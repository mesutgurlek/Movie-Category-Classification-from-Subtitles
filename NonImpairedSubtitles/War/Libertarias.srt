00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,996
<i>Summer, 1936</i>

2
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,307
<i>July 18.</i>

3
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,618
<i>The Spanish army rises against
the Republican government.</i>

4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,525
<i>July 19.</i>

5
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,091
<i>In Barcelona and Madrid
the army is defeated...</i>

6
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,695
<i>... thanks to the people's
heroic efforts.</i>

7
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,624
<i>July 20.</i>

8
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,859
<i>The masses demand
a revolutionary state.</i>

9
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,698
<i>The legal government is unable
to control the situation.</i>

10
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,563
<i>July 21.</i>

11
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:45,870
<i>The Spanish civil war begins...</i>

12
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,874
<i>... the last idealistic war...</i>

13
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,209
<i>... the last dream of a people
striving for the impossible...</i>

14
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:52,546
<i>... for Utopia.</i>

15
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,141
- Down with capitalism!
- Death to priests!

16
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:16,741
Long live Durruti!

17
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,181
Long live the workers!

18
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,616
Long live the FAI!

19
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:43,604
Come along, sisters.

20
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:45,077
A little bit of order.

21
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,607
Silence, please!

22
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:53,992
Sister Agueda...

23
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:56,557
Sister Carmela...

24
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,159
Sister Encarnación...

25
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:02,691
It isn't much, but it will
get you back to your families.

26
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:04,304
You'll leave at once.

27
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,763
Sister Amparo...

28
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:09,875
Be careful, talk as little
as possible to people.

29
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:13,877
Trust no one, except God.
He will never abandon you.

30
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:15,106
Sister Maria...

31
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,982
The most innocent,
the most defenseless...

32
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,086
...the furthest from her home.

33
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,091
He will take care of you.

34
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:26,322
Mother, I'm frightened.
Who will help you if you stay?

35
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:29,061
A Mother Superior
belongs with her convent.

36
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,602
Let's see.

37
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,966
St. Matthew, chapter six,
verse twenty five.

38
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,598
Do not worry about your life,
what you are to eat or drink...

39
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,007
...nor about your body
and how to clothe it.

40
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:44,944
Is not life more than food,
the body more than clothing?

41
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:47,013
Continue, Maria.

42
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,153
The birds in the sky
do not sow or reap...

43
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:52,621
...but your heavenly Father
feeds them.

44
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:55,091
Are you not worth much more
then they are?

45
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:57,991
Do you still believe that God
will not watch over me...

46
00:04:58,169 --> 00:04:59,157
...and all of you?

47
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:00,303
No, mother.

48
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:02,169
Forgive me.

49
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,236
- Time is short.
- Mother!

50
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:05,869
They're here!

51
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:15,880
You nuns, get out!
We're going to burn the convent!

52
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,063
Long live the CNT!

53
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,201
Long live the FAI!

54
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,133
Hey there, sisters!

55
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,902
Where are you going?

56
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:41,740
Don't move!

57
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:47,318
Come on, stand up!
We're not Jesus Christ!

58
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:50,749
The revolution respects all women.

59
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:54,651
Let's watch the cathedral burn.
On your feet, comrade nuns.

60
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:19,888
- Who is it?
- For pity's sake!

61
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:25,697
Shelter in the name
of the Virgin!

62
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:26,921
Come in, sister.

63
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:11,945
Not my underskirt!
For the love of God, no!

64
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:15,516
We're not going to kill you.

65
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,020
Saint Catherine had her tits
cut off...

66
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,558
...and complained less.

67
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,252
You smell of rotting lilies.
Don't you wash your twat?

68
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:23,892
We use bleach here.

69
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,768
That's enough, girls.

70
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:28,097
Put her into bed.

71
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,605
You can go now.

72
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,099
Quickly!

73
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:41,618
You want to save your skin,
right?

74
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,246
You're going to stay here
and say nothing.

75
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,725
Understand?

76
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,928
You've been very lucky,
my dear.

77
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,786
You're in good hands here.

78
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,228
Come in, monsignor.

79
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:56,237
Come on in.

80
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:13,589
Monsignor...

81
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,585
Monsignor...

82
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,855
With all respect...

83
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:19,720
...you have to remove...

84
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:21,921
...all your clothes.

85
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,695
Good luck, monsignor.
And don't worry.

86
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:48,922
It will be all right,
with God's help.

87
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,799
What's your name, child?

88
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,944
A militiaman helped me
get a pass to go to Barcelona.

89
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:06,739
You know who gives them out?
That shoemaker from Murcia.

90
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:09,509
He sits behind a table
stamping papers.

91
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:12,519
You know what the stamp
is made of?

92
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,158
A potato!

93
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,726
And no one can get out
of town without a paper...

94
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:18,955
...with the stamp.

95
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:24,000
Fanny, dear, bring me
a potato and a knife.

96
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,305
Quickly.

97
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,731
The convent priest hid in a tree
and they shot him out of it.

98
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,538
The militiamen found
16 million pesetas...

99
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:34,872
...in the Episcopal palace.
That's 64 million "reales".

100
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,017
160 million "perras".

101
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,345
Then that bishop hasn't
got a bean.

102
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:42,654
I'm not doing it for money.
It's out of humanity.

103
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,088
And conviction, of course.

104
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,026
I'm very Catholic.

105
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,721
- So am I.
- Me too.

106
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,991
More than the cardinal.

107
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,097
More than the Pope!

108
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:16,719
CNT, "comrade, no toiling".

109
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:18,364
- Ma'am...
- Yes?

110
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:21,757
It's the militia.
Will I let them in?

111
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:27,107
Take it easy, girls.

112
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,943
With the revolution
or without it...

113
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:32,273
...men always come here
for the same thing.

114
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,884
Let's go into the drawing room.

115
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:37,278
Coming!

116
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,990
Who's in charge here?

117
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,431
You mean Madame Colet?

118
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,198
Let's see.
That Madame what's it...

119
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:57,640
You the brothel keeper?

120
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:00,780
Call your girls in.

121
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:02,073
All of them.

122
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,340
They're all here.

123
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,322
Aura, turn off that shit.

124
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:25,801
If this is the revolution,
they can forget about me.

125
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,771
I don't go with dikes.

126
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:33,985
Sit down.

127
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,055
You...

128
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:39,991
Over here.

129
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:47,833
Concha.

130
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,646
Friends...

131
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:02,009
...I am Concha Liano
and, like my two comrades...

132
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:04,083
...I am a member of "Free Women".

133
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,348
Our country is now in revolt.

134
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,656
The symbols of oppression
are burning.

135
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:11,654
The workers have occupied
the factories and barracks.

136
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,229
The hated army which oppressed
the working class for centuries...

137
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,798
...has been defeated...

138
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,799
...by ordinary men and women.

139
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,972
Spain is an example
to the world.

140
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,867
Priests and capitalists...

141
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,066
...are fleeing from
proletarian justice.

142
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:26,813
Now...

143
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,774
...at last, the people
are speaking out.

144
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:31,705
Friends...

145
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:34,877
Freedom has broken out.

146
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:36,990
Keep going.

147
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:43,854
A word is heard repeatedly
in our streets...

148
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,693
...our homes, our factories
and workshops.

149
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,093
Revolution!

150
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:50,826
That word is heavy with meaning.

151
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,039
Who's there?

152
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:56,769
Open in the name
of the revolution!

153
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:58,039
Courage, sister.

154
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,648
Say something.
Just say "I'm busy".

155
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:04,646
I'll break down the door!

156
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,655
Say something.
Say "I'm busy".

157
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:09,827
"I'm busy."

158
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:17,962
What are you doing?

159
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,034
What are you doing?

160
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,677
What do you think?
We're screwing.

161
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,832
Not any more.

162
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:27,281
Throw that pig...

163
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,245
...out of bed.
That's an order!

164
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,045
Get out of here, bastard!

165
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:32,981
Or I'll blow your balls off!

166
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:45,826
We cannot aspire
to any kind of justice...

167
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:47,798
...while the greatest slavery
still exists.

168
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:52,230
It forces you to renounce
love, tenderness, friendship...

169
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,604
...and waste your lives on
the sexual voracity of strangers.

170
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:56,544
It makes a woman...

171
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,110
...sell her own body...

172
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,848
...in houses like this...

173
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:03,010
...which are just love sheds.

174
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,324
Love must be free...

175
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:06,624
...not bought.

176
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:07,760
What's she saying?

177
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:10,688
That they're whores too,
but they don't charge.

178
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll kick up a fuss.

179
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,595
No more hypocrisy.

180
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,735
No woman is decent
until we all are.

181
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,971
This has to end at once.

182
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,503
It's over now.

183
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,572
We're here to help you.

184
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,213
Comrades...

185
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:27,440
...sisters, in the name
of all Spanish women...

186
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,913
...we open our arms
to help you regain...

187
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,781
...your dignity as workers,
sisters, or mothers.

188
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:36,251
Join in the liberation
of prostitutes!

189
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,221
Long live Free Women and
the libertarian revolution!

190
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:55,104
You've heard my comrade.

191
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,478
Have you nothing to say?

192
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,683
For Crissake!
What is it you want?

193
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,028
To be whores all your life?

194
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,427
To have cocks stuck up you
ten or fifteen times a day...

195
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,570
...and all for a bowl of stew?

196
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,673
Or have you seven lives
like a cat...

197
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:19,808
...and you can afford
to waste this one?

198
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:23,978
- You can count on me.
- And me.

199
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,581
- To shoot, if need be.
- We're ready to die.

200
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,945
- How do we start?
- Can I be a dressmaker?

201
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:30,678
There are women like you...

202
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:32,617
...in my village.

203
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,084
Calm down. The revolution
guarantees you...

204
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,627
...a decent job.

205
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:41,189
- What about that odd one?
- Her? She isn't one of us.

206
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,660
- She's a nun.
- And there's a priest here.

207
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,770
- A bishop, at least.
- Fuck, a bishop!

208
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,667
The boss was making a CNT stamp
with a potato.

209
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:51,037
She was going to get him out
for money.

210
00:15:58,654 --> 00:16:00,086
Are you a nun, calamity?

211
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:01,952
To serve God and you.

212
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:04,624
Christ! You don't serve
a god or anybody!

213
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,491
You're free from now on.

214
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:09,157
No god, no country, no master.

215
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,960
Whatever you say.

216
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,161
She isn't a nun.

217
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,771
She's a prisoner of the clergy.

218
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,972
To stop the militiamen...

219
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,837
...coming to screw you,
this dump is closed.

220
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:21,843
The potato.

221
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:27,854
Eat it.

222
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:32,750
Eat it!

223
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,691
Show some enthusiasm.

224
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,541
Property is abolished!

225
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:08,965
Burn the mayor's papers!

226
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:12,795
If God is all-powerful,
let him come down.

227
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,002
Death to priests!

228
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:18,235
Burn it all!

229
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,175
Burn it all!

230
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:30,885
Burn it all!

231
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,531
Burn the property register!

232
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:00,748
Move that.

233
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:03,085
What's in here? The bishop?

234
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,928
- Hands off.
- For killing sparrows?

235
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,514
Burn it all!

236
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:26,519
Long live the libertarian revolution!

237
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,063
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

238
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:38,694

248

252

258
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:33,889
Long live Durruti!

259
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,933
Long live anti-fascism!

260
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:38,468
Long live the revolution!

261
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:39,695
Hurrah!

262
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:43,604
Victory to the working class!

263
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,392
Greetings.

264
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:03,460
That's what your lot was
keeping. For the poor.

265
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:28,826
As if we had enough trucks...

266
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:32,491
...to spare some for
the redemption of your girls.

267
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:33,635
Did you hear?

268
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:36,396
Our comrade here wants a bus
to take her girls...

269
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:37,539
...to Barcelona.

270
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:40,696
Have you seen this scarecrow?
Turn round...

271
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:41,902
...and let them see.

272
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:44,175
- Idiot!
- Go wash dishes!

273
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:45,314
Is she with you?

274
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:46,582
She's with me.

275
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:47,739
What about it?

276
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,283
Did you get her
from the wax museum?

277
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:52,246
She's very odd.

278
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:53,883
Not as odd as you...

279
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,226
...with that potato.

280
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:57,860
Let's see.

281
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:01,796
You and your whores will take
a train for Barcelona tomorrow.

282
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:03,394
A gift from me.

283
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:05,535
Where do we stay tonight?

284
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,831
In the Encarnation Convent.

285
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:09,809
It's empty.

286
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:13,202
We thought of your lot
and didn't burn it.

287
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:15,244
So there.

288
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:17,718
Come on.

289
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:24,793
Well.

290
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,426
What about you lot?

291
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:28,891
Because none of us
swallow this story...

292
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,323
...that you're
"loyal to the Republic".

293
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:32,699
Let's see.

294
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,495
You tell me where
the tommy guns are...

295
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,105
...and I'll believe you.

296
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,375
All right?
Where are they?

297
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:41,374
The sergeant's wife
is a sympathizer.

298
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:42,639
A sympathizer?

299
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,382
Of what?

300
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:46,312
Of Libertarian Youth.

301
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:49,414
- What about it?
- She gave them the tommy guns.

302
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:58,627
Did I leave a whore house
just to enter a convent?

303
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:11,733
- What a narrow bed!
- It's only meant for one person.

304
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,472
- Where did the chaplain go?
- On top, as usual.

305
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,784
I know who I'll dream about.

306
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:20,478
The priest in my town.
He was gorgeous!

307
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,387
- I'll stay here.
- Charo, you'll sleep easy.

308
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:25,857
And I won't have to season it
with vinegar.

309
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:28,532
- What's your name?
- Aura.

310
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:29,965
Good night.

311
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,597
Going to sleep in that hat?

312
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,613
What's your name?

313
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:14,183
Maria.

314
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,586
Maria what?

315
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:18,189
De la Concepción de Azcárate...

316
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,287
...y Dorronsoro.

317
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,321
Rich family?

318
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:23,957
I'm a servant of the Lord.

319
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:29,165
With a name like that,
you must be rich. Look at me.

320
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:31,234
Plain Pilar Sánchez.

321
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,837
Poor as a church mouse.

322
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:35,910
Where are you from?

323
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:38,506
My family's in Saragossa.

324
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,853
Tomorrow is another day.

325
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:13,917
You're an early bird.

326
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:27,523
In that hat, you look like
you're in the Legion of Mary.

327
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:29,436
Why not take it off?

328
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:39,512
When do we go to Barcelona?

329
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:40,809
I'm going today.

330
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:43,582
Your lot will go by train.

331
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:44,921
When there is one.

332
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,489
What must I do
to get to Saragossa?

333
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:51,786
You should ask Durruti that.

334
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:54,320
We all want to go there.

335
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:00,895
That's better.
You look like a peasant.

336
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:05,170
Who are you married to?

337
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,439
The Lord.

338
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:09,583
That's great.

339
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:12,482
A husband who doesn't need
his supper made...

340
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:13,945
...or his bed.

341
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,189
I'll see you in Barcelona.

342
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,840
Living in a community
has got advantages for you.

343
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:34,971
You can form a committee.

344
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:37,438
A committee is a group
of comrades...

345
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:40,447
...who undertake to direct,
not order, but direct...

346
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:43,744
...put in order,
the activities of the group.

347
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:46,755
Let's see how this committee
can be formed.

348
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:48,893
First, you need a secretary.

349
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,623
But make sure that
the comrade chosen...

350
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,231
...is the one best able
to read and write.

351
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:56,799
Anita can use a typewriter.

352
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,302
The secretary will be
the representative...

353
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,408
...in dealing with
other groups...

354
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:05,270
...but must remember that she
has no rights over the others.

355
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,913
Rather, she must listen carefully...

356
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,216
...to the suggestions
and complaints of her comrades.

357
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:23,926
You go by train.

358
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:26,666
You going on your own?

359
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,531
With the nun.

360
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:31,610
Get on!

361
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:37,437
Astride.

362
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:03,847
Halt!

363
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,822
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

364
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:19,520
- What are you carrying?
- Stale bread.

365
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:26,269
Say your prayers.

366
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,770
Today, two went through...

367
00:27:27,942 --> 00:27:30,408
...with rabbit skins,
and three with sausages...

368
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:33,703
...but you're the first
with stale bread.

369
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,405
Put on your miter, bishop.

370
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:42,847
There's a nice job for you.

371
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,587
Some moneybags.

372
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:00,412
Shit!

373
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,377
Let's see if there is a God.

374
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:10,687
Come on, let's go.

375
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:23,265
Why did they kill him?

376
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:30,607
This is a revolution,
not a party.

377
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:32,905
And someone has to pay
the consequences.

378
00:28:33,518 --> 00:28:36,609
It's the apocalypse of freedom!

379
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:39,382
Up with the Barbers' Union!

380
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:55,505
There are the rifles.

381
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:59,334
Barcelona's barbers
support the revolution!

382
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:29,368
Down with the army!

383
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,714
Down with the generals!

384
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:33,784
Down with capitalism!

385
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:38,585
Long live the CNT!

386
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,622
Long live the libertarian revolution!

387
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:56,373
- Victory to the working class!
- Victory!

388
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:16,332
Coming!

389
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:20,530
- Five hours!
- Come on, open up.

390
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:21,673
It's a bit much.

391
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:27,240
The men have their revolution.
What about you?

392
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:28,903
Skip the jokes and help me.

393
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:30,448
Push.

394
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,493
- What about her? Who is she?
- A nun.

395
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,533
Christ!

396
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:50,328
Fucking hell! If that's true,
we'll run you through tonight!

397
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:51,496
Come on in.

398
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,373
Come on!

399
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:00,973
The spirit-making machines?

400
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,342
Here. They're right here.

401
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:09,416
Power for women!

402
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,366
Squat down.

403
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,708
Wash yourself at the front.

404
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,849
Don't worry, it isn't a sin.

405
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:35,487
What's up?

406
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,482
She saw a bishop get wiped out.

407
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,754
Well, he'll be in Heaven now.
God is a fascist.

408
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:43,295
Don't talk rubbish.

409
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:46,470
Look.

410
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,204
Stop crying and I'll give you
my peach. Here, take it.

411
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,342
What's this?

412
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,369
11,000 virgins!

413
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:55,773
And what's in here?

414
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,641
Some gold coins from
the clergy's treasure.

415
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:01,250
I was given it to pay
my journey to Saragossa.

416
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,750
We're going for free.

417
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:16,263
This is mine. I got the others
from the barricade outside.

418
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:22,538
A duchess's bed.

419
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:24,712
You'll sleep better
than anyone.

420
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:27,780
Like the princess and the pea,
but without the pea.

421
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,754
Well! A little smile
from the nun!

422
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,848
Did an angel pass by?

423
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,690
My mother used to tell me
that story at bedtime.

424
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:40,924
Are you an anarchist too?

425
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:44,259
Yes, indeed. Anarchist,
spiritualist...

426
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:45,602
...and lame.

427
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:49,863
Anarchist because the individual
is all and the state is nothing.

428
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,402
Spiritualist because,
after death...

429
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,569
...the individual is all
and God is nothing.

430
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:56,575
And lame from birth...

431
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:59,281
...because, that way,
my mind developed.

432
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:00,788
Understand?

433
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,453
Let's see. Jesus...

434
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,753
Jesus was the first anarchist.

435
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,388
- You believe in Jesus?
- Of course.

436
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,361
It's priests that I hate.

437
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:15,326
What's more, I spoke
to Jesus’ spirit once.

438
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,331
You? You spoke to him?

439
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:19,767
To her.

440
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:22,407
Jesus isn't a man,
she's a woman.

441
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,307
Good night.

442
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:32,048
See you tomorrow.

443
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:43,804
Listen.

444
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:47,562
Don't cry too much about your
bishop. He was not innocent.

445
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,605
He never protested
about starvation wages...

446
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:51,902
...about keeping the people
in ignorance...

447
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:56,612
...about letting the poor die,
about children working in mines.

448
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:57,775
For centuries...

449
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,614
...bishops have grown fat
and never protested.

450
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:01,849
It's a sin to kill.

451
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:03,216
Here.

452
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:05,589
Read and learn. You'll see...

453
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,256
...how many ways
there are to kill.

454
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:10,357
See you tomorrow.

455
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,275
The Eternal Book.

456
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,574
"Do not deceive each other.

457
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:31,250
Cast aside the old man
and dress as the new man.

458
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:34,688
Thus, you will have a man
able to feel and think...

459
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,455
...in a way we cannot
even conceive."

460
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,631
Long live
libertarian Barcelona!

461
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,776
Hurrah!

462
00:34:54,318 --> 00:34:57,546
You've been proposed as secretary
of the Propaganda Committee.

463
00:34:57,724 --> 00:35:00,713
Why me? Absolutely not.
I'm going to the front.

464
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:04,429
Come on.

465
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:08,757
Both sexes are oppressed,
not just women.

466
00:35:10,004 --> 00:35:12,596
This means there is
only one liberation...

467
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:16,364
...for which both men and women
will have to fight!

468
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:20,232
You women offered your lives,
full of illusion...

469
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:23,711
...in the first days
of the heroic struggle...

470
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:26,011
...where each man was a hero...

471
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,551
...and each woman was
the equal of a man!

472
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:38,659
But bravery isn't everything.

473
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:43,264
It is time to give up the rifle
for the industrial machine...

474
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,874
...and warrior energy for that
softness in every woman's soul.

475
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,914
She's talking rubbish!

476
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:56,684
Christ! The lioness has turned
into a chicken!

477
00:35:56,857 --> 00:36:00,345
She will impose on the rough
atmosphere of war...

478
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:02,692
...the delicate sensitivity...

479
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:04,556
...of feminine psychology.

480
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:08,594
She will tend the men returning
weary from the battle front.

481
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:12,665
Free Women reiterates that the
danger can only be resisted...

482
00:36:12,842 --> 00:36:14,932
...with the opposition
of a female force...

483
00:36:15,278 --> 00:36:17,437
...participation in the armed struggle!

484
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:18,442
Concha!

485
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:21,307
Leave this to me!
Let me speak for once!

486
00:36:23,287 --> 00:36:24,253
What's wrong?

487
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:27,246
It seems we're mad
because we want to fight.

488
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,516
I'm going to explain,
so listen well.

489
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:31,883
We don't see why...

490
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:35,552
...the revolution is in the hands
of only half the population.

491
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,298
We are anarchists...

492
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:40,957
...but we are also women and
we want to make our revolution.

493
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:43,000
Not have men make it for us.

494
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:46,401
We don't want a struggle
designed to fit the male...

495
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:49,012
...because we'll be fucked,
as always.

496
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:53,412
We want to fight so that we can
claim our part in the share-out.

497
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:55,611
And we want to make it clear...

498
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,518
...that just now we're beside
ourselves with joy...

499
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:01,558
...and it would be a mistake
to keep us at home knitting!

500
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:02,989
We want to die!

501
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:06,565
But we want to die like men,
not live like servants!

502
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:14,736
Clap, nun.

503
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:18,867
Remember, your soul is a woman's
soul and has to be with women.

504
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,485
- What?
- Clap!

505
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:23,375
What's wrong with you?

506
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:26,456
Long live women!

507
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,458
Long live the revolution!

508
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:55,313
Long live the revolution!

509
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:56,684
On to Saragossa!

510
00:37:58,563 --> 00:37:59,926
Long live freedom!

511
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:01,753
On to Saragossa!

512
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:03,900
Long live freedom!

513
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,590
- Are we going to Lerida?
- Don't ask me.

514
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:11,498
I've just got out of jail!
On to Saragossa!

515
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:34,858
You never let go of this.

516
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:36,469
Come on.

517
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:44,006
We're going to Saragossa.
Climb up, Pilar. You too, Concha.

518
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:22,987
Long live the revolution!

519
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,253
Long live Durruti!

520
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:35,972
Long live libertarian communism!

521
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,043
On to Saragossa!

522
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:32,230
That's the lot from
the Gutiérrez century...

523
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,034
...covering the right flank,
or exposing it.

524
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:43,482
And there are the fascist bastards...

525
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,480
...with their army discipline.

526
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,750
When will the grub arrive?

527
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,816
Soon. Before Saragossa falls.

528
00:41:02,072 --> 00:41:04,834
Whoever hits the target
at this distance...

529
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,100
...wins a prize.

530
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:11,480
Comrade Durruti...

531
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:15,245
The readers of the New York
Herald would like to know...

532
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:17,211
...if the anarchists...

533
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:19,522
...act on government orders...

534
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:24,216
...or if they are
in confrontation with it.

535
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:26,963
Fascism must be
stamped out forever.

536
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,700
If necessary,
in spite of the government.

537
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,226
Perhaps, some day soon...

538
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:35,132
...this government may need
the rebel forces...

539
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:37,570
...to destroy the workers'
movement.

540
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:41,638
We fight for the revolution.
We expect help from no one.

541
00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:45,878
We'll show you Russian Bolsheviks
how to make a revolution.

542
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:48,282
There is dictatorship
in your country.

543
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:52,052
There are colonels and generals
in the Red Army...

544
00:41:52,296 --> 00:41:55,057
...while my column has
no leaders and no subordinates.

545
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:58,858
We all have equal rights.
We are all soldiers.

546
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:00,696
I too am a simple soldier.

547
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,304
The men in your column...

548
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:05,164
...are accused of having
fallen into disorder.

549
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:06,809
Chaos, some say.

550
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:10,002
Professional soldiers have
trouble being respected.

551
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:11,215
What do you say?

552
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:16,049
The bourgeoisie always tend
to identify freedom with chaos.

553
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,219
We have organized enthusiasm,
not obedience.

554
00:42:19,527 --> 00:42:20,823
Every man and woman...

555
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:23,518
...is responsible to themselves
and to the rest.

556
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,063
That is our strength.

557
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:28,564
We, the workers, are destined
to inherit the earth.

558
00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:32,903
It will undoubtedly be
a very expensive triumph.

559
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:35,242
You will rest
on a pile of ruins.

560
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:37,238
We are not afraid of ruins.

561
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:41,276
Workers built the palaces and
cities of Spain and America.

562
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,014
We can do it again.

563
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,886
The bourgeoisie can destroy
their world...

564
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:48,248
...before abandoning
history's stage...

565
00:42:48,928 --> 00:42:51,485
...but we have a new world
in our hearts...

566
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:53,889
...a world that is growing
every moment.

567
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,031
It's growing while
I talk to you.

568
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,036
Here.

569
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,032
A promise is a promise.

570
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:30,898
- Anyone for Farlete?
- Me.

571
00:43:31,577 --> 00:43:32,634
- Me.
- Me.

572
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,476
Name and profession?

573
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:37,004
That's a bad start.

574
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,714
We don't want to be on a list.
We came to fight...

575
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:42,045
...for our ideals.
We belong to Free Women.

576
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:43,509
How many are you?

577
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:44,551
No idea.

578
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:45,518
Count us.

579
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,249
They've got tommy guns.

580
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:52,056
- How many tommy guns?
- Six, comrade secretary.

581
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:53,287
I'm not a secretary.

582
00:43:53,635 --> 00:43:55,066
Sorry, comrade priest.

583
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:58,261
And I'm not a priest.

584
00:43:58,674 --> 00:44:01,139
- We were misinformed.
- Undoubtedly.

585
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:03,869
You should give up those arms.

586
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:05,569
Up here!

587
00:44:06,683 --> 00:44:09,877
You and your companions
can be of help at the front.

588
00:44:10,254 --> 00:44:11,720
Without carrying arms.

589
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:13,621
I've heard that before.

590
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:15,949
What you want,
comrade priest...

591
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,960
...is to have us washing up
for the men.

592
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:20,618
Send them to Pina,
it's quiet.

593
00:44:20,932 --> 00:44:22,420
We'll change that!

594
00:44:23,803 --> 00:44:25,098
Pray for us, priest.

595
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,241
I've done my bit for today.

596
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:39,814
Hey!

597
00:44:40,454 --> 00:44:42,852
There's a nail file up there
if you want one.

598
00:44:56,507 --> 00:44:57,768
Just look at this kid!

599
00:44:57,941 --> 00:45:00,498
What is this? Are you tired
of working already?

600
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:01,643
It's tea time.

601
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:03,945
You haven't done a thing yet.

602
00:45:04,149 --> 00:45:05,775
I'm guarding the tommy guns.

603
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:07,883
You go and dig,
I'll guard them.

604
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:09,448
Climb on this.

605
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:17,621
A good trench needs
a security exit.

606
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,898
There are various wars here.
Get that clear.

607
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:23,868
But it's all to take Saragossa.

608
00:45:24,772 --> 00:45:25,738
Or isn't it?

609
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,436
The government doesn't
want us to take Saragossa.

610
00:45:30,712 --> 00:45:33,644
Not there! We'd have to
stand on chairs to shoot!

611
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,010
That row goes outside.

612
00:45:48,032 --> 00:45:49,123
It stops otherwise.

613
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:51,525
My father's winding up
the clock.

614
00:45:51,703 --> 00:45:53,760
He believes in clocks,
not in God.

615
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,064
He thinks if it stops,
his time's up.

616
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:59,104
I came to make the revolution,
not to work.

617
00:45:59,812 --> 00:46:01,778
You make the revolution in bed?

618
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:03,977
It depends on the company.

619
00:46:12,926 --> 00:46:15,824
We'll have to go to
Saragossa by river.

620
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,223
- Can you swim?
- Depends what's on the other side.

621
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:28,869
Look what I found!

622
00:46:29,614 --> 00:46:30,978
Who lost their head?

623
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:33,537
You mean...

624
00:46:34,853 --> 00:46:36,876
- Who lost their ass?
- You pig!

625
00:46:37,054 --> 00:46:39,885
Look, I've just got out of jail!
I spent two years in there!

626
00:46:40,056 --> 00:46:42,420
Two years with nothing
but hairy men!

627
00:46:43,562 --> 00:46:46,858
You'd better be careful, Faneca.
We'll castrate you some night.

628
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:49,657
Pass me the pumpkin.
Over here, to me.

629
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:53,035
We'll castrate him now!

630
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:56,640
- Pass it to me!
- The revolution's fucked!

631
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:16,697
Lord, come down and behold
your libertarians...

632
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:18,593
...adoring a pumpkin.

633
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,425
Give them the enemy
they deserve.

634
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:23,839
I was joking!

635
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:26,911
It's raining!

636
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:30,874
They're going to fire again!
Come on, hurry, take cover!

637
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,118
What are those two doing?

638
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:38,518
Last one's a faggot, Maria!

639
00:47:48,037 --> 00:47:50,003
- Is everyone all right?
- Yeah.

640
00:47:51,137 --> 00:47:53,831
A great weapon, but that lot
don't know how to use it.

641
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:55,565
What the fuck do you know?

642
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:58,505
I did my military service
in Africa. Quartermaster.

643
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,737
I know about war.

644
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:02,073
- Why the pistol?
- What about it?

645
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:09,156
Sons of bitches!

646
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:13,424
- They'll destroy the stew!
- Let them! It doesn't matter!

647
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:15,723
Is touching your tits
counter-revolutionary?

648
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:16,901
Try it.

649
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:23,597
Thanks.

650
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:24,911
Maria!

651
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:28,876
Leave that!

652
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,018
- Where's she going?
- She's crazy! Come back!

653
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:47,892
The pot!

654
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:53,197
- Why did you do it?
- We'd have lost the soup.

655
00:48:53,544 --> 00:48:54,669
The bowls!

656
00:49:00,553 --> 00:49:02,019
Don't worry, we're safe.

657
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:05,482
Bullets have a parabola.
They don't fall out of the sky.

658
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:06,988
I can't get my finger out!

659
00:49:07,225 --> 00:49:13,556
<i>I am searching for freedom...</i>

660
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:18,629
<i>... and singing my songs
on the breeze.</i>

661
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:27,009
<i>I am searching for freedom.</i>

662
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:34,613
<i>If I don't find
that freedom...</i>

663
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:39,557
<i>... I won't stop...</i>

664
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,753
<i>... singing.</i>

665
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:48,070
Do you find them
already peeled?

666
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:53,065
You don't have to tell anyone
where you get the potatoes.

667
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:54,511
Except me.

668
00:49:55,114 --> 00:49:56,603
Where do you get them?

669
00:49:57,018 --> 00:49:59,813
I bought them with old coins
until I used them all.

670
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,277
Now the peasants give them
because they like what I say.

671
00:50:03,558 --> 00:50:04,581
What do you say?

672
00:50:07,094 --> 00:50:08,185
The day has come...

673
00:50:08,529 --> 00:50:11,154
...when peasants will keep
what they need to live...

674
00:50:11,631 --> 00:50:14,893
...but will give the rest to
the workers from the cities...

675
00:50:15,136 --> 00:50:18,967
...in whom, for the first time
ever, they will see brothers...

676
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:20,537
...and not exploiters.

677
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,876
Kropotkin.

678
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:23,840
Chapter 5, page 215.

679
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:35,078
Anyone here from the La Lometa,
Penasol or Riohondo positions?

680
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:36,316
Penasol!

681
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:42,924
La Lometa!

682
00:50:43,537 --> 00:50:44,560
And Riohondo?

683
00:50:45,372 --> 00:50:46,338
Her.

684
00:50:51,779 --> 00:50:54,609
Durruti got some leather jackets
from the rearguard.

685
00:50:54,781 --> 00:50:58,178
He thinks they'll be of use
to those standing guard...

686
00:50:58,386 --> 00:51:00,181
...in the trenches at night.

687
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,515
- How many do you need?
- I want two.

688
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,088
We need three.

689
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,024
- And you?
- Three.

690
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,457
I'll give you two each.

691
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:27,584
Wait.

692
00:51:28,654 --> 00:51:30,052
Can you carry all that?

693
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:31,521
I'll help you.

694
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:33,017
I'll go slowly.

695
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:34,683
Where are you going?

696
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:37,826
- Are you going far?
- To the position at Riohondo.

697
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:40,999
They've come to help me.

698
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:45,605
Greetings.

699
00:51:49,378 --> 00:51:50,344
Mariona...

700
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:02,179
Be careful with him,
he's a priest.

701
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:05,154
He was about to be shot
and Durruti saved him.

702
00:52:05,595 --> 00:52:06,754
He'll know why.

703
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:10,529
But a priest is a priest.

704
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,964
I'm so hungry.

705
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,039
Is there any millionaire
among you?

706
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,111
I bet he's an officer.

707
00:52:22,016 --> 00:52:25,175
I bet he doesn't fight.
I bet he eats separately.

708
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,609
You, soldiers of an army which
has risen against the people...

709
00:52:30,893 --> 00:52:32,620
...you are the people!

710
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:37,850
You are dying to defend the
interests of your millionaire...

711
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:39,091
...generals.

712
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:43,034
That's enough, Beret.

713
00:52:43,606 --> 00:52:45,572
The eight hour day has been won.

714
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:48,502
- Don't you want to eat?
- Fuck, leave me alone!

715
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,545
There are no officers here.

716
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:55,216
We are all soldiers...

717
00:52:55,485 --> 00:52:56,974
...of the revolution...

718
00:52:57,623 --> 00:52:59,714
...against the oppression
of generals...

719
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:00,950
...and capitalists.

720
00:53:01,426 --> 00:53:03,153
Did he think that up himself?

721
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:05,630
Well...

722
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:07,362
It's very good.

723
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:11,660
Don't fire against
your brothers.

724
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:14,964
Turn your rifles around.

725
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:20,665
The enemy is behind you,
not in front of you.

726
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:23,546
Raise your fists and shout...

727
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:25,450
Freedom!

728
00:53:26,021 --> 00:53:27,509
Brotherhood!

729
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:31,023
Long live libertarian communism!

730
00:53:31,226 --> 00:53:34,750
Come over and tell us, and we'll
talk about your mother too!

731
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,793
If I go over, I'll stick
the megaphone up your ass...

732
00:53:38,402 --> 00:53:39,959
...fucking bastard!

733
00:53:40,873 --> 00:53:41,964
That isn't mine.

734
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:45,733
The day you were born
your mother was drunk!

735
00:53:46,243 --> 00:53:47,800
It's getting anti-feminist.

736
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,570
Son of the Pasionaria!

737
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:51,738
How much do they pay now...

738
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:55,370
...for the wrinkled crack of
your fucking whore of a mother!

739
00:53:55,689 --> 00:53:56,848
Come down from there!

740
00:53:57,425 --> 00:53:59,948
Who will you convince
raving on like that?

741
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:02,490
They started.
I was making a serious speech!

742
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,887
Do we let them mention
our mothers?

743
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:07,899
What kind of war is this?

744
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,700
Instead of picking off the enemy,
we make speeches at them.

745
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:18,807
I'd have finished them off!

746
00:54:19,514 --> 00:54:20,741
It's a sin to kill.

747
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:23,641
They're the people too.

748
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,579
The people, always generous
and the enemy of revenge...

749
00:54:28,826 --> 00:54:31,656
...will break bread with all
who have stayed in its bosom...

750
00:54:31,998 --> 00:54:33,964
...expropriators
and expropriated.

751
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:37,692
In this way,
when work begins again...

752
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:41,735
...former combatants will be
together in the same workshop.

753
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:45,634
- Has she gone crazy?
- It sounds familiar.

754
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:46,938
Of course it does.

755
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:51,644
"The Conquest of Bread."

756
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:53,849
Tell them that.

757
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:55,415
In case they win.

758
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,324
In the name of almighty God...

759
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,531
...lay down your rifles.

760
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,337
They'll think it's their side.

761
00:55:14,747 --> 00:55:15,713
So it is.

762
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,607
The virgin Maria.

763
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:20,771
The human being must desire
the freedom of all men.

764
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:21,920
Bakunin.

765
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,852
- Really?
- What does bakunin mean?

766
00:55:25,224 --> 00:55:27,486
I'll tell you if you stop
touching my ass.

767
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:29,185
Touch mine.

768
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:33,520
Really?

769
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,425
Swear in front of everybody.

770
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:38,403
I swear.

771
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:41,736
I don't care. I mean,
I just have this body as a loan.

772
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,569
I'd throw it to the dogs.

773
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,046
The individual freedom
of each man...

774
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:53,876
...is only possible through
the collective freedom...

775
00:55:54,057 --> 00:55:56,046
...of the society
of which he is part...

776
00:55:56,694 --> 00:55:59,489
...by virtue of a natural
and immutable law.

777
00:55:59,664 --> 00:56:00,630
Damn whore!

778
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:02,922
Take the cock
out of your mouth...

779
00:56:03,103 --> 00:56:04,466
...before you speak!

780
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:19,510
What are you thinking?

781
00:56:19,986 --> 00:56:21,077
The same as you.

782
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:27,051
We could wipe out
those guys with that.

783
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:32,492
- When?
- Pilar, Concha...

784
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:36,801
Floren's acting odd.
She's talking like a man.

785
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:39,041
Christ!

786
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:47,908
What did she say?

787
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,386
I don't know.

788
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,723
I was combing her hair...

789
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:06,494
...when she went rigid
and started saying odd things.

790
00:57:14,918 --> 00:57:17,679
- A spirit has entered her.
- We must waken her.

791
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:19,442
- How?
- We'll slap her!

792
00:57:19,621 --> 00:57:21,951
Don't waken her, idiots!

793
00:57:35,774 --> 00:57:36,865
Who are you?

794
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,107
A strongbox.

795
00:57:40,612 --> 00:57:43,203
- Tell us who you are.
- Dynamite.

796
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:47,212
- Can you tell us who you are?
- A good detonator.

797
00:57:48,422 --> 00:57:50,718
Are you a spirit or an imp?

798
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:53,789
And a flag.
That's all you need.

799
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:56,960
My name is Mateo Morral.

800
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:00,793
- Didn't you bomb the Opera?
- Like hell!

801
00:58:00,968 --> 00:58:03,729
I'm the one who threw the bomb
at Alfonso XIII.

802
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:06,967
If I hadn't been garroted...

803
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:09,667
If I were with you,
you bunch of idiots!

804
00:58:09,846 --> 00:58:13,006
You rack your brains trying
to decide if this is...

805
00:58:13,182 --> 00:58:17,012
...a war or a revolution.
It's neither one nor the other!

806
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:20,819
It's just a piece
of rotten shit!

807
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:23,025
And you're even going to lose...

808
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,990
...the shit that's stuck
to your shoes. Idiots!

809
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,361
You leave Barcelona in
enemy hands and come here...

810
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:30,793
...to be killed!

811
00:58:44,151 --> 00:58:46,378
I'm going to hit her so hard...

812
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:51,079
That bitch is saying what she
feels in the depth of her soul.

813
00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:54,018
Goblins, ghosts
and supernatural creatures...

814
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,629
...are bourgeois lies.
Opium for the people.

815
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,161
Go on, spirit. Go on.

816
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:04,002
Durruti is an idiot.

817
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:08,767
He conquers Barcelona and comes
here to collectivize villages.

818
00:59:09,114 --> 00:59:11,841
They're going to screw him
because he's a fool!

819
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:13,744
He has the brain of an ant!

820
00:59:13,919 --> 00:59:14,885
That's enough!

821
00:59:15,788 --> 00:59:19,515
- Aura, you're pulling my hair!
- No, it was me hitting you!

822
00:59:19,692 --> 00:59:20,658
You want more?

823
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:32,903
It was Mateo Morral.

824
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,240
- Do you believe in that?
- No, I don't.

825
00:59:44,055 --> 00:59:46,213
Nor in clocks when they stop.

826
00:59:46,455 --> 00:59:48,819
But where did that voice
come from?

827
00:59:58,938 --> 00:59:59,835
Beret...

828
01:00:00,671 --> 01:00:02,762
Can you dig a hole
without making noise?

829
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:04,166
Depends on the size.

830
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:06,738
About this wide and this deep.

831
01:00:08,015 --> 01:00:09,140
Yes, you can.

832
01:00:10,184 --> 01:00:11,444
What tools do you need?

833
01:00:12,754 --> 01:00:15,016
A chisel and a pair of hands.

834
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:25,087
Call them out.

835
01:00:26,035 --> 01:00:28,126
- 200 balaclavas.
- Yes.

836
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:30,901
- 150 blankets.
- Yes.

837
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,804
- 80 pairs of woolen socks.
- Yes.

838
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:36,838
50 dozen lipsticks.

839
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:38,647
What?

840
01:00:38,816 --> 01:00:41,680
50 dozen lipsticks.
That's what it says here.

841
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:44,819
- Are they mad in Barcelona?
- Here they are.

842
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:56,633
Let's continue.

843
01:00:58,037 --> 01:01:01,060
120 woolen undershirts.

844
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,833
Two oil stoves.

845
01:01:05,814 --> 01:01:07,746
50 mountain knives.

846
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:10,573
300 bowls.

847
01:01:11,186 --> 01:01:12,152
Yes.

848
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:15,110
200 aluminum forks.

849
01:01:15,893 --> 01:01:18,052
200 wooden handled knives.

850
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:20,019
Yes.

851
01:01:20,664 --> 01:01:21,823
20 packs of cards.

852
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:23,596
Yes.

853
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:25,689
200 aluminum spoons.

854
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:22,830
What are you looking for?

855
01:02:24,238 --> 01:02:25,260
A strongbox.

856
01:02:25,538 --> 01:02:26,765
Why do you need one?

857
01:02:30,711 --> 01:02:32,200
Over there, in the corner.

858
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,097
How will you carry it?

859
01:02:50,031 --> 01:02:50,997
Under your arm?

860
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:54,096
I'll manage it.

861
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,563
May I take this too?

862
01:03:15,695 --> 01:03:16,661
Father...

863
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:20,059
If I asked to confess,
what would you say?

864
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:21,330
Don't call me father.

865
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:23,229
What can I do?

866
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:26,396
Wait. Don't do anything.

867
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:29,669
Do as you're ordered,
but nothing else.

868
01:03:29,879 --> 01:03:30,845
And you, sir?

869
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,146
Don't call me sir.

870
01:03:33,982 --> 01:03:35,209
Is that what you do?

871
01:03:38,754 --> 01:03:40,413
- I help them.
- Why?

872
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:44,049
Jesus...

873
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:45,929
...your master...

874
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:49,685
...said that the poor
have a sacred madness.

875
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:52,990
Let me call you father.
Let me...

876
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:55,659
...ease my soul with
the sacrament of penance.

877
01:04:03,683 --> 01:04:06,444
I thought you were a priest.
Are you or aren't you?

878
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,386
Not any more.

879
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,926
Stop! Someone might hear.

880
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:39,884
And bless the revolution!

881
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:43,025
Without it, no one would ever
have kissed you.

882
01:04:58,845 --> 01:05:01,936
They told me: A strongbox
with a hole in the lid.

883
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:03,376
That's what they said.

884
01:05:09,926 --> 01:05:11,448
No smoking or we're fucked.

885
01:05:33,285 --> 01:05:34,273
Let's see.

886
01:05:35,353 --> 01:05:36,751
The trickiest bit.

887
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:49,829
What a moon!

888
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:52,104
We never thought of that.

889
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:54,166
It's clouding over.

890
01:05:54,374 --> 01:05:55,806
We'll do it tomorrow.

891
01:05:56,377 --> 01:05:57,741
It's clouding over!

892
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:08,786
- What's up, Faneca?
- Nothing.

893
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:11,059
Dead calm.

894
01:06:14,032 --> 01:06:16,225
What's that? A shot?

895
01:06:22,307 --> 01:06:23,274
Here.

896
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:25,732
When you hear a noise, look,
and tell us after.

897
01:06:27,181 --> 01:06:28,646
If you don't come back...

898
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,411
...what do I do...

899
01:06:31,752 --> 01:06:32,718
...with the alarm clock?

900
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:37,283
Keep winding it.
Don't let it stop.

901
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:48,827
From now on, we're all part
of one machine, is that clear?

902
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:51,839
Here.

903
01:07:45,837 --> 01:07:47,201
Charo, go over there.

904
01:07:55,981 --> 01:07:58,174
Here we have the remains
of society.

905
01:07:58,986 --> 01:08:02,180
A nun, a whore, a thief,
a pen-pusher...

906
01:08:02,355 --> 01:08:03,322
...and a cripple.

907
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,213
- Cigarette?
- Someone's going to die.

908
01:08:33,224 --> 01:08:34,780
I can feel it in my bones.

909
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,792
Why are we here?

910
01:08:37,194 --> 01:08:39,853
We're with women all day
and at night we jerk off.

911
01:08:40,465 --> 01:08:42,431
The war has to start some day.

912
01:08:44,269 --> 01:08:47,235
The last time I had a woman
was in January '34.

913
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:49,203
Behind a wall.

914
01:08:49,744 --> 01:08:50,710
A tart who didn't...

915
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,070
...have any tits.

916
01:08:52,313 --> 01:08:54,972
I've been on leave since
the night of July 18.

917
01:08:55,951 --> 01:08:57,917
I dream of the same thing
every night.

918
01:08:58,351 --> 01:09:01,011
Large and firm,
with nipples like that.

919
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:02,916
Pointing upwards.

920
01:09:03,827 --> 01:09:05,816
And who do those
wonders belong to?

921
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:07,457
I'd like to know that.

922
01:09:15,505 --> 01:09:16,471
Like these?

923
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:19,799
Do you want to?

924
01:09:22,146 --> 01:09:23,112
Really?

925
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:26,975
You got me on a good day.

926
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,481
I'll do it for the revolution.

927
01:09:30,223 --> 01:09:32,280
And to try to stop
this tingling in my body.

928
01:09:39,368 --> 01:09:40,857
I was just saying to myself...

929
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:43,829
...how odd, men and women
together and nothing happens.

930
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:46,171
It took too long to happen.

931
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:49,939
If the enemy decide to attack
they'll just find us...

932
01:09:50,113 --> 01:09:51,840
...and those two fucking.

933
01:09:52,181 --> 01:09:55,408
If they used the loudspeaker
the other lot could masturbate.

934
01:10:02,892 --> 01:10:04,448
It makes you edgy.

935
01:10:05,764 --> 01:10:07,287
- Doesn't it?
- No.

936
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:08,990
I'm not edgy.

937
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:29,321
How am I doing?

938
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,286
Normal. Fine.

939
01:10:31,759 --> 01:10:33,191
Tell me I'm the best.

940
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:37,092
Say, "You brute, you animal.
You're hurting me".

941
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:39,491
Just shut up and come.

942
01:10:41,338 --> 01:10:42,031
That's it?

943
01:10:42,273 --> 01:10:44,000
Fuck, you'd put anybody off!

944
01:10:56,555 --> 01:10:58,044
Someone's going to die.

945
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,947
I feel it in my bones.

946
01:11:52,786 --> 01:11:53,752
Here.

947
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:56,046
- The river's very noisy.
- That's good.

948
01:12:00,996 --> 01:12:03,087
- All quiet?
- All quiet, sir.

949
01:12:03,264 --> 01:12:05,491
- Good night.
- Long live Spain, sir.

950
01:12:47,081 --> 01:12:48,740
It's no use worrying.

951
01:12:49,016 --> 01:12:51,039
What has to happen will happen.

952
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:53,876
You can't avoid it
by suffering beforehand.

953
01:12:55,423 --> 01:12:56,514
I'm a fatalist.

954
01:12:56,859 --> 01:13:00,791
If you're alive, you're a body.
If you're dead, you're a spirit.

955
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:07,028
It's about to begin.

956
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:12,209
Well?

957
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:25,914
- Charo, the sun's coming up.
- Who's dead?

958
01:13:26,858 --> 01:13:28,949
This operation has
good sponsors, Charo.

959
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:32,491
I consulted with Lenin, Bakunin
and even Françesc Macia.

960
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:35,165
Nobody's going to snuff it tonight.

961
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:37,392
Hey! Come on!

962
01:13:37,772 --> 01:13:39,897
Come on! We're going to war!

963
01:13:55,058 --> 01:13:56,024
Look.

964
01:13:58,162 --> 01:13:59,525
- A flag.
- Yes.

965
01:13:59,864 --> 01:14:00,989
A Republican flag.

966
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:07,033
My God!

967
01:14:07,407 --> 01:14:10,100
Couldn't they have left things
as they were?

968
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:13,945
Here.

969
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:39,105
That's it.

970
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:42,277
Take cover!

971
01:14:52,757 --> 01:14:53,723
Now!

972
01:15:20,522 --> 01:15:22,852
Show no mercy! Continuous fire!

973
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:26,858
Keep firing! Pin them down!

974
01:15:52,426 --> 01:15:53,255
Now!

975
01:16:30,734 --> 01:16:32,098
There's no one there.

976
01:16:59,768 --> 01:17:01,098
The rats have gone!

977
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:08,274
The machine gun is mine!

978
01:17:24,063 --> 01:17:25,790
Intact! Not a scratch!

979
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:30,127
This little darling is going
to work for the revolution!

980
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:36,967
That's it! They've won...

981
01:17:37,145 --> 01:17:38,042
...the war!

982
01:17:45,455 --> 01:17:47,182
Don't be so silly.

983
01:17:47,392 --> 01:17:50,619
Maybe no one has died.
Maybe it was a man who died.

984
01:17:50,794 --> 01:17:52,657
Women of little faith!

985
01:17:53,299 --> 01:17:56,628
No one, male or female, is going
to kick the bucket today.

986
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,359
Hey, come here! Look!

987
01:18:05,411 --> 01:18:06,377
Come on!

988
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,600
Where's she going?

989
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,240
She's crossing over,
she's going with her own lot.

990
01:18:36,347 --> 01:18:37,313
Don't move!

991
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:30,795
Beret!

992
01:19:31,843 --> 01:19:33,968
It's three miles to San Román.

993
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:37,599
- Our people are in the town.
- Come on, everybody push!

994
01:19:37,883 --> 01:19:39,042
Aura! Concha!

995
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:43,083
We're going there. You do
the same. Everyone to San Román!

996
01:19:43,288 --> 01:19:45,117
San Román is libertarian!

997
01:19:45,292 --> 01:19:47,917
We're closer to Saragossa now!

998
01:19:49,095 --> 01:19:50,118
See you later!

999
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:38,043
Long live Spain!
Long live the army!

1000
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:40,214
Long live Christ the King!

1001
01:20:41,021 --> 01:20:44,419
Surrender! Your soldiers
are workers. They've joined us!

1002
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:46,784
Don't be a fool!

1003
01:20:46,962 --> 01:20:50,122
A Spanish army officer doesn't
surrender to the rabble!

1004
01:20:51,235 --> 01:20:52,825
You can all go to Hell!

1005
01:20:53,402 --> 01:20:56,765
The bastard knows that whatever
he does, his time is up.

1006
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:57,871
Hold it!

1007
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:01,098
Go on! Fire, you faggots!
What are you waiting for?

1008
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:04,438
Dare to kill an officer
of the glorious Spanish army!

1009
01:21:08,253 --> 01:21:09,650
Wait here, comrades.

1010
01:21:09,989 --> 01:21:10,955
Long live Spain!

1011
01:21:14,326 --> 01:21:15,451
You stupid idiot!

1012
01:21:15,928 --> 01:21:19,292
You'll be kicking for an hour.
Next time, use a longer rope.

1013
01:21:19,467 --> 01:21:21,456
Did you want a medal
on your casket?

1014
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:24,268
We'll bury you like a dog!

1015
01:21:24,739 --> 01:21:25,932
Want some relief?

1016
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:31,968
That's better than
a couple of aspirins.

1017
01:21:34,648 --> 01:21:37,637
Regards to St. Peter!
You see, we aren't so bad.

1018
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:41,757
Help us, comrades!

1019
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:44,320
A group of officers
have dug in at the mill!

1020
01:21:44,727 --> 01:21:45,693
Let's go!

1021
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,429
Fucking commies!

1022
01:21:53,772 --> 01:21:56,170
Raise your head,
and we'll use your brains...

1023
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:58,364
...to stick up posters!
Fire!

1024
01:22:02,015 --> 01:22:02,981
Fire!

1025
01:22:10,356 --> 01:22:11,322
It works great.

1026
01:22:11,925 --> 01:22:13,186
You feed the belt.

1027
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:14,393
I'll drive.

1028
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,459
The bastard wants to make
my mother a widow.

1029
01:22:59,879 --> 01:23:02,311
Raise the gunstock!
Higher! Fire!

1030
01:23:03,218 --> 01:23:04,184
Jump!

1031
01:23:05,354 --> 01:23:06,217
Jump!

1032
01:23:06,456 --> 01:23:07,751
Come on, jump!

1033
01:23:14,362 --> 01:23:16,123
Let's go! Forward!

1034
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,266
Help me!

1035
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:39,615
Jesus fucking Christ!

1036
01:23:59,348 --> 01:24:01,870
Greetings, comrades!
You're welcome.

1037
01:24:13,898 --> 01:24:15,228
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1038
01:24:43,332 --> 01:24:44,797
On the count of three!

1039
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,856
Are you ready?

1040
01:24:48,304 --> 01:24:50,167
One... two...

1041
01:24:50,707 --> 01:24:51,673
...and three!

1042
01:25:51,742 --> 01:25:52,708
Pilar!

1043
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,676
Forgive me. I want to be
with you. I don't want to go.

1044
01:28:03,394 --> 01:28:05,519
I hear you gave up
your big chance.

1045
01:28:07,764 --> 01:28:09,128
You didn't go to Saragossa.

1046
01:28:15,274 --> 01:28:17,739
Is it a sin to love madly
what is around me?

1047
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:21,335
The convent seems like a jail
to me now.

1048
01:28:22,383 --> 01:28:23,246
Did I hear right?

1049
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:25,440
That priest is courting her.

1050
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:29,944
Who told you that?
Lenin or Mateo Morral?

1051
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:33,854
- I can lip read.
- You may be dead, Father...

1052
01:28:34,328 --> 01:28:35,419
...but listen to me.

1053
01:28:42,805 --> 01:28:46,033
I'll give it to Mother
so that she can kill a fascist!

1054
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:48,898
Long live the
libertarian revolution!

1055
01:28:49,447 --> 01:28:50,435
Hurrah!

1056
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:14,162
On the Last Day, he'll arise
with his fist clenched.

1057
01:29:48,881 --> 01:29:49,847
Maria...

1058
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:54,942
Let's do something
that'll seem insane.

1059
01:29:56,523 --> 01:29:57,489
What?

1060
01:30:01,762 --> 01:30:02,853
Let's get married.

1061
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:06,061
What?

1062
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:08,231
He's feeling her up.

1063
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,165
Be quiet!

1064
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:51,140
- Now, what's your profession?
- I'm a weaver.

1065
01:30:51,921 --> 01:30:52,887
A weaver.

1066
01:30:53,222 --> 01:30:54,188
A weaver.

1067
01:30:54,387 --> 01:30:55,353
A weaver.

1068
01:30:55,889 --> 01:30:56,855
A weaver.

1069
01:30:57,825 --> 01:30:59,189
I was a whore.

1070
01:30:59,361 --> 01:31:01,259
But the revolution
redeemed me.

1071
01:31:01,429 --> 01:31:03,860
She was a weaver
but now she has a bookshop.

1072
01:31:04,033 --> 01:31:06,056
- Please, more slowly.
- Books.

1073
01:31:06,269 --> 01:31:07,996
- Books.
- For reading.

1074
01:31:08,169 --> 01:31:10,499
Do you fraternize
with the militiamen?

1075
01:31:13,478 --> 01:31:15,307
We fight, we're like them.

1076
01:31:17,114 --> 01:31:19,103
I mean, sexually.

1077
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:21,816
You...

1078
01:31:22,387 --> 01:31:23,284
I don't.

1079
01:31:24,356 --> 01:31:25,322
And you?

1080
01:31:26,226 --> 01:31:27,214
I'd like to.

1081
01:31:27,394 --> 01:31:29,121
- And...
- I lost interest ages ago.

1082
01:31:32,064 --> 01:31:34,360
You wouldn't think it,
but I'm a volcano.

1083
01:31:35,736 --> 01:31:37,725
Free love is one
of our principles.

1084
01:31:37,904 --> 01:31:40,370
Women have as much right
as men to enjoy their bodies.

1085
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:43,871
Yes, but men think that
free love means a free hand.

1086
01:31:44,945 --> 01:31:45,911
How are you?

1087
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,216
Greetings.

1088
01:31:50,352 --> 01:31:51,318
And you, Maria?

1089
01:31:53,055 --> 01:31:55,180
- Her? She's a nun.
- No!

1090
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:56,325
Yes!

1091
01:31:56,494 --> 01:31:57,460
You're a nun...

1092
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,488
...an anarchist and a weaver?
All three things?

1093
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,528
I'm not an anarchist.

1094
01:32:05,402 --> 01:32:07,493
Nor am I a nun.
Not any more.

1095
01:32:08,873 --> 01:32:11,203
Maybe I'll become a weaver
after the war.

1096
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:14,534
Some people say
that anarchism...

1097
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,846
...is a form of religious affirmation.

1098
01:32:19,218 --> 01:32:20,377
No god, no master.

1099
01:32:20,553 --> 01:32:23,314
Bakunin has a biblical,
prophetic style.

1100
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:27,181
You're the kind that says
things are always the same.

1101
01:32:27,361 --> 01:32:29,952
No, Englishman, this time
they're going to change.

1102
01:32:31,733 --> 01:32:33,722
So what did my father die for?

1103
01:32:39,076 --> 01:32:40,372
Know why he's here?

1104
01:32:41,743 --> 01:32:44,141
To tell us we have to
abandon this town!

1105
01:32:44,415 --> 01:32:46,278
Durruti says
it isn't strategic!

1106
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:49,139
We have to go back
across the river!

1107
01:32:50,054 --> 01:32:53,452
He says we'll have tanks soon,
and caps with braid...

1108
01:32:53,893 --> 01:32:56,086
...and we'll be called
the People's Army!

1109
01:32:56,261 --> 01:32:59,193
I don't want an army!
I want anarchy!

1110
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,126
Anarchy, for fuck's sake!

1111
01:33:03,768 --> 01:33:05,632
I don't want
to look like them.

1112
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:09,172
Concha, shout with me.
Hurrah for wine!

1113
01:33:09,343 --> 01:33:12,275
Don't ask the impossible.
Shout: Hurrah for bread!

1114
01:33:13,815 --> 01:33:16,975
- Come on, I'll race you!
- Stop it, you're drunk!

1115
01:33:24,527 --> 01:33:26,152
We all have a new world...

1116
01:33:26,329 --> 01:33:27,794
...within our hearts!

1117
01:33:29,465 --> 01:33:32,226
Anarchy is the highest
expression of order!

1118
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:36,359
We don't want to be
male or female soldiers!

1119
01:33:37,307 --> 01:33:39,068
Man and woman are equal!

1120
01:33:40,012 --> 01:33:43,501
They're equal, Englishman.
Equal. Not the same!

1121
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:47,309
What am I saying?
Some are the same.

1122
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:51,451
Dear Lord!

1123
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:56,729
Pilar...

1124
01:33:59,832 --> 01:34:02,424
Come here, love.
Lay down your head.

1125
01:34:03,171 --> 01:34:04,467
This is getting messy.

1126
01:34:05,105 --> 01:34:07,003
Come on, let's go, it's late.

1127
01:34:13,549 --> 01:34:14,515
Priest!

1128
01:34:15,084 --> 01:34:17,346
The nun wets her pants
when she sees you.

1129
01:34:19,556 --> 01:34:21,021
In the name of God...

1130
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:23,123
...or Bakunin,
or whoever you want...

1131
01:34:23,395 --> 01:34:25,758
...you'd better sleep
with her tonight.

1132
01:34:25,965 --> 01:34:28,227
Leave her alone,
you're shocking her.

1133
01:34:31,103 --> 01:34:32,796
Christ, priest.

1134
01:34:33,404 --> 01:34:34,994
She's stronger than you.

1135
01:34:37,444 --> 01:34:40,274
I'm not drunk.
I'm being serious.

1136
01:34:41,113 --> 01:34:43,738
Come on, try to forget
about our father...

1137
01:34:43,918 --> 01:34:47,146
...who is in heaven, and live
down here in this world.

1138
01:34:53,796 --> 01:34:55,092
- Englishman...
- I'm not English.

1139
01:34:55,263 --> 01:34:56,490
So what? Listen.

1140
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:58,924
You know why our flag
is red and black?

1141
01:34:59,102 --> 01:35:00,398
Red for the struggle...

1142
01:35:00,572 --> 01:35:03,731
...and black because
the human spirit is dark!

1143
01:35:05,007 --> 01:35:07,439
Write that down.
Put it in your book.

1144
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,843
A woman of the people said it.

1145
01:35:14,053 --> 01:35:15,349
What am I saying?

1146
01:35:16,888 --> 01:35:17,854
Let's go.

1147
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:27,864
Halt!

1148
01:35:28,402 --> 01:35:30,095
Each to his own.

1149
01:35:30,737 --> 01:35:32,794
The Englishman and I
are going to bed.

1150
01:35:43,051 --> 01:35:44,312
That's the way it is.

1151
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:54,427
Pilar...

1152
01:35:55,065 --> 01:35:56,088
Don't leave me.

1153
01:35:56,434 --> 01:35:57,922
I want to be with you.

1154
01:36:01,806 --> 01:36:02,772
I'm sorry.

1155
01:36:08,881 --> 01:36:10,142
And up yours!

1156
01:36:14,085 --> 01:36:15,914
- What does that mean?
- It means no.

1157
01:36:16,088 --> 01:36:18,077
Nothing doing.
Not on your life.

1158
01:36:18,259 --> 01:36:19,452
Was it for you or me?

1159
01:36:21,828 --> 01:36:22,919
Both of us, I think.

1160
01:36:27,034 --> 01:36:28,000
Greetings.

1161
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,137
Is it true that
you're a volcano?

1162
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,486
I'd like to check it out.

1163
01:36:50,094 --> 01:36:51,060
You know what?

1164
01:36:51,362 --> 01:36:53,725
You had a previous life,
as a woman.

1165
01:36:53,899 --> 01:36:56,024
You were a peasant
or a washerwoman.

1166
01:36:56,201 --> 01:36:59,429
- Well, I don't remember it.
- I do. Let's go.

1167
01:37:03,009 --> 01:37:06,305
Comrades, don't your tits
get in the way when you shoot?

1168
01:37:32,242 --> 01:37:33,606
The gonococcus gang.

1169
01:37:33,778 --> 01:37:34,472
Let's see.

1170
01:37:34,713 --> 01:37:35,679
Attention, girls!

1171
01:37:36,014 --> 01:37:38,708
- How many are there?
- Ten here, but there are more.

1172
01:37:42,187 --> 01:37:43,551
Take off your pants.

1173
01:37:45,324 --> 01:37:46,381
Silence!

1174
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:48,687
And your panties.

1175
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:50,360
Silence!

1176
01:37:57,739 --> 01:37:58,706
The bottles.

1177
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:07,738
Put your name on the label.

1178
01:38:10,988 --> 01:38:12,545
The label's for your name.

1179
01:38:16,694 --> 01:38:18,353
Put your name on the label.

1180
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:21,217
You heard, right?

1181
01:38:28,274 --> 01:38:30,570
- Send them in one by one.
- Very well.

1182
01:38:37,049 --> 01:38:39,174
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Get out!

1183
01:38:40,521 --> 01:38:41,680
For the labels.

1184
01:38:43,757 --> 01:38:49,247
<i>Oh, oh, what labors
the Lord does send us,</i>

1185
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:53,087
<i>standing up and squatting
down again,</i>

1186
01:38:53,269 --> 01:38:56,429
<i>all day long underneath
the sun...</i>

1187
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,070
This is all there is, girls.
I'm finished.

1188
01:38:59,577 --> 01:39:02,475
- Mine is full. What do I do?
- Stop!

1189
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:04,544
- I can't!
- Bite your tongue, Mari.

1190
01:39:07,252 --> 01:39:08,548
I'm wetting myself!

1191
01:39:13,492 --> 01:39:15,549
Girls, this is very serious.

1192
01:39:17,295 --> 01:39:18,386
A pathetic example.

1193
01:39:18,564 --> 01:39:21,086
Four comrades,
who are known to you all...

1194
01:39:21,267 --> 01:39:23,233
...armor-plated a truck.

1195
01:39:23,403 --> 01:39:24,562
A commendable job.

1196
01:39:25,004 --> 01:39:27,402
But that truck has never
been in action.

1197
01:39:27,575 --> 01:39:31,371
Two of them travel the front,
showing off their work...

1198
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:34,977
...while the other two enjoy
leave in Barcelona or Lérida.

1199
01:39:35,216 --> 01:39:38,182
They swap around every week
without any authorization.

1200
01:39:38,353 --> 01:39:41,410
Frankly, I don't want to argue
about what is obvious.

1201
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:44,455
Militarization seems
inevitable to me.

1202
01:39:47,797 --> 01:39:49,763
Listen to me!
Pay attention!

1203
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:54,191
I'll go home rather than wear
a lieutenant's stripe...

1204
01:39:54,372 --> 01:39:55,633
...or let you wear one.

1205
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:58,666
And that truck
did go into action.

1206
01:39:59,009 --> 01:40:01,475
It was decisive
in the taking of San Román.

1207
01:40:02,114 --> 01:40:05,512
The taking of San Román was
strategically useless.

1208
01:40:06,185 --> 01:40:08,117
And you know that, Durruti.

1209
01:40:09,356 --> 01:40:11,185
Yes, I know that.

1210
01:40:16,665 --> 01:40:17,994
Listen carefully.

1211
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,962
I don't think any of you
can doubt my convictions.

1212
01:40:22,636 --> 01:40:23,533
Well, then.

1213
01:40:24,574 --> 01:40:28,438
I say that if it's necessary
we'll impose an iron discipline.

1214
01:40:29,544 --> 01:40:32,339
I'm willing to renounce
everything, except victory.

1215
01:40:45,063 --> 01:40:48,325
Doctor Santamaria's report.
Of ten militiawomen examined...

1216
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,523
...5 have gonorrhea
and 3 are pregnant.

1217
01:40:50,704 --> 01:40:53,135
We have more casualties
from the clap...

1218
01:40:53,306 --> 01:40:54,670
...than from enemy bullets.

1219
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:56,938
Contact the transport corps...

1220
01:40:57,142 --> 01:40:59,438
...and get as many trucks
as you need.

1221
01:40:59,812 --> 01:41:02,244
Gather up the women
century by century.

1222
01:41:02,982 --> 01:41:05,278
Send them to Sarinena
and on to Barcelona.

1223
01:41:05,453 --> 01:41:08,283
- I want no women at the front.
- They're not all like that.

1224
01:41:08,457 --> 01:41:10,218
Send every one of them home.

1225
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:11,118
Greetings.

1226
01:41:18,167 --> 01:41:21,133
There are some things a priest
can do better than a layman.

1227
01:41:21,773 --> 01:41:24,466
I want you to take care
of this problem for me.

1228
01:42:29,816 --> 01:42:30,612
Greetings.

1229
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:34,180
Are you in charge?

1230
01:42:35,254 --> 01:42:37,243
I am, there's no one else.

1231
01:42:38,593 --> 01:42:40,422
- How many?
- How many what?

1232
01:42:40,663 --> 01:42:41,754
How many women?

1233
01:42:42,061 --> 01:42:42,755
None.

1234
01:42:43,097 --> 01:42:45,461
- And those?
- They have more balls than you.

1235
01:42:57,314 --> 01:42:58,280
Comrade...

1236
01:42:59,216 --> 01:43:02,740
Great efforts are being made
to coordinate the column.

1237
01:43:03,454 --> 01:43:04,420
It isn't easy.

1238
01:43:05,123 --> 01:43:06,555
The women's presence makes it...

1239
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:07,555
...even harder.

1240
01:43:07,761 --> 01:43:10,727
We can't prevent a woman
from giving her life...

1241
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:13,053
...in the struggle
against fascism.

1242
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:15,094
We are healthy!

1243
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:22,063
The Association of Free Women...

1244
01:43:22,243 --> 01:43:25,209
...have organized a laundry
service in Siétamo.

1245
01:43:26,012 --> 01:43:27,603
You could be of use there.

1246
01:43:27,783 --> 01:43:29,749
You needn't go back
to Barcelona.

1247
01:43:30,687 --> 01:43:32,585
But you must leave the front.

1248
01:43:35,057 --> 01:43:36,045
You see?

1249
01:43:37,361 --> 01:43:38,759
The same old story.

1250
01:43:39,462 --> 01:43:41,121
Can't men run a laundry?

1251
01:43:46,704 --> 01:43:48,670
I'll count to ten
for you to go.

1252
01:43:57,249 --> 01:44:00,044
Maybe some of you don't agree
with staying here.

1253
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:01,717
If that's so...

1254
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:03,980
...this is your last chance.

1255
01:44:04,224 --> 01:44:07,122
Nothing doing, priest!
Not on your life!

1256
01:44:08,328 --> 01:44:09,953
Your soutane's showing.

1257
01:44:10,465 --> 01:44:12,124
I'll be buried here.

1258
01:44:13,569 --> 01:44:15,000
No betrayal!

1259
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,451
Got any cigarettes?

1260
01:44:48,174 --> 01:44:49,504
I'll see you later.

1261
01:44:52,045 --> 01:44:53,011
Hi, Faneca.

1262
01:44:54,381 --> 01:44:56,006
Take a break, I'll stay.

1263
01:44:56,316 --> 01:44:57,543
Got any cigarettes?

1264
01:44:59,487 --> 01:45:00,453
Yeah, coming.

1265
01:45:00,689 --> 01:45:01,518
Look.

1266
01:45:14,136 --> 01:45:15,432
Lieutenant and upwards.

1267
01:45:19,276 --> 01:45:20,435
I'm going to try it.

1268
01:45:41,534 --> 01:45:44,625
Bastards!
Why not learn how to shoot?

1269
01:45:45,805 --> 01:45:46,771
Well!

1270
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:49,332
He's for it.

1271
01:45:51,814 --> 01:45:52,643
Fuck it!

1272
01:46:08,298 --> 01:46:09,423
That's not the way.

1273
01:46:10,336 --> 01:46:11,597
Will you let me try?

1274
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:15,605
Let's see.

1275
01:46:16,641 --> 01:46:19,607
Not too high, not too low,
neither right nor left.

1276
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:22,302
Fuck!

1277
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:25,445
- Do you think I got him?
- Right through the eye!

1278
01:46:27,054 --> 01:46:28,281
There's confirmation!

1279
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:35,996
It wasn't me.

1280
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:38,523
It was the bullet.
I didn't even aim.

1281
01:46:39,802 --> 01:46:41,768
They gave us a cap
and a bag...

1282
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:44,594
...and made us conductors
on the trams.

1283
01:46:44,807 --> 01:46:47,637
A stupid job, because
people get on the trams...

1284
01:46:47,812 --> 01:46:50,004
...but don't pay,
and they're right.

1285
01:46:50,178 --> 01:46:52,201
Don't the trams belong
to everyone?

1286
01:46:52,382 --> 01:46:55,780
One day Olga asked me to come
and see a girl from the old days.

1287
01:46:56,121 --> 01:46:58,553
We were amazed to see that
the pussy game...

1288
01:46:58,723 --> 01:47:00,484
...is more popular than ever.

1289
01:47:00,659 --> 01:47:03,284
Anyway, the union guys
gave us a house...

1290
01:47:03,462 --> 01:47:05,394
...and we've set ourselves up.

1291
01:47:05,864 --> 01:47:08,296
There is a constant line
of militiamen.

1292
01:47:08,568 --> 01:47:11,625
It's better than before
for there's no one bossing us.

1293
01:47:11,805 --> 01:47:13,236
We've become a collective...

1294
01:47:13,407 --> 01:47:16,237
...and formed a committee
like that militiawoman said.

1295
01:47:27,388 --> 01:47:30,115
I'm the treasurer
and Julia's the secretary.

1296
01:47:30,292 --> 01:47:33,258
The militiamen put up a poster
for us which says...

1297
01:47:33,429 --> 01:47:35,327
..."Respect the woman
you choose.

1298
01:47:35,498 --> 01:47:37,396
She could be your sister
or mother"

1299
01:47:37,568 --> 01:47:40,762
I thought mother didn't sound
right and suggested "cousin".

1300
01:47:43,508 --> 01:47:44,474
That's enough!

1301
01:47:45,411 --> 01:47:46,468
It's what she says.

1302
01:47:46,644 --> 01:47:49,269
You know where you can go.
It's your fate.

1303
01:47:49,649 --> 01:47:52,274
I don't want to.
Any kind of fucking bores me.

1304
01:47:53,418 --> 01:47:56,612
Why don't we all go there and
spread syph among the militiamen?

1305
01:47:56,824 --> 01:47:59,517
It's the most revolutionary
thing we can do.

1306
01:47:59,828 --> 01:48:03,760
Maybe, but you look like a tram
conductor, not a streetwalker.

1307
01:48:04,097 --> 01:48:07,427
That's enough defeatism.
Anyone can leave if she wants...

1308
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,588
...but no messing.

1309
01:48:09,504 --> 01:48:11,834
We're not going.
They're throwing us out.

1310
01:48:12,508 --> 01:48:15,065
Whoever wants to go,
let her say so.

1311
01:48:15,242 --> 01:48:17,174
- No, fuck it!
- No one wants to go.

1312
01:48:17,346 --> 01:48:18,437
I don't want to go.

1313
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:21,549
- And you, Mariona?
- Me?

1314
01:48:22,083 --> 01:48:24,515
I'll think about it
when they open the convents.

1315
01:48:24,821 --> 01:48:27,844
Everything will start up again.
First the barracks, then convents.

1316
01:48:28,192 --> 01:48:29,681
Fancy some braised chops?

1317
01:48:32,096 --> 01:48:33,062
You'd kill it?

1318
01:48:33,399 --> 01:48:35,297
The alarm clock has stopped.

1319
01:48:35,468 --> 01:48:37,263
We thought someone
had to pay for it.

1320
01:48:37,468 --> 01:48:38,559
Will you shoot it?

1321
01:48:38,737 --> 01:48:40,396
We'll just cut its throat.

1322
01:48:41,206 --> 01:48:44,434
Are you going to kill
that poor lamb in front of us?

1323
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:46,871
It's a male,
and a fascist as well.

1324
01:48:47,314 --> 01:48:49,109
You summon its spirit after.

1325
01:48:49,283 --> 01:48:50,476
It'll tell you the same.

1326
01:48:51,151 --> 01:48:53,174
Animals! You're just animals!

1327
01:49:01,330 --> 01:49:02,296
You're a brute!

1328
01:49:03,434 --> 01:49:06,662
- Are you going to eat the chops?
- I'm not eating anything!

1329
01:49:06,837 --> 01:49:10,496
- Close its eyes at least.
- Now we just have to skin it.

1330
01:49:10,843 --> 01:49:13,638
All he's ever done in his life
is fuck sheep!

1331
01:49:13,844 --> 01:49:15,241
Help me, comrades.

1332
01:50:56,296 --> 01:50:57,193
Mariona...

1333
01:51:29,901 --> 01:51:31,594
Long live Spain!

1334
01:52:00,269 --> 01:52:01,132
Get out!

1335
01:52:06,609 --> 01:52:07,632
Get out of here!

1336
01:52:22,392 --> 01:52:24,585
Have pity on my.

1337
01:52:24,763 --> 01:52:26,490
Have pity on this poor servant.

1338
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,088
What will I do Lord?
Tell me.

1339
01:52:31,871 --> 01:52:34,428
Who are you?
Why are you wearing this?

1340
01:52:38,612 --> 01:52:41,669
Sergeant, see to this woman.
Find out who she is.

1341
01:52:44,918 --> 01:52:46,247
Burn that filth.

1342
01:53:25,865 --> 01:53:27,194
People of San Román...

1343
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:29,191
...this afternoon...

1344
01:53:29,870 --> 01:53:32,700
...the glorious forces
of the National Movement...

1345
01:53:33,272 --> 01:53:37,034
...routed the hordes who
were occupying this town...

1346
01:53:38,146 --> 01:53:41,135
...annihilating the majority
of their forces.

1347
01:53:41,883 --> 01:53:45,246
The Masonic communist big wigs
who enslaved you...

1348
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:49,278
...have fled like cowards from
the punishment awaiting them...

1349
01:53:50,327 --> 01:53:51,486
That's her.

1350
01:53:53,699 --> 01:53:56,164
...for the savage crimes
they committed.

1351
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,561
Lieutenant Solanas told me...

1352
01:53:58,736 --> 01:54:01,702
...that you have some relics
of the Virgin of the Pillar.

1353
01:54:02,172 --> 01:54:03,195
He also said...

1354
01:54:03,574 --> 01:54:05,836
...that you admitted
to being a nun.

1355
01:54:06,245 --> 01:54:07,211
Is that true?

1356
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,037
Won't you answer?

1357
01:54:12,585 --> 01:54:15,312
Is the weight on your soul
as heavy as that?

1358
01:54:16,656 --> 01:54:17,815
I'm sorry, father.

1359
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:20,314
I regret this, but God knows...

1360
01:54:20,662 --> 01:54:24,321
...we don't want you to suffer
more than your sins deserve.

1361
01:54:24,933 --> 01:54:27,228
One. This population...

1362
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:29,331
...is subject to martial law.

1363
01:54:30,271 --> 01:54:31,237
Two.

1364
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,729
A curfew will be imposed...

1365
01:54:34,143 --> 01:54:36,837
...from seven in the evening.

1366
01:54:37,312 --> 01:54:38,278
Three.

1367
01:54:38,948 --> 01:54:42,641
All inhabitants are submitted
to military authority...

1368
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:46,812
...to which they are obliged
to justify their identity...

1369
01:54:46,991 --> 01:54:48,218
...and their conduct.

1370
01:54:49,294 --> 01:54:50,260
Four.

1371
01:54:50,564 --> 01:54:52,792
No one may leave the town...

1372
01:54:52,964 --> 01:54:54,931
...without prior authorization.

1373
01:54:55,735 --> 01:54:56,666
Five.

1374
01:54:56,903 --> 01:55:00,062
Gatherings of more than three
people will not be permitted...

1375
01:55:00,306 --> 01:55:02,795
...without the express
permission of this command.

1376
01:55:12,052 --> 01:55:13,313
Did you tear up your ID?

1377
01:55:14,087 --> 01:55:16,315
You don't know me,
I've never seen you.

1378
01:55:16,692 --> 01:55:18,658
I don't know what happened
to my family.

1379
01:55:18,863 --> 01:55:20,158
We're in the same boat.

1380
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:23,287
- Come on.
- To let them kill you.

1381
01:55:23,867 --> 01:55:26,833
We won't get out
of here alive so, sssh.

1382
01:55:27,269 --> 01:55:30,099
Once bitten, twice shy.

1383
01:55:48,895 --> 01:55:49,861
A doctor.

1384
01:55:50,096 --> 01:55:52,289
- Is there a doctor here?
- I'm a nurse.

1385
01:55:52,467 --> 01:55:56,160
A militiawoman from San Román
is bleeding to death.

1386
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:23,661
Pilar...

1387
01:56:24,502 --> 01:56:25,968
Her throat's been cut.

1388
01:56:30,709 --> 01:56:32,834
Pilar, what did they do to you?

1389
01:56:34,414 --> 01:56:35,471
Say something.

1390
01:56:38,351 --> 01:56:41,215
- Won't you talk to me?
- It's no use, she can't talk.

1391
01:56:44,325 --> 01:56:45,416
Do something.

1392
01:56:46,094 --> 01:56:47,082
She's dying.

1393
01:57:00,811 --> 01:57:02,003
Don't die.

1394
01:57:03,046 --> 01:57:04,171
Don't die.

1395
01:57:10,054 --> 01:57:11,213
Don't leave me.

1396
01:57:34,715 --> 01:57:35,681
One day...

1397
01:57:37,185 --> 01:57:39,151
...in the time of the Lord...

1398
01:57:40,922 --> 01:57:43,945
...this planet will no longer
be called Earth.

1399
01:57:44,327 --> 01:57:46,225
It will be called Freedom.

1400
01:57:48,899 --> 01:57:51,126
That day, the exploiters
of the people...

1401
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:53,699
...will be cast into
the outer darkness...

1402
01:57:54,073 --> 01:57:57,039
...where there will be wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

1403
01:57:59,278 --> 01:58:01,039
And the angels of Heaven...

1404
01:58:01,348 --> 01:58:02,814
...on the most high...

1405
01:58:03,682 --> 01:58:06,648
...will sing in joy as they
behold the star Freedom...

1406
01:58:06,819 --> 01:58:09,011
...more blue and more
radiant than ever...

1407
01:58:11,391 --> 01:58:14,016
...because peace and justice
will reign there...

1408
01:58:15,864 --> 01:58:18,352
...because paradise
will always be there...

1409
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,466
...and death will
no longer exist.
