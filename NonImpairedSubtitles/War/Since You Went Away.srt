1
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,902
<i>This is the moment I've dreaded</i>...
<i>coming back to our home...</i>

2
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,379
<i>alone.</i>

3
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:43,077
<i>Oh, Tim. Tim.</i>
<i>You've been gone only an hour,</i>

4
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,988
<i>and already the house</i>
<i>is empty without you.</i>

5
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,364
<i>Darling, forgive me.</i>

6
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,066
<i>I held myself together</i>
<i>through all our good-byes</i>

7
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,972
<i>and I've tried to understand,</i>

8
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,308
<i>but I still don't know why</i>
<i>you should risk your life</i>...

9
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,283
<i>you, the best-natured</i>
<i>and dearest person in the world.</i>

10
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,027
<i>I'll try to remember</i>
<i>what you said last night</i>...

11
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,760
<i>that years from now,</i>

12
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,565
<i>this will seem the greatest</i>
<i>adventure we ever had,</i>

13
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,368
<i>even though we had it separately.</i>

14
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:40,036
<i>But I have no courage, Tim.</i>

15
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,104
<i>You know I have no courage,</i>
<i>and I have no vision.</i>

16
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:47,482
<i>And already</i>
<i>I'm so very lonely.</i>

17
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,603
<i>We've had at least today.</i>

18
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,653
<i>I'll try to keep all</i>
<i>the good things as they were.</i>

19
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,784
<i>I'll keep the past alive,</i>

20
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,455
<i>like a warm room for you</i>
<i>to come back to.</i>

21
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,964
<i>I promise.</i>

22
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,730
<i>I promise.</i>

23
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,294
Mother!

24
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,234
Mother!

25
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,712
- Mother, where are you?
- Upstairs, dear.

26
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,344
Hello, Mother.

27
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,752
Hi, darlings.
Are you awfully wet?

28
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,737
Jane, such a nice, fresh cheek.

29
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,402
Better get your
wet things off, Brig.

30
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,339
Did Pop get off all right?
Was his train on time?

31
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,376
It was mean of Pop not to let us
go to the station with you.

32
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,753
Darling, you know
how much he loves you.

33
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,156
He didn't even want <i>me</i> there.

34
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:38,492
You know how he hates a fuss.
And Louisiana's not so far.

35
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,863
And he'll be home on leave
before he go...

36
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,062
He looked so swell in his cap
and uniform, didn't he?

37
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,403
I'll bet the others were all jealous.
I'd hate a squinchy little father.

38
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,841
Pop looks like a parade
all by himself.

39
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,278
- Did he have my present with him?
- Right in his pocket, Brig.

40
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:02,186
I hope he keeps all his money
in it and everything.

41
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,949
I hope he buys
those generals a drink,

42
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,617
and maybe he'll be a major
by the time he gets home on leave.

43
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,252
He can be a major
anytime he wants to.

44
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,287
Anyhow, he'd probably rather do
something else with it anyway,

45
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,823
like sending Mother
a present or...

46
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,868
- Or what, honey?
- I don't know.

47
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,933
Buy some magazines
or books maybe.

48
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,478
I wasn't really thinking.

49
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,275
I have an idea.

50
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,150
How would you like to play
gin rummy before dinner?

51
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,019
- Okay?
- Okay.

52
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,457
Let's not.
It won't be the same without Pop.

53
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,928
Not even gin rummy...
nothing!

54
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,933
Hello, Soda.

55
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,023
Brig, are you never going to get
out of this bathroom?

56
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,928
Go fly a kite. I wish you'd wait
till I get through!

57
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,058
If you don't get through soon,
you'll brush the enamel off your teeth.

58
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,761
You all stop that bickering.

59
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,770
It's time you girls
was getting to bed.

60
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,829
- Hi, Fidelia.
- Hello, Fidelia.

61
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,467
- Where have you been all day?
- Where's your mother?

62
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,478
I'm in here,
in Jane's room.

63
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,844
All right, princess,
the mirror's all yours now.

64
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,906
You can have a wonderful time
looking at yourself.

65
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,143
Evening, Miz Hilton.

66
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,381
Did Captain Hilton
get away all right this afternoon?

67
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,912
Yes, Fidelia. He said he'd send you
a postcard from New Orleans.

68
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,127
What about you?
How did things go?

69
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:53,757
I got that job this afternoon
with some lofty people uptown.

70
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,461
The wages is mighty fine.
I starts right away.

71
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,332
But I ain't gonna be contentment.

72
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,771
I ain't gonna be contentment like
I been right here all these years.

73
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,576
I'm afraid we're not going to be
very contentment either, Fidelia.

74
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,978
What's more, I don't know what
kind of housekeeper I'm going to make.

75
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,610
I can tell you something.
You ain't gonna be very good.

76
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,849
I've been figuring out this budget.
I don't see how we're going to make it.

77
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,088
I've already arranged
to sell the car.

78
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,597
I don't think the government
pays them officers enough.

79
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,259
I don't see why Mr. Hilton
ain't worth as much to Uncle Sam

80
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,394
as he was to that
advertising company.

81
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,462
You'll probably have
a much easier time

82
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,565
than you've had
taking care of all of us.

83
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,166
You're not leaving us?

84
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,804
Did we do something
to make you mad?

85
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,043
Honey, you couldn't do nothing
to make me mad, no matter what.

86
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,549
You're just like my own child.

87
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,779
Did I hear something
about Fidelia leaving?

88
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,414
Now, Jane, I'm just as unhappy
about it as you are.

89
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,481
We can't keep up the payments
on the house

90
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,550
just by cutting down
on your allowances.

91
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,620
Golly.
First Pop, and now Fidelia.

92
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,927
That's enough of that, Brig.
I don't want no mourning.

93
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,332
You say good night
to your sister and run along to bed.

94
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,371
You, too, Jane.
Tomorrow's a school day.

95
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,966
The Lord Himself will have to take
care of these calamities somehow.

96
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,886
You'll come to see us,
won't you, Fidelia?

97
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,118
Of course I will, child.

98
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:34,196
If you don't pick up your clothes,
you never will keep a husband.

99
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,894
Men don't fancy disorderment.

100
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:43,072
- Good night for now, Jane, honey.
- Good night, Fidelia.

101
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,875
Whee! I'm a commando!

102
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,409
This is all that's left
of Fidelia's last cake,

103
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,178
and I'm afraid it's pretty stale,
but cake is cake these days.

104
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,243
I don't care what they do
as long as they don't ration pickles.

105
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,549
Yes, I know.

106
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,683
You'll have chronic indigestion
by the time the war's over.

107
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,760
Hi, Gladys.

108
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,357
What on earth's
the matter with that child?

109
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,665
Gladys is afraid
of grownups, that's all.

110
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,968
I'd like to hear her say two words
just to be sure she <i>can</i> talk.

111
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,908
Who you talking about... Gladys?
I don't see how Brig can put up with it.

112
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,175
I don't think much of your friends.
They're all man-crazy just like you are.

113
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,341
It's too early
in the morning to argue.

114
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,044
Hurry up. You'll be late.

115
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,281
You tell Becky Anderson
the next time she tries to high-hat me...

116
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,119
- Good morning, Mr. Mahoney.
- Good morning, girls.

117
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,182
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs. Hilton.

118
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,788
I thought I'd bring the groceries and see
if there was anything I could do.

119
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,391
That is nice of you. I think
I'll need all the help I can get.

120
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,995
I hope you won't mind
waiting on last month's bill.

121
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,267
I haven't received
my first allotment check yet,

122
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,399
and I'm not
a very good manager.

123
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,104
I know, everybody's
got problems these days.

124
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,908
Now, you take me,
for instance.

125
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,813
I'm trying to get enough
of everything for my customers.

126
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,681
Would you believe it, Mrs. Hilton...
one of them had the nerve

127
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,313
to ask me why I didn't
go into the black market.

128
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,120
- Me, with my boy in the service.
- You don't mean Johnny?

129
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,593
I wondered why
I haven't seen him lately.

130
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,823
Yes, ma'am,
and he's a mighty fine boy.

131
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,162
I've got a picture of him
in his uniform right here.

132
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,037
I'd love to see him.

133
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,665
You're very proud of him,
aren't you?

134
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,037
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,943
There are two things that Johnny
always wanted to be.

136
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,673
One of them
was to be an aviator.

137
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,875
And what is Johnny's
other ambition, Mr. Mahoney?

138
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,283
Well, you wouldn't
be believin' this maybe,

139
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,787
but it's advertising.
Advertising.

140
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,484
My Johnny always wanted
to be an advertising man.

141
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,054
Well, I'm sure he'll be
very successful at it.

142
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,366
You really think that,
do you, ma'am?

143
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,800
Yes, I do.

144
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,032
You do?

145
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,775
Well, I guess I'd better
be running along.

146
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,707
- Good-bye, Mrs. Hilton.
- Good-bye.

147
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,144
Mr. Mahoney.

148
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,407
I think Mr. Hilton
might like to help Johnny

149
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,009
get into the advertising business
when the war's over.

150
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,784
Now, that is an idea.
It wouldn't have occurred to me.

151
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,088
Mr. Hilton <i>is</i> in the advertising
business, isn't he?

152
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,095
And I'm sure he'd be delighted.

153
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,723
We've always thought Johnny
was a fine, intelligent boy.

154
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,266
That he is, ma'am.
That and a whole lot more.

155
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,700
And you've really given us
something to look forward to...

156
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,068
me and Johnny and the missus.

157
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,870
It was very nice of you to come
and visit with me this way.

158
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:42,243
Not at all, ma'am.
Not at all.

159
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,251
- Mother.
- Yes?

160
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,416
Do you think that I could
be a good secretary?

161
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,187
Ha, a secretary.

162
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,660
Why don't you be a Wac?
You could be their mascot.

163
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:02,257
All right, go ahead and starve.
See if I care.

164
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,896
Dumb magazines.

165
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,974
Everybody's got magazines.

166
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,935
I know!

167
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,878
Why don't we take somebody
into the house... a roomer?

168
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,950
If you're going to throw away aces,
Jane, that's fine with me.

169
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,215
Mother, why shouldn't we
rent a room?

170
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,019
- There's such a terrible shortage.
- Go away.

171
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,286
Down with five.

172
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,352
It's perfectly ridiculous, Brig.
A stranger in our home.

173
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,523
Where you get your ideas
is beyond me.

174
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,932
Certainly it's ridiculous.
It's Communism... that's what it is.

175
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,835
Oh, pooh.
We could get an officer maybe.

176
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,874
And it might be
sort of like having Pop back.

177
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,273
An officer.

178
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,369
I think maybe she's right.

179
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,313
I understand there's not
a room to be had in town.

180
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:54,182
It might be very patriotic of us
to take an officer into our house.

181
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,278
Patriotism hasn't
anything to do with it.

182
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,380
You're just crazy
about uniforms.

183
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,824
We should do everything
we can for our soldiers.

184
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,952
Brig, Jane,
now that's enough.

185
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,054
Do you want to finish this game
or don't you?

186
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,862
- 102. It's a blitz.
- Turn out the dining room lights.

187
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,098
Suppose Pop were looking
for a room in some crowded city.

188
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,662
Hurry up, Jane. It can't be
that hard to figure out.

189
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,040
Suppose there was a family
like ours that had three bedrooms.

190
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,274
Don't you think it would be
malicious not to rent a room to Pop?

191
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,746
Well, Jane?

192
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,283
I won almost $6,000.

193
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,843
592 points at $10 a point.

194
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,284
Deduct it from what you owe me.

195
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,450
And poor Pop
sleeping in the park!

196
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,654
All right, all right,
Pop is sleeping in the park

197
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,562
and the people are malicious
and we decide to rent him a room.

198
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,623
- Now you satisfied?
- You'll do it?

199
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,692
I didn't say I'd do it.
I'll think about it.

200
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,739
I knew you couldn't be mean like
those characters in that other city.

201
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,830
Come along.

202
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,898
I wonder how much
we can get for Jane's room.

203
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,409
My room?

204
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,845
How much will that be
for three days?

205
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,280
What?

206
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,784
Brig, turn that thing off.
I can't hear.

207
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,615
I'm awfully sorry.

208
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,385
Yes. Will this get
into the early edition?

209
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,950
Yes. Fireplace and bay window.

210
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,826
Oh, all right.
Put in "homey atmosphere."

211
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,662
Mother! Mother!
Wait, please!

212
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,431
Keep quiet, Brig. Would you send
the bill to this address, please?

213
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,493
Thank you.

214
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,063
You don't mean you're
going to rent <i>your</i> room?

215
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,871
That's the room
that will bring the most money.

216
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,378
I'll take your room, and you
can double up with Jane.

217
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,211
You're not going to put
somebody in Pop's room?

218
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,875
I didn't mean that.

219
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,419
You wouldn't want
those characters in that other city

220
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,320
to put Pop in anything
but their best room, would you?

221
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,450
But that's different.
He's Pop.

222
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,671
Good morning.

223
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,807
Is this the place
that advertised for an officer?

224
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,009
That's right.

225
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:10,077
With the real fireplace,
nice bay window, southern exposure?

226
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,055
That's right.

227
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,895
I haven't seen the room yet,
but the homey atmosphere seems okay.

228
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,124
I guess it's a deal.

229
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,098
I'm sorry, but the room's
already taken.

230
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,658
Oh, I see.

231
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,671
I'm sorry you had
the trip for nothing.

232
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,971
Yes, I can see
you're grief-stricken.

233
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,977
Hi, beaver.

234
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,717
Good morning.
Mrs. Hilton, I presume.

235
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,260
Yes.

236
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,597
May I be permitted to observe,

237
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,332
this is the first house I've found
in this godforsaken community

238
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,375
- that doesn't smell of cabbage.
- Well, it does sometimes.

239
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,469
I was given to understand
at the office of the Purchasing Division,

240
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,537
to which I have
the misfortune to be attached,

241
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,138
that you had a room for rent.

242
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,310
Yes, but I specified an officer.
You see, my husband...

243
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:19,380
My name is Smollett, William G.,
Colonel, United States Army, retired.

244
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,791
Retired, I might add, by virtue
of certain fatuous opinions

245
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,830
held in the War Department
which judge a man's usefulness

246
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,127
neither by his experience
nor his ability,

247
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,499
but by the number of years
since he was weaned.

248
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,699
Soda.

249
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,345
There was nothing
in the information I was furnished

250
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,713
which indicated that you
had children and domestic pets.

251
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,718
I'm sorry, but they
go with the house.

252
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,981
We won't discuss it.
With your permission, madam,

253
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,580
may we dispense
with further conversation?

254
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,818
I should like
to inspect the room.

255
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,758
Certainly. Just follow me.

256
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,888
I do hope you'll forgive me
if I've been long-winded.

257
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,626
Not at all, madam.

258
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,032
Through a full
and somewhat protracted existence,

259
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,093
I have learned to accept
the natural tendency

260
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,763
of all women to be garrulous.

261
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,603
You're very tolerant, Colonel.

262
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,353
This is an outrage!
Mrs. Hilton!

263
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,657
Can I do anything for you,
Colonel Smollett?

264
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,895
- Mother's busy in the kitchen.
- Indeed you can, Miss Hilton.

265
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,458
You can tell me
who had the kindness

266
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,630
to leave on my bed this
pronouncement from Washington,

267
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,105
this lesson in old-world
courtesy and manners.

268
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,937
I did that, Colonel Smollett.

269
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,740
I thought it might
make it easier for us to get along.

270
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,645
Would you mind helping me
with my aquarium?

271
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,704
What?

272
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,219
Mother's going to use this room.
I have to get my things into Jane's room.

273
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,778
Now, if you'll just
grab that end there...

274
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,221
Now you walk backwards
and I'll steer you.

275
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,829
The big one seems to be
the commanding officer.

276
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,890
- Don't you think that's intriguing?
- Fascinating.

277
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,696
It's a little over to the right.

278
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,966
Be careful not to shake them.
They're very sensitive.

279
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,940
You must forgive me
if I do anything wrong.

280
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:20,205
This is my first experience
hauling fish.

281
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,039
Thanks, Colonel.
I'll do as much for you someday.

282
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,776
I'll tell you what you
<i>can</i> do for me, young woman.

283
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,580
There are certain elaborate
suggestions on page three

284
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,316
of this war communiqué
concerning the condition,

285
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,688
the schedule, and the equipment
of the bathroom.

286
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,694
- Oh, yes.
- You do see?

287
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,697
Then may I ask you
to follow me for a moment?

288
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,096
It was my idea
that we should take in a roomer,

289
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,695
and I'm so glad the whole thing's
turned out so super.

290
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,366
Since you are so ecstatic
over the whole arrangement,

291
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,936
may I ask you whether you
expect me to bathe under that?

292
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,906
Golly, there's a shower
off Pop's room... I mean your room.

293
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,180
And is it necessary
that your paying guest

294
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:06,485
share the facilities of the house
with this vegetable life?

295
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,016
You don't understand. This is
the philodendron Pop gave me.

296
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,859
It needs water. I don't think rain water
gives it enough nourishment.

297
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,025
Really? As soon as there's
no longer any danger

298
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:21,505
of pernicious anemia, would you
mind removing that topsoil?

299
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,542
Yes, and another thing.
I neglected to inform your mother

300
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,407
that I like my breakfast
promptly at 7:00...

301
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,245
coffee, thin toast, and two
eggs boiled, 21/2 minutes...

302
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,614
under no circumstances
more than three.

303
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,085
We can't afford
to give you breakfast.

304
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,622
As it is now, poor Mother
doesn't know what to do.

305
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,251
When Fidelia was here, the bills
didn't seem to be so high, but now...

306
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,558
Please.
I'm quite prepared to pay.

307
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,394
That's fine. What would you say
to 50 cents a day?

308
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:54,598
- That seems a bit high.
- We'll make it $3 a week.

309
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,836
There's the doorbell.
Let's call it a deal. Good night.

310
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,342
But...

311
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,675
Let me see...

312
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,647
...a week for rent...

313
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,750
...for breakfast.

314
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,522
Fidelia!
This is a nice surprise.

315
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,000
I thought I'd run down and see
how you all was getting along.

316
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,198
- Just about the way you predicted.
- We miss you, Fidelia.

317
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,834
You just give me that apron and let
Fidelia finish what you was doing.

318
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,936
Nothing of the kind.
You must be tired. Now sit down.

319
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,947
Child, would you mind
running along?

320
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,212
I got some troublement I wants
to unburden onto your mother.

321
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,152
- You go on upstairs, dear.
- I'll come up and tuck you in.

322
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,654
All right.

323
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,723
Mother, remind me to tell you
about the momentous deal I made.

324
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,590
All right, honey.

325
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,187
- Sit here, Fidelia.
- Thank you.

326
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,124
You see, Miz Hilton,
it's this way...

327
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,465
them uptown folks
is all right in their way,

328
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,766
but it's that lazy trash
they got working for 'em.

329
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,468
Miz Hilton, I just won't abode
in the same quarters with them.

330
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,306
When I finishes my work,
I wants my solitude

331
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,278
and I wants my privitation.

332
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,907
Fidelia, I'd do anything
if I could have you back,

333
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,383
- but things aren't any better...
- I knows.

334
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,647
Your bills
is runnin' awful high.

335
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:20,623
"High" isn't the word for it.
But how do you know?

336
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,592
I hopes you won't think
I'm buttin' in,

337
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,753
but I been keepin'
mighty close touch,

338
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,390
and when I heard tell this afternoon
about that Colonel Smellett...

339
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,230
And here I'm makin'
all that easy money,

340
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,465
and I reflects maybe you wouldn't
mind renting me my old room.

341
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,201
Now, you know I'd never
take any money from you.

342
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,869
That room was always yours,
and it always will be.

343
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,505
I figured you wouldn't take my money,
so I got it figured out.

344
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,845
I can work here on my days off,
and nights, too.

345
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,612
I'm strong as a horse.

346
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,586
Oh, no. You're not as young
as you used to be.

347
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,452
You're not gonna do
any work for us.

348
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,982
It'll be wonderful
just to have you in the house.

349
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,053
Miz Hilton, that's the most beautiful
thing I ever heard anybody say

350
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,964
in all my born days.

351
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,200
If you don't mind,
I'll just go get my bag.

352
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,899
You shouldn't bother
going back for it tonight.

353
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,999
It ain't no bother, Miz Hilton.
It's sittin' right here.

354
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,490
This whole moral breakdown

355
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,999
is being caused by drinking
and nothing else.

356
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,228
They certainly serve
rotten scotch at this bar.

357
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,828
I should go with what?
That's what I want to know.

358
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,271
The one I was with
sure was a dope.

359
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,774
He didn't know
where he'd been

360
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,710
or where he was going
or anything!

361
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,876
I haven't got anything
against red fingernails,

362
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,112
but it's carrying it too far
when they paint their toes.

363
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,245
I bought six dozen
before the hoarders got there.

364
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,816
I can't write him
everything the baby says

365
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,951
one one of those
little V-mail forms.

366
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,491
Emily, let's not go to the bar.
I could use a drink, but...

367
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,934
Don't be so old-fashioned.

368
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,767
Will you let us through, please?

369
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,399
I've been here 20 minutes, and...

370
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,967
Of course, go right ahead.
I was leaving anyway.

371
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,943
He's rather nice-looking,
don't you think?

372
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,573
Still have your
weather eye out?

373
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,642
There are compensations
for being a divorcée.

374
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,914
Bartender!

375
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,389
- Anne, what do you imagine you'd like?
- Anything at all. You order for me.

376
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,756
You make a good Planter's Punch?

377
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,654
I'll make 'em, and if you don't like 'em,
you don't need to drink 'em.

378
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,928
All right, then two.
With light rum.

379
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,034
I knew I had something
to talk to you about.

380
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,734
That vicious tongue
Vivian Robinson with the bad skin

381
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,208
is saying
you've taken in a roomer.

382
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,508
I tried to tell her
it must be a relative.

383
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,276
No, that's the truth.
I've taken a roomer.

384
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,044
We need the money.

385
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,449
If things are that bad,

386
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,511
Tim Hilton had no business
going into the Army.

387
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,183
To be honest,
I don't understand it myself,

388
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,162
but I knew that Tim was miserable
from the start not being in it.

389
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,258
All these irresponsible 40-year-old
fathers dashing off into uniform.

390
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,430
Does it always
have to be Tim?

391
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,875
- Tony!
- Yes. The eternal also-ran.

392
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,711
Emily, do you know
Lieutenant Willett? Mrs. Hawkins.

393
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,115
I've never had the pleasure, but I've
always had a soft spot for Navy men.

394
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,846
How do you do?

395
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,150
I didn't know
you'd turned into a barfly.

396
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,156
I've been trying
to get you on the phone

397
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,590
to tell you that your
old lover was back in town.

398
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,821
Do you want
the whole town to know?

399
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,921
If you want to be
hypocritical about it.

400
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,863
I heard that Tim
had been shipped out,

401
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,266
so I went to the admiral and convinced him
I'd chartered the Great Lakes.

402
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,738
Fine. How long are we going
to be honored with your presence?

403
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,173
Long enough to get ready
for a shakedown cruise.

404
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,541
If you're not stubborn,
that ought to give me the time I need.

405
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,273
Don't you think so,
Mrs. Hawkins?

406
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,646
I really don't know, I'm sure.

407
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,584
- I think you believe him!
- I can't say I blame you much.

408
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,644
You're what I call
a discerning woman.

409
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:14,123
Tony's our oldest friend.
He was Tim's best man.

410
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,719
We can give Mrs. Hawkins
the vital statistics some other time.

411
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,763
Let's get out of here.
I need more privacy.

412
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,664
- I haven't touched my drink.
- We can get another one.

413
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:26,101
Don't let us rush you,
Mrs. Hawkins. Good-bye.

414
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,934
- What about the check?
- Don't bother, Lieutenant.

415
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,134
- I'll take care of it.
- That's fine.

416
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,700
But, Tony...
Good-bye, Emily.

417
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,269
That was a terribly rude thing
to do to poor Emily.

418
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,440
Poor Emily, my foot.

419
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,679
Do you know of any place
in this gay metropolis

420
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,018
where I can conquer
my two passions at the same time?

421
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:48,024
You've been leading me on. There is
someone on the Lakes besides me.

422
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,060
Don't be silly.
I'm talking about you...

423
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,119
you and a nice thick steak.

424
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,363
The white fish, <i>signor,</i>
is simply delicious.

425
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,265
Grilled. You'll like it.

426
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,566
Two steaks, thick.

427
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,936
Lobster creole,
speciality of the house.

428
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,567
- Two steaks, thick.
- I must tell the truth, Commodore.

429
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,134
We are fresh out of steaks
since last Tuesday.

430
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:12,706
This is a steak house. It says
right here..."thick Kansas City steak."

431
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,342
I can't help it, <i>signor.</i>

432
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,444
- There is a war on, you know.
- There's a war on, you know.

433
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,954
Yes, I found that out.

434
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,923
Bring us whatever you have...
anything but hash.

435
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,984
<i>Bravo, signor.</i>
You will be very happy. You'll see.

436
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,053
What are you looking
so depressed about?

437
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,621
My life is an endless series
of disappointments...

438
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,462
no steak, nobody loves me.

439
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:34,130
You wouldn't think so if you'd heard the kids
when I told them you were in town.

440
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,436
I can't figure out just what
special charm you have for them.

441
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,271
They have better taste
than their mother.

442
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,506
I think they believe
you're some kind of genius.

443
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,708
Those cover girls you used
to paint for romantic tales

444
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,444
really gave you glamour
in their eyes.

445
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,076
Gone are the days.

446
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,121
Still, there is a certain similarity

447
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,555
between a beautiful woman
and a battleship.

448
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,957
There must be, or else why would you
be so interested in battleships?

449
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,586
You got me wrong, Anne.

450
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,928
As far as I'm concerned, there never
was a beautiful woman but you.

451
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,332
Ever since that summer the crowd
of us went to the Thousand Islands

452
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,837
and I first saw you standing
on that little yawl.

453
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,930
You had on that white
bathing suit. Remember?

454
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,975
With your hair
blowing in the wind.

455
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,704
Why, Tony Willett!

456
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,507
When did you get back?

457
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,112
- Hello, sugar.
- Give me a ring.

458
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,221
Yes, I will. I will.

459
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,422
We were in the Thousand Islands
with my hair blowing in the wind.

460
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,895
Really, Anne,
that was nobody at all,

461
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,626
just a girl I happened to meet
the last time I was in town.

462
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,668
Tony, you don't have to
apologize to me.

463
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,726
I'd be disappointed
if you ever changed.

464
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,272
When we get home, I'll show you
something to prove...

465
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,535
What do you mean,
when "we" get home?

466
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,406
You certainly mean
to put me up?

467
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,877
Probably can't get a room
anyplace else.

468
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,743
The hotels are jammed.

469
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,784
Why do these things
always happen to me?

470
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,978
I don't see why it should
be any hardship to you.

471
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,714
You ought to have
plenty of room.

472
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,619
You think you're
going to share my room?

473
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,624
The girls can double up.

474
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,922
The girls have already
doubled up.

475
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,589
- We have a lodger.
- A lodger?

476
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,757
Don't start.
I had enough of it from Emily.

477
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,528
- We needed the money.
- Get a job.

478
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:14,594
You look perfectly able-bodied
to me, if I may use the word "body."

479
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,731
What on earth could I do?

480
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,334
You could do plenty
if you really wanted to.

481
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,377
Let's skip it.

482
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:28,415
I don't want to hear a serious word
out of either of us until I leave.

483
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,716
Tony, it's so good to see you.

484
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,382
Next to Tim being home on leave,
it's the nicest thing...

485
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,890
There you go again.

486
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,860
I buy you a beautiful dinner,
and what thanks do I get?

487
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,124
Tim. Tim.
What's that?

488
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,531
Speciality of the house...
chicken hash.

489
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,728
Well, blow me down.

490
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,009
I think Uncle Tony must be

491
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,311
the most distinguished-looking
officer in the whole Navy.

492
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,442
Admiral King's not so bad.

493
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,851
I mean young officers, silly.

494
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,516
You'd better finish your homework
and stop mooning around.

495
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,952
And the governor said
to the admiral, "16-inch guns?

496
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,295
Land sakes, can't they shoot
any further than that?"

497
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,359
- Uncle Tony!
- Jane!

498
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,961
What's the matter?

499
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,599
You don't seem
very glad to see me.

500
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:29,708
But I am. I am.
Honestly, I am.

501
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,645
- Uncle Tony!
- Brig!

502
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,014
That's what I call
a real reception.

503
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,918
- You're not staying with us?
- Yes, he's staying with us.

504
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,287
Don't go spoiling him. We're going to
have enough trouble as it is.

505
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,656
Uncle Tony
couldn't be any trouble.

506
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,059
It's just wonderful
having him here.

507
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,895
Don't listen to your mother.
I'm counting on you spoiling me.

508
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,264
There's just one thing, please.

509
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,997
Do you think you and Brig
could cut out that "Uncle" stuff?

510
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,369
I'm not your uncle.
It makes me feel 108.

511
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,102
You mean we're gonna have to
call you Lieutenant Willett?

512
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,973
"Tony" to you, Miss Hilton.

513
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,605
That must be the taxi driver

514
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,149
with that mysterious object
you lugged along.

515
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,777
You won't be so indifferent
when you see what it is.

516
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,878
I don't know
what this thing is,

517
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:15,187
but could be the side
of a house, I suppose.

518
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,228
- I ain't got no change.
- Don't worry, I borrowed it myself.

519
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,321
Thanks, Captain.
Thanks a lot.

520
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,595
Say, lady, it sure must be nice
having your husband home again.

521
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,135
Well, he's not my...

522
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,828
What's so funny about that?

523
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,066
Lmagine anybody
taking you for Pop.

524
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,768
You think your pop's
wonderful, don't you?

525
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,778
- Well, he is.
- But you don't have to rub it in.

526
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,648
I'll take your bags upstairs... Tony.

527
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:40,809
Don't bother, Jane.

528
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,911
- I don't mind, really.
- Brig, you take one, too.

529
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,788
If we don't give the lieutenant service,
he might not stay here.

530
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,520
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Carry on, mates.

531
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,791
Put them in Brig's room.
I'll move in with you girls.

532
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,525
That'll be fun.

533
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,432
Fun, indeed. I thought I was
through with dormitories.

534
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,993
You'll get to know
your children better.

535
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,767
Who's that?

536
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,138
Is there something
gone bad, Miz Hilton?

537
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,836
I wouldn't call it anything good.

538
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,902
If it isn't
my old girlfriend Fidelia.

539
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,640
Is that Mr. Tony Willett?

540
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,411
I thought we was through with you
till the duration was over.

541
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,816
Lieutenant Willett's going to be
our guest for a while.

542
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,753
- Happy surprise, Fidelia?
- I don't know about "happy."

543
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:22,486
Don't you let these people turn
your home into no boardinghouse.

544
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,461
Well, Fidelia!
I've half a mind not to stay.

545
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,131
But the other half
tells me to forgive you.

546
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,499
- What's that?
- I almost forgot.

547
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,936
May as well have
the unveiling right now.

548
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,735
Wait a minute.
I wanna see, too!

549
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,175
Let's have a little light on it.

550
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,114
I offered it to the Navy.

551
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,719
- Tony, I am flattered!
- That's mighty nice.

552
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,953
Mother, it's just like you!
And so pretty.

553
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,824
Well, it's really not much.

554
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,490
I heard they needed new
recruiting posters for the Waves,

555
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,466
and I figured that your face
was the one that...

556
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,112
Tony Willett, I might have known!

557
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:22,209
Mr. Willett, you cover that thing
right up this here minute!

558
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,948
Jane, you's no business
looking at that.

559
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,183
Tony, the Navy Department
didn't accept it?

560
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,557
No. I never even
found out why.

561
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:34,086
I got the painting back,
and the next thing, I was on sea duty.

562
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,531
Red tape, I guess.

563
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,869
I hope you're having
enough trouble.

564
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,099
I wouldn't wish this on a Jap.

565
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,938
- Give it a little push, Jane.
- All right, Tony.

566
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:52,309
- Nice going, Jane!
- Tony, I'm so sorry!

567
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,749
Never mind, Jane. I'm sure
your mother put you up to it.

568
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,480
No, honestly, Tony!

569
00:40:56,554 --> 00:41:00,012
- Which way do I take this thing?
- Starboard on the port side.

570
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,752
- Here, I'll help you.
- How you gonna get the bed in?

571
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,524
- How am I going to what?
- We'll put the mattress on the floor.

572
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,191
Don't worry, I love
to sleep on the floor.

573
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,324
Come on.

574
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,631
Good evening, Colonel Smollett.

575
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:19,005
I've taken one of
the mattresses out of your room.

576
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,510
One mattress is entirely sufficient.

577
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,278
Colonel Smollett, may I present
an old friend of ours Lieutenant Willett.

578
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,012
- How are you, Colonel Smollett?
- How do you do?

579
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,187
I take it your commission
is in the Navy.

580
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,521
- That's right, sir.
- Doesn't surprise me.

581
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,618
We'll get the bed set up
in the morning.

582
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:41,187
- I'm moving in with the girls.
- It's quite all right.

583
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,195
I assume you're taking the one
I have not been using?

584
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,169
- Of course.
- That's fine.

585
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,229
Is something wrong
with one of the beds?

586
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:54,141
It's just that monstrous animal
that seems to be so attached to it.

587
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,303
Good night.

588
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,243
- Mother.
- Yes, Jane?

589
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,877
Mother, do you think
I have a nice figure?

590
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,284
Yes, darling.

591
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,323
You have a beautiful figure.

592
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,883
Do you think Tony
might paint me someday?

593
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,262
Over my dead body.

594
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,700
Wettookit. Wettookit.

595
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,766
- You must have the name wrong.
- No.

596
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,367
Here it is in Pop's letter.

597
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,243
"We're here in Texas
on maneuvers...

598
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,277
"...in a little town
called Wettookit.

599
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,447
We came, we saw, we took it!"

600
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,285
"We took it."

601
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,815
Very funny. I would
appreciate it, my dear Bridget,

602
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:22,628
if in the future you could spare me
from your father's elaborate puns.

603
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:28,062
I suppose to some people, that creature
comes under the heading of "pets."

604
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,436
I beg your pardon,
Colonel Smollett.

605
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,169
There's someone here to see you...
your grandson.

606
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,144
- William?
- Hello, Grandpa!

607
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,011
To what peculiar
combination of circumstances

608
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:46,022
do I owe this visit, William?

609
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,355
Well, you see, I was transferred
out here to Chamberlain Field.

610
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,724
- I found out at your office...
- Indeed?

611
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,025
I wasn't aware
that the United States forces

612
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,998
had been honored
by your membership.

613
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,830
I enlisted, sir, last summer.

614
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,301
So...

615
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,602
I don't think we need trouble these
women with your autobiography.

616
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:08,270
Let's go into the living room.
If you will excuse me.

617
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,812
Excuse me.

618
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,983
I presume you've come to me
for help of one sort or another

619
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,819
with your tail
between your legs.

620
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,985
No, sir.
I thought you might like...

621
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:27,189
- You see...
- Or is it money that you're after.

622
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,788
Speak up, boy.

623
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,568
I thought you
might like to see me.

624
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,498
A very mistaken notion
if ever you had one,

625
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,337
and you've had plenty,
as we're both well aware.

626
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,538
After all, I thought that we may not
see one another again.

627
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,812
I don't know when
I'll be shipped out.

628
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,079
Come, William.

629
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,883
Let's not
dramatize these things.

630
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,753
There's no need for any pretense
of affection between us.

631
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,486
You've paid your courtesy call.

632
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,888
All right, if that's
the way you feel about it.

633
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,592
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

634
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,464
You may drop me a line
with your address.

635
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,528
And if you have any affairs
that require attention,

636
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,938
I shall have my lawyers
look after them.

637
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,472
For your late father's sake.

638
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,447
Now, I am sure
you will excuse me.

639
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,380
I'm a bit tired.

640
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,051
Good-bye, Grandpa.

641
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,460
What do you suppose?

642
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,764
I'm going in
and speak to him.

643
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,607
Mr. Smollett?

644
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:52,212
I'm Jane Hilton.
This is our home.

645
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,581
I see.
I'm glad to meet you.

646
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:01,854
I hope you like the Army.

647
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,224
That is, I mean,
are you on leave?

648
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,263
Just for the day.

649
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,892
I'll be at Chamberlain for a while,
I suppose, until we're shipped.

650
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,799
That'll be nice.

651
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,134
I don't mean
about you being shipped.

652
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,503
I didn't mean that either.

653
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,413
I hope you don't think
I'm a murderer or something.

654
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,780
Grandfather just doesn't like me.

655
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,684
I don't think it's right.
I think it's just terrible of him.

656
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:35,157
He's not so bad. He has good reasons,
the way he looks at it.

657
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,352
I've kind of disappointed him.

658
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,760
I don't care what you did.
You're a soldier now.

659
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,459
And you enlisted, too.
I heard you say so.

660
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:47,197
That isn't really so very much.
Lots of men enlisted.

661
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:51,533
But it's awfully nice of you
to talk to me this way.

662
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,007
Hi, Brig.

663
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,510
What's with the colonel?
He's storming around his room

664
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,979
like one of the Smith Brothers
with a hot foot.

665
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,539
I'll go up to my room
and do some homework.

666
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,606
Hello.

667
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,519
Uncle... I mean Tony.

668
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,887
Lieutenant Willett,
this is Private William Smollett.

669
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,654
How are you?
Corporal. Engineers, isn't it?

670
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,888
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- I'm sorry.

671
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,796
- You're related to the colonel?
- I'm his grandson.

672
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,960
- But I don't know, sir...
- Think nothing of it.

673
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,436
I cut my grandfather off
without a cent.

674
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,235
Well, Jane, what's the program
for this afternoon?

675
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,367
How about you and Brig
taking me out?

676
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,345
William here... or do they call
you Bill? ...could make a fourth.

677
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,882
That's nice of you, Lieutenant,
but I couldn't.

678
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,078
Besides, if you'll forgive
my saying so, sir, you're an officer...

679
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,122
I forgot all about that.
You're right.

680
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,123
Let's see, Jane,
what could we do?

681
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,386
Anything you say, Tony.

682
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,485
We could have tea
in the garden.

683
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:48,998
That's fine. We could
play some darts maybe.

684
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,524
Thank you, sir, but I ought to
be getting back to the field.

685
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,127
You've both been very nice.

686
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,900
Next time you're in town.
Will you be off next Sunday?

687
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:00,410
- How about it, Jane?
- That would be lovely.

688
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,502
I'll look forward to it.

689
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,104
Well, I'd better be going.

690
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,514
- Good-bye, Miss Hilton.
- It's nice to know you.

691
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,916
So long, and next war,
come into the Navy.

692
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,615
Thanks. Thank you, sir. I will.

693
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,179
Well, good-bye.

694
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,088
That seems like
a very nice boy.

695
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,618
- Yes, he is a nice boy, but...
- Now, Jane.

696
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,289
You take the word
of your old Uncle Tony

697
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,801
and be kind to that boy
the next time he comes here.

698
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,838
- Well, he's nice enough, but...
- But what?

699
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,897
Well, he's so young.

700
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,568
Besides, he isn't
even an officer.

701
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,202
Why, Jane, I'm surprised at you.

702
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,247
Those are the boys
who do the fighting,

703
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,977
and largely for their dreams
of girls like you.

704
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,883
Far be it from me
to run down officers.

705
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:47,185
You go right on advertising us.
Every little bit helps.

706
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,852
- Tony, I wish...
- What do you wish, little Janie?

707
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,921
I wish I were 27.

708
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:58,399
Now, that's a coincidence.
So do I.

709
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,567
Where's that Brig?
Do you suppose she ran out on us?

710
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,005
I've got a nickel bet with her
on Twenty Questions.

711
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,733
Good evening, Mrs. Hawkins.
Let me help you down.

712
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,400
My, but you're strong, Lieutenant!

713
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,606
Here, men,
help the young ladies.

714
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,405
Yes, sir!

715
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,779
Mrs. Hawkins,
I'm so frightened.

716
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:51,184
There's nothing to be frightened of.
Just go in and dance.

717
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,417
This here vehicle
got Susie Fleming aboard?

718
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,759
But a boy named Spencer
was supposed to meet me here.

719
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,626
Come on. Just go into the cloakroom
and they'll give you your nametag.

720
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,538
It's like a great big prom, isn't it?

721
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:15,169
Mind you, Becky, dear,
leave a few boys for the other girls.

722
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,408
Miss Hilton! Miss Hilton!

723
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,215
Come on, Jane.
Don't dawdle.

724
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,051
Will you tell me when Mother
and Lieutenant Willett arrive?

725
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:31,390
Just look for me at the committee
table and I'll help you find them.

726
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,297
Hello, Miss Hilton.
May I have your first dance?

727
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:39,802
Well, I really don't know
what arrangements have been made.

728
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:44,933
I just can't figure out what could
have happened to Susie Fleming.

729
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:12,995
Would it be too much of a favor
to ask you to call me Bill?

730
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:19,073
Well, I don't know you very well,
but all right, Bill.

731
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,825
- Hello, Emily.
- Hello, Anne.

732
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,417
Hello, Lieutenant Willett!

733
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,020
I'm delighted you could
come to our little party.

734
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,191
I practically had to
tie him up and drag him.

735
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,291
He was afraid there wouldn't
be another officer here.

736
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,528
There are a few.

737
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:51,165
You should see Captain Higgs.
That profile...<i>c'est jolie.</i>

738
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,267
But I do believe you're
the only Naval man in the place.

739
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:58,303
I'll bet they give me three cheers
and a long periscope.

740
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,941
You'll have a good time.
Wait and see.

741
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,383
I suppose your first dance
is with Anne.

742
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,250
But remember,
the second is mine.

743
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,313
That's too kind of you,
Mrs. Hawkins.

744
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,483
If only I didn't
have this charley horse.

745
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,356
Naturally,
if you're indisposed...

746
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,056
I promised Tony
he wouldn't have to stay long.

747
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,726
If you'll excuse me, I have
a number of things to take care of.

748
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,668
Emily, would you keep an eye
on Jane after we leave?

749
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:26,038
Why, certainly, my dear.
I'll devote the entire evening to her.

750
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,369
Well, of all the phony battle-axes
I've ever met.

751
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,438
Now, really, Tony,
you asked for that.

752
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,643
What am I doing here
with all these kids anyway?

753
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,152
Why, Tony Willett.

754
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,916
When on earth
did you get back in town?

755
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,855
Hello, sugar.

756
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,053
Give me a ring sometime
when you're on the loose.

757
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,392
Yeah. Yeah.

758
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:52,133
As I was saying, what am I
doing here with these kids?

759
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,829
That was a cute kid, too.

760
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,963
It's just a girl
I went to college with.

761
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,597
I'll bet.

762
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,876
- I'm Johnny Mahoney.
- Of course! How are you?

763
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,612
Lieutenant Willett,
this is Johnny Mahoney.

764
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,847
Your father told me
you were stationed out here.

765
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,117
Dad bores everybody
talking about me.

766
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,853
He has every right
to brag about you.

767
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,122
Well, I don't know
about that, Mrs. Hilton.

768
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,187
I wanted to thank you
for what you said

769
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,391
about Mr. Hilton
helping me after the war.

770
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,299
I thought maybe you might think
I was taking advantage.

771
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,394
I didn't want you to feel
any obligation.

772
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,336
There's no obligation, Johnny.

773
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,671
Anybody who gets you
will be very lucky.

774
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,403
I'm afraid the luck's all mine,

775
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:37,002
and that's the way it's been
my whole life.

776
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,705
I guess
I have to be leaving now.

777
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,445
I thought the dance
was just getting underway.

778
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,248
I stopped in
to pick up my gunner.

779
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,915
I'm taking off in a few minutes.
It's just a routine flight.

780
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,754
- Good night, Johnny.
- Good night, Mrs. Hilton.

781
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,589
- Good night, Lieutenant.
- Good night.

782
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,658
Those kids just break my heart.
They're so eager.

783
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,859
I know.

784
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,061
They expect to come back
to something.

785
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,831
What do you mean, Tony?

786
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,275
Something like they left,
only better.

787
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:09,377
Hope they don't get
too many surprises.

788
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,407
- Hello, Bill.
- Good evening, sir.

789
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,971
- Hello, Tony.
- Hi, Janie.

790
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,644
Mother, I don't believe
you've met Bill Smollett.

791
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,711
I'm so sorry I missed you
at the house the other day.

792
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:22,452
Thank you, Mrs. Hilton.
Your daughter has been very nice to me.

793
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:23,959
Well, that's good.

794
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,222
You children run along
and have a good time.

795
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,355
We'll be leaving soon.

796
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,094
Tony, aren't you going to dance
with me even once?

797
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,534
Go ahead, Tony.

798
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,869
Jane, I'm really
very proud of you.

799
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:16,174
You're the nicest-looking girl
in the place.

800
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:19,044
Tony, do you think so?

801
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:22,415
If only I thought
you really thought so.

802
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,356
Really, I haven't waltzed
very much, Mrs. Hilton.

803
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,689
- Would you rather we stopped?
- Bill, you invited me to dance,

804
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,629
and you're going to see it through
whether you like it or not.

805
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,861
Of course, Mrs. Hilton.
I'm only too happy.

806
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:49,442
I think travel broadens one so.
Don't you think so?

807
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,175
I hope so.
I'll be doing plenty of it.

808
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,709
Do you think the artistic life
is too bohemian?

809
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,155
Indeed I do.

810
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,521
And look what happened
to Bohemia.

811
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,597
- Did you lose something?
- Yes, ma'am. Susie Fleming.

812
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,193
I'm beginning to get
right worried about her.

813
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,977
I just love modern
American painting. Don't you?

814
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,819
You're the true
American art, darling.

815
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:39,124
Nobody else ever
says things like you.

816
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,662
I'm so sorry, sir.

817
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,723
My fault. I ought to watch
where I'm going.

818
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,268
It's all right.
We know you didn't mean it.

819
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,832
- It's over.
- And very nice it was, too.

820
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:09,883
Jane, I think I ought
to be behind you.

821
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,394
I hope we can find
Mother and Tony.

822
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,394
What do you think
you're doing anyway?

823
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,133
I ain't used to dancing.
I'm used to pushing a plow.

824
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,004
You're not kidding.

825
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,476
I bet Emily
put some vinegar in this.

826
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,946
If you're not careful,
I'll think you don't like Emily.

827
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,677
As soon as we leave here,
you better buy me a drink.

828
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,241
That's the least I'm entitled to.

829
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,514
Hello, Tony.
I didn't know you were in town.

830
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,421
Hello, Sam. It's quite a dance
you fellows are putting on.

831
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:44,085
- You look upset.
- Just got some bad news.

832
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,095
- Good evening, Mrs. Hilton.
- Good evening, Major.

833
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:50,293
Plane crash. Don't say anything.
It might spoil the fun.

834
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,267
That's too bad.
Where'd it happen?

835
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,600
Right outside town.
Lost one of my best boys.

836
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,435
- What was his name?
- Mahoney.

837
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,668
- He hit some wires.
- Not Johnny!

838
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:03,611
- Did you know him?
- But it can't be!

839
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,080
We were talking to him
just a little while ago.

840
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,710
I'm extremely sorry, Mrs. Hilton.
I had no idea that you knew him.

841
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:12,277
I shouldn't have said anything.

842
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:15,813
It was just that
I liked Johnny very much.

843
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,725
- I know his father.
- A terrible thing.

844
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,286
Beg your pardon, sir.
The car's ready, sir.

845
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,229
- Be right there.
- Yes, sir.

846
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,291
I've got to go
and examine the wreck.

847
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,802
Not a very pleasant job,
I can tell you.

848
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:31,297
- Good night.
- So long, Sam.

849
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:34,502
Tony, how awful.

850
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:36,512
His poor parents.

851
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,548
Lucky Johnny.

852
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,847
Come on, Anne, let's dance.

853
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,614
Dance?

854
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:48,089
Look, Anne, you'll be
hearing plenty of things like this.

855
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,490
Might as well
get used to them now.

856
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,698
I feel so good!
Don't you feel good?

857
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:03,466
Well, now, my Susie...
she's what I'd call a one-man woman.

858
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,735
I love to read books.
They're so significant.

859
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:09,301
Why do they call you Wolf?
Is that your nickname?

860
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:27,421
You hear what they're playing?

861
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,496
Yes. <i>Together.</i>

862
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,470
As I remember, you and Tim drove
everybody crazy wherever you went,

863
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,336
having them play the thing
over and over again.

864
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,351
Please, Tony,
whistle something else.

865
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:33,487
I thought that was your favorite...
next to <i>Rock of Ages,</i> of course.

866
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:34,928
Don't joke.

867
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,990
All right, have it your way...
no jokes.

868
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:41,231
- What is your pleasure?
- I'm sorry.

869
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,238
You wanted a drink.
Let's go someplace.

870
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,830
- You feel like it?
- Sure I do.

871
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,341
Honest?

872
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,900
No. Frankly, I don't
feel much like it.

873
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,810
Neither do I.

874
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,648
It's pleasant being
in a car again.

875
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,708
We used to take
everything for granted.

876
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:58,549
Now I feel like a king
because I can rent one for a week.

877
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,650
- It's one of 'em, all right.
- You weren't speeding.

878
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:06,559
Have things changed around here?

879
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:09,120
Do you have to be doing something
now before you get a ticket?

880
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,702
Where do you think you're going?

881
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:25,373
I wish I knew. What's your guess?
Gibraltar? New Guinea? Kiska?

882
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,178
- You stationed around here?
- Yes and no.

883
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,345
I don't want to be rude,
but we're not in a chatty frame of mind.

884
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:35,380
Would you mind filling out one
of those slips and getting it over with?

885
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,892
- You weren't doing anything.
- I wasn't?

886
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:39,553
What's all this about?

887
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:43,156
It gets so lonely along this road
since gas rationing.

888
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:46,828
Say, ain't it a beautiful night?

889
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,970
I hadn't noticed it before,
but now that you mention it...

890
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,009
Guess I'd better
be checkin' in.

891
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,941
Nice to have met up
with you folks.

892
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,308
Good night.

893
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,673
Get one of them Japs for me!

894
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:05,513
If I lay my hands on one,
I'll give him a ticket.

895
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:08,488
He's what Brig
would call a character.

896
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,426
It can have my vote.
Do you realize we're laughing?

897
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:16,397
Well, so we are.
What do you know?

898
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,533
What, Tony?

899
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,762
Sometimes I wish...

900
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,579
How'd you like a cigarette?

901
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:34,606
I'd love one. I don't believe
I've had a cigarette in a month.

902
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:38,519
I've never had such a dramatic
buildup to a cigarette before.

903
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,215
You know what
I was just thinking?

904
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,917
I like you best
when you're not thinking.

905
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,720
That's right, run me down.

906
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:47,524
Tony Willett, the jolly fellow.
Always good for a laugh.

907
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:52,124
You're not really going
to be wounded, not by me.

908
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:55,000
No. If you haven't
wounded me by now,

909
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,005
I guess I'm impervious, Anne.

910
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,007
I would like to tell you
what I was thinking.

911
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,839
All right,
what were you thinking?

912
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:05,711
I was just thinking what fun
it would be sometimes

913
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,183
to be a good, heavy,
synthetic rubber heel.

914
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,982
It would be synthetic, Tony.

915
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:28,428
Is it all right now
if I whistled <i>Together?</i>

916
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,598
Go right ahead.
I'd like to join in.

917
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:51,392
I just can't believe that
by tomorrow, Tony will be gone.

918
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,894
There are enough carrots here
to feed a cavalry regiment...

919
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:59,594
men <i>and</i> horses.

920
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,628
I think next to Pop, Tony must
be the nicest man in the world.

921
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,004
- Bridget, please.
- What, Colonel?

922
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:09,408
If you'll excuse me,
I've had enough this morning.

923
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,606
In fact, I think that henceforth,

924
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,242
you may operate this victory garden
entirely by yourself.

925
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,513
Golly, what did I do?

926
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,578
Since you're so obtuse...

927
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:23,422
"Tony, Tony, Uncle Tony."

928
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:25,918
I'd better look
for quarters elsewhere

929
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,986
since that's the way
I'm regarded around here.

930
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,556
Colonel Smollett, I wouldn't hurt
your feelings for anything.

931
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,499
It's not a question
of my feelings.

932
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,562
After all, a man
does have his pride.

933
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,131
There's the postman.
Maybe it's a letter from Pop!

934
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,477
You'll wait here, won't you?

935
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:12,037
- Mother! Mother! Mother!
- What's all the excitement about?

936
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,508
It's a letter to Jane and me
from Pop!

937
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,204
Well, bring it up.

938
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:20,214
Come on, honey, time to get up.

939
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,712
Mother, listen!
Pop says he may get leave soon!

940
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:26,015
Let me see!

941
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,652
What's that about Pop?

942
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,050
Look!

943
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:38,561
- Jane, let me look at you.
- What's the matter?

944
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:44,331
Darling, I'm afraid
you have the mumps.

945
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,932
- Mumps.
- Mumps?

946
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,376
Oh, Mother!

947
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,581
Tony's last day.

948
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:56,947
Only children have mumps.

949
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,723
You sure you ain't leavin'
nothin' here?

950
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,990
Just my love, Fidelia.
You afraid maybe I'll come back?

951
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,293
I ain't sorry you're goin'.

952
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,198
Now, Fidelia, I always say
nice things about you.

953
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:15,066
I ain't got no time
for them complimentaries.

954
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,505
Besides, now that Miss Jane
got herself some mumps,

955
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,872
we need this room
for Miz Hilton and Brig.

956
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,241
At least give me credit
for good timing.

957
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,304
Don't bother with that.
I'll take it down.

958
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,110
I want to be sure it gets down.

959
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,744
I've got a going-away present
for you, Fidelia.

960
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,047
Here it is.
Always remember, a great master

961
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:38,150
devoted some of his last hours
to you before he went off to war.

962
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,293
You like it?
I tried not to flatter you.

963
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:48,201
Why, Mr. Willett...

964
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:52,037
it's just the way
I always wanted to look.

965
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,872
Someday I'll do you in oil.

966
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:58,141
I haven't much time. I want
to say good-bye to everybody.

967
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:01,206
You say your farewells.
I'll tote your bag for you.

968
01:07:01,284 --> 01:07:02,615
That's very nice of you.

969
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,916
Mr. Willett, I must
have been stone blind

970
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:08,684
not to see what
a lovely gentleman you is.

971
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,521
- Leaving, Lieutenant?
- On my way, Colonel.

972
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,221
I'll tell Miz Hilton
you's ready, Mr. Tony.

973
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:15,491
I rather envy you,
if I may say so.

974
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,430
We could use you, sir.

975
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,161
In the Navy?

976
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:27,508
- Good luck, Mr. Willett.
- Thank you, sir.

977
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,639
I guess we have to have a Navy.

978
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:41,586
- Don't come in, please!
- Don't you want to say good-bye?

979
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,591
I have an awful disease.

980
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,492
Can't scare me.
I'm coming in.

981
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,657
Wait a minute, Tony, please.

982
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,565
- All right, Jane?
- Yes.

983
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,160
But I wish you wouldn't.

984
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,398
Hello, Janie.

985
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,303
Hello, Tony.

986
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:02,174
You look fine in that kerchief.
Probably start a new fashion.

987
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:05,612
- I look terrible.
- No, you don't.

988
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:09,515
You could never look terrible.
You're pretty, that's what you are.

989
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,984
Don't laugh at me.

990
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,988
I never laugh
at anybody I love.

991
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,785
And I've loved you
from the moment you were born.

992
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,125
Is that all?

993
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,892
It's the best love I have, Janie.

994
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:25,900
It's a special kind of love
I keep just for Anne and Tim

995
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,459
and the two sweet girls
who are part of Anne and Tim.

996
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,769
Tony, you're going way
and maybe you'll be killed,

997
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:36,334
and I've got the mumps
just like a baby.

998
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:41,008
I hope the mumps are the worst
things that ever happen to you.

999
01:08:41,818 --> 01:08:45,584
I won't be killed. Only the good
die young... haven't you heard?

1000
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,918
And I'm neither good nor young.

1001
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,221
But, Tony, you're just
the right age for a man.

1002
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:54,923
Little Janie.
Wanna make a bet?

1003
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,225
What?

1004
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:59,200
I'll bet by the time I see you again,
you're in love.

1005
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:03,364
You're silly.
You're the silliest man I ever knew.

1006
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,136
Now you're making sense.
I knew you had a good head.

1007
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,039
Will you write to me?

1008
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,808
There won't be anything to write.

1009
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:16,750
There won't be anything
happening after you're gone, ever.

1010
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,448
All right.
But I'll write to you.

1011
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,353
I have to go now, dear.

1012
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,425
Good-bye.

1013
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,993
- Good-bye, Janie.
- Bye, Tony.

1014
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:41,204
I'll write to you.
I'll write to you all the time.

1015
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,374
You'll catch the mumps.

1016
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,818
Do you want to keep them
all to yourself?

1017
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:55,483
Besides, I'm no hero.
I've had the mumps. I'm immune.

1018
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,017
I wish...

1019
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:02,658
Let me wish this time.

1020
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,627
I wish that I was 17.

1021
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,565
What are you doing
sitting in that holy of holies

1022
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,158
as though it were yours?

1023
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,467
I'm getting it used
to being just another chair.

1024
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,801
- Can I wake her up?
- You'd better.

1025
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:50,004
She'd never forgive you
if you left without saying good-bye.

1026
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:59,788
If ever I have any children,
God will punish me... they'll be boys.

1027
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,650
I couldn't possibly have
anything as nice as that.

1028
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,627
The first step usually
is to get married.

1029
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,295
- Are you leaving soon, Tony?
- In just a little while.

1030
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:20,035
Say good-bye to Tony, darling.
It's way past your bedtime.

1031
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,044
I want to talk to him
before he leaves.

1032
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:27,246
- Good-bye, Tony.
- Good-bye, Brig, dear.

1033
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:35,885
It's sort of like
saying good-bye to Pop again.

1034
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,153
Coming from you, Brig,

1035
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:41,060
that's the compliment
to top all compliments.

1036
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,325
I'll have another kiss on that.

1037
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:49,463
- Your cab's here, Mr. Tony.
- Thank you, Fidelia.

1038
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,563
Would you ask him
if he'd mind waiting?

1039
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,269
I got it all arranged.
He's waiting.

1040
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,803
Good-bye, Tony.
Come back soon.

1041
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,370
Good night, Mother.

1042
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,313
Good night, darling.

1043
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:07,016
- Don't catch those mumps.
- What do you think I am, a child?

1044
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:12,257
- Happy dreams.
- Happy landing.

1045
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,895
- Bye, Mr. Tony.
- Good-bye, Fidelia.

1046
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,802
I'll take myself
along now before I...

1047
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,207
Just when did you
captivate Fidelia?

1048
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:36,979
It was my art that did the trick.
I sketched her.

1049
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,680
As a Wave?

1050
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,813
Sometimes your ingratitude
saddens me.

1051
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,882
- You'll recover.
- I've got to leave in three minutes.

1052
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:46,018
Tony, I'm so sorry
to see you go.

1053
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,393
We've all loved having you.

1054
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,261
By the way,
how did you leave Jane?

1055
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:55,031
With the mumps.
And with tears, I'm afraid.

1056
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:59,131
I haven't much tact, I guess.
I didn't know what to say.

1057
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:04,009
I know. Poor dear.
But you are very attractive, Tony.

1058
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,844
- A bone from Mrs. Hilton.
- No, I mean it.

1059
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:09,043
It won't be too easy for Jane,
getting over it.

1060
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:12,315
Nonsense. Older men...
every girl goes through it. Didn't you?

1061
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:16,119
- Still going through it.
- Yeah. Older men named Hilton.

1062
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:18,285
Don't you ever worry about Jane.

1063
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,090
I won't, as long as
the older men are like you.

1064
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:22,858
You know something, Anne?

1065
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:25,560
I'm chump enough to go on
living on your compliments

1066
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,761
for the next six months.

1067
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,964
Like a camel and water,
you know?

1068
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:33,736
- How long can they go?
- I never knew one.

1069
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,346
Tony, don't tell me any secrets,
but is it action this time?

1070
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:44,318
Down the St. Lawrence,
and then I don't even know myself.

1071
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:48,953
- I won't say what I feel.
- No, don't.

1072
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,853
You'd better get some rest.
You look tired.

1073
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,454
I will. I have a little
letter-writing to do first.

1074
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,158
I see.

1075
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,396
How often do you write him?

1076
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:03,404
You won't think me foolish
if I tell you?

1077
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,134
I try to write at least
a few lines every night.

1078
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,574
You know that's a little nuts.

1079
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,176
It's pretty wonderful, too.

1080
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:15,406
Well, good night, Anne.

1081
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,179
Good night, Tony.

1082
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:18,413
Come here.

1083
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,390
You're a swell guy, Tony.

1084
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,256
Go away.

1085
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,193
Well, she finally hit one.

1086
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,923
Now don't drop it.
Bowl it.

1087
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,205
It's no use, Bill.
I'll never learn.

1088
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,299
Sure you will.

1089
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:18,307
- I hurt my thumb.
- I'm so sorry. Let me see.

1090
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,654
It's your turn now, Bill.

1091
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,992
Let's see if you can
knock them all down.

1092
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:36,793
Well, I don't know about that.

1093
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,457
Like a piece of tape?

1094
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,224
Thank you.

1095
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,191
It's your turn now, Jane.

1096
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:41,093
I was just...
He just gave me a piece of tape.

1097
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,336
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi.

1098
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,568
- Have a smoke?
- No.

1099
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,633
I'd advise you
to mind your own business.

1100
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:59,010
I know she's a nice girl.
Anybody could see that.

1101
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,072
I don't like
your laughing either.

1102
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,142
Bill, please come down
and show me again how to do it.

1103
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:07,188
Look, buddy, you can
have a fight if you want it,

1104
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:09,247
but I was just trying
to be friendly.

1105
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:14,394
Well, all right, then.

1106
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:20,258
- Bill, speak to me.
- Gee, I'm sorry.

1107
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:23,499
- Look what you've done.
- I didn't do anything.

1108
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,868
I guess that'll teach him.

1109
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:42,017
You know, I've never been
to the beach in my whole life.

1110
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:46,526
- I've never seen the ocean.
- You haven't?

1111
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,086
I never saw it
till a couple of months ago.

1112
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,654
But you're a sailor.

1113
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:54,225
- I was brought up on a farm.
- I see.

1114
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:58,239
- I've never been on a farm.
- You haven't?

1115
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:01,242
I was brought up
on an Army post.

1116
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,107
I see.

1117
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,805
I have to catch a train.

1118
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:09,407
Gotta be back at the base
in the morning.

1119
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,150
Sure wish you could spend
the rest of the evening with us.

1120
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:20,389
No, you don't.
I've butted in enough already.

1121
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,364
- No, we loved meeting you.
- Sure we did.

1122
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,799
I'll catch a bus here.

1123
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,133
- So long, buddy.
- Good-bye.

1124
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,939
You've both been swell.

1125
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:34,441
You're the only people I met
since I came to town.

1126
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,273
Why didn't you go
to the canteen?

1127
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:40,179
They're so crowded and everything,
and I don't dance so very good.

1128
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:41,477
You and me both.

1129
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,418
Next time you come to town,
maybe we can all go bowling again.

1130
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,812
Gee, I don't know
if I'll ever be back this way.

1131
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,587
I expect we'll get going
any day now.

1132
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:55,093
The war looks
pretty good, doesn't it?

1133
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,722
It sure does.

1134
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:59,666
Well, good-bye, miss.
My name's Harold E. Smith.

1135
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,636
I'm Bill Smollett,
and this is Miss Hilton.

1136
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:06,333
- How are you?
- Jane's my first name.

1137
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,968
- Good-bye, Jane.
- Good-bye.

1138
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:15,680
- Bye, Harold.
- Hal.

1139
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:17,709
Bye, Hal.

1140
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:30,892
- He's nice.
- Yeah, he's a nice fella.

1141
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,594
You were sweet to him, Bill.
I'm sorry about...

1142
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:35,899
I acted like a fool.

1143
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,742
- He's good-looking, isn't he?
- Is he? I hadn't noticed.

1144
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:45,507
- You must have noticed.
- Well, I didn't.

1145
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:48,015
Come on, let's get a soda.

1146
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:55,785
No chocolate. We only have vanilla
flavoring, but no ice cream.

1147
01:19:55,858 --> 01:19:57,985
- Would you like Victory Punch?
- What's that?

1148
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,153
It's a loganberry phosphate
with lime.

1149
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:02,697
- That sounds fine.
- We'll make it two.

1150
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:06,530
But you could have a vanilla soda
without any ice cream maybe.

1151
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:09,162
That's right, I could, couldn't I?
I'll try it.

1152
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:12,503
One Victory and one
vanilla soda with no ice cream.

1153
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:15,338
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Of course not.

1154
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:21,239
Bill, why are you so...
so timid about things?

1155
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,647
What do you mean, Jane?

1156
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:26,279
I mean about asking
if you can smoke.

1157
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:28,323
Nobody else does that.

1158
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:31,723
And, well, I mean everything.

1159
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,920
Is it...

1160
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,056
I hope you won't think
I'm being forward,

1161
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,692
but is it something
to do with your grandfather?

1162
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,770
No, it isn't that.

1163
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,399
Although I suppose I've always
been sort of scared of Grandpa.

1164
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,306
But why?

1165
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:51,210
I dug up a scoop
of vanilla ice cream for you.

1166
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,908
Please pay the cashier and buy
war stamps with your change.

1167
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:55,506
I will.

1168
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:03,590
You see, my father
was a soldier.

1169
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:05,991
He was a colonel
when he died.

1170
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,394
I guess all the Smolletts
all the way back were soldiers.

1171
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,932
One of them was
with Washington at Yorktown.

1172
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,731
Although sometimes I think
Grandpa just made that one up.

1173
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:18,932
I'm sure he didn't.
You ought to be awfully proud.

1174
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:22,067
I'm proud, all right.

1175
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:26,979
But something
went wrong with me.

1176
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:32,478
Mother died when I was born,
so I never knew her.

1177
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,715
Of course I never knew her.

1178
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,054
That's a shame.

1179
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:40,856
She could paint pretty well...
china and things.

1180
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,489
I hope I can show you
her work sometime.

1181
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,590
That is, if Grandpa...

1182
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,191
If Grandpa what?

1183
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:49,203
Well, if I go home.

1184
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:52,001
You see, I haven't
lived home since West Point.

1185
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,371
West Point?

1186
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:57,111
You don't want to hear
all about this, do you?

1187
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:59,739
Not if you don't want me to, Bill.

1188
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:01,680
But I do, of course.

1189
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:07,188
There's no one in the whole world
that I'd rather tell.

1190
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,400
Isn't your soda all right?

1191
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:24,095
Yeah. I just don't
feel much like it.

1192
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,298
I thought I did, but...

1193
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:34,380
You don't have to drink it, Bill.
Would you rather go home and talk?

1194
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,747
We could sit on the porch.

1195
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:40,310
Swell. I'd like that.

1196
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:41,720
So would I.

1197
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,691
There. Now we can relax.

1198
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:21,218
You were talking about how your
grandfather wanted you to be a soldier.

1199
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,356
Would you like
a sandwich or something?

1200
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:26,196
He wanted me to be a general.

1201
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:28,463
But didn't you want
to be a general?

1202
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:30,562
Well, no, I didn't.

1203
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,231
But why not, Bill?

1204
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:37,440
I had an idea it was more
important to build things.

1205
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:41,175
I don't mean it isn't important
being a soldier.

1206
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:44,946
I don't know how we'd keep
the things we build without them.

1207
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,284
But you said you went
to West Point.

1208
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,551
I should think you'd be
a lot more than a...

1209
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:58,527
More than a corporal, you mean.

1210
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,661
Let's have a picnic sometime.
I'll bring a...

1211
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:11,268
Bill, I didn't mean that.
It's wonderful being a corporal.

1212
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,780
No, you meant that
if I went to the Academy,

1213
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:16,249
I ought to be
more than a corporal.

1214
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:20,345
Well, you might as well know it.

1215
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,825
I was kicked out
and I broke Grandpa's heart.

1216
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:29,192
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.

1217
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:31,027
Yes, it was.

1218
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,734
Bill, come and sit down.

1219
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:47,642
Look. Grandpa's father carried
this watch at Vicksburg.

1220
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:50,651
Grandpa gave it to me
on my tenth birthday.

1221
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:54,416
He had it engraved for me.
Read it.

1222
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:56,719
I'll light a match.

1223
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:02,126
"To William G. Smollett,
the Second,

1224
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,496
who will lead men
to glory on the battlefield."

1225
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:10,370
You must have been
terribly pleased.

1226
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:16,609
I said, "Grandpa, don't people
hurt each other in war?"

1227
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:18,976
You see, I was only ten.

1228
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:21,242
He took the watch away from me.

1229
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,308
But he gave it back to me again
when I entered the Academy.

1230
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:28,345
Jane, I did my best, but I
could never make a good officer.

1231
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,550
I can't lead men, and I know it.

1232
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,456
Even if I'd led my class
the way Grandpa...

1233
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:36,019
"Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa."
What about yourself?

1234
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:39,498
Why is it so important
that you satisfy him, the old...

1235
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:43,937
Because he loved me so.

1236
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:49,039
Yeah, I'm sure he did... once.

1237
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:53,945
But all through military school,
from the time I was eight,

1238
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:55,710
I kept letting him down.

1239
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:59,481
I never even wanted to play
with the tin soldiers he gave me.

1240
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,682
Grandpa kept telling me
that if I was a Smollett, I'd...

1241
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:09,320
But I guess I was always...
well, you know... weak.

1242
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:14,024
I was a joke at the Academy.
I only lasted a couple of months.

1243
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:19,770
Grandpa couldn't face
his old cronies.

1244
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:24,038
Well, that's it.

1245
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:27,275
Now you can see what a mess
I made out of everything.

1246
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,408
You've done no such thing.

1247
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:32,851
You're fine and strong,
but you're just sensitive... that's all.

1248
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:37,449
But don't you think I'm a failure
after everything I've told you?

1249
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:40,393
A failure? Just because
you're not an officer?

1250
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:44,960
An officer I know said that you
are the boys doing the fighting.

1251
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,866
- Lieutenant Willett?
- Yes.

1252
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,426
You think a lot of him,
don't you?

1253
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:52,667
Of course, but what's that
got to do with it?

1254
01:26:52,741 --> 01:26:57,110
You're a soldier, and I'm...
that is, we're proud of you.

1255
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,305
And I hope you never
get promoted.

1256
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:03,078
All those officers strutting around
with their gold braid and everything.

1257
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:10,121
Gee, Jane, I'm so glad
you feel that way about it.

1258
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,886
But Grandpa...

1259
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,587
Bother Grandpa!

1260
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,999
There's Soda. You'd better go
before we wake the colonel.

1261
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:22,930
He doesn't scare me.

1262
01:27:24,506 --> 01:27:26,167
Not anymore, he doesn't.

1263
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:29,540
Jane, let me stay long enough
for just one cigarette.

1264
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,101
All right.

1265
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:33,875
Provided you don't ask
my permission to smoke it.

1266
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,044
I won't.

1267
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:48,862
Gee, Jane,
I think you're wonderful.

1268
01:27:55,771 --> 01:28:00,674
"21/2 minutes... under no
circumstances more than 3."

1269
01:28:03,178 --> 01:28:07,080
Sometimes I think six minutes
would be more in character.

1270
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:09,913
I'll serve the colonel his breakfast
this morning, Mother.

1271
01:28:09,985 --> 01:28:12,215
What's wrong with you
this morning anyway?

1272
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:15,916
First you get up an hour early...

1273
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:21,555
...and then suddenly you've turned
into Mother's little helper.

1274
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:24,360
I don't know.
I just felt like it somehow.

1275
01:28:24,433 --> 01:28:28,631
Not that I object.
The next time Brig makes a deal,

1276
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:31,264
she can put it
into execution herself.

1277
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:35,777
You don't mind waiting
for our breakfast until Brig gets down?

1278
01:28:36,545 --> 01:28:39,514
Two sets of breakfasts
are about all I can handle.

1279
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,141
Mother, do you like Bill?

1280
01:28:43,218 --> 01:28:46,745
Yes, of course.
I think he's a very nice boy.

1281
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:50,690
A little shy.
Did you have a nice time last night?

1282
01:28:50,759 --> 01:28:53,956
If he's shy, it's that colonel's fault,
the old goat.

1283
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:56,020
That's not
a very nice way to talk.

1284
01:28:56,098 --> 01:28:58,692
Well, he is.
He's just ruined Bill, that's what.

1285
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:00,598
I'm going to have
a talk with him.

1286
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,433
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why not?

1287
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:05,405
Somebody's got to talk to him.

1288
01:29:05,474 --> 01:29:08,568
It's usually a good rule to stay out
of other people's business.

1289
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:11,009
But maybe it's better
if you learn the hard way.

1290
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,980
Go ahead if you want to.
You're not a baby anymore.

1291
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:17,485
Just think, in another week,
I'll be graduating.

1292
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:20,316
Mother, may I get a war job?
