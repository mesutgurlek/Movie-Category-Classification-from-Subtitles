1
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:03,328
We are calling to varify
a soldier killer in action.

2
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,792
Yes, you will be contacted right away.

3
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:07,024
Who was in charge of
No. 238 Jin Seok Lee?

4
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,890
Jin Seok Lee? It was me.

5
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,573
Why? I checked the hole and
pictures of the scene.

6
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:14,614
Killed In Action...

7
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:16,995
He's not listed in the
Missing In Action list either.

8
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,796
Did you try the
Army Recruitment list?

9
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:20,826
Jin Seok Lee...

10
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:24,656
Army Recruitment List...

11
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:27,556
Alive?

12
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,556
Grandpa, grandpa.

13
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:35,973
You have a call.
It's from the Army.

14
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:39,839
Hello?

15
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:43,173
Hello, sir. I'm from the
Korea War Excavation Team.

16
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,089
We wanted to varify a person
we found while excavating.

17
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:47,998
Yes...

18
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,253
Are you Jin Seok Lee
from the 12th infantry

19
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:53,392
who participated in the
battle of Doom Il Yung?

20
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:55,404
Yes, yes I am.

21
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:59,505
We found a remain with the
same name of Jin Seok Lee.

22
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:02,905
Oh, really?

23
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:05,906
I'm Jin Seok Lee.

24
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:11,306
Isn't it Jin Tae Lee
that you found?

25
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:13,906
No. We're positive it's
Jin Seok Lee.

26
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,456
We just wanted to double check.

27
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:17,906
We apologize for the inconviniece.

28
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,306
It seems that the name was
ommited from our list

29
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,306
or may have just made an
error in our part.

30
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:25,906
What did they say?

31
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:28,706
Wasn't it about your brother?

32
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:33,906
I thought because they said that
they were from the military

33
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:35,906
that they found your brother.

34
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,906
Grandpa, should I help
with the garden?

35
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:50,506
I need you to drive
somewhere with me.

36
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,006
I tried to stop him but
he wouldn't listen.

37
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:57,206
Of course, I'm driving.

38
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,486
Don't worry, mom.

39
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:02,406
Mom's very worried.

40
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:05,656
The is a rough mountain road
and your leg isn't well.

41
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,506
I'll call her later.

42
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:10,906
You went to look for your
brother last year in Yong Byong

43
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:13,106
and you were very exhausted.

44
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:13,986
Yes, you're right.

45
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,906
You go on and pull out the car.

46
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:21,986
O.K.

47
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:24,206
Do you have your ID with you?

48
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,506
They'll probably check you
when we get there.

49
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:29,656
Yes, drivers license, student ID,
citizen ID, I have everything

50
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:30,996
so don't worry.

51
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:31,996
Ok, Ok.

52
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:34,996
Grandpa, you're not
wearing sneakers, are you?

53
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,996
I'll shine your shoes for you.

54
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:52,906
1950, June, Seoul

55
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:27,406
Shoe shine!

56
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:30,396
Shoe shine!

57
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:33,906
Shoe shine!

58
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:35,906
Shoe shine!

59
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,906
Shoe shine...

60
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,906
Shoe shine...

61
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:42,996
Shoe shine.

62
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:45,906
Shoe shine.

63
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:24,906
Shoe shine!

64
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:35,966
That middle one there
is made with Italian leather

65
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,906
that just came in.

66
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,686
Looks nice.

67
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,506
It's really nicely made.

68
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,506
Heels are high and
nicely sewed.

69
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,906
But I like low heels better.

70
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:49,906
It looks more comfortable.

71
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:52,986
Really?

72
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,996
But you'll make much
better shoes than that.

73
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:58,956
I still have a long way to go.

74
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:03,196
In a few years, imagining you
making shoes in a shop like this

75
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:05,906
makes me feel so proud of you.

76
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:13,006
You shouldn't have.
It's too expensive.

77
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,296
You always wanted one, right?

78
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:21,956
Looks great!

79
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:24,906
Thanks...

80
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:31,906
Hey! Ice cream!

81
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,256
Give me one big one.

82
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,306
There are two of you, why not 2?

83
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:38,006
Just give me one.

84
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:40,986
O.K. Let's see, nicely frozen...

85
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:43,906
Here.

86
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,706
You don't have to...

87
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:47,006
Go on.

88
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,806
What about you?

89
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,006
My teeth will hurt so
I don't want it.

90
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:52,606
How much?

91
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,006
2 won.

92
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:55,556
Thank you.

93
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:56,606
Sell a lot.

94
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,006
- You take the first bite.
- I'm OK.

95
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:01,306
- Have a bite.
- I said you eat it.

96
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:02,906
Here, bite it.

97
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,906
The trolly!

98
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:12,506
Shoe shine!

99
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,906
Jin Seok, where are you going?

100
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:17,406
I have to go home.

101
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:18,956
I did all my studies.

102
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,906
I'll teach them to you tomorrow.

103
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:22,906
You have to teach me tomorrow. OK?

104
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:37,006
Mom.

105
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,006
What are you still doing?

106
00:10:42,356 --> 00:10:44,906
Can't you see?
We still have customers.

107
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:46,906
How are you, Jin Seok?

108
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:47,706
Hi.

109
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:55,946
Hold on!
I'll put some in a bowl.

110
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,906
It's alright.

111
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:02,206
I told you not to wipe on your shirt.

112
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:03,806
Come here.

113
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:07,126
Hey, I'm alright.

114
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:08,606
- I said come here.
- I said I'm alright!

115
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:09,306
Thank you.

116
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:11,196
Good bye.

117
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:15,906
Where did you get this wheat?

118
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,986
Oh, that?

119
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,906
They said if I joined some
group I'll get some.

120
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,976
Really?

121
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:24,996
What group gives 2 sacks of wheat
just for signing up?

122
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,996
If I knew it sooner
I could have taken mother, too.

123
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,906
There are no free lunches.

124
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:33,906
Don't worry so much.

125
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:36,906
Let's hurry. Dad must be hungry.

126
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:41,206
Hey, stop it!

127
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:45,606
Dad, Jin Seok got 1st in his
exam again at school.

128
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,706
Isn't he great?

129
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:51,506
Jin Seok will do all the things
you wanted to do.

130
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:55,806
Please help him get into
Seoul Univerisity next year...

131
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,396
and watch over his health.

132
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:01,706
Last spring was terrible.

133
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,756
It wasn't that bad, dad.

134
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,306
I'm fine now.

135
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:13,906
Mom says come in
and pay your respects.

136
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:20,906
Dad, you know Young Shin, right?

137
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:24,906
Young Shin and Jin Tae
will marry in the fall.

138
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:28,096
Mom's already worried
and feels sorry that

139
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,906
her daughter-in-law
may have hard times.

140
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:36,906
I'm sure you would have liked
her if you were here.

141
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,906
Mom, kids must be hungry.

142
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:47,106
Jin Seok, let's clean up.

143
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:48,306
Go and help mom.

144
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:49,306
OK.

145
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:51,706
Open the top.

146
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:52,506
Alright.

147
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,296
There you go again.

148
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,196
Use this from now on.

149
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,906
I made it from an old dress.

150
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,206
And don't lose it.

151
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:36,606
Young Min, what was
most tasty today?

152
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:37,906
I liked meat.

153
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:39,506
I liked cookies.

154
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:40,906
I liked dried persimon.

155
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,806
After we finish dinner,
let's go to the stream.

156
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,306
It's too late to go.

157
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,306
We have to go home and sleep soon.

158
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:53,306
It's Sunday tomorrow and no school.

159
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,906
And it's too hot to sleep.

160
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:59,506
- Come on... let's go.
- Where?

161
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,306
You look so happy.

162
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:19,906
I wish everyday was like today.

163
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:29,906
Yes, I know Jin Tae is like
this on the outside,

164
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:33,006
but I know that he's
very kind deep inside.

165
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:37,906
It's ok, mom, let's go.

166
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,906
No, I don't want to!

167
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,906
Why are you cutting it off?

168
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,906
I think high heels are much cooler.

169
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,906
Wow, it really looks like
a shoe from the store.

170
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:57,506
Are you going to sell it?

171
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,806
Why? If I sell it,
will you buy it?

172
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,206
If the price is right, why not?

173
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:03,999
You think that just anyone
can wear these fancy shoes?

174
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:05,956
Your toes will laugh at you.

175
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:13,906
Can you tell me why this
word is spelled this way?

176
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,906
I told you not to ask me
these kinds of questions!

177
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:18,906
You don't even know this?

178
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,606
It's a second grader question.

179
00:15:20,956 --> 00:15:22,906
Just go and shine shoes.

180
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,906
Forget it!

181
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:27,906
Oh, hi Jin Seok.

182
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:29,896
You're going to tutor me, right?

183
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,106
Jin Seok, you're still here?

184
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,906
Didn't you hear the news?

185
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:36,406
War broke out.

186
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,906
This early morning, North Koreans

187
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:54,906
passed the 38th parallel and attacked...

188
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:18,806
What is all this?

189
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:19,906
Are you moving?

190
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,006
Can't you see?

191
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,406
These are the things we need.

192
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:24,196
I said just take food and clothes.

193
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,306
I won't ask you to carry them
so don't worry.

194
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,606
You think uncle's house is
just around the corner?

195
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:28,396
Put them back.

196
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:29,806
Leave them alone!
I'm taking them.

197
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:30,986
How are you going to take them all?

198
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:32,886
I'm going to take them!

199
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:34,906
I'll take every single one of them!

200
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,106
Don't be stupid!

201
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:37,706
I'm taking them!

202
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:39,206
I said I'm taking them!

203
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:41,106
I said we'll come back soon.

204
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,506
You think all will turn out
the way you think?

205
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,306
We don't even know when
we'll be able to come back.

206
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,906
Noodle business was just
about to get better...

207
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:52,906
We're going to lose our
business spot too.

208
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:56,206
What about all the
kimchee and the soy sauce?

209
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:59,996
And what about the
potatoes we just planted?

210
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:02,006
They'll all still be here

211
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,006
so don't worry.

212
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,516
What if you get drafted to the military?

213
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:11,906
What are they going to do
with someone like me?

214
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:14,406
We'd better hurry.

215
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,906
Most have left already and

216
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:19,906
the refugees are packed everywhere.

217
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:30,906
Hurry, Young Ja.

218
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:33,006
Let's go.

219
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,406
Mother.

220
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:46,506
She said not to get separated

221
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:47,996
so watch the kids well.

222
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:49,106
Put Young Min up here.

223
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:50,806
Young Min, get up there.

224
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:53,906
Hold on tight.

225
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,906
Wait here for us. We'll be back.

226
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:04,006
Jin Seok, let's go.

227
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:07,506
Jin Seok.

228
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,123
Hold hands tight!

229
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,720
Young-ja!

230
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,934
<i>Dae-gu, July 1950</i>

231
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,637
What the hell is that train
sitting over there for?

232
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,441
I told you
trains for civilians are not running!

233
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,223
Where's a pharmacy?

234
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,520
I don't know

235
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,930
Let's go to the war front

236
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,530
And destroy the communists!

237
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,329
We must protect our country!

238
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,739
I think we have to
give up the train

239
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,642
- What about that one?
- It's leaving for the front

240
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,706
- Is Jin-tae back?
- Not yet

241
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,916
Jin-tae will bring you

242
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,419
some medicine in a minute

243
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,325
Salute!

244
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,631
Excuse us, but we're
on official business

245
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,544
Men between 18 and 30
step forward

246
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,110
Between 18 and 30!

247
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,845
It's nothing serious

248
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,441
Just step forward

249
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,384
- What's going on?
- It's nothing serious, don't worry

250
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,122
- What year were you born?
- I was born in 1921

251
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,123
Step forward then

252
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,922
It will be over soon
so please cooperate

253
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,827
Between 18 and 30!

254
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,263
How old are you?

255
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,005
- Ei... eighteen
- Step forward

256
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,768
- What's going on?
- And also people at the back...

257
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,171
step forward

258
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,972
- Men between 18 and 30
- Don't go

259
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,875
You don't need to follow
their orders

260
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,444
Don't worry, It's just some
questions, I guess

261
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,448
- It's going to be okay
- Come on, let's go

262
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,954
Everything will be fine
I'm still a student

263
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,061
- I'll be fine
- No, Jin-seok!

264
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,753
You aren't allowed to go

265
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,563
- Jin-seok!
- No, Jin-seok!

266
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,875
To position!

267
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,541
- Salute!
- Student soldier

268
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,310
Loyalty!

269
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,247
Back to position!

270
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,156
Don't worry
It's going to be Okay

271
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,763
Give this to Young-min

272
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,458
- What happened?
- Jin-seok...

273
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,068
What happened to Jin-seok?

274
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,969
The soldiers took him
with all the young men

275
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,472
he's not back yet

276
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,974
Jin-tae!

277
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,675
- We'll go
- We'll fight

278
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,343
We'll win!

279
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,657
- Student soldier!
- Student soldier!

280
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,769
- Volunteer soldier!
- Volunteer soldier!

281
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,774
Brave volunteer student soldiers

282
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:57,337
long live Korea
but now brave soldiers

283
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,153
Where are you going?

284
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,455
I'm looking for my brother

285
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,854
You're not permitted in here
You'll have to leave

286
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,528
- Jin-seok! Jin-seok!
- Stop right there!

287
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,031
Jin-tae!

288
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,936
Let's go!
This isn't the train to uncle's house

289
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,539
We're leaving soon
Sit down

290
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,243
My brother got on the wrong train
We're getting off

291
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,745
I said sit down

292
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,517
You must be mistaken

293
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,209
We're refugees

294
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,820
not soldiers

295
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,819
You've just been drafted, too

296
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,619
Then who's gonna look
after my mother? You?

297
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,523
Sit down!
That is an order

298
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:47,325
You order your soldiers
We are leaving

299
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,128
I told you to sit down!

300
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,038
You must be mistaken

301
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,233
Why can't you understand

302
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,138
Jin-seok
get off now!

303
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,816
Jin-seok
go, now!

304
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,533
Stay still!

305
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,641
Jin-tae!

306
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,709
Jin-tae!

307
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,720
Jin-tae!

308
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,929
My brother has a problem

309
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,131
with his heart
He can't even run

310
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,435
Tell that at the
training camp

311
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,136
Only those without arms or legs
or who can't talk or hear

312
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,543
At war, they're
called patients

313
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,129
Jin-seok, Jin-tae!

314
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,743
Jin-tae!

315
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,413
What are you doing, you bastard!

316
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,421
Mom!

317
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,086
- Mom!
- Mom

318
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,490
Jin-seok, Jin-tae!

319
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,927
Mom, Young-shin!

320
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,965
- Jin-tae!
- Mom, here, here!

321
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,436
Mom!

322
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,135
Mom, here!

323
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,832
- Jin-seok!
- Here, here!

324
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,843
- Jin-seok!
- Mom! Mom, here!

325
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,044
Mom!

326
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,614
Go to uncle's home first
We will meet you later

327
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,413
I'll take care of Jin-seok

328
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,021
Don't worry!

329
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,022
- What happened to your face?
- Take care of mom

330
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:30,321
Don't worry about us

331
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,225
You take care of yourselves

332
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,833
You must come home!

333
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,835
You must come home!

334
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,238
Jin-tae...

335
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,933
Mom!

336
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,177
Mom!

337
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,214
Jin-tae! Jin-seok!

338
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,481
Mom!

339
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,534
Hey, help me

340
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,250
Fucking bastards!

341
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,392
Pour that all over!

342
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,927
You communist dogs...

343
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,966
I should have burn them
to death Fucking bastards...

344
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,062
- KANG Yong-jin!
- Yes sir!

345
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,236
- KIM Ki-tae
- Yes, sir!

346
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,843
- LEE Jin-seok!
- Yes, sir!

347
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,815
Excuse me, sir

348
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,610
- May I have a word with you sir?
- Go ahead

349
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,213
This is my younger brother
Please let us stay close

350
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,120
He's just a student and
knows nothing about war

351
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,227
I'll teach him
Please

352
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,727
Alright

353
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,531
Here, Nakdong River
is our last line of defense

354
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,133
If this place is taken
the next is Busan, and then...

355
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,836
we've got nowhere to go
but into the sea

356
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,034
If you retreat
I'll kill you myself

357
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,635
This is where we
live or die

358
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,818
Write your wills and

359
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:39,117
whatever you wanna leave
put it in here, Got it?

360
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,815
- Attention, salute!
- Sir!

361
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,428
Damn young punk

362
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,128
What does he know about
death and wills?

363
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,834
Okay, let's say hello

364
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,737
- I am GO Yong-man
- I am LEE Jin-tae

365
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,640
Let me ask you something
Are you two related?

366
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,513
- He's my older brother
- You're brothers? Damn!

367
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,809
I thought they were only supposed
to take one per family!

368
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,422
Who's going to carry on
the family name?

369
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,024
Is the country going to?

370
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,922
Those bastards

371
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,224
Forget the will!

372
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,029
Forget it!

373
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,724
You never know when

374
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,732
the next meal will come

375
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,337
Eat this shit

376
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,030
Just call me Uncle Yang

377
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,836
He's the eldest
in our platoon

378
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,943
He's a self-proclaimed fortuneteller
but he's never right

379
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,714
Welcome

380
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,117
Don't ever take your helmet off

381
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,812
Many get their heads
blown off while sleeping

382
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,616
I'm Sergeant LEEM

383
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,921
I hate anything red
especially the reds!

384
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,030
I am Tae-soo, I escaped
from North Korea

385
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,534
But don't mistake me as a commie

386
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,226
I'm Seung-chul

387
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,938
I was a student but
I volunteered to fight

388
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,733
Say 'Hello', PFC Jo

389
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,142
Whatever for, We'll all be
dead soon anyway

390
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,804
- I'm PFC Jo
- I am Yong-goo

391
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,012
Just call me radio man

392
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,817
I am KIM Cheol-soo
I go by Ban

393
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,913
They are asking me
to fight, eating this?

394
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,227
No water or soup at all?

395
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,226
And mine's so damn small!

396
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,627
You don't want it?
Give it to me

397
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,334
Eat it

398
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,912
Jin-seok!

399
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,316
Jin-seok, are you okay?

400
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,794
Jin-seok, you okay?

401
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,491
Stay right there

402
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,237
Stay put

403
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,835
Jin-tae

404
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,903
I told you to
stay there!

405
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,276
Jin-seok, Jin-seok!

406
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,343
Hang on, Jin-seok!

407
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:34,015
Please keep breathing!
Jin-seok, You can do it

408
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,319
Jin-seok, breathe in!

409
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,724
Now breathe out

410
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,128
More, more!

411
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,529
Spit it out!

412
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,737
Now breathe in!
Jin-seok, You can do it

413
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,442
Deeper, deeper, Jin-seok!

414
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,519
You're okay!

415
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,883
Okay, okay

416
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,885
You're fine

417
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,037
Please send my brother
to the hospital

418
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,773
I'll blow up their tanks or
bring you their commanders

419
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,140
I'll even carry a bomb

420
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,112
- into their camp
- There is one with an epileptic

421
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,310
Another has pulmonary tuberculosis
One in 3rd platoon has rheumatism

422
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,014
Another with heart disease
And one with pulmonary tuberculosis

423
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,318
Need more?

424
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,622
Should I send them all?
Who'll fight then?

425
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,723
Life and death crosses

426
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,926
here every second

427
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,732
If you do
what you've said

428
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,841
and I can even send
your brother home!

429
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,536
I'll do whatever I can do
if I can send him home

430
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:04,307
That's the spirit we need

431
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,815
You have to give to
your country

432
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,316
before asking for something

433
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,217
Just for your information

434
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,327
it's been done before

435
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,925
There, a father and son
were in the same unit

436
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,725
who could send his son home

437
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,232
Wanna know how?

438
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,313
Wills are for dying people

439
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,321
You've got to be strong

440
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,321
I wish all this
would just be a dream

441
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,234
I want to wake up in my room

442
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,635
I'd tell you about this
over breakfast

443
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,474
I would tell you that
I had a strange dream

444
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,337
Then I would go to school

445
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,910
and you and mom would go to work

446
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,121
Don't worry
We will be just fine

447
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,625
Urgent call from
the battalion bunker, sir!

448
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:30,495
What is it?

449
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,070
The 2nd and 3rd have
lost their positions

450
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,332
Damn it!

451
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,935
- Wake them up!
- Yes, sir!

452
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,934
Everybody, wake up!
Everybody up! Up!

453
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,814
Area 721 and

454
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,008
area 734 have

455
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,709
fallen into the enemy's hands

456
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:53,620
Additionally, our supply route
has been cut off

457
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:57,118
This means
we're isolated

458
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,829
Remove all the rocks

459
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,332
They're shrapnel
waiting to happen

460
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,436
Area 731 and 732 are gone
We're next!

461
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,233
The bastards are gonna
hit us hard, like dogs

462
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,831
There won't be anyone
left to bury us

463
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,839
Let the commies come!

464
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,607
I'll kill everyone I can!

465
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,113
Attention!

466
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,918
Sergeant HUH, KOH Yong-man
LIM Tae-soo, KANG Hyo-Yul

467
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,216
YANG, JANG, LEE Seung-chul
Get armed and come with me

468
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,814
What's going on?

469
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,927
There's an order to plant mines
on the defense line

470
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,430
Shit, that's right
under their noses

471
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,929
So what?

472
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,631
I have to go there?

473
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,132
I'm going, too

474
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,896
Yong-man is out
Jin-tae is going, instead

475
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,769
Rest of you get back to

476
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,806
what you were doing

477
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,570
Yes, sir!

478
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,906
- Damn, I always get the shit
- Jin-tae!

479
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,417
- Jin-tae!
- Hurry up!

480
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,642
Those commies will
take over anytime

481
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,009
They slaughter the families
of soldiers and cops

482
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,815
That's why we've got to

483
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,411
win this war!

484
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:33,217
If we lose, the commies
will kill us all!

485
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,916
Win to live

486
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,526
Win how?
Eating mud?

487
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,130
Get back to work!

488
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,011
Aimed fire!

489
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,716
Hide yourselves quick!

490
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:15,023
- Get down!
- Seung-chul! Don't move!

491
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,130
Be careful of the land mine
Seung-chul!

492
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,606
Yang and I will
go get him!

493
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,215
Cover us!

494
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:46,319
Seung-chul, hang on
hang on there!

495
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,339
I'll be there soon
so don't move!

496
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,407
Crazy bastards, don't shoot
don't shoot!

497
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,215
The kid's gonna die!
We have to go quick!

498
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,619
Let's go!

499
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,559
Where's private LEE
you bastard!

500
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,492
I don't know sergeant

501
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,734
- Jin-tae!
- Only a few left

502
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,030
Let's finish them!

503
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,140
Jin-tae!
No, retreat! Now!

504
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,340
Jin-tae! Are you
out of your mind?

505
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,443
Hey! LEE Jin-tae

506
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,715
Quick, you bastard

507
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,619
He was shot in the stomach
and on his leg

508
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,425
Hold on

509
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,126
- Hurry up!
- Hold him tight!

510
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,064
Hold tight, you bastard

511
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,637
Take it easy
Seung-chul!

512
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,537
We must take him
to the hospital

513
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,666
Hey, you bastard! There's
no way to carry him out!

514
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,141
Sew him up right now!

515
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,615
- Hurry up
- Sew him up!

516
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,222
- What should I do with this?
- Hold on, bastard!

517
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,139
You okay?

518
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,739
LEE Jin-tae

519
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,613
I'll kill you if you
do that again

520
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,513
I mean it

521
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,112
One more minute
he would have died

522
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,518
Got it?

523
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,122
Why the hell did you
go for that mission?

524
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,323
Tell me

525
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,625
You weren't on the list
but you volunteered for it

526
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,234
Why is that?

527
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,734
I don't understand
why you did that

528
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,429
Just forget it

529
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,937
What if it was you
laying there

530
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,939
with your guts open!

531
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,342
Promise me
you won't do that again

532
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,107
Promise!

533
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,913
Alright

534
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,933
All I need is
just water

535
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,331
Why the hell are they
playing that music?

536
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,133
They know we're isolated

537
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,835
They're gonna drive us crazy

538
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,412
Remember the ice cream?

539
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,416
It was so good

540
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,225
Back home, you can eat it
till your teeth go numb

541
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,933
I wonder what mom

542
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,537
and Young-shin are doing...

543
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:21,737
I bet... Mom is really
worried about us

544
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,415
Uncle would be taking
good care of them

545
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,517
I miss them all

546
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:32,320
Young-guk, Young-ja
Young-min...

547
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,422
I should've...

548
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,428
set the dog free

549
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,631
- Seung-chul
- What's wrong?

550
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,329
Okay there?
Make him lie down

551
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:56,344
Uncle Yang...
my stomach hurts

552
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,304
Don't worry
You'll be okay

553
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,714
Where's my leg?

554
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,523
You call yourself doctor?

555
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,420
Don't see the maggots?

556
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,620
What are you good for?

557
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,027
Food?

558
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,338
Why no more?
Damn! It's about time!

559
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,872
Give us more!

560
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,137
Stop, you bastards!

561
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,011
My ears are exploding!

562
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,113
Are you gonna make us
go through hell?

563
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,019
You want to give up
Nak-dong River?

564
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:52,627
Seung-chul!

565
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,236
Seung-chul
Put it down

566
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,126
Seung-chul

567
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,322
Why couldn't you wait
just a little longer?

568
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,735
Dismiss

569
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,433
- Go back to the trench
- Shit!

570
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,434
We're going to die
here like dogs?

571
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,809
Starve to death
or shot to death

572
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,716
Who says we're gonna die?

573
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,711
They haven't given us food
or water for days!

574
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,516
We'll die
an honorable death

575
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,625
Soldiers are human, too!

576
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,624
What's the honor when
starving to death?

577
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,228
- Shut up!
- You crazy bastard

578
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,627
You'd go to them for
a piece of bread

579
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,934
It's better than
starving to death

580
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,229
Okay then, go on!

581
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,534
Go join the commies
I'll kill you before you get there

582
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,835
Surrendering is better than

583
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,238
starving to death like animals!

584
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,642
Who gives a shit who wins!

585
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,907
Is that ideology
important enough

586
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,517
to kill each other over?

587
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,410
You finished?

588
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,817
This is totally different from

589
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,514
our fight against Japan!

590
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,319
You damn communist!

591
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,027
Fuck, give back your badge!
You crazy fuck!

592
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,028
Stop it, son of a bitch

593
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,618
- Let go, let go!
- You son of a bitch!

594
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,615
Stop it, son of a bitch

595
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,026
Okay, let's die, you bastard
today, okay?

596
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,425
We're gonna die anyway

597
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,532
- Die, fucking bastard!
- Take it easy!

598
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:07,126
The communists slaughtered

599
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,035
- his entire family
- I didn't do it!

600
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,837
This ain't circus!
Go back to the bunker!

601
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,041
This is it?

602
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,514
Let's attack them

603
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,115
We're so weak we can

604
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,515
- barely lift our guns
- One more day

605
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,418
and we'll be eating corpses

606
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,525
Or surrender to
the commies

607
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,724
They wouldn't expect us
to attack them

608
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,830
We've got nothing to lose
haven't we?

609
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,625
Let's go in and
wipe them out

610
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,229
I will fight!

611
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,735
I will, too!

612
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:42,930
I will follow too

613
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,734
- I will go too
- I will go along

614
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,638
- I will go
- Hey, count me in

615
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,745
- I'll go too
- Me too

616
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,904
One mistake can

617
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:54,814
- kill us all
- Let's go and kill 'em all!

618
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,731
Sir!

619
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,135
I don't understand

620
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,638
why I'm out of the mission

621
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,538
You're not qualified

622
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,439
I am!
Let me join them!

623
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,603
- I have to be with my brother
- It's too late

624
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,113
I'm begging you, I want to
fight with others

625
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,309
Your brother begged me to sit you out

626
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,012
and now you wanna go?

627
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,817
What are you risking
your life for?

628
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,622
- You need a medal, too?
- What medal, sir?

629
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,742
Attack!

630
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,212
Attack!

631
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,011
Fucking bastard!

632
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,736
Fuck, kill 'em all!

633
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:23,415
Die all of you...
die!

634
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,034
Please... don't kill me

635
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,109
I'm only 15

636
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,614
I just got drafted

637
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,718
Please don't kill me

638
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,413
Please...

639
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,819
Die...
