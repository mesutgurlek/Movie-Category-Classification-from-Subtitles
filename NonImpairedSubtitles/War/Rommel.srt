Heil Hitler.
General Field Marshal waiting for us .

00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:48,681

00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,841
- Heil Hitler.
- General.

General Field Marshal .

Ma'am .

12
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:23,441
- You stay well out to lunch ?
- No, thank you. We are here in the service.

13
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:28,561
May I ask you to leave us alone
with General Field Marshal ?

14
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,801
Come on .

15
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:36,721
I announce if we need anything.

16
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:43,481
Aldinger ,
develop Normandy documents.

17
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:52,561
It's so well ? You are looking for an idiot
blaming the West Front collapse .

18
00:02:55,001 --> 00:03:00,121
You are accused of having been involved
the assassination of the Fuhrer .

19
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:03,481
What ?

Thank you. Great. Stay there , we will
up and shooting close-ups .

34
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:25,841
Do what you want , as long as you delay
invasion by a week.

35
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,321
- Fuehrer's adjutant is here.
- Thank you, Aldinger .

36
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:35,521
I need your support. High German
officers that the Russians captured -

37
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:40,801
- Have sent letters to officers
and urged them to stop the war.

38
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:43,801
They're dictated by Stalin himself .

39
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:48,601
Unfortunately not. There is clear evidence
that the letters are not forged.

40
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:53,521
- Do you also have one?
- No. And then I ripped it .

41
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:57,921
Now that the war escalates ,
Fuhrer must know with certainty -

42
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:02,881
- That there is a one-off
and that the field marshal is loyal .

43
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:06,561
- The Führer knows I am loyal .
- Hostile flight !

44
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:09,401
Give me , Aldinger .

45
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:14,761
They have not seen us yet.
- Daniel , try to reach the forest.

46
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:20,721
- They face . They 've found us !
- Maybe you should sit down .

47
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:24,761
Gasa . Faster.
- Where do you see the problems we have here.

48
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:29,161
Not a German plane in sight.
The allies chasing us like hares.

49
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,841
Stop!

50
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,441
In here. Fort . - This Way . In there .

51
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,881
Do not, you still can not hit .

52
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:52,041
In there . Quick!

53
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,481
Shit !

54
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,001
Survived all ?

55
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,841
" On all soldiers
and officers' behalf " -

56
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:17,121
- " We declare our allegiance
to the Führer and National Socialism. "

57
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:21,921
"Therefore , we promise to do all we can
for every soldier " -

58
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:27,561
- " To fight even more intense
of National Socialism 's future. "

59
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:31,361
" Berchtesgarden , March 15, 1944 ".

60
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:49,881
My adjutant was very impressed
of his visit to the Atlantic Wall .

61
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:53,201
I look forward to your progress .

62
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:57,001
This was two weeks ago
off Plymouth .

63
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,321
The enemy appears prepare
a landing .

64
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:05,481
They also gather force
English Channel. At least 50 divisions.

65
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:09,601
<i>- They will then in a few weeks .
- About </ i> they come.</i>

66
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,401
They have practiced this before .

67
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:17,121
It 's obvious that the Allies
must come west.

68
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:20,801
I 'm really looking forward
their departure .

69
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:30,761
What do you think?
Where will they try ?

70
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:36,041
They are probably trying here , in Calais.
Or in Normandy.

71
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:41,521
The two peninsulas offer
excellent opportunities for bridgeheads .

72
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:44,481
How the enemy will act?

73
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,361
First they bombarded our positions.

74
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:54,041
Then attack boats
and armored landing vehicles -

75
00:07:54,041 --> 00:08:00,961
- Under the cover of artillery and bombers .
Airborne troops placed behind the front.

76
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,641
What is your counter-move ?

77
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:09,201
The enemy will be killed at the landing .
The beach is the battle line .

78
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:15,801
Empty talk , Mr. Rommel . How defends
to an over 2,000 km of coastline ?

79
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,841
We miss forces.

80
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:24,441
We place all armored divisions
to the coast. I 'll show you.

81
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:30,401
Within three months , it looks like this
everywhere on the Atlantic Wall .

82
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,841
Barriers hinder
for landing boats.

83
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:37,841
Artillery shells them
directly at the landing .

84
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:43,241
And we have no artillery in place,
taking armor units over .

85
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:49,801
If the enemy breaks through at one point
on fältmarskalkens defense line

86
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,361
- Empire is defenseless .

87
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:58,881
When the Allies marching to Berlin.
Our tanks can only follow.

88
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:05,121
Our tanks kill all enemies
who disembarked in 48 hours.

89
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:11,121
Before the tanks get there , it has
enemy plane bombed them apart .

90
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:18,121
Mein Führer ... I ask you to give me
command of armored forces .

91
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:21,681
Only then can we prevent
enemy invasion.

92
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:26,801
Then we put everything on one card .
Without strategic reserves .

93
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:30,121
As commander in chief in the West
I allow it .

94
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:34,841
But for three years, have you allowed
Atlantic Wall to be inadequate.

95
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:39,881
While Rommel short time
has done exemplary work .

96
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:43,921
An invasion must be strictly avoided.
For one thing is certain :

97
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:48,721
If the landing fails,
do not they try again .

98
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,801
Then we can redirect forces
where we need them - in the East.

99
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,441
All 45 divisions.

100
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:02,481
war output
depends on you and your soldiers.

101
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:06,081
And even Reich
and the fate of the nation .

102
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:11,121
- Do you realize that, Field Marshal ?
- Yes, my Führer .

103
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:16,681
Can you at least wait
at Manfred ? He will be disappointed.

104
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:22,241
Tell him . We have very little time before
the enemy is coming, and much to do.

105
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,641
- You can do it .
- I must.

106
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:28,241
Fuhrer expects
I save the kingdom .

107
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,761
How nice that he trusts you again .

108
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:34,401
FRANCE
April 15, 1944

109
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:44,721
Rommel HEADQUARTERS

110
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:48,761
There you are .
We were expecting you earlier , General.

111
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:52,081
We were chased by enemy aircraft .

112
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:58,201
Their superiority in the air is our largest
problems . My adjutant , Captain Aldinger .

113
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,481
Take the general's baggage .
- You will get to meet my staff , Speidel .

114
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:07,761
- How's the cheese ?
- The Russian offensive can not be stopped.

115
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:10,481
Führer's orders are catastrophic .

116
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:14,601
They give unnecessary coincident ,
and prevents the front moved.

117
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:19,081
- Move the front?
- For Reich boundaries, if possible.

118
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:23,441
Then do not negotiate the enemy with us.
Would you like to be humiliated ?

119
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,761
- No.
- We will prevent the invasion.

120
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:30,961
Only then may the Führer
a strong bargaining position .

121
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:38,601
Gentlemen,
our new Chief of Staff , General Speidel .

122
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,521
Nice .

123
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:45,041
Countess La Rochefoucauld ,
Castle owner's nephew .

124
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,681
<i> - Bonjour.
- Comtesse , bonjour . </ I></i>

125
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:52,481
She speaks excellent German.
She interprets for us.

126
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:57,281
- Er famous ancestor , the author ?
- Yes.

127
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:00,241
<i> " La jeunesse
est une Ivresse continuelle . " < / i ></i>

128
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,801
<i> "C'est la fièvre de la raison . " </ i></i>

129
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:06,601
- It was well he ?
- Yes.

130
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:15,241
Youth is a continual intoxication.
The reason is fever.

131
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:21,721
Who did you mean , Speidel ? There's
just a youth here , Countess.

132
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:27,841
- It happened just like that.
- The Countess knows what is proper .

133
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:31,241
- Are you sure?
- Are not you ?

134
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:36,281
<i> - Messieurs , </ i> good evening .
- Bonsoir . </ i></i>

135
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:45,561
It easily becomes a villain .
Not true Speidel ?

136
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:53,641
Here at Calvados Coast
we still have a gap of 40 kilometers.

137
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:57,881
If the tanks will not
it looks dark.

138
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:03,401
The Führer has promised to curb units
will . You get your tanks.

139
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:08,761
We must move obstacles ahead ,
Marcks .

140
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:12,561
The Allies
practice landing at low tide now.

141
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:17,001
So it looks . But we 'll give them
long way to the beach.

142
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:21,881
How ? I can not tire out the men
with pick and shovel .

143
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:25,081
I have rested soldiers.

144
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:30,601
That's the problem . Your men are too
rested after three years of beach vacations.

145
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:35,841
See the doctor Speidel . He was
on the eastern front , but he laments ?

146
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:39,441
I lost my leg on the eastern front.

147
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:42,641
And with all due respect , I tell you :

148
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:47,201
Your plan requires a minimum of one year.
Anyone who says otherwise ...

149
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,961
- ... Hide the truth or does not know.
- What do you imagine ?

150
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:57,121
The Führer has given me orders to
prevent the Allied landing .

151
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:01,161
And a slacker like you
should not hinder me.

152
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:04,001
Now make sure to get the job done.

153
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,961
Yes.

154
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:17,561
Maybe it was a little rough , but otherwise
nothing happens here , believe me.

155
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,241
Wait, Marcks .

156
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:27,241
- He knows Marcks is absolutely right.
- Your men have been frequent . Sorry.

157
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,361
PARIS
April 25, 1944

158
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,961
German military ADMINISTRATION

159
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,881
It has happened to some here , Hans.

160
00:14:53,881 --> 00:15:01,121
Paris Jews was sent to the East,
but traffic continues ...

161
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:07,521
And SS chasing even Jewish children ,
that residents are hiding .

162
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,561
The local SS last idea.

163
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:19,161
Resistance bomb stations and
then exploded even wagons are doors .

164
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:24,001
Some Jews fled. To prevent
there transported the now bare.

165
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,921
Come on .

166
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,561
Colonel Hofacker ,
Count Stauffenberg's cousin.

167
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:46,321
- General.
- Nice to meet you .

168
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:51,601
Berlin would finally act.
Therefore, they asked me to trust myself to you .

169
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:55,401
- It's about Rommel .
- Rommel ?

170
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:59,601
Can he convince
to participate in kupplanerna ?

171
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:06,161
He will do anything to succeed in the West.
He wants to prevent the invasion.

172
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:10,601
Convince him. Is Rommel with ,
we get the support of the front.

173
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:15,041
And of the people. Do not forget
he is our most popular general .

174
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:24,041
A major step : from Fuhrer minion
the figurehead of the coup.

175
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,521
- But the only thing possible .
- I must see him.

176
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:32,481
Preferably without the Gestapo know .
Can you arrange that?

177
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:41,481
Rommel HEADQUARTERS
April 28, 1944

178
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:07,921
- Guderian decides on the tanks .
- Not Führer ?

179
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:14,761
Führer asked me to inspect them and
submit recommendation. What do you think ?

180
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:19,721
It should be the second Panzer division ,
Geyr . Yet is this .

181
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:27,481
The enemy disembark quickly airborne
divisions with anti-tank guns .

182
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:33,921
That's why the tanks no avail
the coast, with the enemy in the back.

183
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:40,121
The enemy does your tanks to reach
coast and can build their beachhead .

184
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:50,761
How do you protect our tanks
from their sjöartilleri ?

185
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:53,361
We bury them.

186
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:57,521
- Bury them?
- Yes.

187
00:17:57,521 --> 00:18:04,561
Is not their strength in combination
of armor , firepower and mobility?

188
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:11,721
During the campaign against France was traveling
s spökdivision not fast enough.

189
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:16,881
Führer has expressly approved
my plans.

190
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:19,161
He has not decided yet.

191
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:24,041
Until then reads armored divisions
under the Commander in the West.

192
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,721
Then we can end this now.

193
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:42,001
It did not go well in Africa.
Now he wants to be something here.

194
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,401
Get him to see reason .

195
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:50,601
He can not prevent an attack
with infantry hiding behind tanks.

196
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:54,161
- Field Marshal knows what he's doing.
- Really?

197
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:59,281
Actually , he has never been more
than a viable division commander .

198
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:18,161
So it is with the Führer. The last
who meets him is always right.

199
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,721
Let's go a round , Speidel .

200
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,921
Rundstedt is old and tired.
He gave up a long time ago .

201
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:30,161
And Guderian has been a yes men .

202
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:33,801
Take the consequences.

203
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:38,521
- Take matters into your own hands.
- What do you mean?

204
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:46,481
Request to be commander in chief in the West.
Give Hitler an ultimatum .

205
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:51,481
- He needs you. You are well-liked.
- Should I threaten Führer ?

206
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:56,801
- If you want to prevent the invasion.
- So, you achieve nothing with the Führer.

207
00:19:56,801 --> 00:20:01,161
Less you , recognize the people and the Fuhrer
that the war can not be won .

208
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:06,761
Quiet, Speidel . I want you here
as chief of staff a while.

209
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:13,201
- What liberally to let them stay here.
- Thoughtless , you mean ?

210
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:17,601
The French aristocracy
fear the Bolsheviks more than we do.

211
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:21,681
Count worship the Fuhrer .
That kid man is his son.

212
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:26,121
As old as our Manfred.

213
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:29,241
Our son is air defense aide in Ulm.

214
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:33,121
Recently , he wanted to join the Waffen- SS.

215
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:36,561
I forbade him to do so.

216
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:40,121
Now you may ask , but ...

217
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:44,721
You know, I 've heard
terrible stories .

218
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:51,041
If the mass executions . and massacres
of Jews in the occupied territories .

219
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,401
You were on the eastern front .
Can you confirm this?

220
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:59,961
It also takes place in France.
They yet deporting Jews.

221
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:04,681
SS searching through
for hidden Jewish children .

222
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:09,241
- How do you know?
- In Paris, army management , there ...

223
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:11,681
... those who do not find themselves in it .

224
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:18,921
So yeah ... You have to get used to the lightning
and thunder to be a soldier .

225
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:23,041
Our Manfred cried too
when he was photographed .

226
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:29,841
Stülpnagel . Speidel cheated well not here
me to calm screaming babies?

227
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,561
A MANSION NEAR PARIS
14 MAJ 1944

228
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:37,521
In case of extreme emergency must
forcing Hitler to yield.

229
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:42,161
- What do you mean by "force" ?
- To arrest him .

230
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:47,761
And bring him to justice for
the crimes he has committed in the name of the people .

231
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:51,681
Mr von Stülpnagel ,
what you are proposing is a military coup.

232
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:56,481
Do you think you can find a single general
ready for that?

233
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:01,481
A group of prominent men
at our disposal .

234
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:04,921
There have been coup plans
even earlier.

235
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:09,001
Some yielded their
to liberate Germany from Hitler.

236
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:11,361
Daring to their lives ?

237
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:17,161
- An attack , then?
- Not if it can be avoided .

238
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:23,241
Know all about it?

239
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:27,281
- Only in Berlin , the details .
- It is high treason.

240
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:30,281
Hitler betray long Germany.

241
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:36,401
Closes we are not at peace with the Allies
Now , the Russians take Berlin in the autumn.

242
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:41,041
Although you have sworn an oath .
Do not forget it .

243
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:54,761
Now he runs to the Führer .

244
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:24,241
How long have you known
these plans ?

245
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:26,721
A while.

246
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,681
You know what is required of me
the obedient soldier.

247
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:34,361
Do what you must do.

248
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:42,441
Damn it .

249
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:50,481
Give it here . It can be mended .

250
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:01,321

Watch out ! They come, they come !
Here we go ! It begins!

253
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,881

Speidel , dammit . What is happening?

255
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:22,201
Have Englishmen landed ?

256
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:27,841
- A British raid averted near Calais .
- On the Channel coast ?

257
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:32,561
A British military officers were arrested.
He was handed over to the Gestapo.

258
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:36,161
- In Paris ?
- You can be the chain of command.

259
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:58,201
SS HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS

261
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:11,801
Good, Lieutenant General .
We'll take him.

262

- Rommel want to meet him.

You can command the order. he
to be executed as soon as he talked .

264
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:25,761
- He certainly has not spoken yet.
- Within 12 hours , you know ...

265
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:31,601
- ... Where and when the invasion occurs.
- Certainly. But we have our methods.

266
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:36,641
You tell enough for me
if your methods sometime.

267
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:39,481
Feel it . - Take him away .

271
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:23,041
- He understands you.
- How the Brits want war now?

272
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:28,361
- And what was there in Africa?
- Tjafs . Compared to what awaits .

273
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:32,361
Have a seat .

274
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,881
Well , Lieutenant ...

275
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:49,001
Actually , we have the same enemy .

276
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,401
And he 's in Russia.

277
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:57,001
- Why do we fight not side by side?
- It would be hard .

278
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:02,201
We Brits think that certain things
you Germans do, is disgusting.

279
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:06,121
- What do you mean?
- The way you treat Jews .

280
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:11,361
It's politics. We are soldiers.
We have nothing to do with politics .

281
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:16,921
That your Führer exterminate an entire people ,
is it just politics?

282
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:27,961
- It could change.
- It's too late , Field Marshal .

283

And command the order, then?

286
00:28:57,641 --> 00:29:01,601
- What do you know about it?
- You hear a lot.

287
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:05,601
- I'll make sure nothing happens to him .
- But can you do it?

288
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:11,841
- Yes , I'm the commander in chief .
- There are many in France.

289
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:14,521
And then there's the SS.

290
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:21,321
Countess . Wait a minute.

291
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:41,521
Excuse me ... but can you get hold of
those here in Paris?

292
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:45,801
- For my wife's birthday.
- You have good taste.

293
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:50,601
S uncle hope
that we can beat back the enemy.

294
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:52,761
What do you hope ?

295
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:58,241
- Who are you ?
- We are lost , whatever.

296
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:07,241
Given our fortifications,
morale of the troops -

297
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:11,361
- Our new armament
and the weapons we have been given -

298
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:15,361
- We look forward to coming times
with great calm .

299
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:17,321
And ...

300
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:22,681
... do not worry
about how it should go. It's fine .

301
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:27,601
And I do not
that the British are returning for a second time .

302
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:32,881
- Was it good?
- Excellent . Very convincing.

303
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:35,841
Good .

304
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:40,721
I heard that a British soldier
was captured in Calais.

305
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:46,481
- Do you believe that the invasion happens there ?
- The place where you least expect it .

306
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:48,721
Then they learn to come to me .

307
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:54,761
They go to church on Sunday , will set sail
on Monday and will be here on Tuesday.

308
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:58,881
- Why do you think that?
- My birthday is on Tuesday.

309
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:02,041
- My wife too.
- There you are .

310
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:05,841
From the high command ,
Colonel General Jodl .

311
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:14,041
- Hell .
- Bad news ?

312
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:31,521
Führer gives me three armored divisions .
The rest I ask later.

313
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:37,601
Should I send a written request
when the enemy lands ?

314
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,801
I have to meet Hitler.

315
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:44,601
He gets misinformation
of the bad guys around him.

316
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:48,801
- Do you really believe that?
- You and your friends do not believe it .

317
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:53,561
But what do you expect ?
That I passively watching the chaos ?

318
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:59,361
I do not remember as commander
who led his soldiers to slaughter.

319
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:03,641
- There are other options .
- I do not believe in them.

320
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:09,961
Put me through to the Führer's headquarters.
The Fuehrer 's adjutant . I can not wait.

321
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:17,161
Do you like shoes?
A birthday present for my wife.

322
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:20,041
Very elegant . She'll be happy enough.

323
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:24,801
It will be storm and very cloudy
until 10 June.

324
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:27,441
So you can safely go .

325
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:33,081
- A good trip.
- Keep track of everything here.

326
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:36,921
<i> - Monsieur , le comte .
- Pour votre épouse . < / I ></i>

327
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:41,641
<i>- To your wife a happy birthday.
- Oh,  merci . </ I></i>

328
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:45,401
<i> - Au revoir .
- Au revoir . </ I></i>

329
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:57,961
<i> One thing is certain . invasion set
enemy facing a crushing down ... </ i></i>

330
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:12,041
There you are , Manfred.

331
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:16,961
- Good day , Father.
- Good day , my son.

332
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:20,561
- You look good in uniform.
- Can I still take it ?

333
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:25,401
He must be back tonight .
He got permission , but did not .

334
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:32,681
Very good . I'm proud of you.
Go to your room, we'll see you later.

335
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:40,001
He is sorry that you were against
he joined the Waffen- SS.

336
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:42,841
I have not changed my mind .

337
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:47,281
I'm glad you could come.

338
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:50,601
I'm going to the Führer .
Problems in France.

339
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:53,761
Put yourself . You seem a little irritable.

340
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:05,361
Lu, do you remember where
as Strölin recently told ?

341
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,521
- That the gas kill Jews in the East?
- Please stop .

342
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:14,441
Strölin a Nazi
and Lord Mayor of Stuttgart.

343
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:18,841
Although he has sent Jews to the East.
Why does he say so ?

344
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:22,841
It happens even in France,
before my eyes .

345
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:28,201
I thought there were isolated cases.

346
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:33,161
But those at the top are not decent .

347
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:36,961
What do you mean by "those at the top" ?

348
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:46,881
You know where we live ,
what was here before.

349
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:49,361
Yes.

350
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:54,841
- A jew boarding school.
- Then we should move.

351
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:57,521
Do not believe that.

352
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:03,561
We are not preventing him from speaking
in radio , he gets to the masses .

353
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,841
We must be
as eloquent as Hitler.

354
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:11,641
Are we not,
it does not help with an attack .

355
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:18,241
- Yes, Colonel ?
- A radio monitors ...

356
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,161
perceived ... the end of the message.

357
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:27,041
Colonel General von Salmuth has set
the whole army on alert in Calais.

358
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,721
Should I alert the seventh in Normandy ?

359
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:33,481
Call Rundstedts staff .
Let them decide.

360
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,561
So here we go ...

361
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:43,641
It's probably just the usual hysteria .

362
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,721
NORMANDY
6 JUNI 1944 , 01:00

363
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:51,841
There they are. I knew it.

364
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:57,321
Notify Rommel's staff
it starts now.

365
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:16,441
- What is the situation in Calais ?
- The country set there too.

366
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:22,241
With cargo glider . The two prisoners
there will be more land subsidence .

367
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:25,401
We can send 21 to Normandy.

368
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:33,241
Commander of the 21st unresponsive.
He is in Paris with his chief of staff.

369
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,721
- What ?
- General Speidel . Phone .

370
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:41,321
Yes ?

371
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:47,521
Roger that. Very good . Thank you.
And happy birthday , sir.

372
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:53,081
It was Marcks .
The British are attacking with straw dolls.

373
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:58,521
But he thinks he can handle it
on their own.

374
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:05,401
- What do we do now ?
- Yes, what? We go to bed.

375
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:13,241
Normandy, 06:00

376
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:18,201
ONLY ON THE LIGHT OF WINDOW
AND DOORS ARE CLOSED

377
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:22,281
E ARMY Karens PICKET

378
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:40,801
British sjöartilleri .
Churchill happy birthday .

379
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:51,561
OMAHA BEACH
NORMANDY , 06:30

380
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:18,321
Rommel HOME
In MEN LINGEN , 09:00

381
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:32,921
Armed Forces ordered me to deliver
these flowers to your wife.

382
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:36,441
With heartfelt congratulations
from Führer .

383
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:50,321
Take good care of them , Karolina .
They are from the Führer.

384
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:58,441
Commander Loistl , Army Group B.

385
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:01,441
Sure . Just a moment .

386
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:11,721
You have a telephone, Field Marshal .

387
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,961
It must be Fuhrer headquarters.

388
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,561
Yes ? Speidel ? What gives?

389
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:28,881
Have they landed ? Where?
How does our counterattack ?

390
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:34,961
Let division attack directly .
Do not wait for reinforcements. Seizures.

391
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:53,681
- I'm sorry.
- It can not be helped.

392
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:57,481
- Now, in all cases the waiting over .
- Yes.

393
00:39:59,761 --> 00:40:03,081
Take care, Lu . Take care.

394
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:32,601
They do not fit , Karolina .

395
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:36,721
Rommel HEADQUARTERS ,
22:30

396
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,561
We are the General Staff of the bunker.

397
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:53,601
I hope it looks better now.

398
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:59,041
The enemy has already landed
150,000 heavily armed soldiers.

399
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:04,761
They control 130 square kilometers.
British 6th Airborne Division -

400
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:08,041
- Have taken the bridge over the Orne .

401
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:14,361
They also crushed our artillery
Merville , albeit with heavy losses .

402
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:19,121
- Is that all?
- The information is scarce.

403
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:22,001
Radio traffic disturbed by the enemy.

404
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:27,121
The French have sabotaged
telephone lines and roads maintenance .

405
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:31,081
We must expect
a second major offensive .

406
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:34,281
They have darkened the coast at Dover.

407
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:39,201
Say it out loud , Speidel .
You have failed .

408
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:50,041
Fuhrer HEADQUARTERS
In MARGIVAL , 17 JUNI 1944

409
00:42:01,681 --> 00:42:05,041
Field Marshal Erna von Rundstedt
and Rommel .

410
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:15,441
Thanks for coming .
Go ahead and sit down.

411
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:26,681
I must say I am speechless over
your local masters failures.

412
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:30,441
The armed forces were taken by surprise
with his pants down .

413
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:33,921
That says a lot
about the condition of your soldiers .

414
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:37,241
That's the enemy propaganda.

415
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:41,401
Call it what you want.
But the landing was not hindered .

416
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:46,761
- What you assured would happen.
- The forces fighting sacrificing.

417
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:53,001
That we could not prevent the invasion
is anti-aircraft and naval wrong.

418
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:57,481
The Army has made ??a superhuman effort
in an unequal battle.

419
00:42:57,481 --> 00:43:02,401
But the enemy's superiority in the air
and that their fleet had to work undisturbed

420
00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:06,761
- Made it impossible
to fight the enemy as planned.

421
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:15,081
It is unfortunate that no ... for over -
command knew the situation at the front.

422
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:19,121
Instead
believed in the enemy's propaganda.

423
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:24,961
It is crucial to maintain Cherbourg .
If not, take the enemy Normandy

424
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:28,001
- And maybe all of France.

425
00:43:31,681 --> 00:43:38,681
We must choose between keeping ...
Cherbourg ... and to prevent the enemy .

426
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:41,401
We can not do both.

427
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:44,761
Do you have the same opinion , von Rundstedt ?

428
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:49,201
We must give up the rigid system
by Peninsula

429
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:54,641
- And embark on an orderly retreat
to the port and fortress .

430
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:59,121
And at Caen, in front of Orne,
we should avoid ...

431
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:04,761
We will not know anything! It applies
to stand up, hold on and die!

432
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:09,241
Designate a particular skilled commander
Cherbourg .

433
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:15,721
Show field groomsmen how devastating
our retaliation is the enemy.

434
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:25,441
Since yesterday , we have continually fired
V1 missiles against London.

435
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:28,681
All bar one ton of explosives .

436
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:31,641
We have received many great hits .

437
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:37,481
According to our agents can handle civil
population not much more, and ...

438
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:41,481
A hostile bomb dressing
approaching our airspace .

439
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:48,001
My Führer , we should probably
go to the shelter.

440
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:09,361
And now ? We need to tell
that the situation is hopeless.

441
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:13,401
- He only listens to you.
- You are the commander in chief in the West.

442
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:18,761
My power is just enough to move
my guards from left to right.

443
00:45:37,841 --> 00:45:42,561
My Führer , you know
I am your faithful servant.

444
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:45,961
- Can I ?
- Have a seat .

445
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,041
Do not you think ...

446
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:06,001
... it's time
to consider other options?

447
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:15,241
- What do you mean?
- To negotiate .

448
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:23,361
No longer want to negotiate with me.

449
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:27,161
The enemy thinks obliterate Germany.

450
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:32,801
Now we only have each individual
fanatical resistance.

451
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:36,201
Are you prepared for that?

452
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:40,961
Are you prepared for it, Rommel ?

453
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:43,841
Yes.

454
00:46:55,961 --> 00:47:00,881
" Where knowledge and ability ends
and intuition takes over " -

455
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:05,601
- " In the sensory perception ability
and inspiration " -

456
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:10,401
- "Are general's leadership.
It possesses Rommel . "

457
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:13,281
You certainly amuses you .

458
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:17,961
- General Field Marshal .
- Good criticism?

459
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,201
Here you are.

460
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:27,601
Fuehrer wants to keep Cherbourg .

461
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:30,321
And stand west of the Orne .

462
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:34,081
Begin the necessary preparations ,
Speidel .

463
00:47:34,081 --> 00:47:38,201
Can General Marcks do
a diversion ?

464
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:42,321
General Marcks killed
in a hostile air attack .

465
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:49,601
Do you want today's total loss figures?

466
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:53,641
No, it is not necessary.

467
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:56,801
Gentlemen .

468
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:13,641
GERMAN POSITION NEAR CAEN
20 JUNI 1944

469
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:25,521
Once you have taken the height , you protect
road to Bayeux. Best of luck.

470
00:48:25,521 --> 00:48:27,961
Thank you, Field Marshal .

471
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:36,361
- Let the Brits have a fiery !
- Yes, Field Marshal !

472
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:38,361
Good .

473
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:45,161
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Field Marshal .

474
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:23,601
- Back , Daniel. We must return.
- It is madness . We must here .

475
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:26,361
Oh well ...

476
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:32,161
Well, Daniel. Run.

477
00:50:07,561 --> 00:50:11,641
Who's there?
Come forward . Hello?

478
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:15,121
<i> Bonsoir . < / i ></i>

479
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:18,961
Sorry. It was not supposed
to scare you.

480
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:23,921
- What are the Countess this?
- I often come here . It's beautiful.

481
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:29,081
Our soldiers may think you are
partisan, or British agent .

482
00:50:29,081 --> 00:50:33,521
- Maybe I am.
- Then I might look up.

483
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:38,441
- I would be a great trophy for the British.
- Yes. Desert Fox .

484
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:45,441
Long time no see . Now I am only he
who could not stop the invasion .

485
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:50,121
- I'm sorry you do it?
- I am a soldier. Do not forget it .

486
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:58,281
I 'll tell the men
that you are walking around up here.

487
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:05,041
<i> Dear Lu . I'm fine . </ I></i>

488
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:10,121
<i> I must not lose heart .
Although much hope has been dashed . </ I></i>

489
00:51:10,121 --> 00:51:12,081
Yes ?

490
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:19,481
The Russians have broken through
Army Group Mitte.

491
00:51:19,481 --> 00:51:24,281
Seven German divisions have surrendered.
The front is in dissolution .

492
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:34,321
It's probably out of the east.

493
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:36,921
Yes.

494
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:40,161
It will be nice when next week is over.

495
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,841
There was one more thing.

496
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:02,961
- Where is it?
- Småstaden Oradour , near Limoges .

497
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:07,241
a SS- Panzer division
leveled it to the ground.

498
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:12,081
All residents were killed ...
which 450 women and children.

499
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:17,241
- Revenge of the abducted SS officer .
- How do you know this?

500
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:22,121
Army management .
Stülpnagel have already protested.

501
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:27,841
Hitler has banned the responsible
officer successor to justice.

502
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:31,321
Really?

503
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:43,641
Good night.

504
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:53,281
Good night.

505
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:06,761
Poor bastards . Mom said I should
thank God that I ended up with you.

506
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:10,721
- Why?
- With you , nothing can happen to me.

507
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:53,041
The new quartermaster ,
Colonel Finckh , has come now.

508
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:57,561
- He wants to present itself .
- Good, I will soon.

509
00:53:57,561 --> 00:54:00,801
- Field Marshal ...
- What is it?

510
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:08,961
Führer want you to do a dissipative
attacks against Americans in Cherbourg .

511
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:12,721
He wants to 7th Army, advancing
on the west flank.

512
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:19,201
Explain that we are only able to keep
our defense line in western Normandy.

513
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:22,401
The front is inappropriate for an attack.

514
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:31,441
Today telephoned General Marcks brother.

515
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:35,841
He wanted to know exactly to the minute
when the general died .

516
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:37,361
Why ?

517
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:42,521
At 11 o'clock that day fell general's
photo down from the wall of his brother.

518
00:54:42,521 --> 00:54:46,321
- And ?
- General met ten forty-five .

519
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:51,001
- Exactly 11 , he died . Unbelievable, huh ?
- Do you believe in miracles ?

520
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:55,681
It just makes Hitler. LEASTWAYS
what the course of the war .

521
00:54:55,681 --> 00:55:01,641
"Do not say bridgehead , but the last part
of France as the enemy occupying. "

522
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:06,641
Cherbourg fall within three days.

523
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:11,481
Within four weeks of the enemy breaks through
and storms to the Reich frontier .

524
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:16,761
We can only pray that the Allies
is faster than the Russians.

525
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:24,441
- You are not alone in thinking so .
- I think everyone here agrees .

526
00:55:25,481 --> 00:55:28,561
Not true, Dr. Speidel ?

527
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:36,361
Hitler is furious. He can not
draw conclusions or make decisions.

528
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:41,521
Just saying : "To the last man ,"
gives nothing , except a disaster.

529
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:46,561
The idea of ??an attack on Cherbourg
is pure idiocy .

530
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:54,441
You 're the only ELIGIBLE Germany .
To end the war .

531
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:59,041
- There are others who are for war.
- Then it is they who must be shot .

532
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,881
If it is not possible otherwise .

533
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:06,281
Good God, Speidel .
You 're a true warrior .

534
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,721
<i> Battle of Cherbourg , </ i ></i>

535
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:14,321
<i> - the enemy has devastated
large parts of the city ... </ i></i>

536
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:20,521
<i> On the odd factories and bases
fluttering banner of resistance yet . </ i></i>

537
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:28,121

on city streets. </ i></i>

Rommel HEADQUARTERS
25 JUNI 1944

539
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:38,561
From General von Schlieben :
" The final battle of Cherbourg . "

540
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:42,721
" We attacked with tanks.
Where is fly in aid? "

541
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:49,561
" Flight Over The aid can not
penetrate hostile roadblocks . "

542
00:56:49,561 --> 00:56:55,241
" The Fuhrer's orders , you shall fight
to the last bullet . May God be with you. "

543
00:56:55,241 --> 00:57:00,921
Fuhrer's orders were to the last man .
Should you really undermine it?

544
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:06,761
- Male or bullet, what is the difference?
- Kula means surrender, not dead.

545
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:12,681
I hope that the general interpretation of the
just like that.

546
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:28,841
<i> Armed Forces in Cherbourg entered
in the German hero story , </ i ></i>

547
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:31,601
<i> - and made ??himself immortal . </ i></i>

548
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:34,801
<i> In large bunkers , there were men , </ i ></i>

549
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:39,321
<i> - which had been bricked in , and defended
through portholes . </ i></i>

550
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:44,961
<i> They did run out of their last bullets
and then blew themselves up in the air. </ i></i>

551
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:50,481
<i> If a nation at war five years , </ i ></i>

552
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:53,761
<i> - can perform such acts ... </ i></i>

553
00:57:58,081 --> 00:58:02,161
- Are you sure? He travels to Germany?
- Yes.

554
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:05,081
He was directed to Obersalzberg .

555
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:09,601
How can you be so well informed ,
Duchess ?

556
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:12,721
I take care of my job. Did you shoot yours.

557
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:15,721
Do you really want me to do this ?

558
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:22,241
Thank you.

559
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:50,641
You do realize headquarters seeking
a scapegoat for Cherbourg case?

560
00:58:50,641 --> 00:58:55,561
- You or me.
- I declare that the war should end .

561
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:59,961
- The whole world is clearly against us.
- What would you have me do?

562
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:04,401
- That you do not remain silent . Stay with me.
- You are right .

563
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:06,921
We sacrifice both of us.

564
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:19,561
He will give way again .
Just wait .

565
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:23,401
Obersalzberg
29 JUNI 1944

566
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,761
It's six o'clock . They let us wait.

567
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:45,281
Are you here von Kluge ? How nice that you
recovered you so quickly after the accident.

568
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:49,961
Thank you. Führer asked me to assess
the situation in the East.

569
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:56,481
Excuse me,
but my plane to Berlin waiting.

570
00:59:58,601 --> 01:00:01,241
<i> Attention on deck . Look ahead . </ I></i>

571
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:17,161
Make your statement .

572
01:00:29,401 --> 01:00:34,161
My Führer , I'm here
as commander of Army Group B.

573
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:38,361
It's probably the last chance I have -

574
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:44,321
- To describe the situation on the western front
for those of you who are responsible for the people.

575
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:50,441
- I'll start with the political situation .
- You manifest your only in military affairs.

576
01:00:50,441 --> 01:00:55,001
My responsibility towards Germany
forcing me into it .

577
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:59,481
I did not ask for your personal opinion
about world politics.

578
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:03,401
Please adhere solely to the purely military .

579
01:01:03,401 --> 01:01:08,241
You know how disappointed I am
that you did not manage -

580
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:14,401
- To attack the Cotentin Peninsula .
Cherbourg had not had to fall.

581
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:19,321
The side with the best maintenance roads
always win battles .

582
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:24,001
Montgomery maintenance pathways
was more vulnerable than yours.

583
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:30,121
But the advantage you lost
because you were so hesitant .

584
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:34,441
Now we have to lock the British in Caen,
implement a counterattack -

585
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:37,801
- And let the enemy bleed to death in Normandy.

586
01:01:39,121 --> 01:01:43,721
National Secretary ,
you get the generals' reports .

587
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:50,721
Question Hauser or Dietrich .
They know how hopeless the situation is.

588
01:01:54,321 --> 01:02:00,281
Mein Führer , I can not go from here
without having talked about Germany with you.

589
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:02,761
Can we talk privately ?

590
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:07,201
It's probably best that you leave the room.

591
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:44,961
Should we stay at your house in Mr Lingen ?

592
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:49,081
<i> ... where we are . And we do not give
after an inch without a fight. </ i></i>

593
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:52,761
<i> And if we do that ,
we turn back now! </ i></i>

594
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:56,201
<i> We are so happy
we know since yesterday </ i ></i>

595
01:02:56,201 --> 01:03:00,361
<i> - that our Colonel-General Rommel ... </ i></i>

596
01:03:13,641 --> 01:03:19,641
General Field Marshal ? Should we stay
at your home in Mr Lingen ?

597
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:39,321
I see you again?

598
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:57,521
Take care of your mother, Manfred.

600
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:28,321
- Well, Speidel ?
- The front remains.

601
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:30,121
For a while , yes.

602
01:04:36,881 --> 01:04:39,721
I am under no illusions, Speidel .

603
01:04:40,761 --> 01:04:44,721
- Next time it will be me.
- Rundstedt , then?

604
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:50,001
Just as weak as ever.

605
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:54,041
He'll follow orders ,
regardless of how they are corked .

606
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:58,881
- All the facts are clear .
- Hitler did not care. He doubt ...

607
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:03,481
... the enemy's superiority in the air
and devastating sjöartilleri -

608
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:06,401
- As well as our maintenance problems .

609
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:10,361
He does not believe us ,
but we should believe him.

610
01:05:10,361 --> 01:05:13,241
I simply say : " V -1".

611
01:05:14,361 --> 01:05:17,281
Field Marshal ...

612
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:22,641
Leave your command .
It will take effect in the people.

613
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:28,001
- You're still our most popular soldier.
- Those at the top do not allow it .

614
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:35,681
They expect probably that I
'll die a heroic death ... at the front.

615
01:05:37,881 --> 01:05:40,481
But I can help a little .

616
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:45,721
My family is prepared for it.

617
01:05:53,481 --> 01:06:00,481
You must take care of him. He is
soldier dog. He will never be more civil .

618
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,361
It is certainly the .

619
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:11,281
Rommel . Yes ?

620
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:21,481
I see.
Thank you for informing me .

621
01:06:21,481 --> 01:06:25,121
Rundstedt receive the Knight's Cross
and leave office .

622
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,321
And you?

623
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:32,201
- I remain.
- As Rundstedts substitute?

624
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:37,281
No, Field Marshal Kluge
becomes the new commander in chief in the West.

625
01:06:37,281 --> 01:06:39,921
<i> Right on ! </ i></i>

626
01:06:39,921 --> 01:06:43,161
Rommel HEADQUARTERS
3 JULI 1944

627
01:06:44,761 --> 01:06:48,801
- How are you, Speidel ?
- Good . And you?

628
01:06:48,801 --> 01:06:54,761
The British attack with great force.
It takes great manpower to hold out .

629
01:06:54,761 --> 01:07:00,361
We need them in Saint -Lô, to
prevent Americans breakthrough.

630
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:03,961
We abandon neither Caen
or bridgehead .

631
01:07:03,961 --> 01:07:08,681
We do not give an inch without a fight.
Führer's orders are clear.

632
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:13,721
Fuhrer not aware mode .
The order to hold out is devastating.

633
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:18,041
From now , you are getting , and everyone else,
get used to execute orders.

634
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:24,121
- What do you mean?
- You tend to ignore your superiors ...

635
01:07:24,121 --> 01:07:27,001
... and run to the Führer instead.

636
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:36,041
Gentlemen, leave me alone
with Field Marshal awhile.

637
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:50,081
You have apparently forgotten
I am Field Marshal .

638
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:54,361
I want reports
from all masters on the front.

639
01:07:54,361 --> 01:08:01,081
And statistics on the enemy naval
range artillery and ammunition.

640
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:07,681
Go to the front! Then you can see for yourself
the hostile sjöartilleriets force.

641
01:08:08,841 --> 01:08:13,321
It is noticeable
you most have led a division .

642
01:08:17,801 --> 01:08:21,241
And you have not fought
against the British.

643
01:08:21,241 --> 01:08:24,881
Heavy weapons , armor
and artillery stationed -

644
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:29,081
- Beyond the hostile sjöartilleriets
range.

645
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:35,321
Artillery at Cagny and Émiéville .
And behind those tanks.

646
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:38,961
To keep the enemy occupied.

647
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:43,161
- How long ?
- In the best case , three weeks.

648
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:46,761
Until they break through.
So we have three weeks.

649
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:50,881
- For what?
- To find other solutions.

650
01:09:08,521 --> 01:09:11,721
- Field Marshal .
- What ? I'm dead tired .

651
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:16,081
Do you remember Colonel von Hofacker ?
In Stülpnagels staff .

652
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:20,521
- He wants to talk to you. Tomorrow .
- About what?

653
01:09:20,521 --> 01:09:24,641
I am here on my cousin's behalf;
Count von Stauffenberg .

654
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:29,161
You might know that he now
manage the reserve army ?

655
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:32,961
Yes. Has he recovered
from their injuries ?

656
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:36,041
As much as possible , yes.

657
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:48,161
He wants your assessment
the war situation in the West.

658
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:51,641
It should also reserve army know.

659
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:57,521
How long ?

660
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:03,441
Three weeks. Max six .
Unless miracles happen .

661
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:06,761
Do you think that the war is lost?

662
01:10:06,761 --> 01:10:10,321
What you really want me ?

663
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:13,881
- Will you stand to Germany's favor?
- I do.

664
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:17,961
Another Germany.
With another government.

665
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,761
Put your hands .

666
01:10:32,801 --> 01:10:36,881
- Halt! Stay there .
- Put your hands up ! Do not move .

667
01:10:42,921 --> 01:10:44,961

673
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:18,761
General Field Marshal Rommel !

674
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:26,281
I have read your progress .

675
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:30,801
- And ?
- I apologize .

676
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:35,801
I tell the Fuhrer I look
as seriously as you state .

677
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:42,241
The Americans soon break through.
In some areas , all men dead.

678
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:47,561
- Just tell me is no longer enough .
- What do you suggest?

679
01:11:47,561 --> 01:11:52,641
The Fuhrer would negotiate peace .
Otherwise , we open the front.

680
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:57,281
- Would you give Hitler an ultimatum ?
- Call it what you want.

681
01:11:57,281 --> 01:12:02,001
I give him one last chance .
If he does not , I act .

682
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:06,241
- Can I count on you ?
- Do you not hope .

683
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:11,761
- Hitler allow themselves to be impressed .
- We still have an obligation to act.

684
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:16,641
Do you accept that my chief of staff
writing this to Hitler?

685
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:25,241
First, we consult with the commanders ,
especially SS Generals .

686
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:30,641
- Without them you can not .
- I will send them my intentions .

687
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:49,441
- Does he or does he not ?
- What ?

688
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:53,241
That one is planning a coup d'etat in Berlin.

689
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:58,121
- How do you know?
- General Speidel said.

690
01:12:58,121 --> 01:13:04,041
He insinuated that for me.
Although your name was mentioned then.

691
01:13:06,641 --> 01:13:08,481
I know nothing .

692
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:13,921
Position the front worsens by the day .
97,000 man has been killed ...

693
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:18,361
Although troop material losses
are unusually high -

694
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:21,201
- And have only partially replaced .

695
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:24,681
... of which 2,360 officers.

696
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:28,641
That means , on average,
2500 to 3000 to ...

697
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:30,641
A total of about 10 000 men.

698
01:13:30,641 --> 01:13:35,041
As the fighting has shown ,
will the hostile stake -

699
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:39,041
- That part of crush
even the bravest of troops -

700
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:43,081
- Leading to loss of
people , weapons and ...

701
01:13:44,121 --> 01:13:45,721
We have problems .

702
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:51,401
- Heil Hitler, Obersturmbannführer !
- Heil Hitler.

703
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:56,241
- Heil Hitler !
- What do I owe the honor ?

704
01:13:56,241 --> 01:14:00,521
- A French saboteur is hiding here.
- In my headquarters ?

705
01:14:00,521 --> 01:14:03,521
Countess . Count nephews.

706
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:08,281
Count's family has my protection .
Who maintains it?

707
01:14:08,281 --> 01:14:13,721
We grabbed a British agent yesterday.
He has unequivocally pointed to her.

708
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:17,921
- You must be kidding.
- I understand that news shocks you.

709
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:22,001
But you should be grateful.

710
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:24,881
They had planned to assassinate you.

711
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:29,521
Stand species Fuhrer .
This teaches interest you.

712
01:14:50,401 --> 01:14:53,721
I guess it does not
the army group's radio.

713
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:59,361
- SS has gripped the people of the village.
- The Countess ?

714
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,201
No.

715
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:05,641
Where did we ?

716
01:15:05,641 --> 01:15:09,521
" The troops are fighting heroically all over. "

717
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:15,521
... but still approaching
the uneven battle ... an end.

718
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:23,641
According to me it is necessary ... to draw
political conclusions from the situation .

719
01:15:23,641 --> 01:15:28,521
"According to me it is necessary to draw
political conclusions from the situation . "

720
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:32,481
- Should you send it?
- You are right . It's too risky .

721
01:15:32,481 --> 01:15:34,961
I talk to him.

722
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:37,801
We want to have peace negotiations.

723
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:44,001
" Politics " is a loaded word for Hitler.
He believes that Providence rescues him .

724
01:15:44,001 --> 01:15:49,281
- Delete the word "political" .
- Good . I'm sending it to Kluge today.

725
01:15:50,961 --> 01:15:53,801
- Field Marshal ...
- What is it now, when ?

726
01:15:55,321 --> 01:15:58,161
How much told von Hofacker ?

727
01:15:58,161 --> 01:16:02,041
- What do you mean?
- Initiate he s in the plans ?

728
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:06,961
He asked if I could think of
a new state and military power. Plans ?

729
01:16:06,961 --> 01:16:12,121
I do not know . Only a small circle
know how the coup designed.

730
01:16:12,121 --> 01:16:16,681
If you prosecute Hitler , I'm with .
But I support no attacks.

731
01:16:16,681 --> 01:16:20,121
There I have not changed my mind , General.

732
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:22,841
PARIS
16 JULI 1944

733
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:41,481
He knows nothing about the attack .
Hofacker said nothing about it.

734
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:44,441
He believes that we should prosecute Hitler.

735
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:49,881
Hofacker said Rommel stood
available to the peace negotiations.

736
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:55,401
For peace negotiations.
Not for an attack .

737
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:58,561
He must realize that it will be violent .

738
01:16:58,561 --> 01:17:02,201
" Fierce " does not murder.

739
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,521
Gentlemen ...

740
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:12,721
We may not be made ??for it, but
it must be done . With or without Rommel .

741
01:17:12,721 --> 01:17:17,041
- Hitler faced with an ultimatum .
- What ? !

742
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:25,361
Does he not agree to peace negotiations ,
opens Rommel and Kluge front.

743
01:17:25,361 --> 01:17:30,481
When Hitler may ultimatum
depositing he Rommel . Or worse.

744
01:17:30,481 --> 01:17:34,521
- We risk Valkyrias success.
- " Valkyrie " ?

745
01:17:36,161 --> 01:17:43,001
Stauffenberg's people have a plan, if
national emergency imposed.

746
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:48,041
Reserve Army takes over power
the Interior.

747
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:52,201
the condition is
an attempt on Hitler.

748
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:58,441
As plotters appears
not as authors ?

749
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:03,281
No. It will appear as a coup
of party members and SS.

750
01:18:03,281 --> 01:18:07,921
The plan enables all departments,
though they are not involved.

751
01:18:07,921 --> 01:18:14,521
They act according to the emergency plan
Hitler himself has blessed .

752
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:18,281
We just need a reason
to enable it.

753
01:18:18,281 --> 01:18:21,201
- Ingenious .
- The front is the only uncertain.

754
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:27,881
Just because we contacted Rommel .
The soldiers respect him enormously.

755
01:18:27,881 --> 01:18:31,961
- Should he just be propaganda ?
- Rommel factor .

756
01:18:31,961 --> 01:18:37,161
- Goebbels made ??him a folk hero.
- That we use now.

757
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:42,001
Now you have a unique opportunity
to make people a really great service.

758
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:45,121
It is marshal
certainly aware .

759
01:18:49,961 --> 01:18:52,441
Yes ?

760
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:56,241
- General Field Marshal .
- Good morning. Something new ?

761
01:18:56,241 --> 01:19:00,001
according Aldinger
go ye to Dietrich today.

762
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:04,401
- Yes, to the front in Caen.
- Should you discuss your plans?

763
01:19:04,401 --> 01:19:06,241
Of course .

764
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:10,321
He is an inveterate National Socialist .
He tells SS.

765
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:14,041
I know who he is,
but we have no choice.

766
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:17,881
- Otherwise, the Waffen -SS war.
- Why not ...

767
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:23,441
- ... Tell Himmler and Goebbels ?
- Dietrich is experienced . He understands .

768
01:19:26,321 --> 01:19:32,001
Greve Schwerin armor division
is prepared to disarm the SS.

769
01:19:33,241 --> 01:19:38,121
- Determines I still here? !
- Of course .

770
01:19:39,161 --> 01:19:42,961
The enemy is still in the West,
do not forget it .

771
01:19:47,201 --> 01:19:51,601
NORMANDY , THE ROAD TO livarot
17 JULI 1944

772
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:10,441
- Did you see the people? What was it?
- Respect ?

773
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:13,681
No, fear.
They do not know what to expect.

774
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:17,281
- What do you think?
- That we become a British colony.

775
01:20:17,281 --> 01:20:22,241
- And not a part of Stalin's Bolshevism.
- Enemy Plan! Eight.

776
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:23,721
Give it here .

777
01:20:29,721 --> 01:20:33,921
Do you see the way there?
Attempts to reach the forest. Quick!

778
01:20:33,921 --> 01:20:36,521
Hurry up! Accelerate !

779
01:21:09,321 --> 01:21:11,761
Field Marshal !

780
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:20,161
Field Marshal .

781
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:26,241
Help me! Hurry up!

782
01:21:27,561 --> 01:21:30,001
Hurry up! Come on .

PARIS
Kluges HEADQUARTERS

784
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:50,481
Blumentritt .

785
01:21:50,481 --> 01:21:53,601
Just a moment . - Field Marshal ?

786
01:21:53,601 --> 01:21:56,801
- Yes ?
- General Speidel .

787
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:03,161
Yes, Kluge here.

788
01:22:07,961 --> 01:22:10,081
Yes. Roger that.

789
01:22:10,081 --> 01:22:13,561
No, I tell the high command .

790
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,801
Blumentritt .

791
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:24,441
Rommel is badly wounded.
They do not know if he survives .

792
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:29,041
- It was taken only it!
- Call up the command.

793
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:36,241
What happened to Rommel's letter ?
Have we sent it to the Führer than ?

794
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:40,241
- No, you wanted to add it .
- Well, yes ...

795
01:22:40,241 --> 01:22:42,721
Archive it for so long.

796
01:22:48,401 --> 01:22:53,281
He has a skull fracture . it is
a miracle that he survived the night .

797
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:59,521
The Führer has given me the command here ,
until Rommel has recovered .

798
01:23:00,401 --> 01:23:06,001
- Can I count on your support, Speidel ?
- Of course .

799
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:10,281
I set up my fighter place
here in the castle.

800
01:23:10,281 --> 01:23:13,121
When I reach the front faster.

801
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:17,161
- Blumentritt replace me in Paris.
- Of course .

802
01:23:17,161 --> 01:23:19,841
That's all for now.

803
01:23:23,121 --> 01:23:29,001
Yeah, right ... Since this morning , attacking
our enemy positions in Caen.

804
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:41,801
The bombing was the 16th anti-aircraft
and 272 text Infantry Division -

805
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:45,121
- Which was along the front , totally obliterated .

806
01:23:47,641 --> 01:23:51,321
- Keeps the front stalls ?
- So far .

807
01:23:53,401 --> 01:23:55,921
What about Daniel?

808
01:23:57,441 --> 01:23:59,681
He's dead.

809
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:03,241
He did not .
He died in the night.

810
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:10,081
- You have received a telegram from the Führer.
- Well ...

811
01:24:11,641 --> 01:24:17,441
"My best wishes
for a speedy recovery . "

812
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:21,121
- Signed by Adolf Hitler.
- That's it?

813
01:24:21,121 --> 01:24:23,441
Yes, Field Marshal .

814
01:24:24,961 --> 01:24:32,201
Stauffenberg is still set to it .
He flies to headquarters tomorrow.

815
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:37,761
Kluge has moved
th Panzer division to the front.

816
01:24:37,761 --> 01:24:42,921
- Now we can no longer stop the SS.
- We hope to Kluge .

817
01:24:42,921 --> 01:24:47,161
How's ultimatum ?
Have high command responded ?

818
01:24:47,161 --> 01:24:52,281
- It no longer refers to the ultimatum .
- Has not been sent yet?

819
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:59,641
Kluge has been informed long .
He has met with the conspirators .

820
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:05,321
I do not think he is ready to
peace negotiations with the Allies.

821
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:09,681
- There will be no negotiations , General.
- Why not ?

822
01:25:09,681 --> 01:25:17,161
The Allies accept a surrender
Only if we give up even in the East.

823
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:20,201
What does that mean?

824
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:26,081
The fact that we show the world that we dare
revolt against these criminals .

825
01:25:37,561 --> 01:25:40,401
General!

826
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,601
Countess ? What are you doing here?

827
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:51,001
The hotel interests my colleagues.
And Rommel stabsbil falls in the eye.

828
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:53,761
How is the field marshal ?

829
01:25:57,521 --> 01:25:59,961
I can betray you.

830
01:26:01,801 --> 01:26:05,801
SS has taken hostages in the village.
I should surrender myself .

831
01:26:05,801 --> 01:26:09,641
Some of them are children.
Can you do something ?

832
01:26:10,681 --> 01:26:15,801
- Unfortunately, I have no influence.
- I understand . Best of luck.

833
01:26:17,321 --> 01:26:19,681
What will you do ?

834
01:26:21,481 --> 01:26:25,121
- I will surrender myself .
- Do not do it .

835
01:26:25,121 --> 01:26:29,321
- Things are changing faster than you think.
- Really?

836
01:26:30,241 --> 01:26:33,241
One should never give up hope.

An attempt on the Führer.
He's dead.

Witzleben and Beck
has formed an interim government .

Who told you that ?

Our military commander , Stülpnagel .

859

SS and Gestapo carried out
a coup in Berlin.

860
01:28:55,521 --> 01:28:57,601
The Führer is dead.

861
01:28:57,601 --> 01:29:02,401
All of the security in Paris

Field Marshal von Kluge wants to meet you
the battle command center at 20.

867
01:29:26,121 --> 01:29:29,681
An important meeting. Thank you.

- What did he say?
- That he will .

869

Yes!
What is it?

870
01:29:41,761 --> 01:29:46,241
A remote- written message
from Field Marshal Keitel .

871
01:29:46,241 --> 01:29:50,601
- What does he ?
- To Hitler alive.

872
01:29:54,081 --> 01:29:57,721
Find out the truth .
It must go.

873
01:29:57,721 --> 01:29:59,921
Sure .

874
01:30:02,401 --> 01:30:07,361
Tell me, Speidel ...
Did you and Rommel about this?

875
01:30:11,121 --> 01:30:12,801
No.

20:30

881
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:38,121
- What now , sir ?
- We are here to arrest you.

882
01:30:38,121 --> 01:30:42,001
- In general Stülpnagels orders.
- Excuse me?

Rommel HEADQUARTERS ,
20:40

886
01:31:29,081 --> 01:31:35,041
Now that the Führer is dead, we must
make decisions. What will you do ?

887
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:38,321
Settle down , gentlemen.

888
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:45,201
My lords ,
We have received conflicting information .

889
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:50,681
Half an hour ago I spoke
the phone with General Stief .

890
01:31:50,681 --> 01:31:53,001
He is currently at Mamry -

891
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:58,961
- And have talked to some officers
who left the Wolf's Lair today.

892
01:31:58,961 --> 01:32:03,161
They say
Hitler survived the bomb attack .

893
01:32:06,841 --> 01:32:10,441
What takes place in Berlin
is not conclusive.

894
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:15,121
The decisions made here in France
is very important.

895
01:32:15,121 --> 01:32:22,121
For Germany's future sake, abandon
Hitler and suffered the liberation of the West.

896
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:27,721
Make the Field Marshal Rommel had
done - put an end to the bloody murders.

897
01:32:27,721 --> 01:32:33,521
Do not end even worse. Prevent
German history's worst disaster.

898
01:32:34,761 --> 01:32:37,641
Yes ? Just a moment .

899
01:32:38,681 --> 01:32:42,081
General Warlimont ,
the Führer's headquarters.

900

The Kluge .

901
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:50,681
Roger that. I am very relieved.

902
01:32:54,601 --> 01:32:59,521
General Warlimont state
that the Führer is the best of health .

903
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:03,241
The attack failed , that is.

904
01:33:03,241 --> 01:33:10,521
- But , I thought you knew.
- No ... I had no idea.

905
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:15,001
Gentlemen, dinner is served .

906
01:33:24,361 --> 01:33:27,201
Yes. Make gentlemen.

907
01:33:31,801 --> 01:33:36,241
- Field Marshal , I need to talk to you.
- Are we ready?

908
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:41,081
What ? !

909
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:45,761
The entire security
and group Führer Oberg be arrested .

910
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:50,121
Or have already been arrested.
On Stülpnagels orders.

911
01:33:50,121 --> 01:33:55,681
He did it without consulting any
or inform their commander in chief.

912
01:33:55,681 --> 01:33:59,281
It's arbitrary conduct
unprecedented !

913
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:07,081
Refer to
that the order is immediately withdrawn .

914
01:34:07,081 --> 01:34:10,321
The facts speak for themselves.

915
01:34:10,321 --> 01:34:13,361
Your word and your honor is in danger.

916
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:17,481
Army's honor and the fate of millions
is in your hands .

917
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:27,001
Well ... if the pig had died , so ...

918
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:45,201
If I were you ,
I would try to escape as civilian.

919
01:34:45,201 --> 01:34:47,881
Try to jump off .

920
01:34:55,761 --> 01:35:02,361
<i> A little dab ambitious , unscrupulous
foolish and criminal officers , </ i ></i>

921
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:08,761
<i> - forged a plot to eliminate
me and the leadership of the armed forces. </ i></i>

922
01:35:08,761 --> 01:35:14,241
<i> The bomb was placed out of Stauffenberg
and exploded two meters away from me. </ i></i>

923
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:18,561
<i> injured many
of my co-workers difficult. One died. < / I ></i>

924
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:23,841

a shake of the hand, a few scratches ... </ i></i>

925
01:35:37,321 --> 01:35:40,681
A ROAD NEAR VERDUN ,
21 JULI 1944

926
01:35:55,121 --> 01:36:00,241
I go to the lake. I must go
on the legs. Hold at the next intersection .

927
01:36:40,201 --> 01:36:43,041
- A cigarette ?
- Yes , thank you.

928
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:08,121
Where were you , Rommel ?
Where have you been?

929
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:10,761
It has been mentioned name .

930
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:16,401
The name Rommel was among them.

931
01:37:27,561 --> 01:37:33,001
Thank you for coming , sir.
But everything is already settled.

932
01:37:33,001 --> 01:37:36,681
I take full responsibility
for revolt here in Paris.

933
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:40,121
Just Stülpnagel and I was initiated.

934
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:43,561
All the others were unaware .

935
01:37:43,561 --> 01:37:47,481
I apologize .
But I have no regrets .

936
01:37:49,361 --> 01:37:52,041
Names mentioned . Even yours.

937
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:57,201
It is enough if one call
you had with Hofacker July 9.

938
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:02,041
I do not remember .

939
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:14,921
It may not be incriminating .

940
01:38:14,921 --> 01:38:20,641
You were asked about your assessment
of state ... and you gave an honest answer .

941
01:38:24,681 --> 01:38:27,521
How does it look on the front?

942
01:38:27,521 --> 01:38:31,361
s 3rd Army broke through
at Avranches yesterday.

943
01:38:31,361 --> 01:38:34,321
I do not want to be in your shoes .

944
01:38:38,561 --> 01:38:40,801
Heil, mein Führer .

945
01:38:47,241 --> 01:38:49,801
Read this, Keitel .

946
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:55,361
That's what that Hofacker said
if Rommel .

947
01:38:56,401 --> 01:39:00,801
He has talked to him ...
on the attack .

948
01:39:03,761 --> 01:39:06,681
If it is true , Keitel ...

949
01:39:06,681 --> 01:39:11,081
it is a ...
of my biggest disappointments ever.

950
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:19,681
But I can not hurt the people who contact
him so highly , by prosecuting him.

951
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:24,321
Rommel HOME IN MEN LINGEN
August 8, 1944

952
01:39:42,281 --> 01:39:46,441
- General Field Marshal .
- Loistl . What nice.

953
01:39:46,441 --> 01:39:48,561
Jesus ...

954
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:58,081
As long as you do not wear the head during
arm , it's not so bad. Come on .

955
01:40:03,721 --> 01:40:07,401
FRANCE
August 17, 1944

956
01:40:20,001 --> 01:40:24,241
- Go ahead.
- A private letter to you from the Führer.

957
01:40:25,241 --> 01:40:29,761
You are asked to come to Berlin
and report .

958
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:32,401
To report ?

959
01:40:53,361 --> 01:40:57,601
The Americans have already crossed the Seine
with two divisions.

960
01:41:02,241 --> 01:41:04,401
Yes, Speidel ...

961
01:41:05,361 --> 01:41:08,481
That's all for me.

962
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:51,081
- Nice to meet you , Colonel. How are you?
- Thank you good.

963
01:41:51,081 --> 01:41:54,121
I must speak to you in private.

964
01:41:54,121 --> 01:41:58,241
Go in and tell your mom
we have guests.

965
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:03,721
- What gives?
- Field Marshal Kluge 's death.

966
01:42:03,721 --> 01:42:06,801
He was called to Berlin, but took poison.

967
01:42:06,801 --> 01:42:10,481
General Speidel considered
you ought to know that.

968
01:42:13,041 --> 01:42:15,321
Yes. Thank you.

969
01:42:17,521 --> 01:42:19,681
Do we know why?

970
01:42:19,681 --> 01:42:24,881
We assume that Hitler gave him the debt
for frontal collapse.

971
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:27,801
All flees from us , Field Marshal .

972
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:35,041
Are not you ashamed , you wretch -

973
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:39,521
- Over to you , in the most miserable manner ,
betrayed the Führer ?

974
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:43,321
I regret only
I did not perform the attack .

975
01:42:43,321 --> 01:42:47,401
- Then it had not failed.
- It was ... Corresponding ?

976
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:51,601
Be quiet , Mr. Freissler .
Today, it is my head.

977
01:42:53,121 --> 01:42:55,961
In a year , it applies your head .

978
01:43:26,161 --> 01:43:32,121
- What it was based on ?
- Nothing at all . It came totally unexpected.

979
01:43:32,121 --> 01:43:35,241
I will await further orders
in Germany .

980
01:43:35,241 --> 01:43:39,241
- Who will replace you in the army group?
- General Krebs .

981
01:43:39,241 --> 01:43:43,321
Although Blumentritt replaced
and shall report in Berlin.

982
01:43:43,321 --> 01:43:46,241
There is nothing unusual , Speidel .

983
01:43:46,241 --> 01:43:50,481
They are looking for scapegoats
for the fiasco on the front.

984
01:43:52,681 --> 01:43:57,201
The conspirators from Paris
sentenced a week ago .

985
01:43:58,241 --> 01:44:01,121
Horrible . Even Stülpnagel .

986
01:44:03,161 --> 01:44:06,921
Hofacker has apparently not
been executed yet.

987
01:44:12,201 --> 01:44:17,241
- They might still need him.
- Do you have anything to fear ?

988
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:23,121
FREUDENSTADT
September 7, 1944

989
01:44:25,201 --> 01:44:28,921
Good morning, Frau Speidel .
Is your husband at home?

990
01:44:52,201 --> 01:44:56,121
SECURITY MINISTRY IN BERLIN
September 20, 1944

991
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:20,121
- Good morning , General.
- Colonel .

992
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:23,281
He is not anymore.

993
01:45:23,281 --> 01:45:26,921
Herr von Hofacker has just
its weak life left .

994
01:45:29,161 --> 01:45:32,321
Well, Herr von Hofacker .

995
01:45:33,761 --> 01:45:37,601
Tell Dr. Speidel
what you have told us.

996
01:45:37,601 --> 01:45:41,561
That you 've talked to him
on attack plans.

997
01:45:41,561 --> 01:45:46,241
And that even Field Marshal Rommel
was informed about them.

998
01:45:46,241 --> 01:45:52,921
No. Neither marshal or
Lieutenant-General was informed.

999
01:45:55,201 --> 01:45:58,041
If I 've said it ...

1000
01:45:59,161 --> 01:46:04,041
... I must have been ...
temporary memory confused.

1001
01:46:08,801 --> 01:46:12,561
Mr Lingen, October 1.
Dear Frau Speidel .

1002
01:46:12,561 --> 01:46:15,601
Your husband's fate touches me deeply.

1003
01:46:15,601 --> 01:46:20,961
Especially since you have not heard anything
from him for over three weeks ...

1004
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:25,241
... worries me a lot.
I put a high value on your make-

1005
01:46:25,241 --> 01:46:31,081
- As excellent, skilled
and ambitious chief of staff.

1006
01:46:31,081 --> 01:46:36,241
I'll write to the Führer today
and put in a good word for him.

1007
01:46:36,241 --> 01:46:41,121
" Mein Führer , you know I put down
all the power and ability " -

1008
01:46:41,121 --> 01:46:46,681
- "In the Battle of France in 1940,
in Africa 1941-1943 " -

1009
01:46:46,681 --> 01:46:50,481
- 'In Italy in 1943
and on the western front in 1944. "

1010
01:46:50,481 --> 01:46:55,241
" My only goal is to fight for
and win for your new Germany. "

1011
01:46:55,241 --> 01:46:59,401
" Heil, mein Führer .
E point Rommel . "

1012
01:47:01,241 --> 01:47:04,561
Maybe he was informed, yes .

1013
01:47:04,561 --> 01:47:09,281
- But he did not participate actively .
- Knowledge is betrayal .

1014
01:47:11,841 --> 01:47:15,041
According to Lieutenant General Speidel
he -

1015
01:47:15,041 --> 01:47:20,361
- Via Hofacker ,
posted by General von Stülpnagel -

1016
01:47:20,361 --> 01:47:24,761
- Knowledge of the plan
the attack 20 July 1944 .

1017
01:47:24,761 --> 01:47:28,001
He informed
Field Marshal Rommel .

1018
01:47:28,001 --> 01:47:32,721
To Rommel did not keep information
Furthermore , he did not know .

1019
01:47:32,721 --> 01:47:36,841
I believe General Lieutenant's apology
be unlikely.

1020
01:47:36,841 --> 01:47:41,761
It was his duty to self- report
the attack plan.

1021
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:47,801
Especially as Rommel must have said
that he did not intend to report.

1022
01:47:49,641 --> 01:47:55,601
The Führer is of the opinion
Speidels that debt can not be doubted.

1023
01:47:57,321 --> 01:48:00,361
Gentlemen .
If General Speidel claims -

1024
01:48:00,361 --> 01:48:04,881
- That he has informed Rommel
on the attack -

1025
01:48:04,881 --> 01:48:07,641
- The prosecution must disprove it .

1026
01:48:07,641 --> 01:48:12,761
This is a sophistry attempt
to acquit Dr Speidel .

1027
01:48:12,761 --> 01:48:15,041
And even then ...

1028
01:48:16,081 --> 01:48:22,081
The matter was so serious that Speidel not
should rely on marshal .

1029
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:27,521
If there is anything a soldier
be able to rely on ...

1030
01:48:27,521 --> 01:48:31,481
so ... is it to his superiors
doing their duty .

1031
01:48:32,921 --> 01:48:37,281
I hope you realize
what this means for Rommel .

1032
01:48:38,321 --> 01:48:41,761
HERRLINGEN
October 14, 1944

You are accused of having been involved
the assassination of the Fuhrer .

1035
01:49:37,201 --> 01:49:40,801

Colonel von Hofacker ...

1037

- ... And General Speidel .
- Speidel ?

1038
01:49:50,641 --> 01:49:56,241
He testified that he had
informing you of the attack plans.

1039
01:49:56,241 --> 01:49:58,801
I think not on .

1040
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:32,321
Well ...

1041
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:38,081
I forgot about me.
I'll take the consequences.

1042
01:50:40,361 --> 01:50:44,521
Are you kind and leave us alone
in a few minutes ?

1043

In recognition
for your great efforts ... for the kingdom ...

When you 're ready ...

01:51:06,521 --> 01:51:08,641
A gun I do not trust .

1047
01:51:08,641 --> 01:51:12,681
I brought you something
acting on three seconds.

1048
01:51:13,721 --> 01:51:18,041
- What will happen to my family ?
- The liability waivers .

1049
01:51:18,041 --> 01:51:21,881
A state funeral is prepared.

1050
01:51:21,881 --> 01:51:27,521
Your wife will get full pension
