1
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:05,128
500 of them stark-naked,
screamin' their heads off, all with spears.

2
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,792
Yes, they weren't very nice, those spears.

3
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,510
Well, they say it's much worse now,

4
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,092
but these young fellas nowadays,
they haven't got the stomach for it.

5
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,549
There's not many has when
it comes to a spear.

6
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,880
Talk sense, man. All I say is, if
there is a war, which God forbid,

7
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,668
then you can say goodbye to England,
home and beauty,

8
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,258
because the young chaps
now, they can't fight.

9
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,543
Hello, Drummer.

10
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,177
Well, what about us?

11
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,011
What about
the Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry, eh?

12
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,051
What about the Dogs?

13
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,088
But you said yourself
the Dogs aren't what they were.

14
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:43,002
It's all this education and machinery
and goin' to the pictures.

15
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:48,002
It's all right to have a good regiment
but where are the men to fight in it?

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,418
That's the point.

17
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,135
Where are they?

18
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,258
(Chimes)

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,252
There you are. That ought
to warm 'em up a bit.

20
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,885
International crisis.

21
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,376
I tell you, Fred, things
are getting serious.

22
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,883
Do you know what time I got
home last night? Half past ten.

23
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,668
- Winston's having another go at them upstairs.
- Oh, well, that's something.

24
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,926
You know that fellow Westlake,
National Liberal, Bromwich East?

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,085
Do you know how long he went on last night?

26
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,170
Hour and 40 minutes solid.

27
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,969
I know. I know. You're dead right.

28
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,713
It's the third time this week.

29
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,293
I tell you, Fred,
my missus is getting proper fed up.

30
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,551
We're going to have a war.
Right. Let 'em start one now.

31
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:46,046
Let 'em get on with it. Let us get home
early to our suppers for once in a change.

32
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,593
War? Not a chance of it, madam, not this year.
It's not in anybody's interests, is it, really?

33
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,511
- Passage for California?
- Yes. The end counter over there.

34
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,215
Payable to the Agency, sir.
Just "& Co". No "Limited"

35
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:58,757
You'll arrive in Benghazi on the 20th...

36
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,465
- Are we likely to run into any sandstorms?
- No, madam.

37
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,469
The Italians haven't been very clever
about their publicity.

38
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:08,251
Libya's the only unspoiled playground
in the Mediterranean.

39
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,048
War, that's the trouble.
It may start at any moment.

40
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,708
We'd like to do lots of repairs,
but our hands are tied.

41
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,719
- Not when it comes to taking the rent!
- If times were normal,

42
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,837
we'd be giving you a bath with a geyser
and new paint.

43
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:22,465
I don't want a geyser.
I want the guttering put right.

44
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,343
Drip, drip, drip! It drives you mad.

45
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,877
We can't all be thinking of ourselves
in times like these, Mrs Williams.

46
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,720
And with summer coming on,
it won't bother you so much.

47
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,178
I've only had it six months,
now they're talking about a war.

48
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,170
I won't be able to get any spares. Foreign.

49
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,881
- You may not be able to get any petrol.
- Don't talk silly.

50
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,629
How am I going to get home?

51
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,920
- It's nearly quarter past, Jim.
- Won't be a moment.

52
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,799
You're in a bit of a hurry, aren't you?

53
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,885
- Oh, that again.
- I've got to be at the Drill Hall by half past.

54
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,755
Territorials! Look here, Jimmy boy,
I was in the last lot.

55
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,883
At the War Office.
Nearly ruined my health.

56
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,885
Don't start looking for trouble.
If there is going to be a war,

57
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,834
and if they hadn't told us to keep cool after
Munich, I wouldn't have put new pumps up,

58
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,425
but if there is going to be a war,
the whole place goes over to munitions.

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,752
With that knack of yours
and my good management,

60
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,002
why, there'll be a packet
in it for all of us.

61
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,382
Enough for you to buy
that place of your own.

62
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,924
And it's patriotic, too. Hello, Mrs Perry.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,968
Hello, Mr Jackson. Coming, Jim?

64
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:22,088
- I can't go with my buttons like this.
- Buttons! Listen to him.

65
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,928
A man with your husband's brains
playing at soldiers.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,129
It isn't as if he's got any rifles
or machine guns or any real things.

67
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,923
- But they have, haven't you?
- Of course we have. Hurry up.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,674
The trouble is to get them all clean.
They've got so many new guns and tanks.

69
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,677
- Tanks? I thought he was in the infantry.
- Little tanks.

70
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,172
You know, carriers.

71
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,095
Well, the papers say you haven't
got a thing. Not a thing!

72
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,335
You don't want to believe
everything you read.

73
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:47,214
I wish I could take you to the Drill Hall.
You'd be amazed.

74
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,377
So much stuff there,
we've nowhere to put it.

75
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,296
It'd be a great eye-opener.

76
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,592
Now, this is the 1914 type.

77
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,504
When we get a gun - and
we may any day now -

78
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,261
we shall probably get the 1917 type
with improvements.

79
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,336
I used it myself in 1918.

80
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,882
The main thing is, keep it clean.

81
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,218
Mind you don't drop the magazines,
and remember the eight stoppages.

82
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:08,674
Get mud in the feed pawls
and you'll have trouble.

83
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,132
- A bent magazine, you got more trouble.
- Hey!

84
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,005
Shan't be a minute, old man.
But it's a good old gun.

85
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,213
In my humble opinion,
the perfect answer to attacks from the air.

86
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,709
So if hostile aeroplanes
try to interfere with you,

87
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,719
all you got to do is touch 'em up a bit
with the old Lewis. Got it?

88
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,842
(Bomb whistles and explodes)

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,835
We ought to have dug trenches at Dunkirk,
let the Germans through,

90
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:36,377
- then taken them in the rear.
- What can you do with a rifle against a tank?

91
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:42,219
Oh, we had our troubles, in the Sudan and in
Basutoland, but we got through all right.

92
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,674
- The Dogs always do.
- Ah...

93
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,172
What was you in?

94
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,794
The Dogs. D-O-Gs.
Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry.

95
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,795
You ought to know that, young fellow.

96
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,044
- What you in?
- Parachutes.

97
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,760
Oh, the Umbrella Danglers.

98
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,299
Who does your marching for you?

99
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,259
They could have done with us in Greece.

100
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,924
There's another bungled engagement for you.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,885
Surrounded? All right, form square, same
as what old General McNeill did at Suakin.

102
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,668
- You'd be too old to remember that?
- Mm.

103
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,090
Times have changed, Dad.

104
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,672
He's right, Bobby.

105
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,918
I don't doubt they use bayonets nowadays,
the like of which we've never seen.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,552
Great long beggars.

107
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,426
No, nothing's changed.

108
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,925
Except that life's much
easier than it used to be.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,709
Now all them battle courses.
Lot of nonsense!

110
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,886
Anything to get out of marching.
Cushy, compared to what we had to do.

111
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,628
Up to our knees in water to cross a stream.
No time to take your boots off.

112
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,043
No joke, it was.

113
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:51,293
Nowadays, they're afraid of getting their feet
wet Might get in a draught and catch cold.

114
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,927
Lot of nonsense.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,049
One sergeant we had used to shout and scream,
just to make it sound like a real battle.

116
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,626
Wouldn't like that sort of caper nowadays.

117
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:05,259
Too worried about them fancy battle suits
of theirs, these young fellas.

118
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,011
Keeping a crease in their trousers
to go out with a girl.

119
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:13,216
No buttons to clean like we had.
They don't know what polishing is.

120
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:19,668
And another thing, we didn't get broke off for a
cup of tea every five minutes like they do now.

121
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,302
We had to keep on marching,

122
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,796
dressing properly by the right
with bayonets gleaming and everything.

123
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,676
Looked lovely it did.

124
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,255
Didn't feel so lovely, though.

125
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,379
No joke when you've got wet feet
and the sergeant's watching you,

126
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,461
specially when it's hot.

127
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:37,422
Didn't have no feelings,
those old sergeants.

128
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,008
No taking it easy with them -
"left right, left right" -

129
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,300
had to watch your step, you did.

130
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:49,088
If you made a mistake in the drill,
you all had to go back and do it again.

131
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,553
Much easier.

132
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,631
I don't know why they don't call
some of us up, some of the old Dogs.

133
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,877
We'd show 'em.

134
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,424
No need to, Dad. Look.

135
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,843
- Big new call-up.
- Fat lot of good that'll do.

136
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,595
Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry.

137
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,089
I know it's wrong.

138
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:11,255
Mr Davenport said so himself. He said
definitely they were going to get me deferred.

139
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,969
I was on the list. He said so himself.

140
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:17,130
Eat your egg.
I think you rely too much on Mr Davenport.

141
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,425
Oh, you don't know him. He'll do something.

142
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,261
That's one thing about the firm,
they never let you down.

143
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,386
I'm sorry, Parsons, but it's been agreed
that Mr Thyrtle in the bargain basement

144
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,511
will deal with all deferments in future,
so if you'd care to go and see him...

145
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,712
But you must realise, you know,
there's a war on.

146
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,510
Only key men are deferred now.

147
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,300
I understand, but is there a chance that Mr
Thyrtle might do something? You see, my wife...

148
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,132
We've lost Collins from Refrigerators
and Barker from Winter Sports this week.

149
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,342
There was nothing Mr Thyrtle could do.

150
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,301
- I see, sir.
- I'm sorry, Parsons.

151
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:59,006
Mr Thyrtle, please. Quickly.

152
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,834
No, thank you.

153
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:09,342
By the way, Parsons,
I think it might be less um...

154
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:13,505
shall I say, embarrassing
for both of us if we...

155
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:21,500
forget... disregard any differences in status
which may have existed at the... at the store.

156
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,840
Yes, sir. Thank you.

157
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:26,544
I must say, I think it very -
to put it mildly - thoughtless

158
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,216
of the powers that be
to allow such a situation to arise.

159
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,844
Oh, I do agree, sir.

160
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:36,219
After all, it's not as if my activities were
confined to toys. I was in charge of officers' kit.

161
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:40,131
- Yes, and garden ornaments.
- I know, but it's the officers' kit which makes...

162
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,009
Well, never matter.

163
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,793
- I must say, I think the Ministry are ill-advised.
- About your case, sir?

164
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,293
In general, Parsons. In general.

165
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,425
- This free?
- I believe so.

166
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,341
Confidentially, I took the opportunity
of suggesting to the Managing Director

167
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:02,340
when I was saying au revoir, that Mr
Thyrtle is no longer pulling his weight.

168
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,633
That should do a lot of good, sir.

169
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,927
At any rate, I have taken the matter out of
the firm's hands and written direct to my MP.

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,583
- Who's he?
- I beg your pardon.

171
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,381
- Who's he, your MP?
- Sir Henry Chalmers Thompson.

172
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,417
Oh, old Liverlips. Talked for two hours and
a half on the Brompton sewage scheme bill.

173
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,384
Couldn't hear hisself for snores.

174
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,876
- Do you know Sir Henry?
- I'm in the 'Ouse.

175
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,044
- A member?
- No, I work there on the boilers.

176
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,926
They'll be sorry they let me go.

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,757
You wait till the winter. They'll be
asking questions in the 'Ouse, all right.

178
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,587
"Who let Ted Brewer go off to the Army?"

179
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,345
No-one can work them dampers like I can.
They'll freeze.

180
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,502
Are you called up? So are we.

181
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,878
All the same, I don't think you should
refer to Sir Henry in that way.

182
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,004
No? Listen, there's only one good man
ever got into Parliament.

183
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,466
- Who would that be?
- Bleedin' Guy Fawkes.

184
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,257
- I wonder what time we get to Hacklesfield.
- I've no idea.

185
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,218
Three eleven.

186
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,377
- Change at Crewe, don't we?
- Can do. Can do.

187
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,876
Or there's the Derby way.
That's more comfortable.

188
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,253
- Doesn't get you in till five seven.
- We've got to be there by four.

189
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,134
- What, you called up, too?
- Yes.

190
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,756
What, all of you? Go on!

191
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,258
- It's all adventure, isn't it?
- Depends on your previous occupation.

192
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,545
Oh, I was very well situated. Big
travel people. Butlers. Know them?

193
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,509
I suppose you know all the trains, then?

194
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,669
I don't think you'd catch me out in Europe.

195
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,756
Prewar, that is. I'm a bit continental
myself. Swiss grandmother.

196
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,756
- Your job's over for the duration.
- I don't know. People have still got to travel.

197
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,714
Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag,
I always say.

198
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,008
By the way, any of you in the Scouts?

199
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,627
Hurry up. The two-twenty'll
be here in a minute.

200
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,423
All right, I've only got one pair of hands,
haven't I? Yes?

201
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,882
If you're not too busy,
we'd like the same again.

202
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,253
I've had a wonderful life.
I can't grumble. It's all been like that.

203
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,839
- You got a car?
- Yes.

204
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,552
- What make?
- It's a Jowett.

205
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,340
There's a smashing little job.
I've got a Lagonda.

206
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,918
I'll race you,
soon as we get out of this ruddy army.

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,761
- Can't last much longer, can it?
- What, the war? I hope not.

208
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,756
- Too much rent control.
- And then I'll buy a new car.

209
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,760
I'll buy a Mercedes. Rooaaar! Smashing.

210
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,381
- Wonder how many more there'll be of us.
- I don't know.

211
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,465
I suppose some will come from London,
poor mutts. What do you think of it all?

212
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,545
- Very little.
- Yes, I think you're right.

213
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,509
I was in two minds about coming at all.

214
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,590
- Here's the two-twenty. Hurry, Maisie!
- All right, all right, don't get all het up.

215
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,511
- Well, anyway, cheers.
- Cheers.

216
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:26,798
TANNOY: This is Crewe. Crewe Station.
Crewe.

217
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:34,674
Passengers for Liverpool, Shrewsbury, Chester
and Hacklesfield should change here.

218
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,720
- Have we time for a cup of tea?
- What about it, Mr Beck?

219
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:41,968
Platform 7. We've got five minutes.
Time for a quick cup.

220
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:45,502
- Shall I run and get you a cup, Mr Davenport?
- No, no. We'll all go.

221
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,261
Can you tell me,
where does the Hacklesfield train start?

222
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,130
- Platform 7. Over the bridge.
- Are you going there too?

223
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,302
I'll say. Duke of Glendon's Light
footsloggers. Have a cup of tea.

224
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,260
(Slurring)
I'm a fellow with a very independent disposition.

225
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,011
Can't stand people telling me what to do.

226
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,252
And if they try it, then I
always want to be rude.

227
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,668
In fact, I usually am.

228
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,339
Here, I'll get 'em.

229
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,261
The Army will have to put up with me
and not me with the Army.

230
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,751
- Stop shoving, mate, will you?
- I'm sorry, old man.

231
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:17,675
Tea?

232
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,961
- China for me.
- Get used to char. It's all they got in the Army.

233
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,258
Oh, good old Army. The thin red line.
Smashing!

234
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,711
- I don't blame you for getting bottled.
- You going to Hacklesfield?

235
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,293
- Yes. You too?
- Yes.

236
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,298
My name's Stainer. Can I interest any of
you in buying a Rolls-Royce or a Bentley?

237
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,006
- Three teas and a bitter.
- Four teas.

238
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,635
All set for the last lap?

239
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,671
- Looking forward to it, this bloke.
- You can't look back on it.

240
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,753
No. I wonder when we'll be able to.

241
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,626
Mr Davenport was doing very important work
at the time of his call-up.

242
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,927
The Army's full of people who make you suffer
because you're no good at polishing buttons.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,544
It might have gone down with the last
generation and even with some of you,

244
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,340
but it won't go down with me,
because I'm independent.

245
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:01,044
- And if they don't like it, I'll walk right out.
- Look out what you're doing.

246
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:06,214
Don't you shout at me like that.
I'm not in the Army yet, you know.

247
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,918
- He didn't do it on purpose.
- That's right.

248
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:18,466
- There's a nasty piece of work for you.
- That's the way to treat them, see.

249
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,635
Scared stiff, he was. They always
are if you stand up for yourself.

250
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,095
He looked like a regular.

251
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:26,129
Fancy putting decent civilians
under blokes like that.

252
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,258
Hurry up with that bitter, miss.

253
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,632
You can't eat by numbers
and sleep by numbers.

254
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,877
Have them yelling at
you, day in and day out.

255
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,843
By the left. Quick! Eat!

256
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,334
Shut up, shut up.

257
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,341
Oh, dear.

258
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,340
(Train whistle)

259
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:55,128
There you are, you see.
He's ashamed of himself.

260
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,882
- Hurry up with that bitter, miss.
- We haven't time for tea now.

261
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,428
Have a bite?

262
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,083
No, thank you.
I'm rather worried about my digestion.

263
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:07,006
- I have a very sensitive stomach.
- Always did have, didn't you, Mr Davenport?

264
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,837
- Where are you going?
- To get a seat.

265
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:12,295
- Good idea.
- We were here before some of these people.

266
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,259
Appalling service.

267
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,419
Last journey without a pass for years.

268
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,421
Ten Gold Flake, please.

269
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,005
Ten Gold Flake!

270
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:33,459
TANNOY: Passengers for Hacklesfield,
your train is leaving from Platform 7.

271
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:37,334
Left right, left right, left right,
left right, left right left!

272
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,553
All right, jump down, lads.
I'll be back in a minute.

273
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,755
Doesn't seem such a bad bloke.

274
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,168
They've got to be nice
when you're in civvies.

275
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,921
Look at this.

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,343
DRILL SERGEANT:
Breathe natural, that's the idea.

277
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,669
- Barbarian.
- Hey, look.

278
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,132
Keep those knees up.

279
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,591
Nice big strides. Feel the benefit.

280
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,172
Come on! Pick 'em up.

281
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,841
Are you the new intake? That's right.
Nice tall fella should do well at PT.

282
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,963
Stand up, now. Let's see a smile.
Make the best of yourself.

283
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:20,839
Come on, stand up, son.
And look me straight in the eyes.

284
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,714
That's right. You look a bit weedy
at the moment. So do you.

285
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,174
Too much town life. We'll
soon build you up.

286
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,668
Smile, nice smile. That's right.

287
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,135
Come on, what's the matter with you, lad? Get
a haircut first thing, make you feel better.

288
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,548
And that's an order.

289
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,043
Go on, you've only been four miles.

290
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,677
Ought to feel fresh as a daisy!

291
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,333
Look out, my lucky lads.
I'm coming after you!

292
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,465
Right! Pay attention!

293
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:52,211
Then after I got back from Dunkirk I was sent to
the training battalion as a Sergeant Instructor,

294
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:55,919
- then to the Officers Training Unit.
- Our job is to get up to strength again.

295
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,757
We'd hoped for trained men, but we've got
civilians whether we like it or not.

296
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,216
Some came in last week.
30 more expected today.

297
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:06,428
You'll be looking after them. I expect
you'll get pretty fed up with them at first.

298
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,633
They won't seem as... keen as you are.

299
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:13,876
Then one day, you'll find you've got a platoon
of some of the finest infantry in the world.

300
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,673
I don't know how it happens, but it does.
Oh, Edwards.

301
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,049
- Sir?
- This is Perry.

302
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,459
- Hello. Very glad to have you.
- Thank you, sir.

303
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,090
You're lucky.
You might have gone to another company.

304
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,252
Perry was in France with
the 12th Battalion.

305
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,922
- NCO?
- Sergeant, sir.

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,299
Oh, has the depot sent
you your sergeant yet?

307
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,800
Due this afternoon, sir. Fletcher.
Regular with seven years' service.

308
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,720
- Let me know what you think of him.
- Right, sir.

309
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,589
Right, Perry. I'll leave Captain
Edwards to look after you.

310
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,302
Sir.

311
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,005
- I'm giving him No.9 platoon, sir.
- Fine.

312
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,968
I can feel my rheumatics coming back again.

313
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:51,087
You'll have to get rid of those
before we start on these courses.

314
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:54,177
Jumping ditches of broken glass
with bullets whistling by.

315
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,885
- How do you know?
- Picture Post.

316
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,547
I can't understand it.

317
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,050
The Government puts broken glass
on top of walls to protect its property,

318
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,922
then trains blokes to get across it
at its own expense.

319
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,298
At our expense, man. We're just cogs in a
great machine. We pay for our own discomfort.

320
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,136
These living conditions
are most insanitary.

321
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,792
Not if we keep the doors and windows open.

322
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,921
- I can't sleep with the windows open.
- How is your stomach?

323
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,003
- Acute.
- Mm. That'll be the worry.

324
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,674
That's your bowels. Driving my tractor
for a week would put it right for ye.

325
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,595
- What, are you a farmer, then?
- I wouldn't be here if I was.

326
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,136
I worked on a farm, though.

327
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,879
They have a lassie doing my job now.

328
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:34,177
She's better-looking than me
but not for that kind of work.

329
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,419
What else did it say in Picture Post?

330
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,503
Oh, yes. When you come to the barbed wire,

331
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,546
one fellow lays across it
and all the others run over his back.

332
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,091
- Oh, shut up, can't you?
- I'm only telling them.

333
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,801
Battle training they call it. Just to get you
used to things. Real live bullets they use, too.

334
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,253
Well, I won't be shot at merely to gratify
some oafish, military whim.

335
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,509
Then there are these bayonet charges.
Three miles long, uphill.

336
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,503
They make you run all the way, too.

337
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,423
And then you go swinging from tree to tree
on ropes. You know, Tarzan-fashion.

338
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,585
- Should be interesting.
- Oh, turn it up!

339
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,883
You don't know what you're
talking about, Beck.

340
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,506
What have you got to smile about, Lloyd?

341
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,219
Oh, nothing.

342
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,377
What a tragedy it all is.

343
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,630
I'll get my lumbago back again at this rate. I
didn't ought to be in the Army. Not really.

344
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,007
Any day now. Ha!

345
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,553
Lumbago.

346
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,050
Don't they give us sheets
as well as blankets?

347
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,507
Not in the Army. They do in the RAF.

348
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,257
I'd never have believed that in a civilised
country, doctors would permit...

349
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,585
All right, stop talking.
Now, pay attention.

350
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,126
Now, you're going to be No.9 Platoon.

351
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,756
Mr Perry will be your officer
and I'm your sergeant.

352
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,339
Fletcher's my name.

353
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,502
Sergeant Fletcher. Got it?

354
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:50,087
Now, I'm used to having the best platoon in
the battalion and I'm going to have it again.

355
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:54,255
This is the programme. You can take it easy
tonight but no leaving the camp.

356
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,126
There'll be hot supper served for you
at seven. The canteen's open till nine.

357
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,966
Lights out at ten. Corporal Robbins
will tell you about the blackout.

358
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:06,711
Tomorrow you'll be issued with your kit and get
inoculated. On Monday we start work proper.

359
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,427
Got it?

360
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,420
Right. Let's have your names.

361
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,959
- Davenport.
- Right. Yes?

362
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,879
Parsons, sir.

363
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:20,925
- Your name?
- Beck, Sergeant.

364
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,050
- And yours?
- Lloyd.

365
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:27,881
You?

366
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:29,918
Stainer.

367
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,793
Yes?

368
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,261
Luke.

369
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,720
Yes?

370
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:38,882
Brewer.

371
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,380
Yes?

372
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,508
Truscott.

373
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:47,840
Squad will advance! About... turn!

374
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,631
Leave it, leave it. I'll tell
you when to pick it up.

375
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,635
Squad, stand at ease!

376
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,043
That man in the front rank there. Stainer.

377
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,424
Corporal, put him in the
correct ease position.

378
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,676
Feet 12 inches apart, stomach in,
arms straight. Brace yourself.

379
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,421
All right, Corporal.

380
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,834
Squad, 'shun.

381
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:10,674
As you were! Wake up!
What's your name? Daventry?

382
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,333
- Davenport.
- You're too slow, five minutes behind.

383
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,965
Think what you're doing. And you, too.

384
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:19,467
And you, Lloyd, wait for the
word of command before you move.

385
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,675
- Look to your front!
- Officer coming.

386
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,002
All right, Corporal. Fall in. Pick it up.

387
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,884
Squad, 'shun.

388
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,752
- Stand at ease, please.
- Sir.

389
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,836
Squad, stand at ease.

390
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,842
- What's your name?
- Truscott, sir.

391
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,635
Stand to attention.

392
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,553
- Take these names for the tailor.
- Sir. Look to your front.

393
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,836
Do you think you're going to
enjoy the Army, Truscott?

394
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,836
Well, I put down for the Navy, sir.

395
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,635
- Your name?
- Lloyd, sir.

396
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,509
Go on. Stand at ease.

397
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,215
This is far too big.
Keep those trousers well hitched up.

398
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:00,880
Yes, sir.

399
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,174
- What's your name?
- Herbert Davenport, sir.

400
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,386
- What's the trouble with the boots?
- They're a little tight in the toe, sir.

401
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:13,049
- I've rather a high instep.
- What was your job before you came here?

402
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,093
Rather an important one, actually, sir.

403
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:19,385
I was in charge of three departments
at Burbages, including officers' kit.

404
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:21,761
Too big, Sergeant Fletcher.

405
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,548
And the trousers are a
little loose in the seat.

406
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,675
- Your name?
- Parsons, sir.

407
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:32,841
Filth! What do you think a barrack
inspection is? A joke? Lay it out proper.

408
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,592
You've got another five tons to shift yet.

409
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,045
Come on! You'll do it properly
if I have to keep you here all night.

410
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:45,091
Six men to scrub out the cookhouse.
You, you, you, you, you. And you.

411
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,928
Eyes right!

412
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,589
Wake up, that man!

413
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,421
No, you can't have 48 hours.

414
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,178
You've only been in a month.
This isn't a holiday camp.

415
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,343
Stand up! Pick up that step!

416
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,425
You six are detailed for
guard tonight. Got it?

417
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,418
This is a life, isn't it, eh?

418
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,672
A child of three doesn't take as much pleasure
in making a noise as Sergeant Fletcher.

419
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,799
It's just like I said. Putting us under guys like
that, it's criminal. Two guards in one week.

420
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,720
- No, 13 days it is.
- Oh, shut up.

421
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:20,217
Who was it made him turn nasty
in the first place, spilling his tea?

422
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,875
- He'll soon change his tune.
- Who's going to make him?

423
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,878
- I am.
- When?

424
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:29,260
- Soon as I know my way around a bit.
- When'll that be? Ten years' time?

425
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,505
We've only done six weeks so far.
Will you look at that spud!

426
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,878
- Throw it away.
- Here, don't throw a perfectly good spud away.

427
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,677
You're a nuisance, you are.

428
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,428
I don't see how Fletcher
could have remembered us all.

429
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,343
- I had my back to him.
- It's just like I said in the first place. The Army!

430
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:51,007
- Hey, that man!
- Hello, what's that?

431
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,470
That man!

432
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:55,884
Take those hands out of your pockets.
Yes, you!

433
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,961
There's no parade. Hark at him shouting.

434
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,298
Cad.

435
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,757
You'd think he'd know those
letters off by heart.

436
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,796
I don't seem to get any letters.

437
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,590
Come on. You're not getting out of it.
We're saving yours.

438
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,043
I'm going to shoot that rat
the day we get live ammo.

439
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,547
What was all the shouting?

440
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,801
I'm walking back from the lats, quietly,
committing no offence.

441
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,715
All at once I feels my nose running, so my
hand goes to my pocket to get the hankie out.

442
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:25,715
Next thing I hear is his voice yelling at
me across the square from the other NAAFI.

443
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,754
"Take your hands out of
your pocket, that man."

444
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,718
"That man!"

445
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,629
You wouldn't think we was human beings.

446
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,509
You can't blow your nose now!

447
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,049
- There. I warned you, didn't I?
- You did, Geoffrey.

448
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:41,178
It would have been the same if we hadn't spilled
his tea. I wish I'd thrown it in his face.

449
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,632
- Golly!
- I'd love to have done it. It was boiling.

450
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,635
You keep on saying that.
I'd like to see you do it.

451
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,260
Well, I would have done it.

452
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,383
- Stainer, you make me sick.
- Oh?

453
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,502
You keep on talking, you
never do a damn thing.

454
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,800
- Well, what can I do?
- Go and see the officer.

455
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,293
- Oh, don't be mad.
- You'd be within your rights.

456
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,880
Yes, and would they ever forget?

457
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,803
I tell you, Lloyd,
they've got you where they want you.

458
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:06,505
I'm going to see the officer.

459
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,593
- Never.
- Is that wise?

460
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,586
No, but I hate gasbags.

461
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,504
What are you going to say, mate?

462
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,384
I've got plenty to say.

463
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:20,251
Be careful. Not mutiny.
You know what that leads to.

464
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,218
Look out, look out, here he comes.

465
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,757
All right. When you've done here,
report down to the quartermaster's stores.

466
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,587
He's got some scrubbing for you.

467
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,301
Oh, and by the way,

468
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:41,547
the next man I catch around camp with his
hands in his pockets will be put on a charge.

469
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,011
Got it? Right.

470
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,802
- Sergeant?
- Yes.

471
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,925
I want to see the officer, please.

472
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,714
What for?

473
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,795
My reasons are private.

474
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:57,546
All right. Write out an application
in the proper manner and let me have it.

475
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,344
And I'll see if Mr Perry can see you.

476
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,673
Thanks, Sergeant.

477
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,923
Right.

478
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,299
When you all get through,
go down to the stores.

479
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,425
- Look, Lloyd, I'll tell you what to say.
- Go to hell, Stainer.

480
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:15,009
If there hadn't been this trouble at Crewe,

481
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,880
you think Sergeant Fletcher
might have been easier on you?

482
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,547
Yes, I do, sir.

483
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:24,129
Now, these extra guard duties. According to the
rosters you've done no more than anybody else.

484
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,543
Do you think that because
of the trouble at Crewe,

485
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,303
you're blaming Sergeant Fletcher
for doing his job?

486
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,212
It isn't only the guards, sir.

487
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,377
You've been in the Army, what, six weeks?

488
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:37,049
Isn't that a short time to decide
about a soldier like Sergeant Fletcher?

489
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:40,135
I wouldn't have come to you, sir,
if I hadn't felt justified.

490
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:44,380
You've made a complaint. I must investigate
it or refer it to the company commander.

491
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:48,714
Do you want to refer it to Captain Edwards,
make a complaint in front of Sergeant Fletcher?

492
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,339
I'd rather leave it to you, sir.

493
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,550
- Very well, Lloyd.
- Thank you, sir.

494
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,128
SERGEANT FLETCHER: Sentries, pass!

495
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,670
Quick march!

496
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,254
Look here, Evan, I've been thinking.

497
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,427
If he didn't actually say nothing,
he must have hinted.

498
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,423
For the 100th time, he said
he'd look into it. That's all.

499
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,135
Now, for goodness' sake, shut up.

500
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,879
I told you it wouldn't do any good.

501
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,926
But if he looks into it,
like what he said...

502
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,719
Brewer, fetch the cocoa.

503
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:37,510
Right, Sergeant.

504
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:41,506
Won't be having cocoa at the sergeant's
mess party. Wine, women and song.

505
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,337
(Laughter)

506
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,467
♪ PIANO: Lily Of Laguna

507
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,128
Wait till the competitions. I'll bet...

508
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,046
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

509
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,507
- What'll it be? Bitter?
- Have a sandwich, sir?

510
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:02,257
- What's Sergeant Major betting on?
- No.10 platoon, sir. Used to be his.

511
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,589
- We don't mind taking his money, do we?
- I should hope not, sir.

512
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:11,585
My old battalion were all Territorials, so I haven't
much experience of these men just called up.

513
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,504
Do they usually make complaints?

514
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,840
Lloyd, sir?

515
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,126
Yes.

516
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,342
All soldiers like a bit of a grumble, sir.

517
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:21,628
After all, it's not funny to have to run
when you feel like walking,

518
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,256
or stand up
when you feel you could do with a sit down.

519
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:27,545
Or to have someone shout at you
when you're doing your best.

520
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:30,587
No, I think it does a man good
to let off steam a bit, sir.

521
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,919
Yes, if that's all it is.

522
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,172
Well, they're new, sir. But there's
some good men there. Lloyd for one.

523
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,007
He hasn't got the hang of it yet, but he
has the knack of handling men all right.

524
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,343
He's a bit of a nuisance at the moment,
but later on he'll make an NCO.

525
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:47,048
- Now, Luke...
- Got him onto that again, have you, sir?

526
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:51,261
The adjutant is taking some of his men for the
mortar platoon. The way Fletcher carried on...

527
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,834
Well, you'd think someone
was pinching his watch.

528
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,970
He even said that professor bloke - Davenport -
 said he had the makings of a soldier.

529
00:29:58,042 --> 00:30:01,087
There's nothing wrong with him
that the Army won't put right.

530
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,719
- Stainer?
- Yes, what about him?

531
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:07,378
Same with him, sir. He was a bit of a mess when
he first came in, but he'll shake down in time.

532
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:11,132
- We haven't got a dud there, sir.
- See what I mean? Optimistic.

533
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,802
Same thing in France, too.

534
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:20,798
If we'd only had the guns and planes
and tanks and things, it might all have...

535
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,510
Well, anyway, that was that.

536
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,800
There'll be no more of that nonsense.
There'll be a big change.

537
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:31,004
- Things are going to be different from now on.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,501
- Good evening, Brewer.
- Good evening, sir.

539
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,212
Here, he's giving it to him.
He's giving it to him proper.

540
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:41,425
- Who's giving what to who?
- The old screamer.

541
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,380
- Perry's giving him a right dressing down.
- What did he say?

542
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:49,045
He said things will be different. He wants
no nonsense. There's going to be a change.

543
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:52,005
- What did the sergeant say?
- He says, "Yes, sir." That's all.

544
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,508
Very slow, with a silly look on his face.
Almost human, he was.

545
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,586
Had all the stuffing knocked out of him.

546
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,504
Good for you, Evan. You're a plucky lad.

547
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,503
- I owe you an apology.
- I don't know...

548
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:06,467
From now on, he'll be as quiet as a little
lamb. Tomorrow he'll be saying please.

549
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,959
Come on! You're light infantry,
not horse Marines!

550
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,215
Truscott!

551
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:13,136
Truscott, get that fat side over!

552
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,630
(Explosion)

553
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,126
- Parsons!
- Come on. Come on.

554
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,595
Come on! Come on!

555
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,547
Come on! Get out of it! Get out of it!

556
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,758
Come on, Davenport!

557
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,168
- Come on.
(Explosion)

558
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,632
- Come on, Davenport!
- Wait a minute.

559
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,339
Oi!

560
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:41,548
Get on with it, Luke!
What's the matter with you?

561
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,800
Come on, Beck! Hurry up, hurry up!

562
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,720
Come on, come on. Come on, Parsons!

563
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,553
Come on! Come on, the rest of you!

564
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,011
Come on, Truscott!

565
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,501
- Can't you see I'm stuck?
- Well, get unstuck.

566
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,754
Now what have you done?

567
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:07,505
Don't hang about there, Lloyd!
Go back and take it in your stride!

568
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,835
Quick as lightning you ought to be.

569
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:12,418
Come on, Brewer, get some of that fat off!
Get over!

570
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:17,006
Come on, Parsons! You can do it, lad!

571
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,217
Use your brains. What's
the matter with you?

572
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:21,010
Swing across! Don't fall!

573
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,591
Brewer, double up, double up!

574
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,626
Come on, Parsons.

575
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:37,133
SERGEANT FLETCHER:
Right. You can use the mobile canteen.

576
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,129
- What about it, Sergeant Fletcher?
- Not bad, sir. Not bad at all.

577
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,543
Parsons held them up a bit
at the second obstacle.

578
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:49,173
- What is the matter with him?
- I don't quite know, sir.

579
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,794
Something's wrong. No grousing at all.
As if there was something on his mind.

580
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,087
"Tomorrow he'll be saying please."

581
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:59,378
- I only said what I heard.
- Well, you heard wrong.

582
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,793
It's like I always said... Oh!

583
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,506
The officer seemed to be enjoying the fun.

584
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,337
Grinning he was. I saw him.

585
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,095
"Things have got to be different."
That's what he said.

586
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:12,094
- Oh, shut up.
- Well, I've come to a conclusion.

587
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,170
- What's that?
- I don't like the Army.

588
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,088
- Two flans, two teas.
- Razor blades?

589
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,458
Sorry, no razor blades. Yes?

590
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:19,545
Tea, please. And a piece of Swiss roll.

591
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,214
PERRY: All right, pay attention.

592
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,678
Go on eating.

593
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,595
Oh, here he comes.
He can't leave us alone for a minute.

594
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:30,004
I'm supposed to organise this regimental
concert and I shall badly need some help.

595
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:36,708
So, if any of you can play anything, dance, sing,
pull things out of hats, can I have your names?

596
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,219
I shall need all the help I can get.

597
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:45,717
- I do recitations. Shall I put my hand up?
- You do and I'll clock you.

598
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,506
Well, think it over and let me know.

599
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,795
Well, I nearly got knocked
down by the rush.

600
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,546
Oh, they'll be all right, sir.

601
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,426
Why don't you want to help him?

602
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,337
He won't help us. Why should we help him?

603
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,925
You don't seem to be having a very good
time. Don't you ever get into town?

604
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,544
Occasionally, but there's only one cinema
and we've seen the film this week.

605
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,047
Why don't you come over to tea?

606
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,803
- Oh, yes, please.
- When?

607
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,261
- Sunday.
- What, all of us?

608
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,253
- Well...
- If we keep it down to seven.

609
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,375
All right.

610
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,467
- What time?
- Four? Half past?

611
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,094
- Four.
- Who do we ask for?

612
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,376
Marjorie Gillingham.

613
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,928
Number 12 Ellmore Street.

614
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,589
12 Ellmore Street.

615
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,006
FLETCHER: Right. Fall in.

616
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,798
- All right, we'll find it.
- Goodbye.

617
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,795
See you Sunday!

618
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,131
Ring the bell.

619
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,674
Steady. She may be looking
out of the window.

620
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,505
Oh, hello, chaps.

621
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,005
Mrs Gillingham?

622
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,667
That's right. Come in, boys.
How many of you are there?

623
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,511
- Just the seven, Sergeant.
- Oh, quite a party.

624
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,303
- Last man in, shut the door, will you?
- OK, Sergeant.

625
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,544
Charming house you have here.

626
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,628
Bit of a change after our barrack room.

627
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,130
Less congestion.

628
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,258
Yeah, more room, too.

629
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,344
Sit down anywhere.
Mrs Gillingham will be down in a minute.

630
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,594
How are you liking the Army?

631
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,966
- Need you ask?
- I expect you'll get over that.

632
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,127
Been in long?

633
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,709
- Seven weeks. Seems like years.
- I know.

634
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,044
- What are you in? Bombers?
- No, fighters.

635
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,128
- On leave?
- Sick leave.

636
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,425
- You're lucky.
- We could do with a bit of that.

637
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,633
- How do you wangle it?
- Were you really sick?

638
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,877
(Laughter)
- Well, shot up a bit.

639
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,506
Oh, but I'm all right now, though.

640
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,302
See this wristwatch?

641
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,592
Amazing. It landed five
miles from where I did.

642
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,250
They told me it was still going
when they picked it up.

643
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,794
Some farmer chap found it. Bit of luck, eh?

644
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,546
Of course, I didn't really mean...

645
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:37,091
MARJORIE:
Hello. So, you got here all right.

646
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,838
Mother will be down in a minute.

647
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:41,595
Come on, Buster.
Hurry or we'll miss the beginning.

648
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:46,218
Well, so long, boys. Going to see that Merchant
Navy picture. Marvellous job those chaps do.

649
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,295
And they don't wear a uniform. Come on.

650
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,418
Goodbye.

651
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,550
- Bye.
- Bye.

652
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:01,625
I wish we wore uniforms with a collar and
tie. This makes you feel like a convict.

653
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,546
Well, what do you think you are?

654
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,458
Oh, how do you do?

655
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,011
I'm Marjorie's mother.

656
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,549
I'm so glad she persuaded
you to come along.

657
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:14,671
The boys in the battalion before you
always used to come.

658
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,339
Oh, thank you so much.

659
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:20,470
So did the boys from the ack-ack battery,
until they moved.

660
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:25,674
I always say, if Marjorie can have her canteen,
I don't see why I shouldn't have mine.

661
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,216
Now, do sit down, please, all of you.

662
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:31,136
There, that's right.
Yes, that's the comfortable chair.

663
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,425
And you can put your plate
on the table there.

664
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,717
This is extremely kind
of you, Mrs Gillingham.

665
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:38,209
That's right. Oh, dear.

666
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:43,092
I'm afraid this place is rather untidy,
but this house is really too big for me.

667
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,300
Now, do make yourselves at home.

668
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:49,459
Well, and how do you like the Army?

669
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,881
We don't.

670
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:55,296
Oh, dear, what a pity. Now, hands up
for China tea and hands up for Indian.

671
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:02,668
And then what does he do? He has us
marching till our feet are nearly bleeding.

672
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,511
I tell you he's a proper b...
A very nasty fellow.

673
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:09,802
And the officer just smiled and then asked
for volunteers for the camp concert.

674
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:13,466
Both the sergeant and the officer
are as bad as each other, Mrs Gillingham.

675
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,213
That's right, ma'am. It's true.

676
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:19,168
Oh, dear, it is a shame, isn't it?
Who'd like another chocolate biscuit?

677
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,833
Well, they haven't taken your appetite
away from you.

678
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:24,548
The food's not good enough for that,
Mrs Gillingham.

679
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:28,003
Terrible. Since we've been in the Army,
we haven't had a proper bath.

680
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,133
- Well, a shower's quicker.
- Shut up.

681
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,970
You can always have one here
if you bring your towels.

682
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,052
Only, let me know in time.
I have such trouble with the boiler.

683
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,922
Oh? What do you burn?
What sort of boiler is it?

684
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,136
I could probably show you a saving. I'll pop
in sometime and have a look at it for you.

685
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:46,633
I wish you would. Marjorie's friend Buster
couldn't do anything with it,

686
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,589
and, naturally,
he knows all about engines and things.

687
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,345
You poor lads. Your life
sounds terribly gloomy.

688
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:55,214
It is, Mrs Gillingham, it is.

689
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,674
But you said just now
you have concerts and things.

690
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,670
Yes, if we do the acting.

691
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,547
There was a boy in the ack-ack
used to recite a lot.

692
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,505
There was one poem -
The Lynching Of Black Maguire.

693
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,503
How did it start?

694
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:10,594
It was hot that summer in Kicking Horse...

695
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,468
And the earth was parched and dry.

696
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:15,090
Full of geographical licence,
but exciting stuff.

697
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,881
- Good old Sid. Why don't you volunteer?
- Maybe I will.

698
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:22,130
- You know what I told you.
- Och, away, Ted. Let him do it if he wants to.

699
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,709
Well, I thought I was joining the Army,
not a circus.

700
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,842
It's time we went. There's
that fire picket.

701
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:30,093
Do come again next week,
and, don't forget, bring your towels.

702
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:33,509
- You're not going already, are you?
- They've got to fire-watch.

703
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:36,464
Now, don't you let the
other boys bully you.

704
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:39,753
If you want to volunteer for the concert,
you jolly well do.

705
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,049
- Try it again without holding it.
- Right, sir.

706
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,377
Close them.

707
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,177
Now open.

708
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,885
Oh, that's perfect.

709
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,878
CAPTAIN EDWARDS: Everything all right?

710
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:57,675
Yes, thank you, sir. We had a lot of trouble
with the curtains, but they're working now.

711
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,045
Old Colonel Walmsley's coming over
and bringing a band,

712
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:04,503
and he's also going to do some monologues.
He's been very helpful, sir.

713
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,345
Well, the brigadier's coming.
What are our men doing?

714
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:10,676
Well, Cook Sergeant Trubshaw
is going to do his bird noises, sir.

715
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,595
- Beck in my platoon's going to do something.
- Good.

716
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:17,294
"It was hot that summer in Kicking Horse,
and the earth was parched and dry."

717
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,592
- Why parched and dry?
- It's parched and dry.

718
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,219
"And the town was full..."

719
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,053
Get on with it, Sid. The
exercise starts tomorrow.

720
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,970
Exercise!
Three days in the open, firing blanks.

721
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:30,088
Questions ought to be asked
in the 'Ouse about it. Waste of time.

722
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:34,588
Listen, listen. Look, would you do it like this
just to make the earth seem parched and dry?

723
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,084
"And the earth was parched and dry."

724
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,755
Yes, that's good.

725
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,255
No, it looks absurd.

726
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,585
Make up your minds. I've
got to do it in a minute.

727
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,250
You ought to have thought of that.
Serves you right.

728
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,463
I'll laugh when you forget your words,
with the brass hats there.

729
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,379
I only did it because Mrs Gillingham...

730
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:52,793
I know, I know. Come on, my lucky lads.

731
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,127
Oh! After you, Mr Barrymore.

732
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:59,464
Never mind them, son. Carry on.
Black Maguire in town. Coming?

733
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:01,675
- In a minute.
- Go on, son.

734
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,919
BREWER: It might be better
if you sing it, Sid.

735
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,423
The first item tonight is a band.

736
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,342
We are lucky to have with
us the six Pollocks,

737
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,297
who have come all the way from Hacklesfield

00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:54,501
Talavera - it's on your cap badges.

890
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,800
The other battles, too
- Barossa, Sabugal...

891
00:50:56,875 --> 00:51:01,758
At Sabugal, with four companies of riflemen,
they defeated five times Napoleon's troops.

892
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:06,089
Salamanca, Orthez, Waterloo,
Alma, Sebastopol,

893
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:09,177
Tel el Kabir, Mons, Ypres, Somme.

894
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,668
Those are battle honours.

895
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,595
You're allowed to wear that badge
with those names on it

896
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:17,250
to show that you belong
to the regiment that won them,

897
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:20,214
and that when the time comes,
you'll do as well as they did.

898
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:22,793
Last year, that badge was in France.

899
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,843
This year, in Libya.

900
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,334
It hasn't been disgraced yet.

901
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,467
Now you're wearing it.

902
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,133
I know what went wrong today.

903
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,342
It so happens that Captain Edwards doesn't.

904
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:39,550
You needn't worry. I'm
not going to tell him.

905
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:44,295
He's quite depressed as it is to think that it was
his company that let the whole battalion down.

906
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,212
But I just want to tell you this.

907
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:51,505
If you ever get near any real fighting -
I don't suppose you'll ever be good enough -

908
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:56,004
but if you do, you'll find that you're
looking to other men not to let you down.

909
00:51:56,083 --> 00:52:00,670
If you're lucky, you'll have soldiers like Captain
Edwards and Sergeant Fletcher to look to.

910
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,341
If they're lucky, they'll
be with another company.

911
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:08,803
All right, Sergeant Fletcher,
they can have their tea.

912
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,464
Platoon, 'shun!

913
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:17,005
All right, get the rest of your stuff off
and fall in outside in five minutes.

914
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,009
What's up?

915
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,928
To hear him talk, you'd
think we'd lost the war.

916
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,091
Yes.

917
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,217
He'll be as bad as the sergeant now.

918
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:44,003
Come on, Johnson! Come on!
Mr Perry's miles ahead! Let's catch him up!

919
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,175
(Gunfire)

920
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:56,342
(Explosion)

921
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:04,091
One more go
for the day you missed on the exercise.

922
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:23,630
Was that any better, sir?

923
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:27,882
- 17½. Sergeant Fletcher!
- Sir?

924
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,884
- What was it this time, sir?
- 17½.

925
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,459
- That's better than the other platoons, sir.
- Yes.

926
00:53:37,542 --> 00:53:42,176
Hoo! 17½ minutes.
That doesn't sound humanly possible.

927
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,798
You didn't do it in 17½.
You were right behind.

928
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,672
- So was Bert. Weren't you?
- Just in front of you, though.

929
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,341
Ah, what does it matter? He doesn't
care if we break our perishin' necks.

930
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:54,297
How much better do we have to be
to get a thank-you out of him?

931
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:55,927
- I don't blame him.
- What?

932
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,715
- Listen who's talking.
- He's been jolly decent to me.

933
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:01,174
You weren't there, you twerp, so shut up.

934
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,342
We only did it for a joke, anyway.

935
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:06,799
You'd think he'd be decent
enough to see that.

936
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,001
- Parsons!
- Sergeant.

937
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,256
Over here.

938
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:17,382
Well, we've asked for it and we've got it.
For the duration.

939
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,508
Cunning little beggar, sucking up.

940
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,260
- If Bill doesn't come soon, there'll be no tea.
- Good. Serve him right.

941
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:27,095
I wonder what he was sucking up
to Perry and Fletcher for.

942
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,335
Trying to get some more
leave, I should think.

943
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:31,254
- So long, boys.
- Cheerio, Marjorie.

944
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:33,716
- Steady on with that sugar.
- Here are the scones.

945
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:36,883
Isn't Bill down yet?

946
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:39,092
I do hope the bath water's still hot.

947
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:41,383
- How's the leg now, Bert?
- Thank you.

948
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:43,675
It's rather worse since
I put the iodine on it.

949
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,302
It'll be better later, I expect.

950
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:49,084
You should see my leg, Mrs Gillingham.
It's got a bruise as big as that plate.

951
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:51,170
Just put those down there to keep hot, Ted.

952
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,296
It's agony to move it.
I did it on that perishing tree obstacle.

953
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,255
Take it slower if you can't do
it without hurting yourself.

954
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:01,635
I didn't notice you taking it slower. You were
so busy trying to impress our loving officer.

955
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,379
- Look here!
- Shut up, both of you.

956
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,010
Boys, boys!

957
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:07,086
I don't know what's come over you lately.

958
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:09,881
- Well...
- Now, stop quarrelling and eat your scones.

959
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,926
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

960
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,046
Ah, here's Bill. Now, he's not grumpy.

961
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,459
- Sorry I've been so long.
- That's all right.

962
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:19,047
Ted, give Bill a scone.

963
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,926
Oh, do have a scone, Lord Fauntleroy.

964
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,968
(Doorbell)
- Oh, I wonder who that can be.

965
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:25,839
Sure you wouldn't rather sit here, Bill?
It's more comfy.

966
00:55:25,917 --> 00:55:27,718
Thanks, Geoff. Very nice of you.

967
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:31,170
Oh, it's another soldier.

968
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,090
- It's Fletcher.
- What?

969
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,719
Fletcher.

970
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,842
He asked me about baths at the camp.

971
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:43,422
So that's what it was.

972
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:47,803
- And you told him about this place?
- Yes.

973
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:51,134
You... BF, you.

974
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:52,875
Listen.

975
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:54,635
PERRY: Mrs Gillingham?
- Yes.

976
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:58,797
PERRY: I heard you were kind enough to let
people have baths, and I wondered if...

977
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:01,838
MRS GILLINGHAM: Oh, yes. Do come in.
It's no trouble at all.

978
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:05,093
I know how difficult it is
for you boys at the camp.

979
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,798
Perhaps you'd like some tea
while the water heats up.

980
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:10,759
PERRY: Oh, thank you very much.

981
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,168
- Er... What's your name?
- Perry.

982
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,967
This is Perry, boys.

983
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,797
Oh, we have met.

984
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,759
You know each other. That's splendid.

985
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:26,377
I hope you haven't got the same dreadful
officer these poor lads have got.

986
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,427
Same one.

987
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,297
Well, not really dreadful.

988
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:36,670
- I suppose you find it very trying, too.
- Yes.

989
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:41,422
I'll pop down and tune up the boiler again.
It's no trouble.

990
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,594
Oh, dear.
He doesn't really understand it very well.

991
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,717
- Sugar?
- Please.

992
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:50,300
I...I think perhaps I'd better go down
and see what he's doing.

993
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,591
Charming woman, Mrs Gillingham, sir.

994
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:56,053
Yes, she seems very nice.

995
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:02,209
Aye. She... She lets us have
baths here every week, sir.

996
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:04,757
Oh, you're lucky. No thanks, I've got some.

997
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:08,886
Any truth in the rumour, sir,
that the sergeant major's got bronchitis?

998
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,878
Just lost his voice on parade, I think.

999
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:13,969
- Shouting, sir?
- Just giving orders, Stainer.

1000
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:15,381
(All laugh)
- Yes, sir.

1001
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:19,839
- Will you have a cake, sir?
- Oh, thank you.

1002
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,217
You shouldn't have bothered, Ted.

1003
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:26,010
- Here, Mrs G?
- Yes?

1004
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:28,549
You know that officer we was talking about?

1005
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:30,593
- Who, the horror?
- That's him.

1006
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,385
Perry?

1007
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,088
- Oh, what did I say?
- I know.

1008
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,217
Oh, my goodness!

1009
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,342
I wonder what I'd better do now.

1010
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:44,379
Well, it'll take at least a half an hour
for this to heat up.

1011
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:47,385
- I wonder if we could tell him that...
- That it's going out?

1012
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:49,627
I'm sure the lads would
appreciate it, Mrs G.

1013
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:51,676
Oh, I don't quite like to do that.

1014
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:55,210
Well, you see, it's very awkward.
Him and us don't get on well together.

1015
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:58,468
- Still...
- This'll go out in any case. You see this?

1016
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,461
- It don't work.
- No.

1017
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:03,422
I always do... this.

1018
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,300
Yes, well, of course you can do that.

1019
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:11,630
Well, of course, if you don't get on together,
perhaps it would be better if he went.

1020
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,463
- I'll tell him.
- Thanks, Mrs G.

1021
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:14,881
(Laughter)

1022
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:18,336
PERRY: The thing I never discovered was
who did lynch Black Maguire.

1023
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:21,344
- Well, sir, I was just going to explain.
- Oh, it was suicide.

1024
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:25,174
It was not suicide, sir.
The whole poem is really based on fact.

1025
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,007
Actually, a lot of people believe
that Black Maguire was never lynched.

1026
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:31,667
Mr Perry, the water will
be hot in a few minutes.

1027
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,302
Oh, thank you.

1028
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:40,053
Well, the next time we have a concert, sir,
I expect Luke could play us the bagpipes.

1029
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:41,879
LUKE: Certainly. If they'd like it.

1030
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:44,459
As long as he doesn't
practise in the barracks.

1031
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:47,125
- It's a bit near the company office.
(Laughter)

1032
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:48,418
I used to study jazz, sir.

1033
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,293
If there is another concert, I could
probably do some hot drumming or crooning.

1034
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,797
Spare us that.

1035
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:57,253
- What are you doing in the next concert, Ted?
- Concert? Who, me?

1036
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,839
Oh, I couldn't do nothing, sir.

1037
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:02,674
We wouldn't want a shambles like last time.
There must be something you can do.

1038
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,251
Well, I might... tell a few of my stories.

1039
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,550
I don't think the brigadier
would like that.

1040
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:11,963
Maybe he wouldn't like 'em in public, sir, but
if I could get him alone, he'd be delighted.

1041
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:13,712
I don't know. I tried that once.

1042
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:17,511
Captain Edwards seems quite pleased
with the platoon.

1043
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:20,345
- What, with us, sir?
- Apparently, we've improved a lot.

1044
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:22,254
How do we compare with the others, sir?

1045
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,834
Oh, they've been at it a good deal longer
than we have.

1046
00:59:24,917 --> 00:59:27,216
- Well, we can do anything they can do, sir.
- Yes!

1047
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,755
I'll hold you to that.

1048
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,844
By the way, I heard something
else that might interest you.

1049
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:34,339
Leave starts next week.

1050
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:36,087
What, for all of us, sir?

1051
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:37,802
Here, sir?

1052
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:42,011
Have you heard that one about the old man
with the long white beard in the nudist camp?

1053
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:47,919
TANNOY: This is Crewe. Crewe Station.
Crewe.

1054
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,168
Jim!

1055
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,419
Passengers for Liverpool, Shrewsbury...

1056
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,673
Jim!

1057
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,844
..and Hacklesfield should change here.

1058
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:01,632
Come on, London train.

1059
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:04,209
- What will you do when you get home?
- Put slippers on.

1060
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:07,136
- What after that, Ted?
- Send the kids off to the pictures.

1061
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,760
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

1062
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,967
- Have a good leave.
- Thank you, sir.

1063
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:12,381
Two whiskies.

1064
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:14,841
Are those the awful men
you wrote to me about?

1065
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:17,002
No, that's another lot. Quite different.

1066
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:22,218
- So that's his missus, eh? A nice bit of stuff.
- Turn it up, will you?

1067
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:24,460
- Porter, Cardiff?
- 10.43. This platform.

1068
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:26,924
- What's happened to the old 10.31?
- Took it off.

1069
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,552
Go on! Lovely service, that was.

1070
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,794
- Is the Glasgow train over the bridge?
- Yes.

1071
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,345
(Whistle blows)
- Is that us?

1072
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:35,676
- Certainly is.
- Kensal Rise, here I come!

1073
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:40,585
- Come on, Ted. Ta-ta, Geoff. Ta-ta, Luke!
- See you down there, eh?

1074
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,378
Home sweet 'ome.

1075
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,047
WIRELESS: Workers' Playtime!

1076
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:47,879
- Turn it off.
- I want it on.

1077
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,428
- Turn it off, I say.
- No!

1078
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:52,592
- Turn it off!
- Ted!

1079
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:56,294
She's your daughter.
She's got a mind of her own, too.

1080
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,468
All right. Turn it up a bit louder.

1081
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:04,422
- I suppose the Army's still all potato-peeling.
- No.

1082
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,711
You should have joined the Welsh Guards.
They sing beautifully.

1083
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:10,837
Light Infantry move faster, Mrs Daniels.

1084
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,884
- What's this on your cap?
- Badge.

1085
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:15,921
I know that, Evan, I'm not daft.
But what does it say? Tala...

1086
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,252
There you are. Talavera
was a battle we fought.

1087
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:21,011
- Did you win it?
- Of course. Those are battle honours.

1088
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:23,418
Look at the rest - Busaco,
Barossa, Sabugal.

1089
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,506
- You can't fight any war without infantry.
- Infantry stuff's as old as the hills.

1090
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,380
Air power, tanks - they're the new weapons.
Engines of war.

1091
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:33,967
The only engine the infantryman has
is his body, which has limitations.

1092
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:35,132
I don't agree.

1093
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:36,844
- What I mean is...
- Listen, Sam.

1094
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:40,544
An infantryman is one of the most
highly-skilled technical men in the Army.

1095
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:45,010
He has to be a mechanic, a gunner, an explosives
expert and an athlete, to begin with.

1096
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:48,841
He has a greater variety of weapons
than all the rest of the Army put together.

1097
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:52,591
Then he has to be trained in not just
one sort of tactics, but in every sort.

1098
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,796
Street fighting, tank hunting,
wood clearing, and all the rest.

1099
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,960
That's what we're going
onto when I get back.

1100
01:01:58,042 --> 01:02:01,004
Has the quality deteriorated, Mr Thyrtle?

1101
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,761
Not really, Mr Davenport. It's old stock.

1102
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:09,510
Of course, those cupid birdbaths that used to
be two guineas, they come out at £4.10.0 now.

1103
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,337
Purchase tax, of course.

1104
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:14,427
If I were the public, Thyrtle,
I'd do without a birdbath.

1105
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,752
- That's what it does.
- It does?

1106
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,085
But the public must be made to buy.

1107
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:22,047
Has the war completely
deprived us of initiative?

1108
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,334
Watch.

1109
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,467
Yes, madam. What can we show you?

1110
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:29,258
(Thunder rumbles)

1111
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,253
What happened to Betty and Joyce, then?

1112
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:35,470
Betty's in munitions, Joyce is in the ATS.
Got her commission.

1113
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:38,339
Should've thought you'd
have got yours by now.

1114
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:40,882
Oh, they tried to get me to take one.
I didn't want it.

1115
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:45,379
No stripes, no pips, no responsibility.
Just a nice easy life with the boys.

1116
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:48,592
(Bleating)

1117
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,710
(Water splashes)
- Ssh, Tracy!

1118
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:58,968
Mummy, there's an enormous stickleback.

1119
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:05,720
- She is sweet.
- It's been such fun, Jim.

1120
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:07,593
Yes.

1121
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:09,302
Back tomorrow.

1122
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,425
I wonder how much longer it'll last.

1123
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:25,551
Stands to reason, Rommel or no Rommel.
Attack Italy. That's what I say.

1124
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,095
Only, let the Dogs do it.

1125
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:33,093
Leave it to the Guards, or the Greencoats,
or the Skirts, or the Umbrella Danglers,

1126
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:34,553
and it ain't worth doing.

1127
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:37,635
But put the old Duke of Glendon's
Light Infantry...

1128
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,130
I daresay, I daresay.

1129
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:43,594
But the reason why we won't do it, is because
Rommel's going to be in Cairo by Christmas.

1130
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:48,171
In any case, Hitler intends to synchronise his
Egypt push with a blitzkrieg on Gibraltar.

1131
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,218
He'll have to do more than that, eh, Dicky?

1132
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:53,136
It's all very well for you to laugh.
You'll see.

1133
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:56,633
This time next year, we'll have
our back to the wall, and who's to blame?

1134
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,711
The people at the top, what are they doing?

1135
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:01,423
Sitting back and doing nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

1136

01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,550
- Come on, Macready.
- Sorry, sir.

1148
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:16,548
Well, I've called this meeting
because I've got some news for you.

1149
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,677
The information I have is security,

1150
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,713
so I know I can depend on you
to keep your mouths shut about it.

1151
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:24,462
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

1152
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:28,251
I don't know very much about it myself,
but we're going abroad.

1153
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,842
The circumstances are rather unusual,
because, for security reasons,

1154
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:34,714
we're not getting ordinary
embarkation leave. Instead...

1155
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:39,673
- Are they still there, Sergeant Major?
- I don't know.

1156
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,251
It would be something
if we got our marching orders.

1157
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:44,885
Yes.

1158
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:49,296
The lads need it. They're fully trained
and fighting fit. They want action.

1159
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,010
I don't blame 'em.

1160
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:54,129
The papers may have forgotten
Greece and Crete, but I haven't.

1161
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:57,135
- What do you say?
- Yes, I reckon you've earned it all right.

1162
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,377
- Well, so have you.
- I'm getting on, Ned.

1163
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,094
Mobile war's a young man's job.

1164
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:04,592
Office work's more in my line nowadays.
I can see it in the old man's eye.

1165
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:08,341
- Ah, you're kidding. Office work, you?
- Well, I've got plenty of it, ain't I?

1166
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:10,550
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

1167
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:14,714
- Hello. I thought you'd be in the mess.
- No, sir. Just clearing up one or two things.

1168
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:18,800
Well, the Colonel's given
us some good news.

1169
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,802
Oh, yes, sir? What er...
sort of good news, sir?

1170
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:25,004
We're going on a two months' course,
towards the end of October.

1171
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:28,876
- What er... kind of course, sir?
- Something new.

1172
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:33,177
- Must be. We've done nearly everything now.
- It's important. Leave's been put forward.

1173
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,802
I see, sir.

1174
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:37,885
Everybody has to have their seven days
by the end of September.

1175
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:41,965
Very well, sir. I'll see the sergeant major
in the morning about the leave roster.

1176
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,630
- Sergeant Fletcher?
- Yes, sir?

1177
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:48,761
When you tell the men...
don't tell them what you're thinking.

1178
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,168
- No, sir. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1179
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:54,751
♪ And I was the only boy

1180
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:59,543
- Nothing like a good old sing-song.
- Horrible noise coming from somewhere.

1181
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:03,133
- I think it was Fletcher's lovely voice.
- It's this lot, harmonising.

1182
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:07,048
- I used to sing in a choir till my voice broke.
- Aw, then they called you up.

1183
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:10,005
- Just a moment.
- Ten minutes till lights out, Sergeant.

1184
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:12,003
All right, I haven't said a word, have I?

1185
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:16,336
Now, listen. I've got
some good news for you.

1186
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:22,171
In October, we're all going off on a
special course of two months' training.

1187
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:26,007
And I should say... it's
going to be very tiring.

1188
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,715
So the CO has brought all
leave forward a bit.

1189
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:30,795
That's something, anyway.

1190
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:34,419
Well, I thought you'd like to know,
so that you can write home and so forth.

1191
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,089
That's all.

1192
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:40,177
The new leave list will be out tomorrow.
Good night.

1193
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,590
Good night, sarge.

1194
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:44,961
- We get our leave early, anyway.
- And the next later, don't forget.

1195
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:48,171
I wonder what it is.
We've done everything twice already.

1196
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:51,758
Well, I can tell you what it is.
They've got no real fighting for us to do.

1197
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:54,511
So somebody says,
"What shall we do with the 9th Dogs?"

1198
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:58,885
Somebody else says, "Why not give them a bit
of training? That always keeps them quiet."

1199
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,759
Still, leave won't be so bad, will it?

1200
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:05,669
I read in the paper the other day that we're
not going to open a second front till 1947.

1201
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,511
If we don't get some action soon,
I want my cards back.

1202
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,338
Perhaps we're going to be paratroops.

1203
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:14,553
I'd like to see a battalion of motorised
infantry dropped by parachute.

1204
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,547
- Who's room orderly tomorrow?
- I am.

1205
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:21,719
Better clean out the inside of that stove.
It's full of fag ends.

1206
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:22,882
OK.

1207
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:27,759
I wonder why the sergeant was so pleased
with himself.

1208
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,883
He wants to get home to his wife.

1209
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,713
Yes, I suppose that's it.

1210
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:36,134
She has my sympathy.
Fancy seven whole days with him by numbers.

1211
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:40,131
It's a funny thing, but there was a time
when I couldn't imagine him having a wife.

1212
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,383
Pity seven days is so short, eh?

1213
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:46,552
(Train whistle)

1214
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,303
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Bill. You'll be back soon.

1215
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,010
That's right, Hilda.

1216
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:57,172
- Hello, Ted.
- Aye, aye.

1217
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,006
- Hello, Bert. Have a nice leave?
- Yes. Fine, thanks.

1218
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,584
It's very nice of you
to come and see me off, Thyrtle.

1219
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,250
Pleasure, Davenport.
Pleased to have seen you again.

1220
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:08,881
TANNOY: Take your seats on the 10.40.

1221
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:15,668
- Hello, Luke. Have a good leave?
- Oh, grand, Sergeant, thanks.

1222
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,800
- Will I take your coat?
- Thanks.

1223
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,629
- Well, goodbye, dear.
- Bye-bye.

1224
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:22,754
Funny sort of war, isn't it?
Here one minute and gone the next.

1225
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:25,381
That's right. Is that Mr Perry over there?

1226
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:29,426
- Yes.
- Looks all right.

1227
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,585
Good as a regular... almost.

1228
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,793
Goodbye, dear.

1229
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:36,466
It's funny how much of our lives
we seem to spend on platforms.

1230
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:40,381
Yes, the amount of times we've said goodbye
on this one in the last three years...

1231
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:42,212
I wonder what we'll look like in 1970.

1232
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:48,464
Darling, don't wait.

1233
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:50,592
Jimmy,

1234
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:53,796
if you should ever go away
without saying goodbye to me...

1235
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,546
..I'd never forgive you, you know.

1236
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,673
(Whistle blows)

1237
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,298
- You'd better get in, Geoff. We're due out.
- OK, Sid.

1238
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:09,049
Now, don't forget. Any special thing
you want... It's your birthday soon.

1239
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:12,254
- I'll let you know, Dad.
- Bless you, son. Take care of yourself.

1240
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,543
I will.

1241
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,968
I won't wait.

1242
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:24,876
(Whistle blows)

1243
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:28,134
Goodbye, darling. See you soon.
Don't be too easy with Phyllis.

1244
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:33,500
- Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
- I will. See you in a fortnight's time.

1245
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:35,135
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.

1246
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:37,377
- God bless you, dear.
- God bless.

1247
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,635
GUARD: Blinds down!

1248
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,875
Goodbye!

1249
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:10,343
(Ship's hooter)

1250
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,845
She won't half be wild.
"See you in a fortnight," I said.

1251
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:18,797
Don't worry, Ted.
We're going abroad to a nice warm climate.

1252
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,464
I can taste the bananas already.

1253
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,630
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1254
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,423
- Any idea where it is we're going?
- The rumour's Burma.

1255
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,215
- Jungle fighting.
- They say it takes a year to learn it.

1256
01:11:30,292 --> 01:11:31,761
Oh, not our platoon, sir.

1257
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:34,220
(Bell clangs)

1258
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:36,544
Perhaps we're going for
a trip round the world.

1259
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,418
I don't care where we're going. I'm ready
for anywhere, except maybe Iceland.

1260
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,719
- We wouldn't go there with all this transport.
- They've made mistakes before now.

1261
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:47,044
Not that way. Put the ring over the hook.

1262
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,175
I wonder where we are going.

1263
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,720
Ssh! Listen.

1264
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:53,883
(Muffled creaking)

1265
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,713
We're moving.

1266
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,754
One, two!

1267
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,004
One, two!

1268
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:09,585
Deep! Get that lovely
fresh air in your lungs!

1269
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,628
Come on, Mr Perry. I can see you.

1270
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,758
Come on, sir. Come on.

1271
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:16,836
Steady! Break off!

1272
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:20,295
It's going round the ship
that we passed Gibraltar during the night.

1273
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,343
- Is there any truth...?
- I have no idea.

1274
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:26,505
- I think I saw the outline of the Rock, sir.
- It was the shadow of that ship out there.

1275
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:29,428
I haven't heard anything.
When I do, I'll pass it on to you.

1276
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,005
Where do you think we are, Beck?

1277
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:34,757
Oh, I should say one...
no er... two days from the Cape, sir.

1278
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,385
(Laughter)

1279
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:37,928
All right, sit down.

1280
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:41,960
Well, we've just had some very good news.

1281
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:46,000
Major Edwards is telling the rest of the
Company and I'm passing it on to you.

1282
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:50,006
The 8th Army have just won a big victory at
El Alamein and Rommel is in full retreat.

1283
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,133
(Cheering)

1284
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,377
Whoa! You haven't heard half of it yet.

1285
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:59,459
Now, we, in this convoy, are part of a big
invasion force, American as well as British,

1286
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,924
that is going to French North Africa

1287
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,876
to remove the enemy from there
and then cut Rommel's only line of retreat.

1288
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:09,424
We land about 40 hours from now.

1289
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,843
I can't quite tell you where yet,
but I can tell you this.

1290
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:15,418
This is the first step
in the great offensive

1291
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,636
that's going to make Hitler and Mussolini
put up the shutters and go out of business.

1292
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:21,758
(Laughter)

1293
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:25,211
Now, in the past,
we've all had our ups and downs,

1294
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:27,626
and many of us have been pretty fed up
at times.

1295
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:30,091
Not people like Brewer and Davenport,
of course.

1296
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:31,458
(Laughter)

1297
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:34,090
However, that's all behind us now,

1298
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:39,251
and it looks as though all this training we did
is going to come in pretty handy after all.

1299
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,716
Now, I'll just give you what details I can.

1300
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:45,091
(Bell clangs)

1301
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,717
Now, if we land at Phillipville,

1302
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:55,754
there's a three-star hotel there
with an American bar

1303
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:57,836
which would doubtless have beer in stock.

1304
01:13:57,917 --> 01:14:02,172
Those who prefer more exotic beverages
will find your curiosity amply satisfied

1305
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:06,422
at the mysterious bazaars and coffeehouses
of the kasbah, or Muslim Quarter.

1306
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,669
They ought to make you a corporal for that.

1307
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:12,886
We did a brochure on Algeria in '38. Of course,
it's not the kind of beer we're used to.

1308
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:16,088
He only started to drink ginger beer
before we left home.

1309
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:18,419
I can't see us having much time for beer.

1310
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:22,008
No, action, eh? With all this equipment.

1311
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,798
Yes, I shan't be sorry
when we get going with it.

1312
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,880
We won't half have something
to write home about now, eh?

1313
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,633
(Muffled explosion)

1314
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:39,507
(Muffled explosion)

1315
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:42,883
Jerries are round again.

1316
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,175
(Engines hum)

1317
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,550
(Muffled explosion)

1318
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:22,883
(Muffled explosion)

1319
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:39,219
- What's that noise, mate? Guns?
- No, depth charges.

1320
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:42,302
I shouldn't let anyone
catch you smoking in here, if I were you.

1321
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:52,717
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1322
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,508
- Good evening, sir.
- Brewer.

1323
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:13,508
- I'll be glad when...
(Explosion)

1324
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:41,423
Stand still!

1325
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:45,092
Now, walk to your boat stations.

1326
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:52,134
(Alarm rings)

1327
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:57,461
Do that up, Luke. Rifle, Sidley.
Fletcher, go to the boat station.

1328
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:59,794
No-one is to go near a
boat till they're told to.

1329
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,843
- All right here?
- What was it? Torpedo?

1330
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,126
Yes, on the port side.

1331
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,047
(Alarm rings)
- Fire started in No.4 hold, sir.

1332
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:08,334
(Klaxon)

1333
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:11,960
Get that hose along! And
tell the engineers!

1334
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:22,345
(Alarm rings)

1335
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:30,294
Clear that gear away from the bridge!

1336
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,378
- Hodges?
- Sir!

1337
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,631
- Woodward?
- Sergeant!

1338
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:34,834
Robinson?

1339
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:37,002
- Livingstone?
- Sir.

1340
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:39,715
Call the roll.

1341
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,877
- Stewart?
- Sir.

1342
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:43,594
- Jackson?
- Sir.

1343
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,504
- Peters?
- Sergeant.

1344
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:51,129
Get that hose over here!
That hose! Look out!

1345
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:58,761
- Are you all right over there?
- OK!

1346
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,220
Mr Mate!

1347
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:02,674
Yes. What is it?

1348
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:06,045
The cargo's shifting!
Can I have some more hands below?

1349
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,298
Right!

1350
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,835
- You fellows there, come with me.
- Leave your rifles here. Follow me.

1351
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:30,501
Bosun?

1352
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:32,551
Yes. What is it?

1353
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,675
Starting on the upper twin deck.

1354
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,469
Fire on the upper twin deck, sir.

1355
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:38,959
Get below.
Keep the magazine cool with the hoses.

1356
01:18:39,042 --> 01:18:40,547
You, you three, go with him.

1357
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:44,631
The rest of you, lose as much weight as
possible from this side of the ship.

1358
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:48,845
- Start with this transport.
- Over the side with these trucks!

1359
01:18:48,917 --> 01:18:52,425
Unship those rails!

1360
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:57,594
- Can't we get that stuff out of the magazine?
- 200 tons of it.

1361
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,715
Come on, get a bloody move on!

1362
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,258
- All our new stuff, eh, sir?
- I know.

1363
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,004
Right, brake off!

1364
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:27,633
Take this rope! Make it fast there!

1365
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:32,010
Make it snappy!
Chuck that sling over them rails! Look out!

1366
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:38,342
Chuck that rope round the back of it!

1367
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:57,002
Now put a chock in front of that carrier.

1368
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,964
Get another hose on that magazine!

1369
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:08,755
That magazine'll save us
the trouble in a minute!

1370
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:25,668
- Hold it! Hold it!
- She's going! She's going!

1371
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,382
12 feet of water in No.4!

1372
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,544
No.5 bulkhead's bulging!

1373
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:58,177
Brake off!

1374
01:21:06,667 --> 01:21:09,215
Bosun! How's it going? What's the position?

1375
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:12,468
- I can't hold it any longer.
- Right, I'll tell the skipper.

1376
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:20,007
The fire's out of control down there!
We can't hold it any longer!

1377
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:24,042
Right! Destroyer coming alongside!
Abandon ship!

1378
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:29,173
Abandon ship! Destroyer on starboard side!

1379
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,965
Other side! Abandon ship!

1380
01:21:32,042 --> 01:21:34,590
(Hooter blasts)

1381
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,295
That soldier there!

1382
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,467
(Hooter blasts)

1383
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:19,545
Destroyer calling trooper,
am coming alongside.

1384
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,675
Get your men down as fast as you can.

1385
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:24,885
Look out for my heaving lines.

1386
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:31,380
Let down your nets.

1387
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:39,593
I'm sending some men aboard to help you.

1388
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:44,212
Come on down, mate.
Want to have a look at the bonfire?

1389
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:50,048
Don't look down, Bert.

1390
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,589
Keep clear of the nets.

1391
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:14,718
Take it easy, men. Don't rush. Don't rush.

1392
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,754
Get that rope!

1393
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:33,467
Round the wheel!

1394
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,091
Luke!

1395
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:56,053
How many more men are there?
Time we were leaving.

1396
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,213
Right!

1397
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,634
Come on, sir, it's time we were away.

1398
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,502
Get your nets adrift. Get down, men.

1399
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:54,882
Keep your heads down.
She may go any minute.

1400
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:07,927
(Explosion)

1401
01:25:22,292 --> 01:25:25,302
I knew we needn't have bothered
with them carriers.

1402
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,757
She might have gone up sooner if we hadn't.

1403
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,094
A nice lot of transport, that.
The best we've had.

1404
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:34,881
- All right here, boys?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

1405
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:36,547
How's the sergeant?

1406
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:39,920
The doctor says he'll be all
right in a week. He was lucky.

1407
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,133
What happened to your hand, Stainer?
A burn?

1408
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:44,009
It's just a graze, sir. It's nothing.

1409
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:47,213
- Take care of it. Have you got a dressing?
- Yes, sir.

1410
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:51,843
I expect the Colonel will be pretty disappointed
when he finds himself with only half a battalion.

1411
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:55,377
They can't start without us, though,
can they, sir?

1412
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:57,876
In this ship, we'll get there before them.

1413
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:00,175
Yes, that's right.

1414
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:05,470
I'm sorry, boys. I'm
afraid we're out of it.

1415
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:08,379
We're being taken back to Gibraltar.

1416
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:14,668
The Hampshire Regiment,

1417
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:18,175
the Lincolnshire Regiment
and units of the Guards.

1418
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,300
I don't know.

1419
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,255
They seem to have forgotten all about us,
they do.

1420
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:26,011
No wonder they've made
no progress in Tunisia.

1421
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:30,718
There's not a sign of the Dogs anywhere.
Not since Crete.

1422
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:33,754
Too many Guardsmen up the top,
that's the trouble.

1423
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:36,299
Still, the 8th Army ain't doing so bad.

1424
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:40,428
If the government only kept its eyes open
and put the Dogs in when there was trouble,

1425
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,886
the war'd be over by now.

1426
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:44,044
It ain't the government's fault, Bobby.

1427
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:47,052
That's who I blame.
The government, the men at the top.

1428
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:51,799
I wonder what they have done with the Dogs.

1429
01:26:57,917 --> 01:26:59,920
(Chattering)

1430
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,002
What does your husband say, Mrs Brewer?

1431
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:05,133
He says things are still very dull.

1432
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:07,258
Well, they all say that, don't they?

1433
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,502
I don't care how dull it
is as long as he's safe.

1434
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:11,302
They're glad they've left the Rock.

1435
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:14,883
Of course, he couldn't say Gibraltar
because of the censor, but I know.

1436
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:17,885
They must be either in Algeria or Tunisia,
mustn't they?

1437
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:19,380
If only we knew.

1438
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,461
- Perhaps it's better we don't know.
- Mm.

1439
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:24,339
Ted says there's a stripe
going, and old Perry...

1440
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:26,716
He says your husband's
certain to give it to him.

1441
01:27:26,792 --> 01:27:29,091
You've no more recent news than that,
have you?

1442
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:32,959
Bill says something about a stripe, too.
He says he has a sporting chance.

1443
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:35,543
- I wonder whether you...
- I'm afraid I don't know.

1444
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,675
All Jim writes about are the flies.

1445
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,800
(Buzzing)

1446
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,550
(Distant engines)

1447
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:38,299
Where the hell are we?

1448
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:40,176
- You're driving.
- What a dump.

1449
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:44,007
Not even a flick house with an army picture.
I'd hate to be an Arab in peacetime.

1450
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,423
How about them harems?

1451
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,717
I haven't seen any yet. Nothing but flies.

1452
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:55,547
Talk about "the mysterious East".

1453
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:59,678
I reckon Lyons Corner House, Coventry Street's,
got more mystery than what this has.

1454
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,634
This isn't strictly speaking the East.

1455
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:02,799
What is it, then?

1456
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:05,838
You could call it the Middle East,
or the Near East, at a pinch.

1457
01:29:05,917 --> 01:29:08,761
Heaven preserve us from the Far East,
that's what I say.

1458
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:12,626
Perry! That's your area over there.
By Rispoli's cafe.

1459
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,173
Right, sir.

1460
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,506
You come with me.

1461
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:17,756
Beck!

1462
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:31,506
Good afternoon.

1463
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,752
Beck, tell him that this
is the platoon area,

1464
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:36,417
and we hope he'll cooperate with us
while we're here.

1465
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:41,086
Monsieur le Lieutenant dit qu'ici est le
centre de l'Arrondissement de notre platoon

1466
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:44,627
et qu'il invite votre coopération
pendant notre séjour.

1467
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:46,546
- Ah, oui!
- He laughs at the idea, sir.

1468
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:50,583
Tell him we're going to kick the Germans
out of his country. Maybe he'll like that.

1469
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:54,127
Monsieur le Lieutenant dit que nous voulons
vous désemparer des boches.

1470
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:57,633
- Et sûrement vous voulez la même chose.
- Je veux qu'on me fiche la paix.

1471
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,095
Says he's a pacifist, sir.

1472
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:03,255
Monsieur, il y a des batailles qui se déroulent
dans le nord et dans le sud et dans l'est.

1473
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:06,711
Ici, il n'y a rien. Allez là-bas
dans les grandes villes, à Sutre.

1474
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:09,636
Je n'ai pas le droit de vous permettre
de rester ici.

1475
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:13,715
Dites-lui, s'il veut des batailles,
que je peux lui donner des renseignements.

1476
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:18,426
He says to tell you, sir, that the fighting's in the
north, in the south, in the east, but not here.

1477
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,886
He's telling us.

1478
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:22,210
And that he cherishes the
peace in these parts.

1479
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:25,136
He invites us to go to Sutre,
where there are many Germans.

1480
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:29,131
He says that Sutre's a bigger place than
this. That is a fact, incidentally, sir.

1481
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:31,294
If you wish, he can give
us an address or two.

1482
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:34,718
That's very cosy of him. Our orders
are to stay here, and here we stay.

1483
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:36,795
- Monsieur...
- Je déteste les soldats!

1484
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:38,594
Je déteste le bruit! Allez vous-en!

1485
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:40,835
He's not very fond of
noise, sir, or of troops.

1486
01:30:40,917 --> 01:30:43,251
Repeats that he's a pacifist
and invites us to go.

1487
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,590
Allez, filez!

1488
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:47,712
- He says...
- I've got it. Sergeant Fletcher, we'll move in.

1489
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:49,261
Very good, sir.

1490
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:02,379
Rock, nothing but rock.

1491
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,627
Fancy having to farm
this stuff, poor devils.

1492
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:08,501
- Well, it ain't exactly a picnic for us.
- Aye, but we haven't got to live here.

1493
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:10,717
Why should the enemy
want to take this place?

1494
01:31:10,792 --> 01:31:13,174
No such luck. We won't
even see him from here.

1495
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:16,130
Now who's worrying?
It couldn't be you, could it, Brewer?

1496
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:19,503
No, sir, it's Luke here.
He's worrying about how the farmers get on.

1497
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:22,084
Let's hope we won't be here long enough
to find out.

1498
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:25,426
- Are we moving, sir?
- Not yet. That's what I'm here to tell you.

1499
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,420
- All here, Fletcher?
- Just coming, sir.

1500
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,918
FLETCHER: At the double, there! Hurry up!

1501
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,920
Are we going to have an ENSA concert, sir?

1502
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,046
No, I think the concert parties
are a little further forward.

1503
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:36,879
- All here, Fletcher?
- Yes, sir.

1504
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:40,170
I'll give you the full details later,
but the form is roughly this.

1505
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,668
Our battalion's in reserve
in these villages here,

1506
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:46,093
and a long way out in front,
our troops are in contact with the enemy.

1507
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,300
You may see the German
Verey lights at night.

1508
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,259
Well, we're still a long way from them,

1509
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:53,545
but there's no reason why
we shouldn't keep on our toes, is there?

1510
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,344
Cheer up, Davenport. What's that?

1511
01:31:56,417 --> 01:31:58,633
Some sort of tortoise, sir.

1512
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:01,340
There's a lot of them.
Some of the men keep them as pets.

1513
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:03,467
I'm glad somebody in the place is friendly.

1514
01:32:03,542 --> 01:32:06,386
Now, this cafe.
The man there doesn't seem to like us much.

1515
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:09,220
He may improve with care,
so try not to break the place up,

1516
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:11,425
and be on your best behaviour, right?

1517
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,750
- Right, sir.
- Very good, sir.

1518
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:16,212
(Traditional Arabic music on wireless)

1519
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,169
(Volume increases)

1520
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:33,419
Nice, friendly country, this.

1521
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,840
Look at him. What's up?

1522
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:37,797
He hasn't read the Beveridge Report,
that's what's wrong.

1523
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:39,713
I haven't read it myself, come to that.

1524
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:42,470
He wanted us to leave him alone,
fight somewhere else.

1525
01:32:42,542 --> 01:32:45,635
- I don't blame him. I don't blame us, either.
- Here.

1526
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:49,084
What about this? Couldn't we have a game?

1527
01:32:49,167 --> 01:32:50,802
Go on, Sid, ask him.

1528
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:53,838
Ahem! Er... Monsieur le patron!

1529
01:32:53,917 --> 01:32:58,302
Est-ce que vous serez très incommodé
si nous jouons un peu de darts?

1530
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:06,053
Vous avez de l'objection?

1531
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:10,052
Go on, put it up and play.

1532
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:12,673
Come on, Beck. It's time
to go and get orders.

1533
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:16,630
Och, come on.

1534
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:23,252
Cor! Look at that!

1535
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:24,755
LLOYD: Verey lights.

1536
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,384
BECK: I wonder if they're ours.

1537
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:30,259
Yeah.

1538
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:32,625
Pretty near, too.

1539
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,344
Kind of creepy, isn't it?

1540
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:38,510
Come on.

1541
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,378
Nothing like it.

1542
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:47,300
(Dan hits board)
- 21.

1543
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:49,425
(Dan hits board)
- 39.

1544
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,338
Well done. 39.

1545
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:53,669
Ah, well, it's been a nice game, boys.

1546
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,172
Simple.

1547
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,885
We'll court the audience.

1548
01:33:57,958 --> 01:33:59,084
9.

1549
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:00,885
Er... 21.

1550
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:06,507
- How do we stand, Bert?
- You're 19 down.

1551
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:08,918
- Hey, what's the idea?
- Go on, let him have a go.

1552
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,176
- Let him break up the game?
- It doesn't matter. Let him have a go.

1553
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,253
(Speaks local dialect)

1554
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:20,667
Look, he's taking cover.
Thinks it's a spear.

1555
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:23,168
(Cheering)

1556
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,170
Very good! Very good!

1557
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:28,593
Sacré crétin!
Tu veux voir ma maison en ruines?

1558
01:34:28,667 --> 01:34:31,961
Idiot, espèce d'andouille... Un grand trou.

1559
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:35,133
Méchant.

1560
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:52,383
- Well played, sir!
- Beautifully played!

1561
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:54,876
- Why can't you play like that?
- Beginner's luck.

1562
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:58,336
Vous voyez, il n'est pas nécessaire
de désacrer les maisons d'autres.

1563
01:34:58,417 --> 01:35:00,669
Allez, filez, filez!
C'est très désagréable!

1564
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:06,095
Et vous, vous vous conduisez comme ça devant
les Anglais... Une honte! C'est terrible, ça!

1565
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:08,882
(Turns music off)

1566
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,131
Continuez.

1567
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:23,926
- Come on, George! Come on!
- You can do it easily. That's the stuff.

1568
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,880
Not bad, eh?
Here, now what you want is double two.

1569
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:29,175
- Two, two.
- Two, two.

1570
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:32,677
- Good job!
- Oh, beautiful, eh?

1571
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:36,009
What about beginner's luck?
He's played like this for three weeks.

1572
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:37,553
All right, all right.

1573
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:40,635
- What's the lecture today, sarge?
- Aircraft recognition.

1574
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:43,589
WIRELESS: ..has been as fine
as anywhere in England.

1575
01:35:43,667 --> 01:35:46,547
Yes, it's been a good year all round
in Berkshire.

1576
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:49,801
The potatoes and sugar beet
look like coming on nicely.

1577
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:52,885
And other crops are also satisfactory.

1578
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:58,719
Of course, Michaelmas has been considered for
ages the termination of the farmers' year.

1579
01:35:58,792 --> 01:36:00,297
But things have altered.

1580
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:04,843
Thousands of boys and girls on holiday from
school have been helping in the fields,

1581
01:36:04,917 --> 01:36:08,128
and working like Trojans
in the harvest camps.

1582
01:36:09,292 --> 01:36:12,551
It warms a farmer's heart
to see a thing like I saw last week

1583
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:14,675
in the village of Redshaw-by-Farrow.

1584
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:18,045
A little girl,
she couldn't have been older than five...

1585
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:20,294
Switch it off. Platoon, 'shun!

1586
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:24,543
All right, sit down. Smoke if you want to.

1587
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,880
Afternoon.

1588
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:35,882
I had hoped that we would have seen
rather more enemy aircraft round here,

1589
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:40,047
so you could have kept up with your aircraft
recognition without using these models.

1590
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:44,048
However, all we have seen is a couple of
dreary-looking reconnaissance planes,

1591
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:48,001
so we'll run through the German types,
to make sure you haven't forgotten them.

1592
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,086
We'll start off with a few questions.

1593
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:52,798
What's this one? Davenport?

1594
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:55,008
- Messerschmitt 109F, sir.
- That's right.

1595
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:57,963
This one? Luke?

1596
01:36:58,042 --> 01:36:59,713
- Stuka, sir.
- That's right.

1597
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,678
- Brewer?
- Focke-Wulf 190, sir.

1598
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:08,668
- Stainer?
- Lysander, sir.

1599
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:14,299
Parsons, what's the difference between
a Lysander and a Henschel 126?

1600
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:16,343
The wings of the Henschel are swept back,

1601
01:37:16,417 --> 01:37:19,131
and on the Lizzy
they look as if they're swept forward.

1602
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:29,505
- Steiner, have you got that machine of yours?
- Yes, sir.

1603
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:33,127
Well, play it. And the rest of
you, for heaven's sake, sing.

I wonder what's up.

1626

One hour's notice and then stand-to.

Look at it now.

1628

I suppose that's what the
papers call an inferno.

1630
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:50,719
The Jerries have attacked
and broken through up forward.

1631
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:57,922
- All right here?
- Yes, sir.

1632
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:08,171
- Lummy, I could do with a fag.
- Ssh!

1633
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,300
(Silence)

1634
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:46,128
(Gunfire)

1635
01:40:58,375 --> 01:40:59,761
I say, Corporal?

1636
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:01,801
Quiet, Beck.

1637
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:23,918
Thank you.

1638
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,959
(Mortar whistles)

1639
01:42:01,417 --> 01:42:03,088
Watch your front!

1640
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:07,427
FLETCHER: Watch your front!

1641
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,918
(Distant engines)

1642
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:13,129
Listen. What's that?

1643
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:16,135
(Distant engines)

1644
01:42:18,167 --> 01:42:20,335
- Sergeant Fletcher?
FLETCHER: Sir?

1645
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:25,044
Do you hear that?

1646
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:26,547
PERRY: Tanks.

1647
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,959
I'll go over and have a
look at that section.

1648
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:31,673
(Tanks rumble closer)

1649
01:42:41,042 --> 01:42:44,052
(Rumbling and creaking)

1650
01:42:45,167 --> 01:42:46,719
Here they come.

1651
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:53,803
Section! Enemy in front!

1652
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:57,594
Rapid!

1653
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:06,844
Come on, come on.

1654
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:10,428
Fire!

1655
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,006
Change!

1656
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:44,046
- Your men all right?
- Yes, fine, sir.

1657
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:45,216
Good. Listen.

1658
01:43:45,292 --> 01:43:49,380
They've broken through behind B Company
and we've been ordered back to the village.

1659
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:51,094
(Bomb whistles)

1660
01:43:51,167 --> 01:43:52,838
(Explosion)

1661
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,926
- Maria, aux caves!
- Mais...

1662
01:44:06,001 --> 01:44:07,127
C'est un ordre!

1663
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:22,333
Ça y est! Ça y est! Au secours!

1664
01:44:27,833 --> 01:44:30,050
At the double! Davenport, Luke, over here!

1665
01:44:47,668 --> 01:44:49,303
(Gunfire)

1666
01:44:55,208 --> 01:44:56,250
Mortar.

1667
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,467
- Where the hell is it? Can you see it?
- No, sir.

1668
01:45:03,542 --> 01:45:05,461
Let's try down below.

1669
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:09,215
(Gunfire continues)

1670
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:17,261
I think I've spotted it!

1671
01:45:17,334 --> 01:45:21,672
- Where?
- There! Firing from behind that wall.

1672
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,220
Follow me, Beck.

1673
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:41,756
Brewer, come on.

1674
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:45,418
(Explosion)

1675
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:48,129
Come on, Fletcher! Luke! This way!

1676
01:45:56,833 --> 01:46:01,468
Fletcher, see that six-pounder across the
street? I'm going to try and get it working.

1677
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:03,545
Luke and Brewer will come with me as cover.

1678
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:07,252
- I want you too, Beck. You take over.
- Very good, sir.

1679
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:13,131
- Now, across the street... and run like hell.
- Good luck, chaps.

1680
01:46:19,334 --> 01:46:22,677
See that Vickers? Take it into
Rispoli's and cover us from there.

1681
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:26,175
If we keep their heads down on that hill
it will be all right. Go on.

1682
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:48,970
- Venez donc!
- Non, laissez-moi!

1683
01:47:00,708 --> 01:47:02,297
Now, Beck.

1684
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:09,883
(Machine-gun fire)

1685
01:47:16,334 --> 01:47:18,384
(Rapid gunfire)

1686
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:35,591
What's the matter with it, Luke?

1687
01:47:36,668 --> 01:47:38,552
Dry. Bone dry.

1688
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:40,628
And ruddy hot!

1689
01:47:41,708 --> 01:47:44,802
Pass auf! Pass auf!

1690
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:49,928
Da!

1691
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:52,923
Come on!

1692
01:47:56,792 --> 01:47:59,423
- Look who's here.
- Attendez! Attendez!

1693
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:07,251
Down!

1694
01:48:12,167 --> 01:48:15,094
- Ça va aller.
- Here.

1695
01:48:57,001 --> 01:48:58,423
Right, Beck.

1696
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:13,379
That's the last one, sir.

1697
01:49:22,917 --> 01:49:24,339
One of them gone, anyway.

1698
01:49:30,417 --> 01:49:32,882
- Are you both all right?
- Right, sir!

1699
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:34,961
Well, come on back with me, quick!

1700
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:55,469
(Gunfire recedes)

1701
01:50:01,042 --> 01:50:04,336
- Check the ammunition, Lloyd.
- Yes, sir.

1702
01:50:04,417 --> 01:50:07,510
- What have you got, Geoff?
- Four magazines and a bit.

1703
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:11,380
- Luke, how much ammo?
- About 25 rounds.

1704
01:50:11,458 --> 01:50:14,469
- Ted?
- About 20.

1705
01:50:14,542 --> 01:50:16,924
- Davenport?
- Only about ten.

1706
01:50:17,001 --> 01:50:19,051
- Beck?
- About 20.

1707
01:50:19,125 --> 01:50:21,803
Four magazines
and about 20 rounds a man, sir.

1708
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:23,759
Right, well, go easy on it.

1709
01:50:25,292 --> 01:50:26,963
Something happening over there!

1710
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:34,798
They've surrendered! Gosh, I didn't
think it would be as easy as that.

1711
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:36,843
It may be a trick.

1712
01:50:36,917 --> 01:50:38,173
Listen.

1713
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:44,834
GERMAN SOLDIER: If you resist us more,
you will be destroyed completely!

1714
01:50:44,917 --> 01:50:46,967
If you lay down your arms,

1715
01:50:47,042 --> 01:50:51,842
we promise you good treatment and food!

1716
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:54,050
Who the hell does he think he's talking to?

1717
01:50:54,125 --> 01:50:55,879
- Yeah, that's right.
- What a nerve!

1718
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:58,424
I await your immediate reply!

1719
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,922
I'd like to take a pot at him.

1720
01:51:00,001 --> 01:51:02,467
Beck, tell him in German to go to hell.

1721
01:51:03,792 --> 01:51:05,297
Can you hear me?

1722
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:08,220
Yes! Your answer, quick!

1723
01:51:08,292 --> 01:51:11,717
Wollen Sie so gut sein in Dei...

1724
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:13,876
In Dei...

1725
01:51:15,001 --> 01:51:18,628
Sorry, sir, I've forgotten the German for
hell. I've never had to use it much.

1726
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:20,048
He knows English.

1727
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:22,093
PERRY: Go to hell!

1728
01:51:23,208 --> 01:51:25,674
- Everybody OK?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

1729
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:27,670
Feeling a bit hungry, sir.

1730
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:29,883
Breakfast may be a little
late this morning.

1731
01:51:29,958 --> 01:51:32,257
All right, Brewer? Plenty to grumble about?

1732
01:51:32,334 --> 01:51:35,049
- Yes, thank you, sir.
- Good.

1733
01:51:35,125 --> 01:51:37,175
(Bombers overhead)

1734
01:51:50,292 --> 01:51:52,674
Jimmy, this is what we're going to do.

1735
01:51:58,958 --> 01:52:00,168
- Is that clear?
- Right.

1736
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:03,841
Lloyd! Lloyd, we're going in!
Start from here when the smoke comes down!

1737
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:05,339
- Did you get that?
- Yes, sir.

1738
01:52:05,417 --> 01:52:07,088
I'll go and see the other sections.

1739
01:52:20,542 --> 01:52:21,928
LLOYD: Here it is.

1740

(Distant gunfire)

1741
01:52:40,792 --> 01:52:43,257
I'm sorry I forgot the
German for hell, sir.

1742
01:52:44,583 --> 01:52:46,633
It's Hölle.

1743
01:52:46,708 --> 01:52:48,758
That's all right, Beck.

1744
01:52:57,208 --> 01:52:58,500
Come on, lads.

1745
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,966
Once more for the day
you missed on the exercise.
