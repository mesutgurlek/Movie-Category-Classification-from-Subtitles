CINEMATOGRAPHY BY

DIRECTED BY

6
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,131
Who's this guy again? I forgot.

7
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,630
Szczuka.

8
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,373
And what is he?

9
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,005
Secretary of the
District Workers' Party.

10
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,738
Excuse me, sir.

11
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,210
Scram, kid.

12
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,510
Could you open
the chapel door for me, please?

13
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,756
You see? It's locked.

14
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,940
Get out of here.

15
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,003
Maciek.

16
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,712
- What is it?
- They're coming.

17
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,287
Maciek!

18
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,685
It's okay.
I've waited for bigger things.

19
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,749
Hurry up!

20
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,427
Goddamn ants!

21
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,561
Get out of here! Go!

22
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,302
Quick, they're coming!

23
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,306
The car's coming! Quick!

24
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,435
Get his papers!

25
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,973
He doesn't have any!

26
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,172
Jesus and Mary!

27
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,348
Let's get out of here!

28
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:27,084
Wait, you stupid ass!
Where do you think you're going?

29
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,362
Wait!

30
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,904
What happened?

31
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,142
Two of our men were killed.
That's what happened.

32
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,773
Smolarski,
from the cement factory council.

33
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,540
- And him?
- Gawlik, also from the cement plant.

34
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,254
Young kid, not even 20 years old.

35
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,491
Just came back from forced labor
in Germany a week ago.

36
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,387
Came back to meet his death.

37
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,491
So that's where
the bastards were shooting.

38
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,732
Hey, call the police.

39
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,729
<i>If I get my hands on them...</i>

40
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,907
I think it was you and I
who were supposed to be lying there.

41
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,445
- You think so?
- Of course.

42
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,840
But that's not important.

43
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,756
Excuse me, comrade.

44
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,018
My name is Szczuka.

45
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,827
So you're the party secretary
who was coming here?

46
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,361
That's right.

47
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:22,231
I wanted to ask you something.
Not just me, but all of us.

48
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:28,845
Can you tell us how long
people will have to die like this?

49
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,249
This isn't the first time.
- And it won't be the last.

50
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,982
Does that scare you?
- <i>Everyone wants to live!</i>

51
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,816
We've lost a lot of our people.

52
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,458
Did you know Smolarski lost two sons?

53
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,755
One was shot by the Germans in 1939,

54
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,023
the other in 1943.

55
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,962
And now he lies there too.

56
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,766
And for what?

57
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,495
Who shot him?

58
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,304
Poles?

59
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,501
Tell us!
How long is this going to go on?

60
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,243
I'd be a bad communist, comrades,

61
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,451
if I were to reassure you
like a bunch of naïve kids.

62
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,449
The end of the war
isn't the end of our fight.

63
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,883
The fight for Poland

64
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,528
and what kind of country
it's to become has only just begun.

65
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,254
Today or tomorrow

66
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,063
or the day after,
any one of us could die.

67
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,337
Fine. We understand that.

68
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,903
But what do we tell his wife?

69
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,904
What should we tell her?

70
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,679
It's hard for me to talk about this,

71
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,382
since I know very well
those bullets were meant for me

72
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,345
and not those two.

73
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,290
Now pull yourselves together.

74
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,924
Each has to do his duty
while he's still alive.

75
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,026
That's the important thing.

76
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,199
<i>This is a special announcement.</i>

77
00:08:55,167 --> 00:09:00,469
<i>Today, May 8th,</i>
<i>in the ruins of Berlin,</i>

78
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:05,068
<i>the German High Command signed</i>

79
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,805
<i>an unconditional act of surrender.</i>

80
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,746
<i>On behalf of the German High Command,</i>

81
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,410
<i>the unconditional act of surrender</i>
<i>was signed</i>

82
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,621
<i>by Keitel, Friedeburg and Stump.</i>

83
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,693
<i>On behalf of the Red Army</i>
<i>High Command,</i>

84
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:29,132
<i>by the marshal</i>
<i>of the Soviet Union, Zhukov.</i>

85
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,633
So, what's with him?

86
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,039
You know, him.

87
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,335
I have no idea.
He should be here.

88
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,373
Where does he get his information?

89
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,180
From his boss.

90
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,982
And who's his boss?

91
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,252
The mayor.
This idiot is the mayor's secretary.

92
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,289
So he works for both sides?
I despise that.

93
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,464
Is he reliable?

94
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,496
- Is anyone?
- Look. Those tanks aren't bad.

95
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,910
<i>Polish tanks are ready to fight.</i>

96
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,108
- Here he comes.
- Look! Look!

97
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,877
Hello, gentlemen.

98
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,079
- You're late. Any complications?
- No, I had to change clothes.

99
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,152
You getting married?

100
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,156
No, I'm in charge
of organizing a ban<i>q</i>uet.

101
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,261
- Give me that thing.
- Can't see much. Too much light.

102
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:40,562
Listen, Andrzej, don't ask me
for this type of thing anymore.

103
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,572
- Fine. Don't worry about it.
- Information, fine. But not this.

104
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,175
That's enough.

105
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,435
- What?
- Let's go.

106
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,773
- Where?
- We've been invited to a ban<i>q</i>uet.

107
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,811
Stop joking.

108
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,481
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

109
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,155
- Don't take risks.
- Stop being a pain.

110
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,824
See ya.

111
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,331
My respects, sir.

112
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,541
Look who's here!

113
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,243
My respects.

114
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,079
What brings you here?

115
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,909
Duty, Mr. Kotowicz.

116
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,608
I understand. The ban<i>q</i>uet, right?

117
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,853
You're looking for Mr. Slomka.
- That's right.

118
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,746
He's in there, arranging the ban<i>q</i>uet.

119
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,619
A masterpiece!
Take it from me.

120
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,089
Good evening. How are things?

121
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,535
I hope the mayor will be pleased.

122
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,000
The mayor is particularly anxious
about tonight's ban<i>q</i>uet, Mr. Slomka.

123
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,000
I understand.
It's the end of the war.

124
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,243
An extraordinary moment.

125
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:03,011
A separate entrance to the bathroom.
Very convenient.

126
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,642
How's everything, Mrs. Jurgeluszka?

127
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,943
Thank you, director.
It's pretty <i>q</i>uiet.

128
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,854
Doesn't look bad at first glance.

129
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:25,096
I guarantee you, sir,
it'll look even better when you taste it.

130
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,140
Come on. Let's go.

131
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,011
- Did you see the pretty girl?
- Forget it.

132
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,570
Let's have a drink.

133
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,388
Good evening.

134
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,424
What can we get to drink?

135
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,457
Starovin or Jarzebiak.

136
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,994
Two small vodkas.

137
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,501
<i>Miss Krystyna.</i>

138
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,602
What is it, sir?

139
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,511
That's a beautiful name, Krystyna.

140
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,610
- Stop fooling around.
- I'm not.

141
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,472
Drink up and let's go.

142
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,115
Two tall ones and two chasers.

143
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,416
Very nice bar, isn't it, miss?

144
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,037
How late are you open?

145
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,902
We close at 3:00.

146
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,903
- Do you like violets?
- Very much.

147
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,774
Me too!

148
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:18,978
<i>Maciek!</i>

149
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,124
- Did you see that?
- What?

150
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,633
Like Warsaw girls.
Makes me want to stay.

151
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,169
- Then stay.
- Easy for you to say.

152
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,601
As far as I know,
no one's waiting for you.

153
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,877
That's just it.
Why stay if no one's waiting?

154
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,045
- I don't follow.
- Neither do I.

155
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,719
It's probably the master.

156
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,324
Let me take that.

157
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,203
Yes, this is Mrs. Staniewicz.

158
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,776
I'll put him on right away.

159
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,527
- Major?
- <i>Yes?</i>

160
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,113
This is Andrzej speaking.
Andrzej.

161
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,351
I wanted to inform you
that the matter's been taken care of.

162
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,251
Everything's fine. Yes.

163
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,994
No complications.

164
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,590
Yes.

165
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,030
Good evening.

166
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,437
Do you have a room
for Comrade Szczuka?

167
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,933
The Town Committee
called in a reservation.

168
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,872
Of course.
Everything's taken care of.

169
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:03,442
Number 18, second floor.
At your service, sir.

170
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,051
Just a moment.

171
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,295
What's going on?
Did you go for a walk or something?

172
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,498
Hold on. I don't understand.

173
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,761
So it wasn't carried out.

174
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,534
Yes, it's clear now.

175
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,070
Too bad.

176
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,278
All right, come here at once.

177
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,627
- Thank you.
- Do you have any cigarettes?

178
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,486
American? Hungarian?

179
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,196
American will do.

180
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,255
Here you are.

181
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,329
Thank you.

182
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,667
Wait for me at the bar.

183
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,138
Fine. I've waited for bigger things.

184
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,207
- Do you know the Staniewicz family?
- Of course, sir.

185
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,538
Do they still live
where they did before the war?

186
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,146
Yes, not far from here.

187
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,743
They have a telephone.
Shall I connect you?

188
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,978
Allow me.

189
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,891
Thank you.

190
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,325
Their number is 12-14.

191
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,596
And here's your key, sir.

192
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,902
What time is this ban<i>q</i>uet again?
11:00?

193
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,405
Yes. The car will wait for us.

194
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,479
Can I help you, sir?

195
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,988
For now, a pack of cigarettes, please.

196
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,350
- American or Hungarian?
- Hungarian. They're stronger.

197
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,854
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

198
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,430
- I'll get your change.
- No, that's okay. It's nothing.

199
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,604
Will you have a smoke?

200
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,273
No, thank you.

201
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,978
They're too strong for me.
At my age, the cough, you know...

202
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,712
- Your age? How old are you?
- Sixty.

203
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,247
- You don't look a day over 50.
- Very kind of you, sir.

204
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,254
Are you here alone?
- For now.

205
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,915
A blonde?

206
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,125
You could say that.

207
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:33,388
You know, we're always short
of double rooms...

208
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,032
That's okay. A single's fine.
The more intimate, the better.

209
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,196
- Are you by any chance from Warsaw?
- Where else?

210
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,832
So am I.
I used to work at the Savoy Hotel.

211
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,237
- On New World Street?
- Yes.

212
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,681
Just two months short of 25 years.
That's a long time.

213
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,320
- So you were there for the uprising.
- Of course.

214
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,579
Downtown until the last day.
How about you?

215
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,625
Here and there. First in the Old Town,
then downtown.

216
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:07,925
You know, without our old Warsaw,
things just aren't the same.

217
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,459
It's like losing an arm.

218
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:16,499
The chestnuts would be blooming
about now in the boulevards and parks.

219
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,104
Blooming, you say? Blooming...

220
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,348
I was going to give you
a room on the fourth floor,

221
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,448
but the place is full of bugs.

222
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,114
Take room 17, on the second floor.
- Thank you.

223
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:34,053
You deserve it.
We Warsovians have to stick together.

224
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,224
Do you have any luggage?
- Just this.

225
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,592
- That's not much.
- I've had less.

226
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,165
Here are my papers.
- Ah, occupant issued, I see.

227
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,704
Chelmicki, Maciej.
- That's right.

228
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:55,103
Born in Warsaw in 1921.
Occupation... worker?

229
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,244
That's just to fool the Germans.
I'm actually a student.

230
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,682
Thank you.

231
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,740
What are you bawling about?

232
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,014
Did the kitchen staff
say something to you?

233
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,842
Don't be stupid.
They're jealous of you!

234
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:40,752
Well?

235
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:45,753
They killed Stasiek!
The bastards shot him!

236
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,887
Who's Stasiek? Who shot him?

237
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,288
My fiancé, Stasiek Gawlik.

238
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:56,628
O Lord, let the bastards die
a painful death!

239
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,230
Sit down.

240
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,165
Why would they want to kill him?
- How should I know?

241
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,068
- It's probably not true.
- Not true?

242
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,138
Jeziorek just stopped by.
- The cop?

243
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,973
He probably just wanted some vodka
and got it all wrong.

244
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,716
No, it's no mistake.

245
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,479
He said two people
from the cement plant were shot.

246
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,656
I got a bad feeling
and asked who'd been shot.

247
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,825
He said Smolarski and Stasiek Gawlik.

248
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:27,123
God, I thought I'd die right there.

249
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,799
I felt this spasm inside me.

250
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,093
Killed on the spot, he said.

251
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,931
They apparently meant
to kill someone else.

252
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,405
Those two died by mistake.

253
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:43,139
Drink. It's a shame,
but you can't undo it now.

254
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,572
And stop crying.

255
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,646
I'll give you some stockings.

256
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,915
You pretend to be nice,
but you only want one thing from a woman!

257
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,056
What's with you?

258
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,996
<i>It seems innocent people</i>
<i>died needlessly.</i>

259
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,617
An attack of conscience.

260
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,684
<i>You think that</i>'<i>s out of place, Major?</i>

261
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,686
Do you know who was killed?

262
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,964
Workers from the cement factory.

263
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,494
The situation is very clear.

264
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,634
There was a mistake,
and it must be corrected.

265
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,501
- Major, I have a <i>q</i>uestion.
- Yes?

266
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:53,601
Is it really necessary to kill Szczuka?

267
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,381
Lieutenant, you're too experienced
a solder not to realize

268
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,552
that as your superior officer
I have the right to ignore that <i>q</i>uestion.

269
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:05,912
I just thought...

270
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,625
I don't care what you thought.
I'm waiting for your answer.

271
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,954
Yes.

272
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,094
I'm glad we're of the same opinion.

273
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,533
Nevertheless,
I'll answer your <i>q</i>uestion.

274
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,664
I understand your doubts.

275
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,964
What's more,
I'd be surprised if you had none.

276
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,639
It's a very complicated situation,

277
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,603
but the war years have taught us

278
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,243
that we must approach
these complicated situations une<i>q</i>uivocally.

279
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,104
No compromises,
one way or the other.

280
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,215
When did you join the Resistance?

281
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,318
1941.

282
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,216
And what did you fight for?
Freedom for Poland?

283
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,755
Well, is this the Poland you imagined?

284
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,293
Lieutenant, you must be aware
that the only option left to you

285
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,967
in a Poland such as this is to fight.

286
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,930
Where will you go
with your past history?

287
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,604
All doors in this country
are closed to you

288
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,639
except one... prison.

289
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,310
I know.

290
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,247
Now, about this man
who's been giving us trouble.

291
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,321
Who is Szczuka?

292
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:25,297
An intellectual, an engineer,
a communist and an excellent organizer.

293
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,629
A man who knows what he wants.

294
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,833
He's just come back from Russia
after several years away,

295
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,806
and now he's been named
to the Party's Regional Committee.

296
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,617
You're surely aware of the power
he'll have as first secretary.

297
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,686
The skillful removal of such a man
should make a favorable impression.

298
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:52,260
It would resonate at the level
of both politics and propaganda.

299
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,691
Particularly now that
the situation in our sector

300
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,528
<i>j</i>ust became much more complicated.

301
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,735
I just received a report
that Captain Wilk's detachment

302
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,600
was surrounded by the army
and security police last night.

303
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:08,571
They suffered heavy losses.
Only a few managed to get away.

304
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,238
That's unfortunate.

305
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,010
But if I know Captain Wilk,
he'll manage.

306
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,247
Unfortunately,

307
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,550
the captain was killed.

308
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,663
<i>We must admit, dear friends,</i>

309
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,100
<i>the colonel</i>'<i>s wife</i>
<i>puts us at ease here.</i>

310
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,967
<i>I can forget</i>
<i>about the ugliness out there.</i>

311
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,941
- I'm so glad, Count.
- Please, no titles tonight.

312
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,409
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

313
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,481
- How's our business going?
- Coming along nicely.

314
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,477
Are you certain, my dear?

315
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:51,884
I see you've forgotten that in times
like these, nothing is certain.

316
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,054
What a pessimist.

317
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,757
Our friends will always remain
our friends.

318
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,119
That's why we place our fate
in your lovely hands.

319
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,226
I'm sure you mean my husband's hands.

320
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:06,069
He's going to spare no effort
to get us out of this country <i>q</i>uickly.

321
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,133
Then I propose...
since it's getting late...

322
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:14,410
that we drink to the colonel's health
at the Monopol.

323
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,771
- Mr. Szczuka has arrived, madam.
- Who did you say?

324
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,782
Mr. Szczuka.

325
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:24,478
Forgive me, but I must
leave you for a moment.

326
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,517
I have to see to some
rather boring business.

327
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,785
I know what you mean.
Business is always so boring.

328
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,392
And yet it's become impossible
to live without it.

329
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,404
<i>The allies will strike</i>
<i>with lightning speed.</i>

330
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,762
<i>I agree.</i>

331
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,831
How are you, Katarzyna?

332
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,495
You do recognize me, don't you?

333
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,897
What is it?

334
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:17,431
You know I returned from abroad
only a month ago.

335
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,067
I know. I received your letter.

336
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,710
I wrote three.

337
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,516
I had no news to convey.

338
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,442
I still don't.

339
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,350
Listen, Katarzyna.

340
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,854
Towards the end of 1941,

341
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:41,256
friends notified me
that Maria had died

342
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,960
and that you had taken Marek.

343
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,498
You think I should have sent him
to an orphanage?

344
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,898
I wrote then that I didn't want you

345
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,009
bringing up my son.

346
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,944
I gave you the names of friends of mine.

347
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,344
Did you get that letter?
- No.

348
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,911
I never got that letter.

349
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,486
But I can assure you
that even if I had,

350
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,455
Marek would still have stayed with us.

351
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,487
You seem to forget

352
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,625
that Maria was my sister, after all.

353
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,691
Where is he?

354
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,264
I don't know.

355
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,501
I wrote you that the last time
he was in this apartment

356
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,137
was in October,
right after the uprising.

357
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,601
- And you've had no news of him since?
- No.

358
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:29,174
And that's all
you can tell me about my son?

359
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,345
Listen, Katarzyna, he's only 17.

360
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,710
I know.

361
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:39,352
Nowadays, boys of 17 are grown men.

362
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,123
Who is he now?

363
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,350
What kind of man
did you raise him to be?

364
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,688
A good Pole, I can assure you.

365
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,659
I can imagine,
with your type of patriotism.

366
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,963
It's not at all hard to guess

367
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,465
what kind of man
you raised my son to be.

368
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,403
But too bad.
What's done is done.

369
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,805
But he's only 17.

370
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,879
And I assure you that if he's alive,

371
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,772
sooner or later
he'll be my son again.

372
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,692
It was nothing important.

373
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,472
Wait a moment.

374
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,975
This apartment isn't safe anymore.

375
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,183
- In a hurry?
- No, I'm meeting someone.

376
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,949
- A woman?
- Happy?

377
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,184
- Who?
- You.

378
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,654
Me?

379
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,356
What do I care who you're meeting?
- You don't care about anything.

380
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,228
- I should hope so.
- I don't believe you.

381
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,194
Suit yourself.

382
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,131
Then I don't believe you.

383
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,201
Do you have to stay late?
- Until we close.

384
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,967
Really? All by yourself?

385
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,111
- A friend comes in to help at 10:00.
- You see?

386
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,111
I see nothing.
When it gets busy,

387
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,407
the two of us can barely handle it.

388
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,848
Here comes the woman you're meeting.

389
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,784
I see you remember him.

390
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,352
- Of course, he's very handsome.
- Indeed.

391
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,789
- Let's go.
- Well?

392
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,689
- Let's go somewhere <i>q</i>uieter.
- What did he say?

393
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,629
- Come on.
- Are you crazy? It's <i>q</i>uiet in here.

394
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,703
Well, don't you like this little table?
It's a dream.

395
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,135
Not bad, eh?

396
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,137
It'll do.

397
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,577
Are you going away?

398
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,345
Are you crazy?

399
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,782
I thought you were going to Warsaw.

400
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,489
What happened?
Did Florian call it off?

401
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,226
On the contrary.

402
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,261
Then what do you take me for?

403
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,065
Think I'm the type
to leave a job unfinished?

404
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:07,761
Guess who's staying in Room 17
of the famous Monopol Hotel,

405
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,867
next to you-know-who.

406
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,243
All right, Maciek.

407
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,588
Who's that idiot, for God's sake?

408
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,490
- Who?
- That guy.

409
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,270
- He's got a stupid back.
- His front's stupid too.

410
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,045
Good evening.

411
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,347
- Your usual vodka and vermouth?
- No, cognac for a special day.

412
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,206
You must have done some business today.

413
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,247
Artistic business.

414
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,588
Thank you.
- How's your show doing, Mr. Kotowicz?

415
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,290
Splendidly.

416
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,093
Right this way, Countess.

417
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,442
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we begin our artistic program.</i>

418
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,879
Today we are celebrating a great day.

419
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,776
The war has ended!

420
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,043
And what better way to celebrate

421
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:35,022
than with the incomparable
Hanka Lewicka?

422
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:14,493
<i>Do you see those ruins on the hilltop</i>

423
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:18,201
<i>There your foe hides like a rat</i>

424
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,269
<i>You must, you must, you must</i>

425
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:28,535
<i>Grab him and cast him from the cliffs</i>

426
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:34,075
<i>And they went, heedless of danger</i>

427
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,388
<i>They went, to kill and avenge</i>

428
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,820
<i>They went, determined as ever</i>

429
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:49,092
<i>As always, for freedom, to fight</i>

430
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,429
- You remember?
- What?

431
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,701
Drinks at Red's?

432
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,863
No.

433
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:01,737
You don't remember?

434
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,402
When was that?

435
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,406
You remember.

436
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,416
Stop fooling around!

437
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,985
- No?
- I don't remember!

438
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,902
No?

439
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,271
Haneczka.

440
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,874
Wilga.

441
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,678
Kossobudzki.

442
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,220
Red.

443
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,286
Kajtek.

444
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,630
We're still alive.

445
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,413
Still, those were the days, Andrzej.

446
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:17,945
You really think so?

447
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,314
What a life... and in such company.

448
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,924
What a great crowd.

449
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,288
So what?
They're almost all dead.

450
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,192
Maybe so, but life was better.

451
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,035
- We were different.
- Younger.

452
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,693
Not just that.

453
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,666
We knew what we wanted.
- Perhaps.

454
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,541
And what they wanted of us.

455
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,137
Now you said it.

456
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,942
It's simple!

457
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,851
What do you think they wanted?

458
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,383
They wanted our lives,
and they still do!

459
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,954
But that's all right.
We can afford it!

460
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,984
Enough theatrics.

461
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,826
It's easy to die.
- Depends on how.

462
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,731
- It's all we're good for.
- Is that so little?

463
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,560
It's hopelessly little.

464
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,898
You're exaggerating.

465
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,364
You're exaggerating, Andrzej.

466
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,404
No need to take things so seriously.

467
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,147
The main thing is
to find a way through this mess

468
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,850
without being tricked or getting bored.

469
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,584
What else is there?

470
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,023
Perhaps.

471
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:36,627
<i>Years will pass and ages will roll by</i>

472
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:42,499
<i>But traces of bygone days will remain</i>

473
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:51,109
<i>And all the poppies on Monte Cassino</i>

474
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:59,580
<i>Will be redder</i>
<i>from growing in Polish blood</i>

475
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,488
Listen, Maciek,
I've got to talk to you seriously.

476
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,978
God, these animals make so much noise!

477
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,670
How will you handle our friend?

478
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,470
Don't worry. I'll manage.

479
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,342
Listen, I'm responsible to Florian.

480
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,678
That's all right.
I'm responsible to you.

481
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,151
Everyone's got to be
responsible to somebody.

482
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,015
There's just one other complication.

483
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,158
Don't worry.
The order will be carried out.

484
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,820
What's the complication?

485
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:16,032
First, Florian doesn't want me
directly involved in this job.

486
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,258
And?

487
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,063
And, I have to leave, <i>q</i>uickly.

488
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,967
This is all news to me.

489
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,768
- I'm taking Wilk's place.
- Why? What's wrong with him?

490
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,241
I'm taking his place.

491
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,775
So, another one.

492
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:52,492
Listen, a while ago you said
no one was waiting for me.

493
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,831
That's true.
Will you take me with you?

494
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,164
Are you serious?

495
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,968
Serious?

496
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,876
Nothing in this country
is serious anymore.

497
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,477
But I've gotten used to it.

498
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,348
If you'll take me, I'll go with you.

499
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,447
When do you leave?
- Early.

500
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,687
4:30 in the morning.

501
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,360
So you see, you have
precious little time to finish him off.

502
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,160
Little time?

503
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:29,262
Let's see,
this wake will start around 11:00,

504
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,566
and it'll probably last about...

505
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,801
Three hours.

506
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,877
It's easy. He'll have
to go to his room to sleep.

507
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,145
All right, Maciek.
I'll see you later.

508
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,419
Don't party too hard.

509
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,879
See you.

510
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,327
Alone now?

511
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,801
Unfortunately.

512
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:46,179
- When's your friend coming? At 10:00?
- Yes.

513
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,281
So you could probably
get out by 10:30, right?

514
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:57,257
You could tell them you've got a headache,
don't feel so well, something like that.

515
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,258
- <i>Miss Krystyna.</i>
- They can wait.

516
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,089
<i>I</i>'<i>d like to pay.</i>

517
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,392
They can wait.

518
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,865
<i>The bill, please.</i>

519
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,030
Will you be able to get away?

520
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,005
Suppose I could? Then what?

521
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,606
I'm staying at the Monopol.

522
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,644
Really? Good for you.

523
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,907
Second floor, room 17.

524
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,613
- Are you sure?
- It's easy to check.

525
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,415
- Unfortunately, I only check my bills.
- Is that all?

526
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,785
Yes, and they never tally anyway.

527
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,721
You really only check your bills?

528
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,035
Seriously, you can check for yourself.
This will tally, I assure you.

529
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,030
Well?

530
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,875
Well?

531
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,673
I swear, these violets
smell better and better.

532
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,747
Room 17.

533
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,552
Second floor.

534
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,884
10:30.

535
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,724
I'll be waiting. I swear.

536
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,641
<i>Miss Krystyna!</i>

537
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,826
There you are, sir.

538
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,922
- Excuse me?
- Your bill.

539
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,427
Just a minute, Miss Krystyna.

540
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,036
<i>Miss Krystyna.</i>

541
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,196
Just a moment.

542
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,270
Well, look who's here!

543
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,681
Enjoying yourself?

544
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,113
Forgive me,
but I'm on duty at the moment.

545
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:08,222
Oh, I see the illustrious Town Council

546
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:11,187
is displeased with the press.

547
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,354
I know nothing about that.

548
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:18,727
You didn't send me
an invitation to this ban<i>q</i>uet.

549
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,500
Excuse me, sir,

550
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,898
but Mr. Pawlicki received an invitation.

551
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,164
Oh, Pawlicki!

552
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,576
I guess Mr. Pieniazek doesn't count.

553
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:35,151
I'm sorry, but the mayor himself
made up the guest list.

554
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,713
Precisely.

555
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,022
My friend Swiecki.

556
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,456
No! Mayor Swiecki. The mayor.

557
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,495
What?

558
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,222
Why do you stare like that?

559
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,466
No reason.

560
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,772
Though something
did just occur to me

561
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,870
that you might find of some interest.

562
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,043
Me? No.

563
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,713
What is it?

564
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:11,080
It's just a little tiny problem.

565
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,422
If my friend, Swiecki...

566
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,752
Excuse me, sir.

567
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:21,824
All right, if you insist:
If my former friend, Swiecki,

568
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,766
should go to Warsaw,

569
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,198
will he or won't he be taking

570
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:32,340
his present secretary along?

571
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,442
What? Do you know something?

572
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,904
Pieniazek...

573
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,740
knows everything!

574
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,513
Miss Krystyna,

575
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,446
two tall ones.

576
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:48,554
What about...

577
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,192
Two tall ones.

578
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,762
Let's have a drink.

579
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,661
No, I'm on duty,
and if the mayor should...

580
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,060
But that's great.

581
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:03,735
We should drink to the minister's health,
especially if on duty!

582
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,966
So you mean it's true?

583
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,503
What ministry did he get?

584
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,476
- National health.
- Not bad.

585
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:16,150
Damn, I wish it had been foreign affairs.

586
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,820
Yes, he'd have preferred that too.

587
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,717
Here's to foreign affairs!

588
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,583
You think he'll take me with him?

589
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,695
Of course he will.

590
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,396
Shit always floats to the top.

591
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,468
You'll see where I'll be in five years.

592
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,697
You bet I will.

593
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,607
Here's to the five-year plan.

594
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,501
How are you today, Mr. Slomka?

595
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:08,135
I'm always well, Mr. Mayor.

596
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:12,034
See, gentlemen?
Finally a citizen who's not complaining.

597
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,439
Please forgive me, Mayor.

598
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,873
I know the editor,
but not the other gentleman.

599
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,515
- Mr. Kalicki.
- Exactly.

600
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,652
I'm not sure what position...
- What are you getting at?

601
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,014
But since you attach
such importance to titles,

602
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,924
then you may from now on
address me as...

603
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,759
As what, Mayor?

604
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:35,494
Mr. Minister, I'm afraid,
my dear, Mr. Slomka.

605
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,332
Careful there.

606
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,733
Gentlemen.

607
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:48,042
Well done, Mr. Slomka.

608
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,940
But where's Mr. Drewnowski?
Has he been here?

609
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:53,444
Yes, Mayor.

610
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,185
I beg your pardon... Minister.

611
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:00,078
Mr. Drewnowski
kept an eye on everything

612
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,587
and, if I may say so,
expressed his satisfaction.

613
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,519
Where the hell is he?
He should be here.

614
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,160
You want an appetizer?

615
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,031
No?

616
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,666
No matter. But tell me:

617
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:16,098
What exactly do you want?

618
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,704
Everything!

619
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,274
Lots of money.

620
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,942
- You'll have that.
- Sure!

621
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,249
I'm fed up with being poor.

622
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,646
Miss?

623
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,183
Miss, two more.

624
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,131
- Who is it?
- <i>It</i>'<i>s me.</i>

625
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,790
Were you sure I'd come?

626
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,192
Yes.

627
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,026
And do you know why I came?

628
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,669
It's simple.

629
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,975
I could never fall in love with you.

630
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:06,682
What?

631
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,880
You don't want to fall in love?
- With you?

632
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,521
- In general.
- I'd rather not.

633
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,356
- On principle?
- Why complicate life?

634
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,256
It complicates itself.

635
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,292
So why add more complications?

636
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,074
What?

637
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,681
Tell me something about yourself.

638
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,283
Why?

639
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,044
On second thought, I will.

640
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,385
I lived in the country,
on my parents' estate.

641
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,693
- Before the war?
- Yes, near Poznan.

642
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,591
- And then?
- Then we moved to Warsaw.

643
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,692
- We?
- Mother and I.

644
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,732
Father was arrested
by the Germans right at the start.

645
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,867
- Did he die?
- Yes. At Dachau.

646
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,534
That's about all there is to tell.

647
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,344
- Is your mother alive?
- No.

648
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,379
She died in the uprising.

649
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,423
Any other family?

650
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,292
Fortunately, no.

651
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,827
- Fortunately?
- Less people to lose.

652
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,366
You're right.

653
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,535
What about you? No family?

654
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,540
None whatsoever.

655
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,014
Are you going to stay here long?

656
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,377
I don't know.
I suppose I will, for now.

657
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,882
- And after that?
- I never think that far ahead.

658
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,426
You know, I wasn't sure you'd come.

659
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,227
You don't even know me.

660
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,421
You don't know me either.

661
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,670
Come on, let's go.

662
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,896
Did you invite me or didn't you?

663
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:14,974
Are you the minister's secretary
or aren't you?

664
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:19,314
I invited you, but not on that side.

665
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,144
Both sides are good.

666
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,253
From today on,
there's only one correct side.

667
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,180
Rubbish!

668
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:31,018
You can go from one side to the other.

669
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,228
Both sides are good!

670
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,729
- Will you take Drewnowski with you?
- Of course.

671
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,726
Evening, comrade.

672
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,336
He's a great guy.
Climbing the ladder.

673
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,898
I'll make a man out of him.

674
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,906
- Will I be a director one day?
- Of course you will.

675
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,073
You'll be a director!

676
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,680
I'm gonna be a director...

677
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,865
This way, please.

678
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,024
Mrs. Jurgeluszka!

679
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,801
Mrs. Jurgeluszka!

680
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,641
Poland has blown up!

681
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,348
It's blown up!

682
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,954
Where are the directors going now?

683
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,420
To the ban<i>q</i>uet!

684
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:50,264
I'll lead you to a bright future!

685
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,176
What's the meaning of this?
Where have you been?

686
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,888
What's this scoundrel doing here?

687
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,650
Well, actually,
it just kind of happened.

688
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,618
I just thought, Mr. Mayor...

689
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,295
Sorry. I mean Mr. Minister.

690
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,829
I thought the press...

691
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,225
What's this nonsense?
What's wrong with you?

692
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,998
Congratulations, Mr. Minister.

693
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:28,270
On behalf of the democratic press,

694
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,479
hip, hip, hurrah!

695
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,915
This is a scandal, Mr. Drewnowski!

696
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:50,799
A happy day indeed.
Congratulations.

697
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,626
Best wishes.

698
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,836
Let me introduce Comrade Szczuka.
Comrade Wrona, head of security.

699
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,703
I can't even look you in the eye
after what happened this morning.

700
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,635
I thought it would go differently
in the forest.

701
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,971
At least we're out of the forest now.

702
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,013
Welcome, comrade.
Please come in.

703
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,708
Good evening.

704
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,115
- Out of my way.
- You won't leave?

705
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,318
No! Is this a democracy or not?

706
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,987
Please be seated.

707
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,991
Please.

708
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,837
You won't leave? Just wait!

709
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,304
Are you threatening me?

710
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:35,710
And who brownnosed before the war?
- Shut your foul mouth!

711
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:41,474
You didn't kiss Sanacja's ass?
Tell me you didn't!

712
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,385
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

713
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,775
Poland has blown up in our faces.

714
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,571
- I'm a director.
- You'll be a director.

715
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,015
- There are still too few of us.
- We need to pull more people together.

716
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,344
- Yeah, but who?
- What do you mean "who"? The nation.

717
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,686
You've been drinking already, haven't you?

718
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,984
Of course, I have.

719
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,627
And you should be drinking too.

720
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,064
Enough now. Hush.

721
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:34,332
I hate these affairs.
They're for the bourgeoisie.

722
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:36,495
- You don't like them?
- No.

723
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,431
Don't worry.

724
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:42,100
One day you'll like them!

725
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,675
Quiet!

726
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,578
Mr. Swiecki,

727
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,484
the minister.

728
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,189
My dear comrades and citizens...

729
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:09,398
today, May 8th, 1945,

730
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,966
is a great day for liberated Poland.

731
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,687
How are things, Mrs. Jurgeluszka?

732
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,622
They're giving speeches.

733
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,089
The minister himself is speaking.

734
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:36,265
Anyone been sick yet?
- No! It's too early for that!

735
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:39,763
Everything at its proper time.

736
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:44,868
First, the speeches.
Then people come running here.

737
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,774
- I think you'll do well today.
- I think so too.

738
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:56,649
It's probably somebody's birthday.

739
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:01,721
What are you talking about?
It's nobody's birthday.

740
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,688
An anniversary, then.

741
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,793
What are you babbling about?

742
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,327
It's all for Poland!

743
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,896
You know what just occurred to me?

744
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,368
We only met a few hours ago,

745
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:25,110
but I feel like we've known
each other much longer.

746
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,782
Tell me.

747
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:30,782
What?

748
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,887
What are you really like?

749
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,021
What do you mean?

750
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,655
You seem different than before.

751
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:42,958
Is that bad?

752
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:46,292
God, I don't think it matters.

753
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,336
It doesn't matter at all?

754
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,640
- Are you cold?
- A bit.

755
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,548
- Okay now?
- Better, anyway.

756
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,935
Why do you always wear
those dark glasses?

757
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,766
A souvenir of unre<i>q</i>uited love
for my homeland.

758
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,672
It's nothing, really.

759
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:35,483
I spent too much time
in the sewers during the uprising.

760
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,584
You know?

761
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,322
No.

762
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,027
Why not?

763
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,355
I don't want to.
There's no point.

764
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:51,798
Why?

765
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,963
Don't you understand?
You're leaving.

766
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,201
I don't want
any good-byes or memories

767
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:04,139
to leave behind when this is over.

768
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,250
Not even happy memories?

769
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,456
Not if they're only
going to be memories.

770
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:20,592
You have your life, and I have mine.

771
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:25,361
We met by chance, and that's nice.

772
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:28,033
What more can we ask for?

773
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,472
What is it?

774
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,333
Nothing.

775
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,914
I think our neighbor is back.

776
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,206
It's awful how you can hear
everything here.

777
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,343
Awful.

778
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,018
Hold me.

779
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,088
Do you have any cigarettes?

780
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:33,693
Of course.
American or Hungarian?

781
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:35,460
Hungarian, please.

782
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,647
Here you are.

783
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,044
Thanks.

784
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,584
<i>What are you doing tomorrow?</i>

785
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:03,059
<i>Today. It</i>'<i>s today already.</i>

786
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,030
<i>Let</i>'<i>s spend the day together.</i>
<i>What do you say?</i>

787
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,134
<i>You already know the answer.</i>

788
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,836
- Where were you captured?
- In the forest.

789
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,837
- Wilk's gang?
- Captain Wilk's detachment.

790
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,230
What's your name?

791
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,343
- Krzysztof.
- Is that it?

792
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,436
Krzysztof Zawadzki.

793
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,342
Your name?

794
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,243
Turn around.

795
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,213
How old are you?
- A hundred.

796
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,888
How old are you?

797
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,857
A hundred and one.

798
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,649
You have to go.

799
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,555
I should. Lili will kill me.

800
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,492
Bye.

801
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,579
Could you give me a light?

802
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,373
Certainly.

803
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,623
Thank you.

804
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:36,983
What's wrong?

805
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,180
Nothing.

806
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,623
Stay with me for, say, half an hour.

807
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:44,586
All right?

808
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,020
All right.

809
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,109
It's started to rain.

810
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:15,550
Here.

811
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,734
What are you thinking about?
Don't want to say?

812
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,795
I was just thinking...

813
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:35,707
about something I shouldn't think about.
But I'm done now.

814
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,777
Don't look at me so reproachfully.
- It's not reproach.

815
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:42,940
Then what?

816
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,618
You still don't know?

817
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,350
It'll start pouring soon.
- You want to go back?

818
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:50,953
No.

819
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:56,397
God! Life can be
so beautiful sometimes.

820
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,098
Knock on wood!

821
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,196
- It was just a wish.
- Knock on wood anyway!

822
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:09,570
<i>We</i>'<i>re marching to fight</i>
<i>for our homeland</i>

823
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,646
Life is dangerous.

824
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,286
Come on!
Let's hide in there.

825
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,814
This way!

826
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,328
Aren't you cold?

827
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,175
Look. An old crypt.

828
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,381
An inscription.

829
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,355
"So often

830
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:04,898
are you as a blazing torch

831
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:11,602
with flakes of burning hemp
falling about you.

832
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:17,570
Flaming, you know not if flames
freedom bring or death,

833
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:23,781
consuming all that you most cherish.

834
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:30,020
Will only ashes remain, and chaos,

835
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:33,420
whirling into the void..."

836
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:51,472
The letters are blurred.
I can't read it.

837
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,109
It's by Norwid.

838
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,793
"Or will the ashes

839
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,726
hold the glory of a starlike diamond,

840
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,499
the Morning Star of everlasting triumph."

841
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,705
That's beautiful.

842
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:27,143
"Or will the ashes hold the glory
of a starlike diamond..."

843
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:35,013
And what are we?

844
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:38,590
You...

845
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,627
are definitely a diamond.

846
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:46,899
Listen.

847
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,802
I have to tell you something.

848
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,568
- Nothing sad, I hope.
- No.

849
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:59,105
Actually, I'm not sure.

850
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:12,724
I don't know.

851
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,198
I'd like to change some things

852
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,634
and arrange my life differently.

853
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,971
It's really hard to talk about this.

854
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,073
You don't have to. I can guess.

855
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:33,077
- Really?
- Is it so difficult?

856
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,050
You know...

857
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,115
until now I haven't thought
about many things.

858
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,555
Life always managed
to work itself out somehow,

859
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,997
and the point was simply to survive.

860
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,365
You understand?
- Yes.

861
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,299
I just want a normal life,
to take up my studies.

862
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,874
I graduated from high school. Maybe
I could go to the technical institute.

863
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,137
What about you?

864
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:09,079
You weren't supposed
to talk about sad things.

865
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,083
Was that sad?
Should I knock on wood?

866
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:20,184
God, if I had known yesterday
what I know now...

867
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,895
I probably wouldn't
have come to you then.

868
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:27,466
You know...

869
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,107
until now,
I didn't know what love was.

870
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:36,105
I really didn't.

871
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:38,978
My heel.

872
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:40,439
Where?

873
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,844
Don't worry.
I've fixed bigger things.

874
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,151
What's this?

875
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,690
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing there?

876
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,929
The lady's had some trouble. You expect me
to find a shoemaker at this time of night?

877
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,472
Shame on you! And you too!

878
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,599
This is how young people act these days!

879
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:44,243
They can't even respect the dead.

880
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,148
- What?
- Don't you see?

881
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,374
You act all happy,

882
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:52,086
while two people murdered today
lie there next to you.

883
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,854
Maciek, what are you doing?

884
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:10,737
Come in.

885
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,438
Where have I heard this?

886
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,197
You don't remember?

887
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,575
I got really drunk that night.

888
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,348
This wine's pretty dangerous.

889
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,478
Alba Seta.

890
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,255
Our first days in Spain.

891
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,188
Grabowski died in the forest,

892
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:07,518
and Rubacki in France in 1944.

893
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:11,255
You remember
there were 36 of us at first?

894
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,630
And who's left now?

895
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,164
Those were good times.

896
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:18,305
And these will be good times too.

897
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:25,078
I don't know what to think anymore.

898
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,148
If it was up to me,
I'd do something about them <i>q</i>uickly.

899
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,709
That mob down there
doesn't represent all of Poland.

900
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:37,988
I know,
but that doesn't make it any easier.

901
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,829
I don't know how to govern.

902
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:55,106
Don't even try to learn how, Franek.
Listen to me.

903
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,778
There is so much suffering and injustice,
so many tears in this country.

904
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,481
Everyone carries his own burden.

905
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,386
Learn to understand.

906
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:12,420
What's there to understand?

907
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,499
German.

908
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,729
Did you find them?

909
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,663
No, but we will.

910
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,905
Some of these are English too.

911
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:31,911
At close range,
there's not the slightest difference.

912
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,680
Let's get some sleep.

913
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:44,090
We'll deal with all this tomorrow.

914
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:47,021
It's going to be a nice day.
The rain stopped.

915
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,023
See you tomorrow.

916
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,799
See you tomorrow.

917
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:17,620
When are you leaving?

918
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:20,859
Probably tomorrow.

919
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:26,233
But perhaps I could still
change everything.

920
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,901
Change what?

921
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:32,740
Certain things.

922
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,174
Could you?

923
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,439
Perhaps.

924
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,291
Were you buying yourself
some flowers?

925
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:04,926
Listen, I need to talk to you, seriously.

926
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,364
I think we've already spoken seriously.

927
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:18,872
Well?

928
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:21,576
You know I'm not a coward.

929
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,147
So?

930
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:30,421
Try to understand, Andrzej.
I can't go on killing and hiding.

931
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:34,819
I just want to live.
You've gotta understand.

932
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,494
I don't have to do anything.

933
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:39,461
Are you speaking
as a soldier or a friend?

934
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,202
- I don't understand.
- You mean you don't want to.

935
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:46,098
I can only speak to you on this matter
as your superior officer.

936
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,272
You took this on yourself.
Nobody forced you.

937
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:51,844
- You're my only friend.
- Drop the melodrama.

938
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:55,106
You fell in love.
That's your business.

939
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,979
But to put your personal affairs
before our cause...

940
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,015
You know what they call that.

941
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:03,122
- I've never been a deserter!
- And what would you be now?

942
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,226
You wanted this job.
You took it on yourself.

943
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:14,027
Don't you understand people can change?
I'm not running away.

944
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,796
But you want to.
You want me to say,

945
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:20,039
"Fine. You're in love.
Do as you like."

946
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,037
How many times have we been
in action together?

947
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:26,042
What if you had fallen in love then?
Would you have come to me then?

948
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:28,578
How about during the uprising?

949
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,416
- That was different.
- No, my friend.

950
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:35,019
You keep forgetting you're one of us.

951
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,985
And that's what counts.

952
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,595
Now you've done it.
You can say good-bye to your career.

953
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:54,733
Beat it!

954
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:58,164
You'll be singing a different tune
tomorrow. The minister will ruin you.

955
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:01,833
I don't care.

956
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:06,781
The bastard's going to ruin me?

957
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:11,410
Life's like a house of cards.

958
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:14,044
Have a drink, sir.

959
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,382
No. I'll do it myself.

960
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,058
Recklessly?

961
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,325
Don't worry. I want to live.

962
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:57,654
I'll be waiting for you in the morning.

963
01:23:58,099 --> 01:23:59,760
Remember: 4:30.

964
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:00,901
No.

965
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,934
Well, then,
I guess this is where we part.

966
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:08,699
I doubt we'll ever meet again.

967
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,014
Only one of us will be proven right.

968
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:15,009
See you.

969
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,883
Do you believe in all this?

970
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:23,317
Me? That's of no importance.

971
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,971
Please buy some violets, sir.

972
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,104
Zoska, go home.

973
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:01,461
<i>It</i>'<i>s good when everything</i>'<i>s quiet.</i>

974
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,225
Come in.

975
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:12,096
<i>Forgive me, Comrade Szczuka.</i>

976
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:14,933
<i>I have an important message</i>
<i>from Major Wrona.</i>

977
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,715
Do you have a son, comrade?

978
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,846
Marek. He's 17.

979
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,253
- Bad news.
- What's wrong?

980
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:29,287
He was a part of Wilk's group.
We've got him in custody.

981
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:33,892
Major Wrona's sending a car.
The porter will tell you when it's here.

982
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,924
Very well. I'll wait.
Thank you, Lieutenant.

983
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,032
Do you know the name Wilk?

984
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,578
No.

985
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,545
What did you do during the uprising?

986
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:59,115
I shot... at Germans.

987
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:00,978
But now you shoot Poles.

988
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:05,491
And you shoot sparrows.

989
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,377
- Porter?
- Yes.

990
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:24,876
A car will arrive soon.

991
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,808
Tell Comrade Szczuka
to come down when it does.

992
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:30,712
Szczuka? Ah, in Room 18.
Very well.

993
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:52,552
Our patience has been rewarded.

994
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,688
Here's to Warsaw.

995
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,064
It's a beautiful night.
Time for a walk before my trip.

996
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,635
Are you leaving already?

997
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,971
I'm afraid I have a jealous wife.

998
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:18,957
Stop it! You're hurting my ears!

999
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:30,505
Gentlemen, it's time to go home.

1000
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,080
Just a moment, gentlemen.

1001
01:33:14,822 --> 01:33:17,222
<i>Music! I want to dance!</i>

1002
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:24,592
Are you artists, or are you not?

1003
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,726
At this time of night?

1004
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:28,732
Director, please.

1005
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:31,870
Time should be irrelevant to an artist.

1006
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:34,164
I demand absolute obedience.

1007
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:40,610
- It's no use.
- We've never played that before.

1008
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:43,173
No, I'll accept no excuses.

1009
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:45,478
Give me an A-major, young man.

1010
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:54,053
Ladies and gentlemen,

1011
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:57,625
the last dance... in A-major!

1012
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:31,496
What happened?

1013
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:33,893
Nothing. I have to leave.

1014
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,635
Now?

1015
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:38,630
My train's at 4:30.

1016
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:41,066
You weren't able to change things?

1017
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:42,472
No.

1018
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:46,536
All right then. Not another word.

1019
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,443
<i>No more excuses.</i>

1020
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:53,185
Don't say another word.

1021
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:56,487
Just go.

1022
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:10,600
Wonderful! Fantastic!

1023
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:14,838
And now, a great discovery!

1024
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:18,776
A salute to the new day!

1025
01:35:22,016 --> 01:35:23,745
A brilliant idea.

1026
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:26,918
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a polonaise!

1027
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,591
In pairs, please.

1028
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:42,801
Anyone opposed? No one.
I proclaim universal agreement.

1029
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:05,315
Quite the happy bunch.

1030
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:10,024
If we could only celebrate
a Warsaw not in ruins.

1031
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:15,229
Well, as long as I'm here,

1032
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,629
you can count on getting a nice room.

1033
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,605
Thank you. Good-bye.

1034
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:24,468
Sir!

1035
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:31,685
Give my regards to Ujazdowska Parkway.

1036
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,917
How's it going?

1037
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:08,416
Come here.

1038
01:37:12,426 --> 01:37:14,519
Give me that.

1039
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:17,657
So you've changed your mind!

1040
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:19,322
- What's this for?
- You don't know?

1041
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:28,465
You only came because you got fired!
Trying to be a hero now?

1042
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:36,783
What for?

1043
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:58,834
Maciek, stop!

1044
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:10,316
What are you, crazy?

1045
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:12,913
He's got a gun!

1046
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:16,446
Stop or I'll shoot!

1047
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:30,397
Careful! He's armed!

1048
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:32,605
- Where is he?
- Come on!

1049
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:03,169
- He couldn't have gotten far.
- I saw him!

1050
01:39:03,504 --> 01:39:04,971
This way!

1051
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:31,204
THE END
