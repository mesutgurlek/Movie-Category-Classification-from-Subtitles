1
00:00:00,724 --> 00:00:02,322
Mr. Akins received
this from a man

2
00:00:02,323 --> 00:00:04,527
who claims his
daughter worked here.

3
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,444
"Deviant freak"?

4
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:10,015
Control over my own trust.
Let me prove that I can do this.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,166
Alright.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,600
Your father's full name?

7
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:13,635
Daniel Andrews.

8
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,370
And you said he was a veterinarian.

9
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:16,671
That's news to me.

10
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:19,207
How long before
you tell the truth?

11
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:22,910
I'm trying to tell
a new story here.

12
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:27,048
If you are interested. I could
manage to be much less distant.

13
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:29,450
I got demoted today
because of you.

14
00:00:29,484 --> 00:00:32,653
Well then, stay the hell
away from me, Vera.

15
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:34,755
Mom?

16
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,723
Father told me you were dead.

17
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:40,126
Come on.

18
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:44,672
- It was a a nice cafe.
- Yes it was!

19
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:47,267
Surprise!

20
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:50,470
This is for you.

21
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:53,738
Happy wedding.

22
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:56,442
He'll make a honest
woman out of you.

23
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:58,577
Are you surprised?

24
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:00,045
I'll say.

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,181
And who do we have here?

26
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:06,385
This is my mom.

27
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:10,288
Your mom?

28
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:14,313
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

29
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:35,178
That's another drink for
the future Mrs. Ivan Buchinsky!

30
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:36,713
I don't mind.

31
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:39,483
I want a word with his
soon-to-be mother-in-law anyway.

32
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,317
Kate, isn't this amazing,

33
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,753
your mom being here after all
this time thinking she pasted.

34
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:46,822
Yeah.

35
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,657
C'mon, shower-girl
needs a breather.

36
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,992
Let's go again!

37
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,195
I read in the engagement notice
that your husband's a vet.

38
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,630
Vernon?

39
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:56,732
Oh no, he was a pacifist.

40
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,035
Now, Mother, stop teasing
Mrs. Corbett!

41
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,769
It's our old family joke,

42
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:04,672
"What d'you call a vet
who's never served?

43
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:06,974
A veterinarian!"

44
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,977
Plenty to be smile about now,
don't you, Mrs. Andrews?

45
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:10,811
Yes.

46
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:12,783
There's a spot in the game,
Mrs. C!

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,807
No no no no.
You... you--

48
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,808
Let's sit in here.

49
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:21,758
It's like basketball.

50
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:24,458
If I'd known I'd cause
such a commotion.

51
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:27,761
Don't worry about it
I'm only glad to see you.

52
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,529
You were hard to find.

53
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:31,497
Wasn't that the idea?

54
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:34,767
I know, but I'd reason
to trouble the waters.

55
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:38,137
Marion, I had a call from
a police detective.

56
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,275
What did he want?

57
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:46,411
To finish a conversation you'd had
about the night your father died.

58
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:48,380
He thinks it was foul play.

59
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:52,184
And he wants the truth about
your father's death.

60
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,859
Relax, Lore, it's just
a blood drive.

61
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:04,328
And guess who'll be there?

62
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:06,630
I tell you, I can't
quite get my head around

63
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:09,266
how they can draw
out your blood now

64
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:12,503
and just save it
for someone else.

65
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:15,473
Guess I don't care much for
doctors making advances,

66
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,974
however you square it.

67
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:23,413
Well, if we have boys leaking
blood all over the African sands,

68
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:27,283
we're damn lucky they found ways
to fill them back up again.

69
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:30,453
Suddenly you're a big
believer in modern medicine.

70
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:33,288
Patel says he can improve
these legs:

71
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:37,159
Exercises, electricity
on the muscles...

72
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:39,228
That "doctor" is selling
you snake-oil,

73
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,463
trading on your hopes
to nab our girl.

74
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:43,765
You can't rewrite thirty years.

75
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,001
Oh I'd say we can.

76
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,184
You okay, Mrs. Corbett?

77
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:07,220
I can't believe they go in there and
draw out half the blood God gave you.

78
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,655
We only take ten percent, Mom.

79
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,990
You joining the line or
just holding it up?

80
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,659
I'm busy corralling the workers.

81
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,994
Now I know why it's
called a blood drive.

82
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,596
That's quite the system.

83
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,931
Well, with nearly nine
thousand wounded allies

84
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,667
in that North African
desert, we need it.

85
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:25,871
To think our blood will be winging it
across the Atlantic and within 48 hours,

86
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:28,674
pumping through
the veins of our boys.

87
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:33,712
Visclovski, McRae, and Perrault?

88
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:36,782
Your turn to donate blood.

89
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,383
Mine too, Mrs. Corbett.

90
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:39,917
Didn't you give already?

91
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:42,253
Oh, I'd remember if I did.

92
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:44,289
Oh dear, I'm really
dropping the ball.

93
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:45,756
You're juggling a lot.

94
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:50,562
Boy, with this
Operation Supercharge,

95
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,797
Montgomery's throwing
everything he can at 'em.

96
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,831
Three years,
Rommel's gone undefeated.

97
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:57,067
Well, we got 'em on the run now.

98
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:01,004
You watch, the ole Desert Fox'll
be chewing on sand in no time.

99
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,639
Might want to look away.

100
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:05,275
There, you're done.

101
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,644
Mr. Parry.

102
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,912
Now there's something
I can set eyes on.

103
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,648
Count to sixty
before you get up.

104
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:15,084
Wish you'd been here earlier.

105
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:18,688
One look from you and the blood
drains right out of me.

106
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:19,988
Aren't you a card.

107
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,290
It's my low blood-pressure.

108
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:23,158
What's your game now,
Mr. Parry?

109
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:24,327
None left to play.

110
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:26,127
My stint here is winding up.

111
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,463
What, the war ended
and nobody told me?

112
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,298
I'll be assigned
another job elsewhere.

113
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,670
I'd hope by now you can trust me
to know where to send a postcard.

114
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,004
C'est la guerre.

115
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:43,176
Easy, you haven't
waited your minute.

116
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,212
I'm stronger than I look.

117
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,615
"Cheerio."

118
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,883
After work.
Testing field.

119
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,254
You'll have a glimpse of
what I've been all about.

120
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,421
Can't wait.

121
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,961
Boy, look at all that.

122
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,763
You'll want it on ice quick.

123
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,531
Could be going to my brother,

124
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:09,168
he's RAF, flying over the
Sahara right now.

125
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,639
Sinking fuel-ships and cutting
supplies from Nazi tanks.

126
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:13,938
You know a thing or two.

127
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,174
I met a few RCAF.

128
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,009
What's your brother's name?

129
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,177
We call him Twill.

130
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:19,778
Twill?

131
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,712
Yeah.

132
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,914
You don't forget a
name like that.

133
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,783
Glad to hear he's
still kicking.

134
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,151
What's your name?

135
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,952
Vera Burr.

136
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,120
Twill wrote about you.

137
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:34,425
He said there's no gal better
at bucking up a soldier.

138
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,127
Is that what he called it.

139
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,197
Oh hey, I meant it
as a compliment!

140
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,672
Ivan.

141
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:51,608
Apparently I gotta go have the life
drained outa me. Kiss for good luck?

142
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:55,244
I need to tell you something before one
of the other girls starts spilling.

143
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,079
Uh-oh. You get into trouble
at your shower last night?

144
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:00,148
Ivan, I haven't been
entirely honest.

145
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:02,184
It's my mother.
She's alive.

146
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:02,951
What?

147
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:05,053
I just found out yesterday.

148
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:09,224
How can she be,
not dead all of a sudden?

149
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:12,059
My father wasn't a good
man. He lied, Ivan,

150
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,295
and told me that my mother died.

151
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,065
When it was all to cover his pride
that she'd gone and left him.

152
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,201
What kind of man
lies about that?

153
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:21,302
It's hard to explain.

154
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:23,738
Try.

155
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:26,474
I hate to tell you this way.

156
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,775
But, see, my name's not Kate.

157
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,445
Miss Andrews!
I got a gent waiting to see you.

158
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,780
Detective.

159
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:34,981
Detective?

160
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:36,783
Come on.

161
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,622
What are you doing now?

162
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:44,122
Looking for a good vein.

163
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:46,258
And how do you know
when it's good?

164
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,293
Best ones are in the
antecubital fossa.

165
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:51,296
Visible, well supported
and with a large lumen.

166
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,297
What's a lumen?

167
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:53,532
Mother?

168
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:57,269
You're right, I don't
want to know.

169
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:58,937
But they're sure this is safe?

170
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:00,938
If you don't want to help out,

171
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:03,074
there's plenty of other
people who can.

172
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,109
I'm doing this,
Sheila, and I'm here.

173
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:07,211
Just get it over with.

174
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,618
You're good.

175
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,719
Top of nursing school,
I bet.

176
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:18,422
Turning all kinds of heads.
Teachers, doctors.

177
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,857
I've turned Narendra's head.

178
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:21,492
That's good enough for me.

179
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:22,359
I didn't mean...

180
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,127
You're still hoping that
I'll do better.

181
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:27,163
You should know that
I've quit looking.

182
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,766
You don't worry you'll get hurt?

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,067
I'm not going to stop seeing
a man, just because

184
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:35,337
he's one of the things out
there that scares you.

185
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:46,616
Fresh air and stout,
does the trick.

186
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,750
What's it going to like
in there for me now?

187
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:50,552
As far as VicMu is concerned,

188
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:53,555
your gravest sin was
missing a day's work.

189
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:55,056
Thank you.

190
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,559
When I say to you
"Don't mention it".

191
00:08:57,593 --> 00:09:00,729
You mean, don't mention it.

192
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:02,864
A man I know once said,

193
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,400
there's nothing more exhilarating
than to be shot at and missed.

194
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:08,869
You got yourself another
chance, Mr. Moretti.

195
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,504
Make it count.

196
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:18,378
I hear congratulations
are in order.

197
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:20,814
I'm getting married, yes.

198
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:23,750
If I hadn't seen your
picture in the paper

199
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:26,686
with this new name of yours,
I'd've never found you.

200
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,156
I would have been in touch
if I thought I could help.

201
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,493
Your father's injuries
tell us he fell backwards.

202
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:34,961
Any ideas how?

203
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:36,728
Must have lost his balance.

204
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:39,698
Our tests show he
wasn't a drinking man.

205
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:40,899
Never touched the stuff.

206
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,434
So what happened?

207
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:47,272
Sir, none of us likes it
when a man dies alone,

208
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:49,741
but when my father went?

209
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:53,143
It was just him and his Maker.

210
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:55,947
Yes.

211
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:59,684
Except your father was
covered with a canvas tarp

212
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,219
like a sleeping baby.

213
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:04,154
He didn't die alone.

214
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,957
Someone was with him.

215
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:09,025
Someone who wanted
to cover it all up.

216
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,705
You've gone a bit pale.

217
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:24,707
I gave blood today.

218
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,376
Oh.

219
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,844
No please, come in.

220
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,114
Thank you, Miss Rowley.

221
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,787
Miss Rowley, I know
where you are now.

222
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:46,293
You didn't know her
real name either.

223
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:47,428
"Real" name?

224
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,634
Lot of girls come from other
places, reinvent themselves.

225
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,302
So long as they do their work,
don't cause trouble...

226
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:58,038
Marion Rowley is the daughter
of a street preacher

227
00:10:58,072 --> 00:11:00,674
who died under suspicious
circumstances.

228
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:06,747
Kate's a good girl,
Detective Brodie.

229
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,050
What a sight.

230
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:13,653
Before the war, who'd have thought
women could work like this.

231
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:16,556
We've proved we're
as capable as men.

232
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,558
Yes.

233
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:22,194
I'm starting to think you're
capable of just about anything.

234
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:36,107
Blood drive's over for
today, come back tomorrow.

235
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:38,076
I'm here to see you, Vera.

236
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,879
Well I'm not here for
you, Marco. Not anymore.

237
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,280
You nearly sunk us both.

238
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:44,481
The guys you fell in with,
that guy Frankie?

239
00:11:44,515 --> 00:11:46,483
Is in jail. And I'm
done with that.

240
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:50,287
It's over. I promise.

241
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:53,023
Now please, let me
make it up to you.

242
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:54,925
What'd you have in mind?

243
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,760
Figured I'd pop by tonight.

244
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,062
Did you?

245
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:58,829
Yeah.

246
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:00,296
Say eleven-thirty?

247
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,098
Can I say no to that?

248
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,867
Why yes I can. I don't
need a Midnight Man.

249
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:07,536
Oh why? 'Cause you found a
Midnight Pipsqueak?

250
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:11,074
That half-pint soldier
you were chatting up?

251
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:14,210
Life's more than a parade
of randy service men.

252
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,720
You need a better gambit than
leading a girl to nowhere

253
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,889
and ruining her shoes while
you play Man of Mystery.

254
00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:29,592
I can't tell you
where I'm going...

255
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,193
but I can show you
why I've been here.

256
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,229
Is this one of my
father's tins?

257
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:35,997
Patience and I
will show you.

258
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,965
Show me what? A blob
of plasticine?

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,434
Not quite. That's dangerous.

260
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,603
Well I'm tired of your secrets,
Clifford.

261
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,870
Give it to me!

262
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:44,705
Not till you start
shooting straight.

263
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,146
What are you doing
get off me!

264
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,223
Did somebody just bomb us?

265
00:13:05,258 --> 00:13:07,492
Yes. You did.

266
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:08,593
What on earth...?

267
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,398
Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine.

268
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:16,468
In English, please?

269
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:17,770
RDX.

270
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,837
Research Department Explosive.

271
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:23,107
Uses a fraction of the materials
and packs twice the punch.

272
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,276
Hitler won't know what hit him.

273
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,477
I know I didn't.

274
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,880
We're using it in the
Sahara right now.

275
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,015
And we advanced this in our lab?

276
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,350
Yes. I'd hoped my
demonstration here would

277
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:35,653
be somewhat more, controlled.

278
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,921
And the tin, my father's design.

279
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:41,124
So Operatives can carry it
discreetly behind enemy lines.

280
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,625
Why show me this?

281
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,428
And I hate the thought
of leaving without you

282
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,630
knowing what we are all about.

283
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:50,300
Well, next time you're looking
to turn a girl's head...

284
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:54,570
make sure she doesn't
nearly blow it off first.

285
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:01,210
Here it is.

286
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:03,045
Elizabeth McRae

287
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,185
"Betty McRae...

288
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:14,956
Deviant freak. Seduced my
daughter, Marion Rowley."

289
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:19,027
Lorna? What are you doing?

290
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:24,698
What have you got there?

291
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:35,103
Easy going, Ivan.

292
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:36,771
You're down a pint of blood.

293
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,106
That's one way to
save money on beer.

294
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:41,709
I know I threw a lot at you.

295
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,578
Do I call you "Marion" now?

296
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:44,746
No!

297
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,717
Ivan, I'm still Kate
to anyone who matters.

298
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:52,619
And the cop?

299
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:55,188
Why's he think your dad's
death was suspicious?

300
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:57,257
I don't know.

301
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,391
Honest.

302
00:14:58,426 --> 00:15:02,596
Was your dad even
a veterinarian?

303
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,566
Was he?

304
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:13,940
You saw the scars on my back.

305
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:17,509
He was supposed to
be a man of God.

306
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:20,112
And I'm ashamed, Ivan...

307
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:23,849
of everything that I come from.

308
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:26,818
And if you knew you
wouldn't blame me.

309
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,522
I'm still the same girl.

310
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,262
You'll be a Buchinsky soon.

311
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,801
I just want our life to start.

312
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:46,369
So we take the train
to Winnipeg.

313
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,905
What, and get married there?

314
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:49,306
New job,

315
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,942
new home... it's a lot
cheaper out there.

316
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:53,110
Run away?

317
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:57,614
It's not running away
if you're going home.

318
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:58,681
Let's do it.

319
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:01,985
Everything will be better
once we're out there.

320
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:10,660
Glady, here I am entertaining
at your hotel.

321
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:13,328
You'd asked for more
of your winter clothes.

322
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:14,663
Did Mother bring my coats?

323
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:17,298
I was feeling a chill
on the way home from work,

324
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,534
A nip of brandy will
warm those bones.

325
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:20,702
Come on in.

326
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:23,239
I'll have a bellman bring up
your luggage up from the car.

327
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,341
What are you doing
entertaining at The Hedley?

328
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,844
I'm here with some military associates
who depart soon for overseas.

329
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:32,379
We're celebrating
a job well done.

330
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:34,849
Clifford Parry, is he here?

331
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,684
How well do you know him?

332
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,853
A few dust-ups on factory turf,

333
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,554
nothing to speak of.

334
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:43,991
Gladys, dear, I was just
waxing on about you.

335
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:45,659
You know Clifford Parry.

336
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:48,628
Miss Witham. Nice to see you
out of the factory.

337
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:52,431
Mr. Parry was just telling me how he held
back Churchill against Lord Halifax.

338
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:56,002
Imagine the pickle we'd be in if our
British Bulldog hadn't prevailed.

339
00:16:56,037 --> 00:17:00,140
No doubt we have you to thank
for the defence of the free world.

340
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:03,008
Your father was lending us a great
help in our latest round.

341
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,176
Something about the container,

342
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,944
that's all they'll tell us gals!

343
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,345
I'm proud of you, Daddy.

344
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,149
I have an inspiring force in
you, my dear.

345
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:13,085
If this country had more
women like your daughter...

346
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,088
the danger she faces
on a daily basis?

347
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:19,623
Mr. Parry, I'll faint in your
arms if you're not careful.

348
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:23,127
Perhaps, she could pursue your
line of work, Mr. Parry.

349
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:28,399
What's so funny
about that Daddy?

350
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:31,569
Not to worry, Gladys is
hardly intelligence material.

351
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:34,337
What she has in moxie,
she lacks in judgment.

352
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,040
You do know I'm standing
right next to you.

353
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:39,976
I'm only saying, your parents
have nothing to worry about.

354
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:43,980
I'm sure coming from a virtual
stranger, that's a great relief.

355
00:17:44,015 --> 00:17:45,048
Come, Mr. Parry,

356
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,984
let's freshen your drink
and go speak to the Major.

357
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,252
It was a pleasure, Miss Witham.

358
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,156
I'll give him moxie.

359
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:56,358
He's lucky he's
leaving the country.

360
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,359
Now, now.

361
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:00,930
Mr. Parry told me he thought
you quite liked him.

362
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:05,233
Something about an explosive
afternoon at work?

363
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:10,038
Mr. Akins caught me red-handed.

364
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,406
Looking at a girl's
employee records.

365
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,142
There's nothing wrong with that.

366
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,011
Except now he's gone and
taken what he found

367
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:21,081
in those files and
given it to the police.

368
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,282
Damn it.

369
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:25,685
Why didn't I just go and burn
the letter the first time,

370
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,221
when I had the chance?

371
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:30,023
It'll just shine a little
light into the dark.

372
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:32,025
And who knows what'll
come crawling out?

373
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,527
This could do your
girl some help.

374
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:38,430
This preacher who wrote it sounds
like one hell of a lunatic.

375
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,733
This detective won't
see it that way.

376
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,368
You don't know that, Lorna.

377
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:44,170
We women, the jobs we do,

378
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:48,374
he thinks it perverts a girl.
He's a man who hates us.

379
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:50,576
I need to talk sense
into that detective.

380
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:56,047
Seems a lot for a
lady to carry alone.

381
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:57,048
It's just a mix-up.

382
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,251
Bellhop brought it here
instead of my room.

383
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,819
Nothing a fifty-cent
tip won't cure.

384
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:01,887
Oh fifty cents?

385
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,688
Well, I am between jobs now.

386
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:06,057
It's a good time to
improve your discretion,

387
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:07,959
learn how to talk to a girl.

388
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:09,994
Gladys, let's be
nice to our friends.

389
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:11,028
I'm sorry mother.

390
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:14,265
Must have been a
residual belch of moxie.

391
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,400
You want nice?
I'll give nice.

392
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:17,734
Let's go, Jeeves.

393
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,504
Until we meet again, Mr. Parry.

394
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,511
You sure
like your steak.

395
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,914
I need it.

396
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,748
I donated blood today.

397
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:39,189
So, what else did your
brother say about me?

398
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:42,324
That thinking of you gets
him through the dark,

399
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:47,830
knowing there's girls like you
back home helps him fight.

400
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:50,765
Well, that's sweet.

401
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,368
You cutting his meat there,
Vera?

402
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,037
This ain't your party.

403
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:57,438
You're just doing this
to get me going.

404
00:19:57,472 --> 00:20:00,241
Don't flatter yourself.

405
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,643
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

406
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:04,378
Is that right?

407
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,782
Enough. Quincy, if he
doesn't shove off, we will.

408
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:11,752
Let's go have some dessert.

409
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:22,695
"My daughter has been
corrupted by your factory

410
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,798
and your employees,
namely one Betty McRae."

411
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,401
This man, he's a twisted soul.

412
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,070
He was a pious, God-fearing man.

413
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,473
And every father has the right to
protect and correct his daughter.

414
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:37,743
She sings for the
soldiers at the hospital.

415
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:40,412
Two perfect angels.

416
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,281
They may have made mistakes.

417
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:44,483
Like what they did
to Vernon Rowley.

418
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:47,285
Why are you dogging
them like this?

419
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,688
Because I hate it when
people lie to me.

420
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:53,524
You know what,
I can always tell.

421
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:56,160
Anything else you
want to say to me?

422
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,882
Tip for services rendered?

423
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,551
You want a tip, Clifford?

424
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:10,522
Stop swanning around here like a
class-act with a plum in your mouth.

425
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,524
I was attempting to
protect your career.

426
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:14,759
By belittling me to my parents?

427
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:16,928
They already think
little enough.

428
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:20,130
I need to keep it that way,
if you're to move forward.

429
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:21,665
What is your big plan here?

430
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,233
Your job's only beginning.

431
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,135
What does that mean?

432
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:26,001
What are you...

433
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:29,004
Let go!

434
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,905
My dress.

435
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,675
- I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

436
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,014
Take it off.

437
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,783
You heard me.

438
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:43,585
Take off your dress.

439
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:44,686
I'll fix it.

440
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:47,656
Boy, when you said dessert,

441
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,691
I wasn't thinking a
plate of cookies.

442
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,795
Sweetie, that's your
sugar ration and some.

443
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,931
Never seen so many dresses.

444
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:59,667
The coral one's
my favourite.

445
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,169
It's my best colour.

446
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,541
Have you never been in a
girl's room before?

447
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,543
No.

448
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:14,681
And I'm figuring I'm only here
so's to make that fellow jealous.

449
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:17,984
Yeah, he's one man who's
never coming back in here.

450
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:19,486
Why's that?

451
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:23,656
Well...

452
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:27,727
let me tell you
about girls, Quincy.

453
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:31,430
It's like your brother
flying over the Sahara.

454
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:35,333
You need to know what
you're gunning for.

455
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,369
You have to like her for her.

456
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:40,305
Not just because she's
available.

457
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,974
And you let her know
she's the special one,

458
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:44,743
because if you don't?

459
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:48,212
She moves on.

460
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,768
Good night, Quincy.

461
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,775
You run, Marion,
You'll get chased.

462
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,877
I got myself free last time.

463
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:23,045
You'll look guilty.

464
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,281
I am guilty, Mom.

465
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:28,484
I was there on his last night.

466
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:30,886
He flew off in
one of his rages.

467
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:33,288
I thought he was
going to kill me.

468
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:34,288
And he fell.

469
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:37,826
He fell from a height
and landed hard...

470
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,227
and he died.

471
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:41,930
I was afraid to say.

472
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:42,797
Oh, Marion.

473
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,999
And I should have come forward,
I know.

474
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:48,235
And now it's too late.

475
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,871
I'd rather take my
chances with Ivan.

476
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,345
Okay, I understand.

477
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:10,255
Impressive.

478
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,827
I was a journalist,
then a soldier.

479
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:17,029
You learn a thing or two.

480
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,602
Thank you.

481
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:27,806
You've a rare gift,

482
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,276
you can navigate
different worlds.

483
00:24:32,311 --> 00:24:36,615
Your intelligence,
your patriotism,

484
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:40,521
it hasn't darkened your spirit
the way it has some men.

485
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:46,058
Half my job is
hiding what I feel.

486
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,930
The shell never cracks.

487
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:55,999
But I'm fighting for a time
when I won't need secrets.

488
00:24:57,735 --> 00:24:59,869
I only hope,

489
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,572
I'll remember how to
live without them.

490
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,680
You can turn around.

491
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,298
You take care of my daughter,
you hear?

492
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,934
I'll be out to Winnipeg to check
up on you soon.

493
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:09,969
Yes, Ma'am.

494
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,737
She's a special girl,
I'll take good care of her.

495
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,671
We should get moving.

496
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,239
I love you, Mom.

497
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,777
I doubt anyone's
travelling tonight.

498
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,246
I need to ask you a
few questions.

499
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,082
My friend Betty's expecting us.

500
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,652
Oh, Miss McRae is already
at the station.

501
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,753
She doesn't have to go with you.

502
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:31,387
Then I'll come back
with a warrant.

503
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:32,990
A warrant? For what?

504
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,925
I'll go, whatever you want.

505
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,159
A warrant for what?!

506
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:39,229
For her arrest in connection with
the death of her father, Vernon Rowley.

507
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:40,931
Kate?

508
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,966
- I had nothing to do with it.
- I'm coming too.

509
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,702
You stay here, get
the boy a paper bag.

510
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:48,570
We'll leave tomorrow, okay?

511
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:50,006
I don't even know you.

512
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,175
- It's his asthma, he needs help!
- C'mon!

513
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:55,045
You being here is making
it worse. Come on.

514
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:58,948
Wait. Stop! You can't do this!
Mom?  Mom!

515
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:00,816
Mom! Call an ambulance!

516
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:04,343
Where were you the night
of February 13th?

517
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:05,579
The night he died?

518
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:08,614
I went to some "do" at a
friend's, then I went home.

519
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:09,515
And before the party?

520
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,349
I worked. Check my time-sheet.

521
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:12,918
I hadn't seen her for months.

522
00:27:12,953 --> 00:27:16,388
I've a patrolman who identified you in a
fight with the man the night he died.

523
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:17,522
It must've been another girl.

524
00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:19,524
The last time she saw my father?

525
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,393
The night he came to
the rooming house.

526
00:27:21,427 --> 00:27:22,094
They shook hands...

527
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:23,563
And I wished them all the best.

528
00:27:23,597 --> 00:27:25,830
- He'd scream every day on that corner.
- He scream at you?

529
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,866
I needed correction.

530
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:30,034
Saw her scars?

531
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:32,436
You feel Miss Rowley
was trapped?

532
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:34,238
Kate's a grown woman!

533
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,608
I could've left if I wanted to.

534
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:37,541
And the letter?

535
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:38,409
What letter?

536
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:39,343
What letter?

537
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,714
You loved her.

538
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:46,483
She was your obsession.

539
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:49,219
But Daddy stood in your way.

540
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,088
You had a grudge.

541
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:54,891
And here's a girl who you knew
would do your dirty-work.

542
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,526
What kind of monsters
do you think we are?

543
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,129
Women hold our moral centre.

544
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:03,332
Only what's been asked
of you in this war,

545
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:06,235
is stripping all
of that away.

546
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,770
You can't prove a thing.

547
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:09,538
You can't prove a thing.

548
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:10,706
Watch me.

549
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:17,979
So both of them? In jail?

550
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:19,514
All night with the police.

551
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,449
And capped it off
with a warrant.

552
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,584
Just like that?

553
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,052
I hate to trouble you,

554
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,787
but there was nobody else I...

555
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:28,055
It's no trouble.

556
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,458
My daughter's in jail,
Mrs. Corbett.

557
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:33,361
I can't lose her again.

558
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,529
Please.

559
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:43,936
For the sake of
appearances, you go in first.

560
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:48,808
Meet me in my office at
lunch. I've a proposition.

561
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:58,617
Miss Witham. I need your help.

562
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:00,118
This is the wrong way.

563
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:01,420
Not today.

564
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:03,822
Betty and Kate,
they're in terrible trouble.

565
00:29:03,856 --> 00:29:06,592
And I don't know how to fix it.

566
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:13,798
Still can't believe I went
and fell asleep on you.

567
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:14,699
What a lightweight.

568
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:18,403
Beer has that effect
on the best of them.

569
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:19,904
Once we load out tomorrow,

570
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:21,706
that'll be it for
the blood drive.

571
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,773
Till the next one.

572
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:25,542
By then, I'll be over there.

573
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,944
Yeah?

574
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:32,916
Well, keep your head low,
and say hi to Twill for me.

575
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:35,385
Incoming...

576
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:46,995
Woops,

577
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,598
left a little axel grease.

578
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:49,798
Keep it.

579
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,568
It'll earn you some
respect from the boys.

580
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,305
I'll never forget you,
Vera Burr.

581
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:01,075
Elizabeth McRae
and Marion Rowley

582
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,179
are charged with murder
in the second degree.

583
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:10,385
Accused of violently ending
the life of Vernon Rowley.

584
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:13,354
Given that Miss Rowley has been
living under a false identity,

585
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:15,222
can we assume there's
a high risk of flight?

586
00:30:15,257 --> 00:30:16,890
Yes.

587
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:18,259
What does the Crown recommend?

588
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:20,761
That bail be denied,
Your Worship.

589
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:22,496
We didn't kill anybody, honest.

590
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,031
This is a bail hearing,
not a trial.

591
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,700
With grave charges.

592
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,439
Bail is set in the
amount of $7,000 each.

593
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:35,775
Until such time as
bail can be met,

594
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:37,943
the defendants will be
remanded into custody.

595
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:44,116
Your Honour?

596
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:45,751
"Your Worship."

597
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:47,185
Yes.

598
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:52,524
Well, I will offer a surety.

599
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:53,592
Gladys?

600
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:56,495
You are in possession of
fourteen thousand dollars?

601
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,829
Yes, sir.

602
00:30:57,863 --> 00:30:59,298
My name is Gladys Witham.

603
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:00,798
And your father?

604
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:03,501
Does he know you're involved
in this sordid business?

605
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:05,603
It's not my father's money.

606
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:07,037
As a surety,

607
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:09,940
it's your responsibility that the
accused adhere to the terms of bail,

608
00:31:09,974 --> 00:31:12,142
report to bail officers,
and attend all hearings.

609
00:31:12,177 --> 00:31:15,413
If not, you lose every dime.

610
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:16,846
I understand.

611
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,947
So ask yourself,

612
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,583
how much do you trust
in these girls?

613
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,328
Your Worship, I believe
in these women.

614
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:37,966
Bail is granted. Miss Witham,
settle with the court office.

615
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,003
And you, young women,
do not fail your friend.

616
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:51,045
Gladys.

617
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,314
I've got to go to the office.

618
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:54,515
Gladys, thank you.

619
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,252
I'm so sorry I did this.

620
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:01,255
I said my first prayer in
I don't know how long,

621
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:03,458
thanking God for you here.

622
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:06,593
You had your secrets.
I understand.

623
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,598
Go see your mom.

624
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:15,369
I should have just destroyed
the letter when I had the chance.

625
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:16,202
It's okay.

626
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:18,004
I could have done
better by you.

627
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,873
Look, I'm sorry. Both of you.

628
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,841
This won't be
an easy fight.

629
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,342
We'll work up a defence.

630
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:25,444
It doesn't work,

631
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,913
fixing each other's lives.

632
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,882
Some things just
have to play out.

633
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,316
Betty, this is not over.

634
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:35,087
Princess? I can't owe you more.

635
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,193
This just in.

636
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:57,641
"I'm advancing without cover.
Jewel Box, 8pm."

637
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,389
A coral dress.

638
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,791
Quincy...

639
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:17,693
Dividends from the
blood-drive?

640
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:20,797
I saw that solider
chatting you up.

641
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,766
You know, Carol?

642
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,968
They say the tide is turning,

643
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:30,841
that the battles we're fighting
might finally end different.

644
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,444
You ask me.

645
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:36,945
Isn't it time,

646
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,380
we change things here, too?

647
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:46,353
Is he nice, your soldier?

648
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,322
Yes.

649
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:49,990
He's very nice.

650
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:55,629
But I can't do this anymore.

651
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:02,635
I tell you, these asthma
cigarettes never seem to help.

652
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:07,574
Excuse me, excuse me.

653
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:11,911
They let you out.

654
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:16,548
Gladys put up bail, but
we can't leave the city, yet.

655
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,416
I'm so sorry Ivan.

656
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:24,155
We're not going anywhere, Kate.

657
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,557
The wedding's off.

658
00:34:30,562 --> 00:34:32,730
You don't mean that.

659
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:38,669
I changed my life for you.

660
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:40,838
And when you had the
chance to come clean,

661
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:42,507
you only lied more.

662
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,708
I don't even know
what to call you!

663
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:47,577
Kate!

664
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:49,245
You call me Kate.

665
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:56,285
I gave you my heart.

666
00:34:58,756 --> 00:34:59,689
Nurse?

667
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:00,990
Just go.

668
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:01,891
Nurse!

669
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,393
Kate, just go and
I'll be better.

670
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:26,663
Waiting for someone?

671
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,433
Yeah.

672
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,603
Nice dress?

673
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:38,107
Well he's a nice soldier.

674
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:40,009
So, why's it in the box?

675
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:42,378
If you must know,
I'm not taking it.

676
00:35:42,412 --> 00:35:43,813
Why is that?

677
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,081
It's your favourite colour.

678
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:48,017
How would you know
what colour it is?

679
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:57,161
You're the one
who bought this dress?

680
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:02,297
I know a thing or
two about you, Vera.

681
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:04,766
But all I've been able
to see lately is

682
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:07,334
the mess I've let this
war make of my life.

683
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:10,871
I've been either too blind or
too stupid to tell,

684
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:13,140
that all this time, Vera,

685
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:16,743
I'm looking at the best thing
that ever happened to me.

686
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:25,852
I've got this... thick porterhouse
steak for two on order.

687
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:31,657
Hey.

688
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,727
You're not out of
the doghouse yet.

689
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:36,229
I know.

690
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,869
Ivan won't see me.

691
00:36:43,903 --> 00:36:45,770
He says I'm no good.

692
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:50,142
He'll come 'round.

693
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:51,977
Why should he?

694
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,945
He's right, I'm a liar.

695
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,883
We didn't kill your dad.

696
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,417
It was an accident.

697
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,686
They're after us hard, Betty.

698
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:07,358
And there's no way to play this
where we come out looking good.

699
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,394
I should've never
asked you to stay.

700
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:13,894
You wanted to leave when he died
and I wouldn't let you.

701
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,903
I'm sorry.

702
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:23,940
Growing up in that
awful caravan,

703
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,176
I never thought that
I'd have a future.

704
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:33,448
But in the last year, I've lived
more than I ever dreamt.

705
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:38,687
I found a real home.

706
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:42,456
And I met a man who
was good to me.

707
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:45,093
And I found a friend, Betty.

708
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,560
A real friend.

709
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,666
Who loved me.

710
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:06,980
<i>Allied tanks, planes, and infantry</i>
<i>continue to dispense sledge-hammer blows</i>

711
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:10,617
<i>to the fleeing, beleagured</i>
<i>German and Italian divisions</i>

712
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:13,186
<i>forcing them back toward</i>
<i>the Libyan border.</i>

713
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:15,054
That's a tide turning,
right there.

714
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:18,291
Feels like it's the first time
that's happened this war

715
00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:19,825
That's because it is.

716
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,328
Mom, what's that smell?

717
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:26,332
It's lentils.

718
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:29,101
Lentils? What kind
of dinner is lentils?

719
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:31,269
Welcome.

720
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:33,838
Narendra?

721
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:34,839
Well.

722
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:37,508
I invited him for supper.

723
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:38,443
You did?

724
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:39,877
Thank you for having me.

725
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:40,946
You're welcome.

726
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:48,319
Some things have to play out.

727
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:51,788
Well, come in, Doctor.
Take a seat.

728
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:05,968
- How go your exercises, Mr. Corbett?
- Very well--

729
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:10,206
Good morning.

730
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,244
Honey. You should
eat something.

731
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,081
I'm done running, Mom.

732
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:24,152
I'm going to tell the truth.

733
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:32,627
What's this?

734
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,595
Something that Betty left you.

735
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,766
"You're safe here now."

736
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:46,073
Marion what happened?

737
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,508
I've gotta stop her.

738
00:39:53,797 --> 00:39:56,032
You're up early.

739
00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:57,433
What are you doing?

740
00:39:58,168 --> 00:40:02,005
Figuring out how to convince
my father I'm no fool.

741
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,874
He'll think I just threw
away my trust fund.

742
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:07,309
I can hear him now:

743
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,511
"You hardly know these girls."

744
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:11,613
Father doesn't see
what I see.

745
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:16,785
The courage, shrewdness,
creative thinking.

746
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,393
They don't look good
on a Rosedale Girl.

747
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,201
Then get out of Rosedale.

748
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:36,036
Easy for you to say,

749
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,404
you're leaving.

750
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,540
There's a place we
call "the farm,"

751
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:42,508
a good drive out of town.

752
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:44,777
Allied operatives from around
the world train there,

753
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:47,447
and carry out missions.

754
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,715
No volunteers.
Only recruits.

755
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,850
Sounds like a dime-store novel.

756
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:53,385
We'll help win this war.

757
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,854
New codes, new technologies.

758
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:58,023
RDX is only the beginning.

759
00:40:58,058 --> 00:41:01,226
You're telling me this now, why?

760
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:04,529
Because I want you in.

761
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:07,531
Of course, you'd be subject
to the Official Secrets Act.

762
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,534
Family, friends,

763
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,971
they can never know.

764
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:15,939
You have what it takes, Gladys.

765
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,475
Are you up for the job?

766
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,777
Betty?

767
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:22,846
Betty?

768
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,485
Betty! Betty!

769
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,853
You were saying.

770
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,453
Betty! Betty!

771
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,756
I went to see the preacher,

772
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,860
to tell him to stop
harassing me at work.

773
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:39,561
He got mad.

774
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:40,829
Go on.

775
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:47,435
He attacked me,
had me on the run.

776
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:55,276
I went into this alleyway,
up a fire-escape.

777
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:57,712
He was right behind me,

778
00:41:57,746 --> 00:42:01,216
grabbing me, hitting me.

779
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,683
And then what?

780
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:06,586
He fell.

781
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:08,522
And your friend Marion?

782
00:42:08,556 --> 00:42:11,625
My friend Marion was not there.

783
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,394
I'll swear to it.

784
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:32,978
They say with El Alamein,
the tide is turning.

785
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:40,885
Girls, they're lucky
they have you here.

786
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,089
Otherwise, who knows what
might happen to them?

787
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,027
You have something for me?

788
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,441
The turning tide.

789
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:05,342
How did Churchill put it?

790
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,944
"Now this,

791
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:08,778
is not the end."

792
00:43:08,812 --> 00:43:12,048
"It is not even the
beginning of the end."

793
00:43:15,086 --> 00:43:17,920
"But it is, perhaps..."

794
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:22,925
"...the end of the beginning."

795
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:41,145
