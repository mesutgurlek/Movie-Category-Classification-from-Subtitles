296
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:22,077
- Lay it on her, will ya?
- What, baby?

297
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:25,741
- Me? Married? Married?
- Of course I'm not married, Mildred.

298
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,751
- Come on. Cut it out.
- Wh-Who could follow you?

299
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,982
- Hey, we could lose this line.
- Lay it on her, will ya?

300
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:34,388
Uh, honey, look.
I want ya to do me a favor.

301
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:37,758
There's a package under
the name of"Pierce"...

302
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:41,993
at a place called "Adam's Ribs"
next to the Dearborn Street station.

303
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,466
I want you to go in there and pay for it
and take it to the M.P. S...

304
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,060
at Midway Airport.

305
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:49,436
Yeah, I'll send you
a check for it.

306
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:53,910
Uh, mark the package
"Dr. B.F. Pierce...

307
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:57,539
"4077 MASH, Korea.

308
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,516
Rush: Medical Supplies."

309
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:03,383
What? It's ribs and sauce.

310
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:06,150
- Yeah. We use 'em for, uh...
- Anatomy practice.

311
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,624
Anatomy practice, right.

312
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:11,560
Well, they don't allow us
to work on real people.

313
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:15,463
The sauce? Well, uh, they don't let us
use real blood, either.

314
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,502
You understand?

315
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:20,628
Boy, she's smart.

316
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:24,732
<i>Thanks a lot, Mildred.</i>
<i>Right, honey. Bye-bye.</i>

317
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,277
- [Whispering]
Come on, come on.
- Mildred, I can't keep the war on hold.

318
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:29,836
I gotta go. Bye-bye.
[Kissing Sounds]

319
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:34,579
- [Cackling] Radar.
- Yeah?

320
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:36,779
Wire the M.P. S at Midway Airport.

321
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:39,345
Tell them that the package is
for Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce.

322
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:42,791
- Yeah.
- General MacArthur's personal physician.

323
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,626
MacArthur. Wow. I've never been
in the stockade before.

324
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:50,190
Then wire the, uh, Military Air
Transport Service, A.P.O. San Francisco.

325
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:53,237
- "A.P. O..."
- Tell them that it's urgent.
Critical medical supplies.

326
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:56,068
- "Critical..."
- "Handle with Care. Highly Infectious."

327
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,074
Uh, mark it,
"Quickest possible.

328
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,440
Do not spill.
Keep refrigerated."

329
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,911
Way to go,
"Big John."

330
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:15,288
- Sir. Wake up, sir.
The spareribs are here.
- Where? Where?

331
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,226
They're in a supply depot
down in Ouijongbu.

332
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,958
- Uh, they're hung up in channels.
- Who hung 'em?

333
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:23,557
Well, I talked to a Major Pfiefer.

334
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,262
- He wouldn't even talk
to me when I talked to him.
- What'd he say?

335
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:31,138
He started with, "Drop dead."
And then he got rude!

336
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:35,043
We'll get him, even if
we have to call Klinger's uncle.

337
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:37,877
- Trap? Wake up!
- [Mumbling] Mildred...

338
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:41,214
- Me and the ribs, we're all in Korea!
- Let's eat!

339
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:47,024
Come on, Dan.
It's on the way to Seoul.

340
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,821
No room. I gotta take
this kid down for X ray.

341
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:52,089
Unless you want to use
the rumble seats.

342
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,723
- Okay! You got it!
- Gimme your hand.

343
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,233
Climb under.
Watch your head.

344
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,235
Okay, get him in.

345
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:25,287
"4077 MASH..."
Oh yes, talked to some...

346
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:27,490
cocky little nurse
at your outfit.

347
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,830
- Radar.
- Tried to muscle me on the phone.

348
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:32,893
She's a tough little cookie.

349
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,929
There it is. "One box,
medical supplies. Marked urgent."

350
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:39,909
- Figures.
- We're doctors.
We need that stuff, Major.

351
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,538
- It's important.
- Yeah, it's a new wonder drug.

352
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:46,816
Top shelf.

353
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:52,950
Keep those code numbers
to the front, so we can read them.

354
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:55,891
Oh, sorry.
It's only our first day on the job.

355
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,225
- What about our package?
- You know what I've got to process?

356
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:04,564
Twelve Sherman tanks, 2,000 blankets,
100,000 rolls of toilet paper.

357
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:08,571
A trainload of semiautomatic
corn poppers and baby A-bomb components.

358
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:12,268
- They're delicious with popcorn.
- Whatever it is, I've got it.

359
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:15,801
And you want me to find
one insignificant little box
of med supplies.

360
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:19,105
We sometimes use them
in our work.

361
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:22,675
You think because
you save lives, it's important.

362
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:24,846
Move this over there.

363
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,857
Sure.

364
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:30,393
- Another box of hernias, huh?
- [Grunting, Sighing]

365
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:33,453
Major, you're not
gonna cooperate, huh?

366
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:36,625
If I help one person,
I have to help everybody.

367
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:40,068
You can't run a war
on cooperation.

368
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,401
All right, fine.
We'll go up the line.

369
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,566
- Who's your boss?
- My sergeant.

370
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:47,736
- Where is he?
- Look, he's very busy,
and I don't want him upset.

371
00:21:47,812 --> 00:21:49,905
We're not gonna upset him.

372
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:52,245
He's over in Admin.
Sergeant Tarola.

373
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:54,250
Please don't tell him
I sent you.

374
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,479
Thank you, Major.
You've been a tower ofJell-O.

375
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,480
Nobody cut
requisition orders on this.

376
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,492
Emergency medical shipment,
Sergeant.

377
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,994
There's no S-47/19-J accompanying.

378
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:08,691
I told you we should have
got an S-47/19-J accompanying,
but you wouldn't listen!

379
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:11,758
- That's necessary?
- Necessary?

380
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:17,001
We don't go to latrine around here
without an S-47/19-J. Sorry.

381
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:25,440
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but this little supermarket
of yours isn't all that clean.

382
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:28,815
Yeah. Ideal breeding
environment for cholera.

383
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:31,081
- The plague.
- You're kidding.

384
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:33,316
Do you always sweat
in 40-degree temperature?

385
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:36,292
- I'm not sweating.
- You should be.

386
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,294
Nothin' wrong with me.
I feel sensational.

387
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:40,853
Ah! There it is.
Say that again, will ya?

388
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,696
I feel sensational?

389
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:47,295
- Definite slurring of the "S."
- Classic early symptom.

390
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:51,102
- <i>Followed by the eyes blinking</i>
<i>in an up-and-down motion.</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

391
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,473
You know if there's plague here,
we'll have to close the place.

392
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:55,478
Post it as a contagious area.

393
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:57,480
- Give you a chance to be reassigned.
- You're probably anxious...

394
00:22:57,548 --> 00:23:00,483
to get up to the fighting war
anyway, aren't you?

395
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,821
[Scoffs]
What's in the package?

396
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,292
Spareribs and sauce from Chicago.

397
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:14,397
- Adam's Ribs?
- You know?

398
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:17,659
I'm from Joliet.
I'd walk to Chicago on my knees...

399
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:19,929
in the snow for a takeout order.

400
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:21,937
He's one of you.

401
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:25,236
- How many you got?
- Forty pounds.

402
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:27,401
I'll take twenty
and a quart of sauce.

403
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,513
Ten, and a pint of sauce.

404
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:35,108
Twelve, and a pint and
a half. And coleslaw.

405
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:40,055
We didn't order any coleslaw.

406
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:45,485
You sent all the way
to Chicago, and no coleslaw?

407
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,864
Forgive us, we're draftees.

408
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,225
##<i>[Wolf Whistle]</i>

409
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:25,125
Shall we give thanks?

410
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:27,135
Praise the Lord
and pass the sauce.

411
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:29,137
<i>[Man On P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention all personnel. Attention.</i>

<i>Choppers on the upper pad.</i>

<i>All O.R. Personnel</i>

No! No, that's not fair!

417
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,048
- Come on.
- No, no, wait! It's not fair!
We got ribs now!

418
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:50,524
Adam's Ribs from Chicago!
We lied to Mildred!

419
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:53,153
I had to send her a check!
