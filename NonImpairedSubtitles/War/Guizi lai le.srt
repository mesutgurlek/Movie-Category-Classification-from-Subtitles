Ma Dason

38
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
What's this village called?

39
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,309
Rock-Armour Terroce

40
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,312
Whats you doing up so late?

41
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313

Don't let the Jap devils find out

47
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
Any slip up...

48
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
and you will be dead man

49
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,334
But... they got a blockhouse here

50
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,302
It could be hard

51
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,671
It will be alright

52
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,045
This is called
"shadow under the lamplight"

53
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
understand?

54
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,315

55
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,247

56
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,987

57
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,211

58
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,241

00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,359
It is alive

60
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,526
This is bad!
I'll tell that guy

61
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,869
Ma dason

62
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,409

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,411
in your sparetiem,
interogate them

64
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,415
We will collect them
on New Year's Eve...

65
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,418
together with their statements

66
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
understand?

67
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,388
yes

68
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,426
who'll collect them?

69
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,393
me!

70
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,392
It was like this

71
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,398
Just like this

72
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,437
Then he junmped the wall and ran off!

73
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,440
so what was his name?

74
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442

00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,445
so what'd he look like?
Dunno

76
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,448
My eyes were closed

77
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
How about his clothes? was he tall?

78
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
with your eyes closed,
can u see me?

79
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
How many were there?

80
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
I didn't dare open my eyes

81
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,459
So what exactly did he say?

82
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461
He said he leave 'em here
till New Year's Eve

83
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
when he'd come for 'em

84
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,467
He sounded really fierce!

85
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,470
He called this "shadow under the lamplight"

86
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,473
I'll kill you,turtle_fucker!

87
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,476
You can take family bussiness later

88
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,480
Dasan's been with your son's widow
for some time

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,482
we have to talk

90
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,483
with these good-for-nothing!

91
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,484
go to bed

92
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486

93
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,487
Don't call me dad!

94
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,489
Shameless Slut

95
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,493
A father-in-law can't take this way

96
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
Go for me,then!

97
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496

00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,465
Get down

100
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,481
It's fortune ,not misfortune
when misfortune can't be avoided

101
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:42,522
Well, it is fortune or misfortune?
What should we do?

102
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,523
Take'em to the blockhouse

103
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,525
I'm in with their chief

104
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,526
What?

105
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
Hand 'em over

106
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,528
That's no good

107
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,531
What'll I say
when that guy comes back for 'em?

108
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,532
Tell him to see the Japs

109
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,534
What would he dare do?

110
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535

111
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,537
This guy tie up Japs in gunnysocks

112
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,539
What wouldn't he dare do?

113
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,541
Are you a collaborator?

114
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,473
Seem like it

115
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,674
I'll throttle on with each hand

116
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,044
and then we'll bury 'em!

117
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,553
That's it

118
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
Well just dig a hole!
I'll do that

119
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,558
You would,But the guy said

120
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,559
if anything happens to 'em

121
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,561
or if the Japs find out...

122
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,963
we'd be killed

123
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,796
killde?who'd be killed?

124
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,863
He said he'd kill
everyone in the willage!

125
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,473
nothing

126
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576

127
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,544

128
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,580
speak!

129
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
I thought we could run away

130
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
and leave the socks here

131
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,584
what could he do to us

132
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
sit down

133
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587

134
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
if we have to die anyway

135
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
what if we just kill you!

136
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,595

137
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,563

140
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,578
I'll throttle 'em

141
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,674
and bury 'em

142
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,745
Such work are not the work of idle men

143
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,631
Provoke neither those
who dwell in the hill

145
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,637

That's it.

239
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,028
I am as old as your grandfather

240
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,031
To me ,you're still kids

241

There is no escape

248
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,058
Better to die now.

249
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,064
These peasants won't allow it

250
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,068
It's the guys who captured us

251
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,072
who'll decide our fate.

252

A gunship is passing by!
You think they can hear you?

280
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,218
I try out the front
and they couldn't hear

281
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
How noisy is that?

282
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
How noise is that?

283
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,225
Shout your head off if you like

284
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,228
What are you thinking?

285
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
we'll try again next tiem.

286
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,233

Between the noise of the ship

287
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,237
and the band,they'll never hear us

288
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,239
All right，Enough talk，eat

289
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,242
Nothing beats a good meal

290
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,201
But we'd better change your bandage first

291
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
I'll change your bandage

292
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,251

It's for your own good,you idiot.

295
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,256
Dong,tell this woman...

296
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,260

But I'll touch her later.

297
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,219
More than once or twice，
And more than just touch!

298
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,275
Hanaya，she's helping you

299
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,277
Don't you have any conscience?

300
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,281
It's Chinese.
who've got no conscience.

301
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,283
First they shoot,
then they help

302
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,285
Mongrels can't even shoot straight!

303
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,288
If they shoot straight,
you'll be dead.

304
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,256
I'll kill me now

305
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,621
What the hell is going on?

306
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:49,308
You want to kill yourself?
Use a sharp stone,not wood.

307
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,310
Sister-in-law ignore him!

308
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,311
I'm not your sister-in-law.

309
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
Shut up

310
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,316
Thank you,brother.

311
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,317
Let me go!

312
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
We are all Chinese, after all

313
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
Why not shut up?

314
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,322
Hurry!

315
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
I was captured once before

316
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,324
Captain eight let me go

317
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
Don't give me that.

318
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
I've nothing to do with this

319
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,332
We'll be pals,you do me a favour

320
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
Of course.Name it

321
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,338
You two came as you had to
Go as you must

322
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,340
Don't make it trouble

323
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,343
Alright?I'm treat you well enough

324
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,345
Why are you so thoughtless?

325
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,220
He's coming to

326
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,290
I'll tell you one thing
If you keeep this up

327
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,654
I could get nasty!

328
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,675
It's me!Wake up.It's dawn

329
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,819
Was it cold last night?

330
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,486
It wasn't warm

331
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,989
What's happening in there?

332
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,125
Quiet so far

333
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,395
If they don't settle down,
they'll be the death of me.

334
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:18,996
Have a look

335
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:36,103
Brother，I am so hot，
Could you take this off me?

336
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,418
Better hotter than dead

337
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,419
Show some thanks,will you?

338
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,422
I damn pleased if someone fed me...

339
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,425

340
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,427
But why suffer like this,brother

341
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,430
I hear you coughing all night

342
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,432
You were freezing

343
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,435
Let's make this simple，Release us

344
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,437
I'm not putting your life in danger

345
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,440
So don't put mine in danger

346
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,441
Alright?If I let you go

347
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,807
I'm a dead man

348
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,446
Why aren't you eating?

349
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,408
Why isn't he eating? Move over

350
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,080
You．．．Light up.

351
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,316
People are iron,food is steel.

352
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,759
You can't eat
C'mon,have some

353
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,363
That's good

354
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,404
what is the hell?

355
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,475
Bastard!
Humiliationg an Imperial army soldier!

356
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,477
I'll kill you!Chinese pig

357
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,479
what he wants?

358
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,480
White flour

359
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,484
White flour?
Where am I gonna get That?

360
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,112
I wouldn't mind some myselft.

361
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,255
Just eat

362
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,017
那你看他不吃，饿死咋整?

363
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:59,389
He won't.Can't let him starve

364
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,504
I sent them to get flour

365
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,505
son of bitch!If I havenot eaten,
God danm you cann't eat.
Bastard!I'm not eating
and neither are you

366
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,507
They'll never find flour

367
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,472
They're scared we'll die.
They'll let us go

368
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,522
We'll be saved

369
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,523
Son of bitch.

370
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,525
What?Flour?

371
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,528
Do you thik That aunt Ba look like Flour

372
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,529
Eat me, why don't you?

373
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,531
Now that's silly.

374
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,535
Isn't it a capital crime
to hoord that stuff?

375
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,537
Trying to send me to the gallows?

376
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,540
Auntie This is a mater of decency

377
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,543
Decency?

378
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,549
You've a mistress in your bed
and Japs in your cellar

379
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,550
Son of a bitch!

380
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,552
You swearing at me?

381
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,553
NO,not you Er Bozi

382
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,554
I'm his mother

383
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,555
Curses at him travel straight to me

384
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,558
You don't understand

385
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,559
He swears at me, too

386
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,561
He hasn't kept his word.

387
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,564
He said he wouldn't tell you

388
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,567
If he lied to me,
He wouldn't be my son,

389
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,566
Whatever you say.

390
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,577
But I really need your help

391
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,581
Auntie.
You're fond of me,aren't you?

392
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,583
这两天我就为这俩人

393
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:29,588
I've done so much for these two men.
For the village

394
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,592
I've slept with my clothes on
I've spent night in the cellar

395
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,599
That's your fault.

396
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,600
I have no choice!

397
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,602
The Jap's threatening suicide!

398
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,606
He won't eat..
Unless his food's made of flour

399
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,097
Otherwise, he'll starve himself

400
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:55,310
It's mess
If you care about me...

401
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,620
You won't let me leave empty hand,
will you?

402
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,622
That's exactly how you'll leave today

403
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,625
A man going to starve

404
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,626
Let him starve

405
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,628
Japs are monsters anyway

406
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,629
That's no good.

407
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,631
If they starve,
our village is done for

408
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,635
I'd rather die than be a collaborator

409
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,638
What're you talking about?

410
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,641
This guy risks his neck to bring 'em

411
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,600
ask us to look after 'em
And we let'em starve?

412
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,650
What's a collaborator?
That's a collaborator

413
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,609
keep talking,there's no flour!

414
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:42,160
What's in here?

415
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,024
nothing

416
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,628
There's flour inside the chest
in the blue bag.

417
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,665
Who told you that?

418
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,667
who?The one who keep secrets.
He tells me stuff too.

419
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,673
That damn son of mine!

420
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,005
I don't care anyway,
There's none

421
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,642
Auntie，How's this?

422
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,682
I'll repay you double what I take

423
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,684
Triple it.There is none

424
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,685
Four times

425
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,687
Five times
and there's still none

426
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,688
How about six?

427
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,647
Seven and I'll give none!

428
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,696
All right. 8 then!

429
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,700
Dong teach me some chinese

430
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,659
what?

431
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,669
I want to swear at them.

432
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,718
To use the most terrible words.

433
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,720
Hummiate them

434
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,721
and they'll have to kill me.

435
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,722
Basterd!Teach me now.

436
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,690
Yes,sir

437
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,191
Cut it out
At a time like this,Thinking of that

438
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,274
You've heard them call us
brother and sister in law

439
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,470
Besides．．．when I saw Auntie,

440
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,612
I tell her all about us

441
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,372
What'd you sy?

442
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,283
I sadi... it is what it is

443
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,178
Have you no shame?

444
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,517
She said,no story,no flour

445
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,127
She wasn't nasty about it.

446
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,125
Things are what they are

447
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,264
Why not just admit it?

448
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:31,491
Don't push it，They're all ben too
Busy to think about us

449
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,773
After tonight,
when those two leave

450
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,504
How can I walk in the streets
with everyone talking behind my back?

451
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,144
What can I do?

452
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,744
If a big man like you doesn't know,

453
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,746
Why ask me?

454
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:49,373
Well．．．

455
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,919
I'll marry you

456
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,548
You have to anyway!

457
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,591
What're you saying?

458
00:29:59,591 --> 00:29:59,967
You have no choice

459
00:29:59,967 --> 00:29:59,967
Who's there?

460
00:29:59,967 --> 00:29:59,967
Me!

461
00:29:59,967 --> 00:29:59,967
It's him!

462
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,732
It's me!

463
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,734
Don't use that word!
It scares me!

464
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:18,777
I've got their statement

465
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:20,779
When the guy comes

466
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,782
Give him this,
I'm glad I didn't forget

467
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:25,951
Anyway, we've made it.

468
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:29,371
True!
Once they've left

469
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:33,750
we can celebrate New Year's...
all over again.

470
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,815
They're here，Dong

471
00:30:59,985 --> 00:30:59,985
The time's come

472
00:30:59,985 --> 00:30:59,985
I hear their footsteps.

473
00:30:59,985 --> 00:30:59,985
I can see them taking up their weapons.

474
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:14,791
I want to turn the curses
you've tought me

475
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:22,799
in to bullets to fire them!

476
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:33,810
I want to enrage them!

477
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,855
Dong, Goodbye forever!

478
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,861
Brother and sister-in-low,
happy new year!

479
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:46,865
You're my granddad, I'm your son.

480
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,867
Brother and sister-in-low,
happy new year!

481
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:52,830
You're my granddad, I'm your son.

482
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,876
The words are nice.
Why dose he sound so angry?

483
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,962
Japs sound the same,
whether they're happy and angry.

484
00:31:59,962 --> 00:31:59,962
Why d'ya think we call them devils?

485
00:31:59,962 --> 00:31:59,962
Brother and sister-in-low,
happy new year!

486
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:11,515
You're my granddad, I'm your son.

487
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,892
Enough,

488
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:17,896
I get the message.

489
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:20,899
But your generations are mixed up,
If i'm your granddad,

490
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,902
you're my grandson,
Not my son. See?

491
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,904
How come they're not angry?

492
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,907
Japanese are always cursing them.

493
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:29,908
They're used to it.

494
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,910
Brother and sister-on-law, happy...

495
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,911
Okay, okay. Shush.

496
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,913
Twice is enough.

497
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:38,917
We've made you dumplings.

498
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:39,918
Just what you asked for.

499
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:40,919
Did you teach him that?

500
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,923
Yes. It's the spring festival.

501
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:45,924
I tought him propitious phrases
to thank you both.

502
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,927
Nice of you.

503
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,930
Now, eatup. It's your last chance.

504
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:55,684
By tonight, you'll be on the road.

505
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,938
Let's bring over the table.

506
00:32:59,938 --> 00:32:59,980
Hold on. We'll set this up.

507
00:32:59,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Eat hearty.

508
00:32:59,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Hoarders!

509
00:32:59,980 --> 00:32:59,980
I'll kill you for sure.

510
00:32:59,980 --> 00:32:59,980
No chance of that.

511
00:32:59,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Why not?

512
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:12,910
"On the road" means "to die" in Chinese.

513
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,954
This is our last meal!!

514
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,956
We're goners!

515
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,959
Why don't the act
like they gonna kill us?

516
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,961
Even when a chinese kills someone,

517
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:26,924
his expression never changes.

518
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,970
How are they gonna kill us?

519
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,972
You afraid of dying?

520
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,976
I just feel stupid dying this way.

521
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:41,939
But I'm not afraid.
I won't beg for mercy.

522
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,987
Shall we do it?

523
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,532
Move aside.

524
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:56,995
Let'em finish their meal.

525
00:33:58,664 --> 00:33:59,998
Untie them.

526
00:33:59,998 --> 00:33:59,998
Please, one favour!

527
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:11,969
Send my parents a message for me,

528
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,179
in the northeast.

529
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,977
Of course.

530
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:20,978
Don't panic.

531
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:26,358
You'll be on the road soon.
And whatever happens, happens.

532
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,986
Enjoy your dumplings.

533
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,989
All right. I will!
And then, i'll go on the road.

534
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,994
I lived by my mouth,
Now i'll die for it.

535
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,997
If only I hadn't learned Japanese!

536
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,419
In my next life,
I'll come back a mute.

537
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:49,965
Eat up...

538
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:52,259
Or we'll be lat.
Tell him...

539
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,386
we've still got to trouble you
to get back into those sacks.

540
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:55,888
What?

541
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:59,975
They're putting us back
into those sacks

542
00:34:59,975 --> 00:34:59,975
What now?

543
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:10,652
The Japs are like this.
They cry, they sing.

544
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:23,207
before he goes,
we should give him a drink?

545
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,961
I want a drink!
He'd like a drink.

546
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,963
Just what we were thinking.

547
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,382
Let's get some wine from Old Man Qi.

548
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:50,817
San... think they'll give us a reward?

549
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:56,175
Go!

550
00:36:59,970 --> 00:36:59,970
It's time for lunch.

551
00:36:59,970 --> 00:36:59,970
I'm not going.

552
00:36:59,970 --> 00:36:59,970
Not going to the Base?

553
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:10,189
No. We're having Chinese chicken today.

554
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:11,190
You serious?

555
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,192
Know how to get a chicken
from a Chinese?

556
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:16,195
'Excuse me, can you give me a chicken? '

557
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:19,198
Idiot! You wouldn't get anything in that way!

558
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,200
Watch me.

559
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,162
Bastard! Hand over that chicken!

560
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,210
Bastard! Hand over that chicken!

561
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,211
You're pathetic. You'll get thrashed
Watch me.

562
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,213
You are going beat them.

563
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:37,216
Get it?

564
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:41,220
So they will scary you.

565
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,182
Bastard! Hand over that chicken!

566
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,228
What the hell?
Halt!

567
00:37:58,403 --> 00:37:59,363
Bastard!
You scared the shit out of me!

568
00:37:59,446 --> 00:37:59,988
What you do?

569
00:37:59,988 --> 00:37:59,988
I'm from the village!

570
00:37:59,988 --> 00:37:59,988
No leave village.
You go back.

571
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:22,261
Head down. Come here.
Here, have another.

572
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,262
Go back.
No go out, understand?

573
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:26,265
See?
That's how you deal with them.

574
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,266
Get it!

575
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,268
Halt!

576
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:31,270
Don't let it move!

577
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,312
You come back?

578
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,314
What's wrong?

579
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:18,317
What's all this?

580
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,319
Speak!

581
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:24,323
i must eat that chicken today!

582
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:28,285
Look, it's him!

583
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:31,330
You... dammit, what're you doing here?

584
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,292
I ordered you stay in the circle!

585
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:38,337
Bastard!

586
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,339
Please don't kill him.

587
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,341
Get out!

588
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,342
Japanese!

589
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:44,343
Japanese!

590
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:45,344
You must be dreaming.

591
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,346
Japanese!

592
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,348
No get out! Understand?

593
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:51,350
Yes!

594
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,351
Maruyama!

595
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:54,353
The chicken!

596
00:39:59,983 --> 00:39:59,983
Captain-san!
This what you're after?

597
00:39:59,983 --> 00:39:59,983
Bastard! Hand over the chicken!

598
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:11,370
Forget it, moron.

599
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:15,374
Captain-san?
Want me to kill it?

600
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,376
Now he's talking..

601
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:18,377
Let's sit over there.

602
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:19,378
No!

603
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:23,340
bastard! I heard!
Bakayaro! Fool!

604
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:27,386
It's ture.

605
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:30,389
Japanese speaking Japanese.

606
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:34,351
Soldiers of the imperial Army!

607
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,398
You stay here.
I'll get some kids to make noise.

608
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,400
Okay!

609
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,402
The Japs want more water.

610
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,403
It's ture!

611
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,404
There are Japanese up there!

612
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,406
Heaven's looking after us.

613
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,407
Becarful.

614
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,408
How'd they get here?

615
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,409
I ran into them.

616
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:54,371
Not you bring it here?
Captain-san.

617
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,875
Go fan the fire.

618
00:40:58,584 --> 00:40:59,960
Our chicken is nearly ready.

619
00:40:59,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I'm going to scream!

620
00:40:59,960 --> 00:40:59,960
They still won't hear you.

621
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:11,430
Hanaya.

622
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,432
I've got an idea!

623
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:16,435
Don't worry about us.
We've got our own luch.

624
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:18,437
We'll save you the bones.

625
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:22,441
It was bloody delicious.

626
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,443
Why did he hit you?

627
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,445
I said 'knock you block off'.

628
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:27,446
Can't you say the opposite?

629
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:28,447
Well... you try.

630
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:29,448
Not me.

631
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:30,449
I can only say bakayaro!
It's worse.

632
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:31,450
Say baka-NO-yaro!

633
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,451
Cut the crap.

634
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:34,453
I'll watch them.

635
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,997
I have a idea.

636
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:50,469
Please save us!

637
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:51,470
Please save us.

638
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,471
Please!

639
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:54,473
Attack!

640
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:58,477
Son of a bitch!

641
00:41:58,477 --> 00:41:59,478
Sense.
San, he's gone inside!

642
00:41:59,478 --> 00:41:59,978
Move! Move!

643
00:41:59,978 --> 00:41:59,978
What're you doing with that?

644
00:41:59,978 --> 00:41:59,978
Captain.

645
00:41:59,978 --> 00:41:59,978
It's for kill the donkey.

646
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:11,490
Donkey?
Eat donkey!

647
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:15,494
This maron is terrified
at the very sight of us.

648
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:19,858
They thinks us can eata donkey!
Idiot!

649
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,550
That pretty maid.

650
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,554
is a bird on high.

651
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,555
I am going to do my best.

652
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,523
Maruyamo!

653
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,559
Get your gun!

654
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,560
San!

655
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,561
What're you doing?

656
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,565
I'm getting you another chicken.

657
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,568
I see.

658
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,570
This gun...very good.

659
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,571
Save it...We eat next time.
Understand?

660
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,869
Understand.

661
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,577
We should be at our posts.

662
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,578
Right.
Playtime's over.

663
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,579
Two telephone lines to set up.

664
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,581
Why's he always waving
a knife around?

665
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,549
Get back!
No move!

666
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,553
You scared?

667
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,547
Course not.Not with you around.

668
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,653
Sensei...
Look at this!

669
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,568
What now?

670
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,604
That idiot is still inside the circle!

671
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,606
You're something else!
You're got these mongrels worked out.

672
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,574
I can teach you a few things.
I'm still learning.

673
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,618
You?Still learning?
You're never too old to learn.

674
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,620
Fucking cunts!

675
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,579
What're you doing?

676
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,628
Japanese soldiers!
They're coming!

677
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,629
Fuck you,Jap!Fuck!

678
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,588
Fucking cunts!

679
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,599
Move!
Turtle-fuckers!

680
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,650
What the fuck is this about?
So you pull this on me!

681
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,653
Trying to get me killed?

682
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,654
Get this straight.

683
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,656
You try and get me killed...

684
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,784
and I'll kill you first!

685
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:25,656
What's going on when you left the village?

686
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,664
I left the village.

687
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,666
Crossed the river.

688
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,668
Climbed the mountain.

689
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,670
Entered the town.
Went to ask fot Pockmarked Li.

690
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,672
Get the point!
This is the point.

691
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,673
You always leave the village,
cross the river...

692
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,675
If i didn't leave the village.
How could i cross the river?

693
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,634
Give me some water.
Go on!

694
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,684
Where was I?
Crossing the river...

695
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,687
Get the point.
You saw Pockmarked Li.

696
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,689
I didn't say that.
You did.

697
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,690
I said i saw Captain Five.

698
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,693
What did Captain Five say?

699
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,695
He said,
'Haven't i told you what i do?'

700
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,696
I said,'No,i've never met you before.'

701
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,698
Captain Five said,
'Are you from Xia-Village?'

702
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,700
'I'm from Rock-Armour Terrace.'
He said,'Rock-Armour Terrace?'

703
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,704
'We've never left anyone there.

704
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,706
Do what you have to.'

705
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,708
I said,'What's that?'

706
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,710
He said,'You've a blockhouse there?'

707
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,669
'What are you waiting for?
Do the deed.'

708
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:20,306
So this captain said'do the deed'.

709
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,710
Yeah.
He gestured like this.

710
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,046
'Do it!'

711
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,090
'Do it!'

712
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,455
Tell us again.
What was that gesture?

713
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:31,993
Was it like this?
Or that?

714
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,758
Like this.

715
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,866
So he meant kill 'em!

716
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,130
No.
What do you mean?

717
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,202
Like this...like this...

718
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,744
Of course he meant kill 'em.
Looks like it!

719
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,747
There's an old saying:
Better to obey than respects to pay.

720
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,748
Well...
better obey then.

721
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,752
Old Uncle,if he wanted us to kill 'em,
why didn't he say so?

722
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,754
Why say 'do the deed'?

723
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,713
Men in hidh postions
can't always sat what they mean.

724
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:05,025
It was so clear!First those guns
yelled out to the brass band.

725
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,163
Then,today,
they tagged the chicken.

726
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,789
What's next?
Better to obey orders.

727
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,537
Did he sat how to do it?

728
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,761
No

729
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,375
Or who should do it?

730
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,477
No.He doesn't know us.

731
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,782
How could he?

732
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,785
He knows you!

733
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,744
Be thought i was from Lower Village.
Never saw him before.

734
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,758
This is a hard one.
What's so hard?

735
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,847
Japs are all bastards.
More water!

736
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,850
I'll throttle 'em
Twist their necks and bury 'em!

737
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,809
Shut up!

738
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,860
Bury 'em?That's an idea.
So...

739
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,861
It's not that i'm afraid.
How can i put this?

740
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,864
It's not right.
Why not?

741
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,865
We were told to look after them.

742
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,868
We can't just decide to kill them.
It's not good.

743
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,827
Besides,that Captain Five
who Liu Wang found.

744
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,233
Didn't drop 'em on us.

745
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,109
His orders don't count.

746
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,042
What if Captain Four or Captain Seven
comes for 'em?What then?

747
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,480
So why don't you go your self?
Go find Captain Four or seven?

748
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,890
Don't be stupid.

749
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,891
Uncle.

750
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,894
Stop looking at me!
If I weren't such a wuss, I'd do it.

751
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,895
We've got to reason this out.

752
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,898
Why? My putty mouth came from my mom,
never true at all.

753
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,901
If I let go of my mouth,
everyone in the village would be dead.

754
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,903
Our village is that famous?

755
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,905
I've kept my mouth shut for over half a year.

756
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,907
I "sensei" this and that all day along to keep quiet

757
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,910
Thats my contribution

758
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,911
That's some hard work.

759
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,913
Hard Work?

760
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,914
'Sensei'You,collaborator!

761
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:37,915
You do it then!

762
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,917
Well...Liu Wang

763
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,919
What the heck are you looking at me for?

764
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,921
What should I be scared of? 
lets get this straight.

765
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,923
You know the saying
"Stick your neck out"?

766
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,925
Thats me!

767
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,927
I almost died at the entrance 
of village, today.

768
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,929
Why do I keep on saying, 
out of the village, over the river

769
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,931
Because it makes me sick

770
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,298
I even dream of leave out of the village,
cross the river, leave,cross,leave...

771
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,360
And you scold me for slurping?
Give me that

772
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,574
I'd choke them to death, 
one after one, and bury them.

773
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,676
Don't talk about it any more!

774
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,276
If you guys aint gona do it, then I will.

775
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,082
You wont do it, then leave to me.

776
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,516
We'll draw lots then
heaven will decide

777
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:20,323
Whoever catches this red bean do it.

778
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,891
Uncle

779
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,484
Two big guys... can't even handle it

780
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,526
then find one more.

781
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,289
Forget it, I've got both.

782
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,959
Give me some water.

783
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,270
Bro, give it.

784
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,978
here you are ,san

785
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,022
say something.

786
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,785
Whats there to say?

787
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,925
Leave them to me,I'll throrrle 'em

788
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,626
don't talk no more.

789
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:41,000
Give me a hand, help out.

790
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,603
Just digging, ain't it? 
fine I will do it.

791
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,503
You two dig, Da Sun do it!

792
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,643
lets just get it done, 
we will do it tonight.

793
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,175
OK?

794
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,513
agree

795
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,671
Bro, the hole is done, right here.

796
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,535
We'll wait at the bottom.

797
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,622
We fixed you some food,

798
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,352
to help you over the shock

799
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,931
Er Bozi's mum says

800
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,558
dont worry about repaying the flour

801
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,199
She said, dont mind it too much.

802
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,809
eat on, I should get going.

803
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,941
Go ahead.

804
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,408
Yu'er?

805
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,713
Don't touch me, You dare touching me!

806
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,888
For the sake of my unborn child.

807
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,959
Are you all right?

808
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,130
Don't touch me

809
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,432
Who?

810
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:02,562
ME!

811
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:05,074
Stop saying "ME, ME"

812
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,675
Here, eat.

813
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,245
Your Mom?

814
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,236
She ain't coming.

815
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:12,875
Not Coming?

816
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,413
NO?this is terrible!

817
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:33,826
Uncle san!

818
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,566
Screw You this dumb ass.

819
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,148
I didn't kill anybody.

820
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,364
Geez

821
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,161
Whats wrong with you?

822
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,732
Anybody saw?

823
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,129
Noone

824
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,264
Hurry and get the door shut.

825
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,658
Mom, I am back.

826
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:46,666

827
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,407
Only one lolly，whats wrong uncle san?

828
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,409

829
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,467
I am going to grandpa's

830
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,200
Go go go.

831
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:11,591
Yu'er, why not... just run away!

832
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,222
Bring little Thresher

833
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,133
and the old man, yuh?

834
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,442
Then, don't send meals tomorrow.

854
00:58:59,998 --> 00:58:59,998
Kill me, what are you waiting for?

855
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:11,510

856
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,512
Those guys are at Fenghuotai

857
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:13,512
Those guys are at Fenghuotai

858
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:15,514
Did you send the meals?

859
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:16,515

860
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:17,516
You listen?

Enough's been said!

862
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:19,518
Say What?

863
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:23,522
First they shout to the brass band

864
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:26,525
then they tag the chicken

865
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:29,528
Now they're using Little Thresher
three times unlucky!

866
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:33,532
If something happens, We'd lose out heads?

867
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:34,867
Of Course!

868
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:35,951
Get Up, let me ask you, 
that two idiots should be killed?

869
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:37,536
Should

00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:38,537
Should, then why didn't you

871
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:41,540
You didn't kill them，
then you are gona kill us?

872
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,541
Where are they from?

873
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,543
You know the guy with the gun?

874
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:46,545
What the heck are you saying?

875
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,547
I only say stuff I needed to say, 
I don't know those guys!

876
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:51,550
You don't know? Two big guys in the bags.

877
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,552
Need at least two guys to lift one bad.

878
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:54,553
We need four peeps.

879
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,555
Then we need at least 4 guys, 
may be even more.

880
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:57,556
Can't see anybody at all?

881
00:59:57,556 --> 00:59:58,557
What the heck are your eyes for!

882
00:59:58,557 --> 00:59:59,975
They are closed

883
00:59:59,975 --> 00:59:59,975
Really? You open the door?

884
00:59:59,975 --> 00:59:59,975
You did it with your eyes closed?

885
00:59:59,975 --> 00:59:59,975
No, i closed 'em after

886
00:59:59,975 --> 00:59:59,975
Yuh, You saw it.

887
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:12,571
No, I didn't see, 
it was dark, I couldn't see.

888
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:15,574
Stop saying shit! Half a year passed, 
You think we are idiots?

889
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:17,576
I have no goodie out of this.

890
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:18,577
No? I don't think so.

891
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:21,580
If Not why do You keep on helping them?

892
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,582
You said you'd pay me back eight-told

893
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:25,584
Where's that coming form?

894
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:26,585
Yes, we all see through that

895
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:27,586

896
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,588

897
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:30,589
All You want is the lives 
of our village people.

898
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:31,590
Whoever wants the lives 
of the village people,

899
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,592
I will be waiting for him

900
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:37,596
He wants my life? How dare he.

901
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:39,598
He only wants your life, eh?

902
01:00:39,598 --> 01:00:41,600
Stop arguing, will you?

903
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,602
Why can't I? What am I afraid of?

904
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:45,604
It's been 8 years 
since the Japs took over our village.

905
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:47,606
8 Years, man.

906
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,609
He dare touching me?

907
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:52,611
My behavior is right and proper

908
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:55,614
Wherever they should look up to me

909
01:00:55,614 --> 01:00:57,616
screw that, 
don't wana argue with him over this.

911
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:05,662
You practice first,

912
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,666
Japs in Great Wall.

913
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,668
Why hit the kids, Why Not Hit ME!

914
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,670
Don't Cry.

915
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,672
The Truth about this kid in me,

916
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,674

Force us to kill.

920
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,910
Once we kill, you don't 
give a rat's ass about us.

921
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,716
Freaking scared of Da Sun.

922
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:31,982
so,they'are still alive

923

You are afraid to kill people, so do we.

934
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,726

01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:04,823
You want to "borrow an assassin"

1003
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:10,087
Didn't old uncle five tell 
you about my marksmasnship?

1004
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:14,191
He said you can hot a fly at 100 paces

1005
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,962
Thats right but with a gun
A nin-chamber automatic

1006
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:20,168
The further the target 
the more accurate the shot

1007
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,610
Natuarelly

1008
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,976
There's a blockhouse at 
Rack-Armour Terrace,yeah?

1009
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,612
Yeah

1010
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,274
The village is as big

1011
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:30,987
as an ass-cheek

1012
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,989
How can you use a gun then?
This is a job for a sward

1013
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,991
But old uncle five is asking you

1014
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,993
You cant say no,can you?

1015
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,997
Can't do it

1016
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,999
Alright

1017
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,000
What are you doing?

1018
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,001
Going home

1019
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,730
you can go,
but you gotta leave the beans

1020
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,828
What?You wont help 
but want the beans?

1021
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,438
I cant help you out 
but you gotta leave them

1022
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,842
You want to kill a jap,
but dont want to anyone to know,right?

1023
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:00,782
right

1024
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:01,850
its a secret,right?

1025
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,020
yeah

1026
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,022
so,i'll keep your secret!

1027
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,252
it's like this，
If i dont take something

1028
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:11,053
How can you trust me to keep mum?

1029
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,163
I dont need your beans

1030
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,095
I just want you to feel okay about this

1031
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,563
I just want you to feel okay about this

1032
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,036
Silly man
You've simply came to wrong place

1033
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:25,975
I make tofu if you throw in sorghum,

1034
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,442
would that still be tofu?

1035
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,669
The more sorghum you put in, 
the less it will be like tofu

1036
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,748
in the future,remember:
if you want a swordsman

1037
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,053
dont goto the one with the gun

1038
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,055
do you get my logic?

1039
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,057
no

1040
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,058
no?

1041
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,061
Let me show you What i mean

1042
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,029
Attention!

1043
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:07,547
What we do?

1044
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,684
Take a detour

1045
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:14,090
halt!
what are we afraid of?

1046
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,049
running means we've sone wrong

1047
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,067
get down

1048
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,112
They have lost this bat

1049
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,114
When they see me,they bo and escape

1050
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,116
They're back!

1051
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,118
Sister Yayoi,look!

1052
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,120
They have been away for a long time

1053
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,122
At last they are back

1054
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,125
Yayoi,what's wrong?

1055
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,093
Matsuno?

1056
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,136
Idiots!Go back inside

1057
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:04,095
Whats all this fuss?shameless hussy

1058
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,066
Look at him

1059
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,908
You need wits and bravery!

1060
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,647
I've remarried. Silly man.

1061
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,081
Besides,I've got a Chinese heart, too!

1062
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,514
SO you do.

1063
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:26,453
Let's go.

1064
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,299
Brother-in-law.
Where are you taking me?

1065
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,891
-To the military police.

1066
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,170
-WHat?

1067
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,138
To the bath-house!

1068
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:48,548
-you know the empress Cixi?
-Yeah.

1069
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:53,183
-How about the Eight Ministers?
-Yeah...Uh,no.

1070
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:59,319
-Didn't think you would.
-Darlings of the court.

1071
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:04,421
All beheaded!
Know who wielded the sword?

1072
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,202
-Old man Liu!
-Really?
