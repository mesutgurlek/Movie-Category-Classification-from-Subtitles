1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,708
This way!

2
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:13,556
Get out!

3
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,409
Get your ass here!

4
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,699
Open the door!

5
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,018
You, get out!

6
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,821
What you doing?

7
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:29,667
Bring your ass here!

8
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,736
Where you going?

9
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:38,436
Hey you!

10
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:40,338
With the others!

11
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:45,302
Shut up!

12
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:46,500
Stupid!

13
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,915
Any government troops here?

14
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,108
You wanna argue?

15
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:51,986
You dead!

16
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:54,240
- You hiding troops!
- No, my son.

17
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:56,065
Where's the food?

18
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:57,695
You don't wanna talk?

19
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,107
We live here, my brother.

20
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:02,521
l'm not your brother!

21
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,244
You're just a stupid old man.

22
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:07,672
Give it up!

23
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,127
He's talking to you, man!

24
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:14,320
Take that TV!

25
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:15,734
The food!

26
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:22,426
We're fighting a war!
We're hungry.

27
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:25,825
You're a fighter!
You're a Dogo fighter!

28
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,770
You fucking Dogo man!

29
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:36,793
Stand up!

30
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,262
Women here!

31
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:42,349
Men there!

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,304
Move!

33
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:49,258
Find the money!

34
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,466
Take off your fucking shirt!

35
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,562
Check for weapons.

36
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,788
- Where are your guns?
- Got no weapons.

37
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:01,266
Take off your shirt!

38
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,862
Give me that ring.

39
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,031
Hands in the air!

40
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:07,272
Where you hiding your guns?

41
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,333
You don't have guns?

42
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,565
Old man, you think l'm stupid?

43
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:15,921
Where's the fucking money?

44
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,484
l got no money, brother.

45
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:18,919
- Fucking liar!
- No.

46
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,067
- Where's the money?
- Don't kill me!

47
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,918
Where you hide the fucking money
in this village?

48
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:26,654
Search them!

49
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:28,454
Are you a crybaby?

50
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:30,170
Are you a fucking crybaby?

51
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,556
Listen up, gentlemen, shut up!

52
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,166
Why all the fucking noise?
We need some money.

53
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:36,599
We need some money.

54
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,037
No money.

55
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:40,186
- Sure you got no money?
- We're suffering here.

56
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:43,347
- You have to pay for the war.
- We got no money.

57
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,675
You're a liar.

58
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,532
Where are the kids in the village?

59
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:49,566
- No kids here.
- You sure?

60
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,537
l'm telling you.

61
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:53,748
- And the government soldiers?
- None here.

62
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,447
Where are they?

63
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,001
They just pass through.

64
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:59,268
- You look like a soldier.
- l'm not a soldier.

65
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:00,010
You sure?

66
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,787
The house is empty.

67
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:10,984
Check under the beds!

68
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:14,590
Who's there?

69
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:21,968
Hey you!

70
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,100
- Get up!
- Please!

71
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,431
Move! Go!

72
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,778
- l hate crybabies.
- Don't kill me.

73
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,943
- Fucking crybaby!
- Don't kill me, my son.

74
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,606
Fucking pussy.

75
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:39,861
What the fuck you doing
with my wife's wedding dress?

76
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,315
That's my wedding dress!

77
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,167
- Fucking soldier!
- Who is he?

78
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:50,799
- My son.
- Your son?

79
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:52,772
You hiding him from us?

80
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,816
- He won't fight the war?
- He's not a fighter.

81
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:57,512
- He's an enemy!
- No, he's a student.

82
00:04:57,576 --> 00:04:58,909
A fucking fighter!

83
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:01,849
- So, no kids here?
- He's my son!

84
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:05,063
- He's an enemy!
- He can't go to war!

85
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,052
He's a fighter!
Shut up!

86
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:09,019
Get up!

87
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:12,761
Please! Leave him alone!

88
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,875
Show us what you can do.

89
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,581
Shouldn't have hid him.
We'll kill you.

90
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:18,529
Give him your rifle.

91
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:20,945
Don't kill me, please!
Leave him alone.

92
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:22,833
Please! Leave him alone!

93
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,939
Please, l beg you, please.

94
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:30,555
Please, he's my son!
He can't go to war.

95
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:33,821
Kill your father or you die!
We've all done it.

96
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:34,518
Kill him!

97
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:35,818
Or I kill you.

98
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:36,764
Please!

99
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:39,392
Kill him now!

100
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,840
No, he's a student.

101
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:42,931
Fucking enemy!

102
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:50,677
Kill him!

103
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,656
Let's go!

104
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:35,780
...facing the violent offensive
by rebel factions

105
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,800
who are now 1 2 miles from the city.

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,254
Government forces have deployed
and claim to control the situation.

107
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,406
ln a statement from the President,
he said, and I quote,

108
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,899
"l'm waiting for the imminent
intervention of UN forces."

109
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:04,626
Fofo!

110
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,449
Come on, let's go.

111
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,339
No men, no war!

112
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:31,894
- Death dealer!
- No die, no rest!

113
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,831
- You don't wanna die...
- Don't be born!

114
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:38,248
- l make a face!
- Stay away from me!

115
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:39,816
Cover your ass!

116
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:15,824
Gentlemen, our mission
is to capture the TV station.

117
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,204
Yes, sir!

118
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:20,377
Before we attack the TV station,

119
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,299
we make sure we're ready,

120
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,895
we get in the spirit, one by one.

121
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,814
- Mad Dog!
- Yes, sir, general.

122
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,593
This coke will jack you up.

123
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,226
War cry!

124
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,368
Who's there?

125
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,141
Who the fuck is there?

126
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,703
You're a fucking Dogo man.

127
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,588
You work for the Dogo president.

128
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:30,183
Where you going?

129
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:38,293
Open up!

130
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:43,696
Fucking stop!

131
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,107
Give me your bag.

132
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:48,150
No Good Advice, hold the bag.

133
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:52,574
- You know this woman here?
- No.

134
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:53,822
Please!

135
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,057
l've seen her somewhere before.

136
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,631
She's the one who gives the news.

137
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:00,484
She's the newswoman.

138
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:08,368
She talks about us, says we're rebels,
coming to kill the people.

139
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:11,872
- That's Tanya Toyo.
- l don't know that woman.

140
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,740
You sure you're Tanya Toyo?

141
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:18,643
You sure?

142
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,340
A fucking Dogo woman!

143
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,377
You see how fine she is?

144
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,607
You wanna escape from us?

145
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,791
My advice, kill the woman.

146
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,516
Please. Please.

147
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,456
What's that look mean?
Where's the government money?

148
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:09,272
l'll fuck you today.
You talk about us! l'll fuck you!

149
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,809
No Good Advice, hold my gun.

150
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:13,552
Spread your legs.

151
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:19,058
You make fun of us.

152
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,540
l beg you.

153
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:30,105
Spread your legs!

154
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:33,927
Look, she's acting like she's scared.

155
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:49,406
Chief, l wanna do her too.

156
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,229
Be honest when you talk about us.

157
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:01,036
No Good Advice, she's all yours.

158
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,323
Spread your legs!

159
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,072
l'm gonna fuck you!

160
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,215
The war has displaced people.

161
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,072
Most families have lost relatives
and loved ones.

162
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,165
I lost six family members:

163
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,990
my mother, my grandmother,
my father...

164
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,475
Suddenly, the rebels show up

165
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:38,431
and grab your people,
three or four family members,

166
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,351
and kill them in front of you.

167
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:45,145
You're forced to laugh.
The kids, they say, "Laugh."

168
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,449
And if you cry, you die.

169
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,682
When l sit and think,
I just don't know.

170
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:53,633
I got nobody around to advise me.

171
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,010
Nobody.

172
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:57,856
I didn't lay eyes on my mother.

173
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:01,666
I left for one week
and they killed all of them.

174
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:34,887
Who are you?

175
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:38,194
Death dealer.

176
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:40,768
- Password?
- No die, no rest.

177
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,494
l'm General Dirty Soldier!

178
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,047
l'm No Good Advice.

179
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:45,637
No men, no war!

180
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,124
- What the what!
- What the fuck!

181
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:49,063
- l make a face!
- Stay away from me!

182
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,231
Cover your ass!

183
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,514
The war cry!

184
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,566
Call me Mad Dog.

185
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:05,599
l'm No Good Advice!

186
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:09,502
We're fucking soldiers!
l'm Young Major.

187
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,751
We'll fuck up the dogs!

188
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,610
l'm Small Devil,
and l'll rip your heart out!

189
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:22,786
No need to be fucking around.

190
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,594
No need to be wasting time.

191
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,235
I wanna be a Ranger.

192
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:33,954
A Ranger was a motherfucker.

193
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:37,553
A Ranger was a brave soldier.

194
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,650
- Am I right or wrong?
- You right.

195
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:43,536
- Tell me if l'm wrong.
- You damn fucking right.

196
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,876
Mad Dog!

197
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:47,105
Yes, general.

198
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:49,390
Get your men prepared for tomorrow.

199
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:52,837
Everybody get ready,
pack the ammunition and everything.

200
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:56,154
We set fire to the city tomorrow.
You're the target commander.

201
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,517
l need the city asap.

202
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:58,872
- You got it?
- Yes, general.

203
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,732
Go and get prepared.

204
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:04,675
Gentlemen, we have again
done a great task for this country

205
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:06,618
by capturing the TV station

206
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:10,118
that the government used
for propaganda to the outside world.

207
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,390
Without the TV station,

208
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:14,668
there are no means to communicate
with the people.

209
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,159
ln a few days we'll be in the city.

210
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:20,179
Once there, we'll chase the Dogos out,

211
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:24,262
house by house, street by street,
until we get rid of them.

212
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,966
There's a bridge ahead.

213
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,894
When we get on the bridge,

214
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,231
we'll put fire to the city

215
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,258
and get the president out of power.

216
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,172
We need to liberate our people,
bring freedom to our people.

217
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,680
We have to make sure our resources
are used in the right way.

218
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:44,531
The Dogos have been oppressing
our people forever.

219
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,828
Be very wary of them.

220
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,147
Watch out for the luggage
on their heads.

221
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:52,591
They can hide weapons
in their mattresses.

222
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,660
l don't want you to die
on the mission.

223
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,945
The mission is crucial.

224
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,100
Your life is tied to the mission.

225
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:01,343
Be careful with your life!
Am l clear?

226
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,248
Yes, sir!

227
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:04,334
They can shoot you in the back.

228
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,165
l don't want you to lose your lives
on this mission.

229
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:09,591
- You get it?
- Yes, sir!

230
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,946
We're going to reach the city
and get the president out of power!

231
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:49,922
You, you know me?

232
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:54,392
l'm Johnny Mad Dog,
Small Boy Unit commander.

233
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:56,161
- Your name!
- Fatumata.

234
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:58,292
Fatumata, you Dogo girl.

235
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,057
But today you'll join my unit.

236
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:05,461
- What for?
- Shut up, No Good Advice.

237
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,676
But she's a Dogo.

238
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,177
The girl will help us
kill the fucking Dogo president.

239
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,542
We'll get peace in our country.

240
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,806
Freedom in our country,
you like it?

241
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,831
Follow me. Let's go.

242
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:26,032
- You ready to fight the war with me?
- Yes, sir!

243
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:39,113
- Death dealers, you listening?
- Yes, sir!

244
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:41,787
You are the death dealers, rebels.

245
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,506
We are now about to start our mission.

246
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,059
Gentlemen, l want you to be calm.

247
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,488
This war is our war.

248
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,600
Free your heart.
Fight the war as a soldier.

249
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,186
Relax your mind.

250
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:58,812
Open your heart to the revolution.

251
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,646
Fight, no retreat.
Don't think about home.

252
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,177
After the revolution
you'll get your benefits.

253
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:07,321
Money will be given
and you'll go see your parents.

254
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:10,940
We need to go
and capture the whole fucking city.

255
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:12,538
You need to go.

256
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,094
No retreat, no surrender...
No ma and pa...

257
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:19,364
Any soldier talking about ma and pa
will be executed.

258
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:24,430
Gentlemen, death dealer rebels,
be strong and vigilant.

259
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:33,271
Guys, you seen it for yourselves,
you're now bullet-proof!

260
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:37,732
Don't draw back from war,
if they fire at you, fire back.

261
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,988
- You don't wanna die...
- Don't be born!

262
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:17,956
- Mad Dog!
- Yes, general!

263
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,980
Your next mission is to move
to the embassy.

264
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:24,272
- Secure the area until l get there.
- Yes, sir, general!

265
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:26,220
- You don't wanna die...
- Don't be born!

266
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:30,856
Gentlemen, let's move.

267
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,256
Dad,

268
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:18,149
l'm scared.

269
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,199
- You, where you going!
- l beg you, chief.

270
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:50,670
Fucking ass!

271
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,222
Your rifle's mine!

272
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:33,768
Fofo.

273
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,150
Get up, we need to go, hurry up.

274
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,076
Your shoes, hurry up!

275
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,153
- Don't be foolish, they're near.
- Fofo, hurry up!

276
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:16,706
- Go with your sister.
- Go with us, dad, please.

277
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:19,094
l beg you, l'll take good care of you.

278
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,120
- Go with your sister.
- Bring the wheelbarrow!

279
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:26,178
- You can't forsake us like this.
- l'm not forsaking you. Now leave.

280
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:28,474
- Dad, please!
- Leave.

281
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,143
Leave!

282
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,598
Dad, open this door.

283
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:37,727
Dad, we can't leave like this.

284
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:42,687
You have to come with us.
Please, l beg you.

285
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:45,563
Open this door!

286
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:47,651
Dad!

287
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,019
Look at that pig!

288
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,607
Hey you, fucking stop!

289
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,729
You, I said fucking stop!
Where you going?

290
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,538
Where you taking that pig?

291
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:11,294
l'm carrying the pig across.

292
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,889
- What?
- The bridge.

293
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:15,278
- Who gave it to you?
- An old man.

294
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,640
- An old man?
- Yes.

295
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:18,248
You... The pig!

296
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,799
We're a troop of fighters.

297
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:22,867
You're just a looter!

298
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:26,141
- lt's my pig!
- l beg you.

299
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:28,063
- What?
- l beg you.

300
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,938
You beg me?
Put the fucking pig down!

301
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,063
Quick!

302
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:37,140
lt's my pig, stupid old looter!

303
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:38,513
Sit down.

304
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:41,270
You liar. You fucking looter.

305
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,720
You stole the pig and say
somebody gave it to you!

306
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,866
Take off your fucking coat!

307
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:49,397
You're a fucking looter!

308
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:51,089
l said, take it off!

309
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:56,517
The pig's for me.

310
00:29:56,585 --> 00:30:00,084
Got tell the owner
that No Good Advice took it.

311
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,183
You hear?

312
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:05,042
Look me in the face
when l talk to you!

313
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,637
Get the fuck up and go!

314
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,012
Yes, general Never Die?

315
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:11,720
Where are you?
What is your position?

316
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,072
We control the whole area.

317
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,675
Go!

318
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,698
My men are on patrol.

319
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:19,270
The streets are empty,
there's nobody on the streets.

320
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:22,716
You got no self respect, old man!

321
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:25,231
Everybody's waiting for you! Hurry!

322
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:28,293
Chicken Hair!
Come here! Report!

323
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:32,294
We're gonna carry the old man's pig
to the truck.

324
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,004
Put it on my neck.

325
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:43,175
Go, take the coat.

326
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,661
- C.Y.A!
- Cover your ass!

327
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:58,210
- You all know what?
- No.

328
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,466
At any moment,

329
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:03,076
if l see a looter around here,
l'll damage his life!

330
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:06,013
l don't wanna see no looter here.

331
00:31:06,056 --> 00:31:08,805
- You hear?
- Yes, sir!

332
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,869
Deploy.
All men deploy!

333
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:04,823
l found a weapon.

334
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,471
- Where?
- Over there.

335
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,927
20 shots in the magazine.

336
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,918
- What weapon is it?
- An Uzi.

337
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,384
- Chinese?
- No, lsraeli.

338
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:17,283
Chuck Norris used it
in Delta Force.

339
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:18,912
So be careful!

340
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:22,258
The lsraelis or Chuck Norris
might be around.

341
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:24,306
- Butterfly.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:25,616
Try this arm.

343
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:30,233
Be careful with it.

344
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:39,853
Try it! Don't be scared. Try it!

345
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,768
- On the ground!
- Sit the fuck down!

346
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,430
Look at the chief!

347
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:05,845
The password?

348
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:07,297
Face the chief!

349
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,529
You don't wanna talk?

350
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:10,059
What's the password?

351
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:13,694
- What's in your bucket?
- Fruit... Bananas.

352
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:17,813
Oh, your bananas are orange?
You think l'm stupid?

353
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:20,300
Fucking liar!
You're a Dogo man.

354
00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:22,775
Dirty ass!
l'll kill you today!

355
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:24,629
You a government trooper?

356
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:27,584
Take his clothes off
and tie him up.

357
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,818
- Your ma's name?
- Ataouza.

358
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:31,756
- Your pa's name?
- Abriye.

359
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,832
Look at the mark on this man.

360
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:35,624
He looks like a government fighter.

361
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,247
He's a government troop man.

362
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:40,405
Today is his last day.

363
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,306
Show me your finger.

364
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,270
That man's a fucking fighter!

365
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,403
He's denying it!

366
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,685
- Who fired at my pickup?
- Not me.

367
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,885
Tell me the truth. Was it you?

368
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,122
l didn't fire.

369
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:55,404
Why did you have the Uzi then?

370
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,044
- l didn't.
- So why you hiding?

371
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:58,993
My oranges.

372
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,994
You were hiding for your oranges?

373
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,499
My ma sent me to look for food.

374
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,948
Tell the truth!

375
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:15,160
You lie and I'll kill you.

376
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,699
Who fired at my pickup?

377
00:34:20,078 --> 00:34:21,244
Look at me!

378
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:23,397
Why you fight for the government?

379
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:24,809
You'll die poor.

380
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:28,120
Chief, l seen that man before.

381
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:30,471
He's a fucking government troop man.

382
00:34:30,596 --> 00:34:32,511
He was on reconnaissance.

383
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:37,010
When we catch these spies
they pretend to cry,

384
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,703
but they are not crying,
they can hit us in the back.

385
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:40,964
He's an enemy.

386
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:43,856
You'll die today, my boy.

387
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:47,185
- l'm not a fighter, I go to school.
- What school?

388
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,765
- What school?
- Methodist.

389
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:51,417
- Your teacher?
- Teacher Perry.

390
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:52,180
Stink mouth!

391
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:55,356
You fucking Dogo man!

392
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:57,679
Fucking Dogo man!

393
00:34:57,794 --> 00:34:59,543
You Dogo fuck!

394
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,775
Everybody on board!

395
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,458
Johnny!

396
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:52,872
Johnny Mad Dog!

397
00:36:52,982 --> 00:36:55,106
No Good Advice is waiting for you.

398
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,215
We're waiting for you!

399
00:36:58,423 --> 00:36:59,255
What you doing?

400
00:37:18,498 --> 00:37:20,872
Fofo, I'm going to hide you in here.

401
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:26,751
Don't come out,
l'll be back soon with dad.

402
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:29,498
Sit.

403
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:33,520
- Government troops!
- Pussies!

404
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:35,702
All men on board!

405
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:57,179
Dad!

406
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:39,538
Fofo!

407
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,069
Where are you?

408
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,982
- Where we going?
- Shut your fucking mouth!

409
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,922
We'll kill the motherfuckers!

410
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:39,588
Where are the soldiers?

411
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:40,597
l don't know.

412
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:49,013
Enemy!

413
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:54,268
Move! Enemy around!

414
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:55,448
Move off the road!

415
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:02,753
Move off the road, enemy around!

416
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:06,490
Move off the road!

417
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:08,350
Move!

418
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,309
Motherfucker! Move! Move!

419
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,268
Shit, let's carry the man.

420
00:40:44,157 --> 00:40:45,990
Chicken Hair,

421
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:47,566
watch out, bro.

422
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:50,059
lt's dangerous here.

423
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,474
l saw some smoke up there.

424
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:56,513
Fast! Let's get him out of here.

425
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:58,969
Sniper in the building!

426
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:14,677
Reinforcements 1 ,2,3!

427
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:56,023
All clear, all clear!

428
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:26,661
It is my will that when I die

429
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:31,247
Don't bury me, don't bury me

430
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:35,805
You cut my dick in alcohol

431
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:40,128
And call my wife and give it to her

432
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,775
And when she cry, let her cry

433
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,416
When she roll let her rock

434
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,479
And what the fuck she thinks she is

435
00:43:54,337 --> 00:43:58,045
She fucking around with my GI dick

436
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:02,396
Another man will counsel her

437
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:07,125
Another man will comfort her

438
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:11,690
Take my rifle and my bonnet

439
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:15,865
Call my son and give it to him

440
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:20,607
Let him defend or let him fight

441
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:25,157
For his country, for his people

442
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:27,234
It is my will...

443
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:43,139
- Death dealer!
- No die, no rest.

444
00:44:43,374 --> 00:44:45,414
Gentlemen, keep moving.

445
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:47,309
Shut the fuck up!

446
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:54,082
- Fuck you rebels!
- They all deserve death.

447
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:26,917
Stand back!

448
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:30,010
Move!

449
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:33,123
- Back off!
- Fucking move away from the gate!

450
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,828
lt's an emergency hospital.

451
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:37,924
We have to protect the hospital.

452
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:41,167
Move from the gate before I kill you!

453
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:44,909
Our general wants us to find
the government troops!

454
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:47,831
No arms allowed inside!
No one can enter armed.

455
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,861
- l can't leave my weapon.
- You have to.

456
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:53,292
My weapon is my mother
and my father!

457
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,858
No arm is allowed in here!

458
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,117
Nobody's stopping you from entering.

459
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,656
No arms allowed, it's a hospital.

460
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:02,925
Who are you to give me orders?
We'll enter today.

461
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:04,208
Any troops inside?

462
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,068
No, we only have civilians.

463
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,494
They're the only ones who count.
We're the ones fighting the war!

464
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:13,680
You're just standing around!

465
00:47:13,758 --> 00:47:15,174
You speak English?

466
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,279
We have a wounded soldier,
so we wanna go inside!

467
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:21,174
You wanna lose your lives?

468
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:23,944
You know that the president
is already dead.

469
00:47:24,037 --> 00:47:26,411
We control the city now.

470
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:28,684
We want to go inside and check.

471
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:31,178
We're freedom fighters!

472
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:33,398
Take our wounded and we'll go.

473
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,975
Who are you to stop us?

474
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:39,203
- We brought peace to our country.
- We want inside.

475
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:41,360
- We want in!
- Open the gate!

476
00:47:41,436 --> 00:47:44,476
We'll kill you all
if you touch that gate.

477
00:47:44,516 --> 00:47:46,515
We'll kill you one by one!

478
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:51,199
- Back off.
- Call a medic!

479
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:56,418
Officer!

480
00:47:58,634 --> 00:47:59,508
Get the medics.

481
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:03,549
We got a wounded soldier.
You got wounded soldiers here?

482
00:48:03,554 --> 00:48:06,845
lf anything happens to him,
we'll kill you all!

483
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:11,032
- Retreat.
- He better not die.

484
00:48:11,113 --> 00:48:13,571
We're setting up a post right there.

485
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:15,716
lf he dies, we'll kill you all.

486
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,416
Fucking UN soldiers, you'll die
before you leave our country.

487
00:48:19,432 --> 00:48:21,389
You're hiding government troops.

488
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:24,300
lf anything happens to him,

489
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:26,182
all of you all will die.

490
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:29,770
lt's our country,
defy us and you'll die!

491
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,989
lf we find government troops here,

492
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:33,735
you're all gonna die!

493
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,074
Retreat!

494
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:36,398
Dirty ass!

495
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:11,416
- ls he your father?
- Yes.

496
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:14,589
- What happened to him?
- He was hit by a bullet.

497
00:49:14,947 --> 00:49:16,446
- A bullet?
- Yes.

498
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:19,294
- How long you been here?
- Not too long.

499
00:49:20,105 --> 00:49:22,313
- He'll be okay, all right?
- All right.

500
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:24,551
- Take good care of him.
- Okay.

501
00:49:29,584 --> 00:49:30,667
Dad,

502
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:32,265
don't worry.

503
00:49:33,783 --> 00:49:35,532
Everything will be okay.

504
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:46,634
What we gonna do
with the UN soldiers?

505
00:49:46,704 --> 00:49:49,036
They got a lot of Dogos inside.

506
00:49:50,503 --> 00:49:52,919
We're not afraid of the Dogo people.

507
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:54,981
We are brave soldiers.

508
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:57,296
You afraid of the UN soldiers?

509
00:49:57,383 --> 00:49:59,132
Shut your fucking mouth.

510
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:01,882
l decided to make
a tactical retreat.

511
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:03,441
So what do we do now?

512
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,499
We wait for the general's call.

513
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,484
We're all hungry now,
No Good Advice.

514
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:11,478
Let's kill the fucking pig.

515
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,369
l'm not ready to kill my pig.

516
00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:14,998
- Kill the pig.
- No!

517
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,599
- We're hungry, kill the pig.
- l'm not ready.

518
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:23,263
- Don't talk to me like that.
- l'm not ready.

519
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:26,878
You think it's a human being?
lt's better than us?

520
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,356
Everybody's hungry.

521
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:30,447
- We'll kill it now.
- No.

522
00:50:30,577 --> 00:50:32,701
- We'll kill the pig.
- l said no.

523
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:36,307
You stole the pig from an old man!
Put it down.

524
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:40,152
- Put it down!
- No, l won't!

525
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,612
- Put it down.
- No, l won't!

526
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:45,444
You won't put it down?

527
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:48,419
- You wanna die?
- For why?

528
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:50,579
- Put it down!
- That's an order!

529
00:50:51,537 --> 00:50:55,703
You think the pig's yours?
l'll kill it and see what you do.

530
00:50:56,015 --> 00:50:58,264
There's plenty of food around here.

531
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:01,124
We don't have a good knife
to kill the pig.

532
00:51:01,175 --> 00:51:03,132
- Where you see food?
- Everywhere.

533
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:05,830
You want your life
or the pig's life?

534
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:09,353
- You wanna die?
- All too, l want it!

535
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:11,955
- The pig's used to me.
- We'll kill the pig!

536
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:14,325
Don't kill the pig!

537
00:51:14,414 --> 00:51:16,704
- We're hungry.
- Don't kill the pig!

538
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,480
There's food all around.

539
00:51:18,574 --> 00:51:21,406
Don't argue.
l'm gonna kill the pig.

540
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:24,370
- You can't do that.
- You'll see.

541
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:27,599
- l'll kill the fucking pig today!
- No!

542
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:29,151
You won't kill it!

543
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:33,162
- Young Major!
- Yes, sir.

544
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:36,700
Nasty!
Go clean the pig.

545
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:39,112
Eat the fucking pig.

546
00:51:39,253 --> 00:51:41,418
Clean it and eat it.

547
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:43,433
Everybody's hungry.

548
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:48,036
Last time, when it wasn't your pig,
you were the first one to say,

549
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:49,884
"Let's eat the pig."

550
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:53,407
Now, when it's your pig,
you keep it for you.

551
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,283
We were on mission
when you took it.

552
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,399
Move on, let's go!

553
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,467
Let's go! You're not going?

554
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:05,233
Stay but we'll eat the pig,
that's the fucking truth.

555
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,416
Stupid man.

556
00:52:07,288 --> 00:52:10,370
You act like the pig was yours.

557
00:52:18,848 --> 00:52:20,472
Hello, Never Die.

558
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:24,237
Johnny talking, do you hear me?

559
00:52:25,286 --> 00:52:26,785
Where are you?

560
00:52:26,887 --> 00:52:30,219
At the hospital.
The UN is giving us a hard time.

561
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,662
We're busy at the Palace.

562
00:52:31,766 --> 00:52:34,098
l need reinforcement and ammo.

563
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:37,542
Hold your position.
Let no one in, no one out.

564
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:39,773
No food or medication.

565
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:43,595
We got it! Victory is ours!
We're on the move!

566
00:52:43,604 --> 00:52:45,395
So we win the war?

567
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:47,827
Hello, Never Die...

568
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:32,057
What's your name?

569
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,616
l forgot your name.

570
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:43,603
But l'll call you Lovelita.

571
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:47,623
l heard it in a song.

572
00:55:49,065 --> 00:55:50,439
You like it?

573
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:54,404
You gotta hold that name.

574
00:55:55,505 --> 00:55:57,546
lt will be fine for you.

575
00:56:00,265 --> 00:56:02,348
You hold a gun before?

576
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:07,140
Try to fire this one.

577
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,115
Fire it.

578
00:56:16,063 --> 00:56:17,728
Fire it. Try it.

579
00:56:21,143 --> 00:56:24,142
You know how to fire a gun now,
Lovelita.

580
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:27,498
Do you know what's on my neck?

581
00:56:28,902 --> 00:56:30,901
This is my protection.

582
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,304
The bullets fly past me.

583
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:37,018
They can't touch me.

584
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,409
lt makes me invisible.

585
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,194
You see what's on my back here?

586
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,294
Bullets can't touch me there.

587
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,211
That's why l'm still alive.

588
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,339
My general, Never Die...

589
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:53,551
He has some protection.
lf you fire at him,

590
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:56,093
the bullets turn into water.

591
00:56:56,381 --> 00:57:00,338
lf l make it to colonel,
he'll give me one.

592
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,841
How long you been fighting
the war?

593
00:57:08,018 --> 00:57:10,517
l was very small, very small.

594
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:14,757
l started fighting when l was ten.

595
00:57:15,697 --> 00:57:17,196
l started fighting then.

596
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:19,459
What was your name before?

597
00:57:22,058 --> 00:57:23,932
l don't know my name.

598
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,649
Where you coming from?

599
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:30,526
Where is your family?

600
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:32,931
l ain't got no family.

601
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:41,342
Pussycat!

602
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:44,203
Give your fucking wedding dress
to the girl.

603
01:00:52,075 --> 01:00:53,241
Hey you!

604
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:54,549
Help me!

605
01:00:54,676 --> 01:00:58,300
My dad's legs are cut off,
l want to put him in your cart.

606
01:00:58,714 --> 01:01:00,880
Somebody stole my wheelbarrow.

607
01:01:03,113 --> 01:01:04,654
How much do you have?

608
01:01:06,234 --> 01:01:07,400
Five dollars.

609
01:01:07,554 --> 01:01:09,345
That's not enough.

610
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:10,850
- Ten.
- Ten?

611
01:01:10,994 --> 01:01:12,743
l can't risk my life for ten.

612
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:15,247
- Twenty dollars.
- That's all l have.

613
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:16,851
l can't help you.

614
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:19,768
People are shooting, they're coming.

615
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:20,499
l'm going.

616
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,058
Hey you, come!

617
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:17,239
Hey you!

618
01:02:21,508 --> 01:02:23,507
Get up!

619
01:02:23,985 --> 01:02:26,901
You hear me?
l said, "Get up."

620
01:02:30,384 --> 01:02:32,508
What kind of old man is this?

621
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:38,830
Put your fucking book down!

622
01:02:39,504 --> 01:02:41,086
l said, "Put it down!"

623
01:02:41,704 --> 01:02:43,286
You won't put it down?

624
01:02:45,903 --> 01:02:48,860
What a stupid old man,
doesn't want to get up!

625
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:28,537
- Give me the baby!
- Please!

626
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:31,304
Give it to me!

627
01:03:31,418 --> 01:03:33,584
You don't want to give it to me?

628
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,226
Give it to me!

629
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:37,695
- Give it to me!
- Please!

630
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:41,006
You wanna die?

631
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:43,850
Nasty!

632
01:03:43,979 --> 01:03:45,894
Nasty! We got our man.

633
01:03:45,978 --> 01:03:49,977
She's an enemy.
Fucking Dogo woman.

634
01:03:49,977 --> 01:03:51,892
l'm gonna eat her baby.

635
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:53,560
Deploy!

636
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,370
Everything all right?

637
01:04:18,656 --> 01:04:19,488
Dad!

638
01:04:19,617 --> 01:04:23,824
Stop your bicycle!

639
01:04:51,851 --> 01:04:53,850
Our Lord and our God,

640
01:04:55,732 --> 01:04:59,397
Daddy and l thank You
for sparing my life

641
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:00,990
to see this day.

642
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:07,081
Lord, as my father
is dead and gone...

643
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:12,341
lf it is Your will, Lord,

644
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,915
let Your will be done.

645
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:20,582
May his soul rest

646
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:24,335
in perfect peace

647
01:05:25,928 --> 01:05:29,594
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

648
01:05:30,006 --> 01:05:30,963
Amen.

649
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:36,886
Five score years ago,

650
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:43,373
a great American in whose
symbolic shadow we stand today,

651
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:48,088
signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

652
01:05:49,685 --> 01:05:52,142
This momentous decree came

653
01:05:53,685 --> 01:05:58,517
as a great beacon light of hope
to millions of Negro slaves

654
01:05:59,364 --> 01:06:04,447
who had been seared in the flames
of withering injustice.

655
01:06:05,123 --> 01:06:07,747
It came as a joyous daybreak

656
01:06:08,643 --> 01:06:12,892
to end the long night
of their captivity.

657
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:15,833
But one hundred years later,

658
01:06:16,162 --> 01:06:20,495
the Negro still is not free.

659
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,547
The life of the Negro
is still sadly crippled

660
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:28,228
by the manacles of segregation

661
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:32,159
and the chains of discrimination.

662
01:06:32,442 --> 01:06:34,441
One hundred years later,

663
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,478
the Negro lives
on a lonely island of poverty

664
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:43,346
in the midst of a vast ocean
of material prosperity.

665
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,486
One hundred years later,

666
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:47,678
the Negro is still languished

667
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:50,677
in the corners
of American society...

668
01:06:50,718 --> 01:06:52,342
Who's on the radio?

669
01:06:52,437 --> 01:06:55,269
...and finds himself in exile
in his own land.

670
01:06:55,318 --> 01:06:56,817
He's the president.

671
01:06:58,718 --> 01:07:01,633
Now, we need our own money.

672
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,858
We need our fucking money.
So what do you say about it?

673
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:51,957
There's no fucking shit!
No more money.

674
01:07:55,913 --> 01:07:58,412
Butterfly! Check behind the house.

675
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:02,051
You think l'm stupid?
You think l'm joking?

676
01:08:02,072 --> 01:08:05,529
The old American car outside,
you took the batteries?

677
01:08:05,551 --> 01:08:09,633
Take everything. The tires
and the batteries are buried outside.

678
01:08:09,749 --> 01:08:13,039
Take the keys,
take what you want and leave.

679
01:08:13,231 --> 01:08:17,230
Put it all down!
All the US dollars and all!

680
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:20,061
With all their fancy diamonds,
they're mocking us.

681
01:08:20,108 --> 01:08:21,941
- No Good Advice.
- Yes, sir.

682
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,238
l'll take this one for Lovelita.

683
01:08:24,348 --> 01:08:26,180
- lt's fine?
- Yeah.

684
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:28,223
lt's good.

685
01:08:29,308 --> 01:08:33,182
Old woman, you and your husband
are educated, let me tell you.

686
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:36,147
l want you to answer one question.

687
01:08:36,869 --> 01:08:38,159
The two of you all.

688
01:08:40,228 --> 01:08:42,810
What's the area of a triangle?

689
01:08:45,346 --> 01:08:46,928
You can't talk?

690
01:08:48,106 --> 01:08:50,772
You'll lose everything
in the house here.

691
01:08:50,945 --> 01:08:52,069
All!

692
01:08:52,866 --> 01:08:55,199
And losers will die.

693
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,740
l'll give you one more chance.

694
01:09:00,185 --> 01:09:01,893
Only one more.

695
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:06,456
How much is ten to the third power?

696
01:09:06,866 --> 01:09:09,406
Ten to the third power is one thousand.

697
01:09:09,705 --> 01:09:12,121
To the sixth power is one million.

698
01:09:12,304 --> 01:09:15,012
As for the surface of a triangle,

699
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:18,980
it is equal to the base multiplied
by the height and divided by two.

700
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:22,601
Now, please,
just leave us alone.

701
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:24,288
We've given you everything.

702
01:09:24,383 --> 01:09:25,882
What? What do you have?

703
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:28,722
With all your gold and diamonds!

704
01:09:28,783 --> 01:09:29,782
What's your job?

705
01:09:29,903 --> 01:09:31,360
You better shut up!

706
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:34,003
- l'm a high-school teacher.
- High-school teacher?

707
01:09:34,063 --> 01:09:36,145
You fucking Dogo woman.

708
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,756
You think you smarter than me?

709
01:09:39,862 --> 01:09:44,236
l was in the second grade,
but I took third-grade lessons.

710
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,815
With all the books you know,
your country is finished.

711
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:50,723
My wife isn't Dogo,
she's from your tribe.

712
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,856
- Don't hurt her.
- Prove it!

713
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:54,565
l'm the one who's Dogo.

714
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:57,478
You speak my dialect?

715
01:09:57,579 --> 01:10:00,745
l only speak English,
l wasn't born here.

716
01:10:00,778 --> 01:10:02,902
My father was an ambassador.

717
01:10:02,978 --> 01:10:04,602
Ambassador?

718
01:10:05,419 --> 01:10:07,251
So you understand our dialect?

719
01:10:07,459 --> 01:10:08,541
Of course.

720
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,659
Prove it!

721
01:10:09,818 --> 01:10:11,400
l give you two minutes.

722
01:10:11,818 --> 01:10:13,692
- Kill them!
- Let's split!

723
01:10:13,778 --> 01:10:16,027
They're boring,
there's nothing to loot.

724
01:10:16,099 --> 01:10:18,139
Let's go loot other houses!

725
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:20,802
Time is up.

726
01:10:21,058 --> 01:10:22,391
Time finished.

727
01:10:23,698 --> 01:10:27,614
Too bad you were born abroad.
Next time you be born here!

728
01:10:27,616 --> 01:10:30,323
l don't give a damn,
l love my husband.

729
01:10:30,377 --> 01:10:32,042
So you insult my general?

730
01:10:32,935 --> 01:10:35,184
Watch it or l'll blow your head off!

731
01:10:35,256 --> 01:10:37,713
You can kill me,
but don't touch my wife.

732
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:38,608
Shut up!

733
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,767
- Stand up!
- That's an order!

734
01:10:43,735 --> 01:10:46,318
You supported the stupid president!

735
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,916
Collaborators!

736
01:10:49,655 --> 01:10:50,654
Hey old man!

737
01:10:50,775 --> 01:10:53,107
- Get undressed!
- Make it fast!

738
01:10:53,174 --> 01:10:55,756
- Dogos are traitors!
- Fast!

739
01:10:55,814 --> 01:10:59,063
You'll fuck your wife,
right now, in the living room!

740
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:01,508
- Take off your fucking clothes!
- Do it!

741
01:11:01,575 --> 01:11:02,615
Trousers off!

742
01:11:02,973 --> 01:11:04,222
Put them down.

743
01:11:05,213 --> 01:11:07,754
Now fuck for me now!
Quick! Quick!

744
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:10,927
Start fucking!

745
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:12,306
Look at his big dick!

746
01:11:12,412 --> 01:11:14,161
You wanna die, old man?

747
01:11:15,891 --> 01:11:16,557
Fuck her!

748
01:11:16,692 --> 01:11:18,899
You take all our money
and kill our people!

749
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,154
- Fucking whore!
- What happen to you, Lovelita?

750
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,490
- He's my man!
- Who the fuck are you?

751
01:13:41,557 --> 01:13:44,306
l enjoy myself.
Fucking Dogo!

752
01:13:45,076 --> 01:13:47,533
- Move!
- Put the arm down.

753
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,013
- Move!
- Put it down.

754
01:13:49,116 --> 01:13:50,532
Who you think l am?

755
01:13:50,997 --> 01:13:52,829
You do whatever you want with me?

756
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:53,916
Let's go, Johnny!

757
01:13:54,036 --> 01:13:55,285
l'm gonna kill you.

758
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,979
Who the fuck is she?

759
01:14:10,394 --> 01:14:11,935
Take the weapon.

760
01:16:51,338 --> 01:16:53,753
- Good morning, general.
- Where are your men?

761
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:55,832
l don't know, general.

762
01:16:55,937 --> 01:16:57,811
Don't call me general.

763
01:16:58,778 --> 01:17:00,777
l'm in the regular army.

764
01:17:00,857 --> 01:17:02,856
l'm proud to be a corporal

765
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,698
and also the president's bodyguard.

766
01:17:06,336 --> 01:17:08,460
No men, no war!

767
01:17:12,696 --> 01:17:15,070
So no more war, what we do now?

768
01:17:15,136 --> 01:17:18,719
Why ask me that?
Soon, you'll turn in your weapon.

769
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:21,346
We don't want boys with arms.

770
01:17:21,415 --> 01:17:23,122
Find something else to do!

771
01:17:27,733 --> 01:17:30,191
- General, our money?
- There's no money.

772
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:32,545
You fought the war
and looted a lot of things.

773
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:34,986
You served yourself!
l got no money for you.

774
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:37,011
The president owes us.
lt's our right.

775
01:17:37,094 --> 01:17:38,677
There are rights and duties.

776
01:17:38,773 --> 01:17:41,356
- You, in the regular army?
- l'm no civilian.

777
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:42,370
Yes, you are.

778
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:46,575
l can send you in a refugee camp
to serve as security

779
01:17:46,572 --> 01:17:48,530
and watch over the Dogos.

780
01:17:48,612 --> 01:17:51,695
You gotta stop tribality.
Treat them like other tribes.

781
01:17:51,731 --> 01:17:53,230
Do l make myself clear?

782
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:55,898
Go wash up, you're dirty!

783
01:18:58,006 --> 01:18:59,547
l'm looking for my brother.

784
01:18:59,645 --> 01:19:02,019
- Who is he?
- His name is Fofo.

785
01:19:02,366 --> 01:19:04,823
Fofo? No.

786
01:19:23,963 --> 01:19:26,170
- What's your name?
- Mayama.

787
01:19:27,202 --> 01:19:29,701
- Where are her parents?
- Dead.

788
01:21:10,911 --> 01:21:12,410
Hey you!

789
01:21:13,271 --> 01:21:15,270
l know you! You're a killer!

790
01:21:16,952 --> 01:21:18,159
Who are you?

791
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:20,173
Where you know me from?

792
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,682
Who ordered you to distribute
the rice?

793
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,582
You wanna die?
Where you know me from?

794
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:37,828
This is the soldiers' rice.
Put it back.

795
01:21:37,908 --> 01:21:39,241
- No!
- ln the truck!

796
01:22:10,104 --> 01:22:11,645
ln the truck!

797
01:22:11,745 --> 01:22:12,744
No, I won't!

798
01:22:32,862 --> 01:22:34,611
What you doing here?

799
01:22:34,823 --> 01:22:36,989
Get your things and follow me.

800
01:22:38,102 --> 01:22:41,267
- Get up!
- l'm not gonna leave her here!

801
01:22:42,101 --> 01:22:43,475
- Get up!
- No!

802
01:22:43,582 --> 01:22:44,664
You got it?

803
01:22:48,901 --> 01:22:50,733
Put the girl over there.

804
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,555
- Not on my bed!
- Why did you bring me here?

805
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:08,826
Anything l feel, l'll do it.

806
01:23:12,499 --> 01:23:13,998
ls that your daughter?

807
01:23:18,978 --> 01:23:20,727
The girl is your daughter?

808
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:25,957
Where's your family?

809
01:23:29,457 --> 01:23:31,081
What's your name?

810
01:23:31,777 --> 01:23:35,276
You think l'll show you my name,
Mad Dog?

811
01:23:36,217 --> 01:23:38,050
How do you know my name?

812
01:23:40,857 --> 01:23:42,564
Mad Dog is finished.

813
01:23:44,495 --> 01:23:46,369
Where's my little brother?

814
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:48,359
Who your little brother?

815
01:23:48,855 --> 01:23:50,354
You killed him.

816
01:23:51,895 --> 01:23:53,810
You think l can kill a child?

817
01:23:53,894 --> 01:23:56,976
l saw you kill a little boy,
for oranges.

818
01:23:57,014 --> 01:23:59,805
How do you know l killed a boy
for oranges?

819
01:24:01,455 --> 01:24:03,662
lt wasn't for oranges l killed him.

820
01:24:04,015 --> 01:24:07,264
He fired at my pickup
and was trying to escape.

821
01:24:08,733 --> 01:24:11,191
We captured him in the old town.

822
01:24:11,252 --> 01:24:13,210
l asked him what was in his bucket.

823
01:24:13,373 --> 01:24:16,330
He said bananas and l kicked
the bucket and it was oranges.

824
01:24:16,411 --> 01:24:19,244
He tried to escape
and l killed the man.

825
01:24:22,452 --> 01:24:26,784
lf l had met him on the front
he would have killed me too.

826
01:24:28,093 --> 01:24:29,717
Was he your brother?

827
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:34,351
So who says
when they don't need you,

828
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:36,406
they won't get rid of you?

829
01:25:10,127 --> 01:25:11,542
You like it?

830
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:16,114
lt's fine on you.

831
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:18,106
lt's beautiful.

832
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,021
You like it?

833
01:25:21,566 --> 01:25:24,232
lt's fine around your neck.

834
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:28,923
l don't need your gift.

835
01:25:38,403 --> 01:25:39,819
You go to school.

836
01:25:40,523 --> 01:25:42,522
Take the book, it's for you!

837
01:25:42,844 --> 01:25:44,301
Can't you read?

838
01:25:50,643 --> 01:25:52,684
You go to Sunday church

839
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:55,315
to worship Jesus Christ?

840
01:25:55,402 --> 01:25:56,485
You're a virgin!

841
01:25:56,763 --> 01:25:57,929
And you?

842
01:25:58,843 --> 01:26:02,092
l got all the women.
l only need to pick one.

843
01:26:02,802 --> 01:26:05,467
Raping is not the same as loving.

844
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,704
You're not talking?

845
01:26:16,999 --> 01:26:19,332
You started the talking, talk now.

846
01:26:19,481 --> 01:26:21,063
Now you're scared.

847
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,197
l thought you were brave.

848
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,264
Talk again.

849
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,055
Talk now!

850
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:49,228
Go away!
