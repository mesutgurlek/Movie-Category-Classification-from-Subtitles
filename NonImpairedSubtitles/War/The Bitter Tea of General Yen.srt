1
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,989
Well, if it isn't Amelia, our little
tower of strength from Tientsin.

2
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,710
And Dr. Hansen. Shades
of Canton and Pearl River.

3
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,918
Rain and refugees and shooting
all the way. My, what a country.

4
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,155
Hello, Mrs. Blake.

5
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,078
Hello, Mrs. Jackson.
Come in, Mr. Pettis.

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,714
Haven't seen you since the gunboats
rescued us from General Yen.

7
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,672
PETTIS: Yeah. By the skin
of our teeth, wasn't it?

8
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,314
Close one, that, close one,
that. Step into the living room.

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,875
Everybody in China is
here. Literally everybody.

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,476
And no wonder. No missionary in
China would miss Dr. Strike's wedding.

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,635
No, indeed. Step right in.

12
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,198
MAN: Where is the bride and groom?

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,355
MRS. JACKSON: They're not here yet.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,879
What? Oh, she's on her way

15
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,274
from the ship with my husband.

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,869
Oh. And Bob? Oh, Dr. Strike telephoned.

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,714
He'll be busy working among the
refugees until the very last moment.

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,070
He didn't even have time to
meet the boat. Imagine that.

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,435
That's Robert Strike all over.

20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,148
And you say he hasn't
seen her in three years?

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,595
No. They're supposed to
be childhood sweethearts.

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,910
I can hardly wait till I see them kiss.

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,388
Amelia.

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,034
Who is the bride, Mrs.
Jackson? Megan Davis.

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,629
Finest old Puritan family
in New England, my dear.

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,110
Her father's a big
publisher. Very old family.

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,471
I hope Dr. Strike
isn't making a mistake.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,877
No. I hear she is young,
attractive, full of energy.

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,473
She'll need it. Yes.

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,076
Dedicating her life to the
service of mankind in China.

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,876
Just what I did 50 years
ago with my own bride, Mary.

32
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,313
Yes, it's glorious.

33
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,392
And yet, I pity her. Pity her?

34
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,995
I've spent 50 years in China,

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,313
and there are times when I think
we're just a lot of persistent ants

36
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,676
trying to move a great mountain.

37
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,236
Bishop, how can you say that?
After all that you've done?

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,431
Yes, I do pity her.

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,070
When I think of what
she has to face, I...

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,990
Only last month I
learned a terrible lesson.

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,231
I was telling the
story of the Crucifixion

42
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,510
to some Mongolian tribesmen.

43
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,196
Finally, l... I thought
I had touched their hearts.

44
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,630
They crept closer to my little platform,

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,957
their eyes burning with the
wonder of their attention.

46
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,399
Mongolian bandits, mind
you, listening spellbound.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,633
But, alas, I had misinterpreted
their interest in the story.

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,957
The next caravan of merchants
that crossed the Gobi Desert

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,109
was captured by them and crucified.

50
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,830
That, my friends, is China.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,879
MR. J ACKSON: Miss Davis, please.

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,509
Come on. Miss Davis!

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,871
You've run down my rickshaw boy.

54
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,394
Yes.

55
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,112
That Chinaman in the car doesn't
seem to care much. It was his fault.

56
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,109
Aren't you going to
send for an ambulance?

57
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,636
Is he badly hurt?

58
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,079
Aren't you going to do anything
for that boy? He may be dying.

59
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,835
If so, he is very fortunate.

60
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,674
Life, even at its best,
is hardly endurable.

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,629
How can you be so unfeeling?
What kind of a man are you anyway?

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,354
Oh, I'm so sorry. Do
you want a handkerchief?

63
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,509
Madam, it's raining, and I'm
afraid you are getting wet.

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,359
Miss Davis, I've gotten
another rickshaw boy.

65
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,989
Come on, come on!

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,997
MR. J ACKSON: You shouldn't
have done that, Miss Davis.

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,350
Oh, I couldn't help it.
Everybody was so callous.

68
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,156
I know, but human life is
the cheapest thing in China.

69
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,631
Oh, I do hope the bishop's
going to like them.

70
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,474
It is a wonderful event... Yes?

71
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,188
Oh, here comes the
bride. WOMAN: The bride.

72
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,159
Play "Here Comes the
Bride." Here comes the bride.

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,508
MRS. J ACKSON: Megan
Davis! My land, child.

74
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,314
It's been 11 years since I saw
you last. Let me look at you.

75
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,749
Shh!

76
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,152
Folks, this is Miss Megan Davis.

77
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,596
Take a good look at her,
because in half an hour,

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,631
the poor thing will
be Mrs. Robert Strike.

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,718
No, no, no, no, you can't
get acquainted with her now.

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,077
She's gotta get ready for
the slaughter. Come on, Megan.

81
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,511
But I can't understand it.

82
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,154
The owner of the car
looked so civilised.

83
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,032
I wonder who he was.

84
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,397
Some rich merchant taking
refuge in a settlement.

85
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,790
But don't be fooled about
his looking civilised.

86
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,110
They're all tricky,
treacherous, and immoral.

87
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,716
I can't tell one from the other.
They're all Chinamen to me.

88
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,358
Who is it?

89
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,278
He's here. Who's here?

90
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,511
The groom. Bob?

91
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,796
Downstairs. Here, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

92
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,792
Here's your hat. Oh, yes.

93
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,835
MEGAN: Bob. Megan.

94
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,151
Let me look at you, Bob.

95
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,430
Will you forgive me? I simply
couldn't meet you at the boat.

96
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,959
Oh, I'd forgive you anything.

97
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,230
Well, that's good,
because... Listen, Megan.

98
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,396
What's the matter,
Bob? Well, listen, dear.

99
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,352
St. Andrews Orphanage
is in terrible danger.

100
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,109
I've got to get a safe
- conduct pass to get into the war zone and bring out the children.

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,237
What? Is there going to be a
wedding? I'm sorry, Mrs. Jackson.

102
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,998
The wedding will have to be
delayed. But don't worry...

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,269
Is the pass from the American consulate?

104
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,879
No. None of the foreign
authorities can do anything.

105
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,638
I've got to get a pass
from a Chinese general.

106
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,195
MRS. J ACKSON: That's what we
call our gangsters here: Generals.

107
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,675
Which one, Bob? General Yen.

108
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,399
ALL: General Yen.

109
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,234
You don't mean the man that expelled
missionaries from his province?

110
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,471
Yes. He's in Shanghai
now under an assumed name.

111
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,518
I think I know where to find him.
I don't see how you can possibly

112
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,109
ask that bandit for any favours
after the way he treated you.

113
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,993
Well, I hate to, but he's the only man who
can get me through the Nationalist lands.

114
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,919
I've got to go now before I
lose track of him. Where's Megan?

115
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,034
I'm ready, Bob.

116
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,151
Megan, you can't go
with me. Of course I can.

117
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,277
Not now. I'm not going to
allow you to risk your life...

118
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,109
If there are bandit generals to be tamed
or children to be rescued, I'm in on it.

119
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,238
Why do you think I came to
China? I wouldn't let her go, Bob.

120
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,109
If you ask me, I'm proud
of her. Come on, Megan.

121
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,312
God willing, we'll be back in two hours.

122
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,431
With a carload of orphans.

123
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,596
BISHOP: Oh, it's great to be young.

124
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,230
Oh, dear, my wedding is all spoiled.
If it isn't the war, it's the orphans.

125
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,914
The food's spoiled, and the
flowers will be all spoiled.

126
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,513
Well, it's not your wedding.

127
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,632
Oh, you keep still. Did
you take your magnesia?

128
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,353
No.

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,796
Is this the bandit's cave? Yes.

130
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,632
Now, you sit right here in the car.

131
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,757
If anyone speaks to
you, just glare at them.

132
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,557
Bring the general with you.
Maybe he'd like to go with us.

133
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,679
Never mind that. With your provinces
in the deal and you commanding,

134
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,996
they'll get what they lack now.

135
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,031
What is it? Money, money, money.

136
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,949
Keep your shirt on. Keep your shirt on.

137
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,156
He handles the army in the provinces,

138
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,277
but when it comes to
money, he listens to me.

139
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,515
Dr. Strike. I wonder
what that bird wants.

140
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,634
Whoa, wait a minute. You better see him.

141
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,952
He knows you're in Shanghai
and he may make it hot for you.

142
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,794
Stall him off. Get rid of him.

143
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,398
You're right.

144
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,510
Hello, Dr. Strike, my old friend.

145
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,638
I'm sorry to intrude like this, general,
but it's a matter of the utmost importance.

146
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,836
Naturally, everything
you do is important.

147
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,798
I want a safe
- conduct pass to Chapei.

148
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,474
What on earth do you want to
go there for? That's an inferno.

149
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,188
That's why I must go. Our
orphanage is between the lines.

150
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,759
The children are in danger. We've got...

151
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,473
Oh, orphans.

152
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,599
What are they anyway? People
without ancestors. Nobody.

153
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,114
Please sit down, doctor.

154
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,356
I will get you a glass of wine.
General, you don't understand...

155
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,156
Later on, we'll be entertained by
some singsong girls. Say, doctor?

156
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,278
Have you never been curious
about singsong girls?

157
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,511
General, will you
please give me that pass?

158
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,753
Look here, doctor.

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,673
I'm not supposed to be in Shanghai.

160
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,279
If my name is seen on a pass,

161
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,596
it will do me great harm
with the foreign authorities.

162
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,434
If you don't give me that pass, general,
I'll tell the foreign authorities you're here.

163
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,196
Here's to your very good health, doctor.

164
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,278
General, I think the
boys are about ready

165
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,311
to talk turkey on those provinces now.

166
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,519
Why bother me with affairs of state
when I have orphans to consider?

167
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,115
Oh, hello, doc. How's
the missionary racket?

168
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,272
Say, I heard you were thinking
of getting married tonight.

169
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,158
Yes. I postponed it to come here.

170
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,039
What?

171
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,831
You mean to say that you left the
prospect of a beautiful woman's loving arms

172
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,196
for some nameless brats?

173
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,158
I certainly hope she
never finds that out.

174
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,430
Please, please, write
that pass, general.

175
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,996
YEN: Able to read Chinese yet, doctor?

176
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,037
STRIKE: Not yet, general.

177
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,912
They escaped the fire anyway.
But the place looks deserted.

178
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,878
Maybe they've gone.
Miss Reed wouldn't go.

179
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,188
Soldiers.

180
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,355
What do they want?

181
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,551
Well, they're laughing,
so it must be all right.

182
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,717
STRIKE: Stand back from the door,
dear. They're liable to shoot.

183
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,558
Where are the children?
In the next room.

184
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,030
There are only six left. The
rest were taken away by friends.

185
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,713
Good. We can take them all in one trip.

186
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,273
All right, Dr. Strike.

187
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,393
Bob, I don't trust that pass.

188
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,791
Do you think we ought to risk
taking the children out now?

189
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,715
They've taken our car.

190
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,831
STRIKE: Well, never mind. We'll
have to take a chance on foot.

191
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,469
No, doctor. I'm responsible
for these children.

192
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,393
They were placed in my care. I
can't risk their lives on foot.

193
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,200
But the fire's only a block away. We
can get rickshaws at the North Station.

194
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,919
Oh, please. We ought
to do what Bob says.

195
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,516
STRIKE: Megan. Megan.

196
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,832
Megan, I think you better take
this pass in case we get separated.

197
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,357
Come on, now. Keep close together.

198
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,389
Straight ahead, Megan.

199
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,471
Megan, get back here.

200
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,191
Get back here.

201
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,517
Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,279
Come on, baby. STRIKE:
Go straight ahead.

203
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,358
STRIKE: Megan, there's the
North Station over there.

204
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
I cannot give you help, doctor.

205
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,358
Bob?

206
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,115
Bob!

207
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,390
MAH-Ll: Feeling better now?

208
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,631
Do you feel better?

209
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,351
I believe I do. Then drink some tea.

210
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,392
I don't think I can. Please try.

211
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,079
You mustn't be frightened.
No one will hurt you here.

212
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,515
Please. Try drink some tea.

213
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,919
The general thinks it will do you good.

214
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,792
The general?

215
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,309
I'm terribly sorry for you.

216
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,911
But you are all right now. I'm charging
myself personally to take care of you.

217
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,311
Haven't I seen you someplace before?

218
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,795
You were kind enough to
offer me a handkerchief.

219
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,357
Oh, yes.

220
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,633
How did I get here?

221
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,077
My car arrived just as you were
being roughly handled by the crowd.

222
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,998
And you rescued me?

223
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,238
If you wish to put it that way.

224
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,838
Are we on a train? My troop train.

225
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,749
Oh.

226
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,839
I believe I'm well enough to
get off at the next station.

227
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,435
I'm sorry. Only military
trains are running.

228
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,313
There is a civil war, you know.

229
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,875
Will I be able to let
my friends know I'm safe?

230
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,033
Everything will be arranged.
Please try to sleep now.

231
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,919
I will have you called when we arrive.

232
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,437
Thank you. You're welcome.

233
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,436
Yeah, uniforms, I know. All
you guys think of is uniforms.

234
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,838
Hello, Jones. Hi, Yen.

235
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,674
You raise that money?
Did I raise that money?

236
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,478
See, I got a whole boxcar full of it.

237
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,075
I had to hock half your
province to get it, but I got it.

238
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,629
Have you heard from
General Feng? Not yet.

239
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,713
He's still got another
day to make up his mind.

240
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,039
You may have to convince him
with lead instead of silver.

241
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,636
Oh, keep your shirt on. I had to sell
half your ammunition to get that dough.

242
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,917
I'll tell you when to go. I haven't
steered you wrong yet, have I?

243
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,636
How long will it take me to
put my boat in commission?

244
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,912
Boat? You ain't going anywhere
until you get rid of this Feng deal.

245
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,310
What's the matter? Aren't you
interested in this war anymore?

246
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,236
Say, where are those invoices? Say,
snap out of it, some of you guys.

247
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,788
Haven't got something new
on the string, have you?

248
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,911
I want to send a
missionary back to Shanghai.

249
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,553
Well, send him back in a freight car.

250
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,318
My propaganda budget's about exhausted.

251
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,552
I'm going to send this
lady back in my yacht.

252
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,679
Aha. I had a hunch it was a female.

253
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,239
Who is she?

254
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,670
Bride of a lamb. "Bride of a lamb"?

255
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,512
Young lady who was going
to marry Dr. Strike.

256
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,994
I found our famous safe
- conduct pass in her pocket.

257
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,198
Say, this isn't anything to laugh at.
We gotta get rid of her pretty quick.

258
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,152
We've had enough trouble
with that guy Strike.

259
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,669
I think you have
underestimated the good doctor.

260
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,071
He seems to have excellent
taste in some things.

261
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,475
Yeah, never mind that. I'm not gonna
wait to put any boat in commission.

262
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,150
She goes back to Shanghai tonight if I
have to send her back in a freight car!

263
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,155
Jones, Jones, Jones. I'm afraid
gallantry is not one of your vices.

264
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,791
Open the door.

265
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,711
MEGAN: Open the door.

266
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,632
MAH-LI Good morning. Are you better?

267
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,030
MEGAN: Where are we? What
is this terrible place?

268
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,551
This is General Yen's summer palace.

269
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,912
General Yen? The bandit?

270
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,558
Good morning.

271
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,356
I hope you slept well.

272
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,476
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,990
YEN: It was terribly stupid of me
to disturb your morning like this.

274
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,835
But there is a famine in my province,

275
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,038
and I have no rice to feed my prisoners.

276
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,715
I assure you it won't
happen in the future.

277
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,869
They are taking the rest of them
down the road, out of earshot.

278
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,156
A cigarette? I have both
Turkish and Virginia tobacco.

279
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,152
I've never heard anything so
cold-blooded in all my life.

280
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,839
But isn't it better
to shoot them quickly

281
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,390
than let them starve to death slowly?

282
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,958
Don't go, please.

283
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,393
Please sit down and have your breakfast.

284
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,433
Why did you drug me on the
train? I don't remember a thing.

285
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,235
You were in great pain,

286
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,552
and sleep makes a long
journey very short.

287
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,838
You didn't have to bring me here.

288
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,951
Why don't you send me back to Shanghai?

289
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,597
I intend to, but it isn't
safe to send you back by rail.

290
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,914
Please sit down. I don't believe you.

291
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,479
You're lying.

292
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,672
I'm sorry, but you are making a mistake.

293
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,838
Dr. Strike told me all about you.

294
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,836
You yellow swine, if you think that...

295
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,391
I advise you to send me back to
Shanghai just as soon as you can.

296
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,634
You will always find me
your most humble servant.

297
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,318
Did you see this?

298
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,594
What are you laughing at?

299
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,234
Ten to one she goes back to
Shanghai in a freight car.

300
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,436
You lose.

301
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,353
She's not going back
at all. Are you nuts?

302
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,910
Do you want that guy Strike to
turn your province upside down?

303
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,950
Haven't you seen the
Shanghai newspapers?

304
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,112
They think she's dead.

305
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,274
I think I'll shave.

306
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,039
Say, wait a minute, wait a
minute. Wait a minute. Listen.

307
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,840
I've never interfered in
your private affairs before.

308
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,271
But don't forget, this is a white woman.

309
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,150
That's all right. I have no
prejudice against her colour.

310
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,634
Well, it's no skin off my nose.

311
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,358
Come in.

312
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,436
Good evening, Miss Davis. General Yen...

313
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,513
Sends his compliments and humbly
requests the honourable presence

314
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,069
of Miss Megan Davis for
dinner for the third time.

315
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,630
And for the third and last
time, Miss Megan Davis says no.

316
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,152
Mah-Li.

317
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,189
Were you able to send
that note to Dr. Strike?

318
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,668
Yes.

319
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,356
Do you think you could send another?
I want to make sure he gets it.

320
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,318
Maybe.

321
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,873
This is all I have left.

322
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,790
Can you do it with that?

323
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,394
Maybe. Here.

324
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,558
Mah-Li, I'll never forget this.

325
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,076
Speak English. What did she say?

326
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,790
She said, " No, for the
third and last time."

327
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,593
Well...

328
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,998
I often envy the common soldier.

329
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,794
His wants are so few.

330
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,150
Even a common soldier would've knocked.

331
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,952
I did.

332
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,596
I almost broke the door
down, but you didn't hear me.

333
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,835
You were evidently absorbed in the
sublime effects of the spring moon

334
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,150
upon my people.

335
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,312
What do you want?

336
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,515
In my province, this is
called a cherry-blossom moon.

337
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,276
It's a time when young and old,
rich and poor, sick and sound

338
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,476
pay their homage to the god of love.

339
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,472
You think you can wear
me down, don't you?

340
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,558
But you can't. Do you
hear me? You can't.

341
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,439
Oh, please let me go. I
can't stand this any longer.

342
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,716
Please send me back to my friends.

343
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,509
But I have told you: The
country's in state of war.

344
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,354
If anything should happen to you,

345
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,598
I have to answer to Dr. Strike.

346
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,078
How long will it be?

347
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,032
I don't know.

348
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,589
Maybe a week, maybe a month.

349
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,273
Maybe even longer.

350
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,195
But I will do everything I can
to make your visit pleasant.

351
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,514
If you would only relax and
let me improve our acquaintance.

352
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,996
It's pretty hard to become
acquainted with a man

353
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,152
who ruthlessly slaughters
helpless prisoners in one move,

354
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,870
and in the next shows such a tender
reverence for the beauty of the moon.

355
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,751
You have the true missionary spirit.

356
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,078
Really, Miss Davis,

357
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,199
there are times when I
would like to laugh at you.

358
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,033
But there are also times
when I find you admirable.

359
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
There are also moments when I...

360
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,756
Perhaps I shouldn't speak of them.

361
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,230
I might astound you.

362
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,830
Perhaps you believe us
incapable of such moments.

363
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,918
Yes, I'm sure you do.

364
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,358
Have you ever read
our poetry, Miss Davis?

365
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,154
Do you understand our music?

366
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,956
Have you ever seen our paintings
of women walking among fruit trees?

367
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,592
Where the fruit trees look like women,

368
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,674
and the women look like fruit trees.

369
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,798
There has never been a
people more purely artist,

370
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,559
and therefore, more purely lover,

371
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,836
than the Chinese.

372
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,791
I think we ought to end this discussion.

373
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,675
Certainly, if you find it objectionable.

374
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,478
But I wish you didn't.

375
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,075
If you should change your mind,

376
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,309
if you would follow our custom
of accepting third invitations,

377
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,074
we are having dinner at 8.

378
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,833
MEGAN: Yes?

379
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,118
I will give you more
suitable gifts later.

380
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,918
Why?

381
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,959
That was Captain Li.

382
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,316
Oh, that's all right, Mah-Li.
You don't have to bribe me.

383
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,552
Then you won't tell the
general? It's nothing to me.

384
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,229
If you want to do something
for me, help me get out of here.

385
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,550
Escape? Isn't there some way

386
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,995
you could persuade him to
send me back to my friends?

387
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,037
He would only think I was jealous.

388
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,272
But it would be easy for you
to do it yourself after dinner.

389
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,996
Please come. You could help
me so much with Mr. Jones.

390
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,798
Jones?

391
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,268
An American?

392
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,318
Yes. The general's financial advisor.

393
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,872
What kind of a man is
he? Oh, he's very smart.

394
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,553
I'm afraid of him.

395
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,392
Could I meet him?

396
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,234
Yes, if you come down to dinner.

397
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,278
This dress of mine looks terrible.

398
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,272
Oh, I can arrange that.

399
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,356
Do you like this one?

400
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,956
I like that one.

401
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,553
I have noticed you were in
need of powder and paint.

402
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,074
Yes, perhaps I am. I
will see you at dinner.

403
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,032
Thank you.

404
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,150
YEN: Oh, Miss Davis, I'm so
glad you changed your mind.

405
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,595
This is Mr. Jones, my financial advisor.

406
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,756
Hello. How's the missionary racket?

407
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,471
And this is Captain Li, my aide.

408
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,313
Please.

409
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,875
You're a newcomer in China, I take it?

410
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,593
Yes, I landed four days ago.

411
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,712
You're learning an awful
lot about China in four days.

412
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,514
I certainly have.

413
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,954
No. No champagne?

414
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,832
That's Pol Roger, 1906.

415
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,678
I wonder if I could
have a glass of water.

416
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,633
Water? You'll catch
your death of typhoid.

417
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,113
Your health, Miss Davis.

418
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,997
And the same to you, Mrs. Yen.

419
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,715
Oh, that chair is for my wife...

420
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,956
who does not exist.

421
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,354
As yet.

422
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,357
JONES: You see, Mah-Li isn't his wife.

423
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,393
She isn't even allowed to
sit on the same level with us.

424
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,636
She may seem kind of lonely tonight,

425
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,792
but I've seen her
with plenty of company.

426
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,833
Excuse me.

427
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,833
I was greatly relieved tonight

428
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,913
when I heard there was another
American in this strange place.

429
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,553
Well, thank you for the compliment.

430
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,399
But I guess I'm what's known in
the dime novels as a renegade,

431
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,989
and a darn good one at that.

432
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,998
I don't think I'd be much
of a relief to anybody.

433
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,271
What's that?

434
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,473
Oh, I was just trying to find out
the duties of a financial advisor.

435
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,469
He's the secretary of my treasury.

436
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,874
Yeah, I'm the big squeeze.

437
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,117
And if I do say it myself, I can
milk more money out of this province

438
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,958
than any man alive.

439
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,389
Do you advise the general
on other matters too?

440
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,236
Sure I do. But he never takes
it, except when it comes to money.

441
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,238
Then he's all ears. Aren't you, general?

442
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,634
Well, as they say in your
country, "Money talks."

443
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,319
JONES: Money talks in any country.

444
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,149
Wait till you hear how that boxcar full
of money I've got out there is gonna talk.

445
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,792
Six million dollars Mex can make
a lot of noise in any language.

446
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,679
I thought you asked me
not to mention that, Jones.

447
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,558
We're all friends here.

448
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,514
Besides, Mah-Li knows anyway.

449
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,233
I didn't tell her.

450
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,670
You're not the only man around
this ranch who tells her things.

451
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,552
JONES: We play dealer's
choice, Miss Davis.

452
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,911
Stud, jackpot, spit-in-the-
ocean, roodles. Anything you like.

453
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,519
I'm sorry, I haven't any money.

454
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,797
I'll be glad to carry you. It's
only a friendly little game.

455
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,309
No, thanks. I think I'll watch.

456
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,351
JONES: How about you, general?

457
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,949
Pass. Two bucks.

458
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,993
And $10 more.

459
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,270
Not me. I thought you said you passed.

460
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,631
I'll raise you $10.

461
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,435
And $10 more.

462
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,631
He loves to steal a pot.

463
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,716
Don't pay any attention to
Jones. He has a bad liver.

464
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,277
Oh, don't try to kid me, general.

465
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,153
Don't I know you better
than you do yourself?

466
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,796
Him and me, thick as thieves.

467
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,749
Don't you tell me everything you know?

468
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,235
Do I? And if you don't,

469
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,954
don't I know how to find it out anyway?

470
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,718
I don't know. Do you?

471
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,436
Sure I do. All I have to do is
give $50 to the general's bodyguard.

472
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,668
You give too much.

473
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,472
Sometimes I give more than that.

474
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,634
Yes, sir. Five hundred
dollars Mex to Captain Li

475
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,919
and you can get the low-down
on whatever happens around here.

476
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,994
How many cards, please?

477
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,349
Two.

478
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,957
And how does Captain Li know?

479
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,831
You better ask Captain Li about that.

480
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,516
How pretty.

481
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,032
Do you know good jade when you see it?

482
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,430
Valuable as diamonds, jade like that.

483
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,879
You like them? Look at them closely.

484
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,436
Yes, they're lovely.

485
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,718
I want you to keep them. They're yours.

486
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,919
They're yours. Put
them on and wear them.

487
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,352
Oh, I couldn't think of it,
really. I don't want them.

488
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,788
But you must take them.

489
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,879
I assure you, they are mine to give.

490
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,156
Please take them.

491
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,549
It was cruel of you both to humiliate
her that way. It was disgusting.

492
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,791
Nice girl, Mah-Li.

493
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,389
Raised in a mission
school, she tells me.

494
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,358
She's charming, and I'm
quite sure she's good.

495
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,551
Hah! That's an idea.

496
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,951
Now you're talking.

497
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,718
What about this one?

498
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,236
JONES: Come on, gigolo.

499
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,230
Don't forget your rings, Miss Davis.

500
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,915
How could you employ a man like that?

501
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,631
Jones has everything I
want of the Western mind.

502
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,075
I don't follow you. It's very simple.

503
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,238
As long as I can make my
interests his interests,

504
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,874
he is not going to betray me.

505
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,477
But your Dr. Strike, he
is unreliable as a friend.

506
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,473
And also as a lover.

507
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,590
He will betray you
every time for his god.

508
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,191
The subtlety of you Orientals
is very much overestimated.

509
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,269
I can't get the connection.

510
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:25,268
East or West, men seldom deviate very
far from their main passion in life.

511
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,992
You might as well know once and for all
that Bob Strike has everything I want,

512
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,519
or ever will want, in a man.

513
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,039
Put it on the table.

514
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,788
MAH-Ll: Come in.

515
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,793
Here are your rings, Mah-Li.

516
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,433
But the general gave them to you.

517
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,393
Well, I'm giving them back
to you, general or no general.

518
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,794
Miss Davis?

519
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,072
Will you send them to my parents
when you get back to Shanghai?

520
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,635
They live in Xuzhou,
and they're very poor.

521
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,070
I will write the address.

522
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,871
Why don't you take them yourself?

523
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,752
That's impossible.

524
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,953
Impossible? What's the
general going to do with you?

525
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,239
You've got a chill, Mah-Li.

526
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,351
You go right straight to
bed. I'll order some hot tea.

527
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,278
No. Don't bother.

528
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,557
See? I have my hot-water bottle.

529
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,955
That'll keep me warm long enough.

530
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,832
They aren't going to take me far.

531
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,197
Goodbye, Miss Davis.

532
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,469
Look here, Mah-Li.

533
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,358
I've wanted to tell you from the first

534
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,790
that if I could ever help
you in any way, I would.

535
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,195
That's what I came to
China for, to help people.

536
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,839
You are very kind, but I'm waiting
for the guards to take me away.

537
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,359
Guards?

538
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,915
What guards? Where are they taking you?

539
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,838
Not far.

540
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,031
Oh, no, they won't.

541
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,118
You stay right here, Mah-Li.
I'll go and see the general.

542
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,669
What's the idea, Miss Davis?
Isn't it long past your bedtime?

543
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,438
Is that any of your business, Mr. Jones?

544
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,473
Now, you don't fool me even
a little bit, young lady.

545
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,990
Mah-Li's been spilling grief, and you're
all steamed up with Christian charity.

546
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,555
Then it's true? Sure it's
true, but you keep out of it.

547
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,113
Besides, the general's gone to bed.

548
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,038
If you think I'm going
to let that child be...

549
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,593
Now, Miss Davis,

550
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,912
maybe you think I acted pretty rotten
tonight, but I know what I'm talking about.

551
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,599
Mah-Li's not your kind.

552
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,031
She's just a conniving, little dame who
deserves every bit that's coming to her.

553
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,275
Including murder, I suppose.

554
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,471
Now, you let the general
be the judge of that.

555
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,079
He runs his own show out here,

556
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,589
with about 50 centuries
of authority back of him.

557
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,469
You missionaries come out here and expect
to convert 500 million people overnight.

558
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,910
Why, changing a leopard's
spots is duck soup

559
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,439
compared to changing China.

560
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,198
You know, you're lucky to
be alive out here yourself.

561
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,277
Now, you go back to your
room, go to bed and behave.

562
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,072
Not until I've seen the general.

563
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,350
I'd like to see the
general. Please, Miss Davis.

564
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,709
Have a little common sense.

565
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,275
You have no right to go
to his room in that getup.

566
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,914
Besides, I know the
general is a nice fellow.

567
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,076
He's well-educated, has lovely manners.

568
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,759
But don't forget he's a Chinaman.

569
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,396
If you're through, Mr.
Jones, I'll do as I please.

570
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,277
All right, young lady.
It's no skin off my nose.

571
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,468
Well, Miss Davis.

572
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,355
What have I done to deserve the
honour of your visit at this hour?

573
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,355
You've ordered the murder of Mah-Li.

574
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:24,111
Well, couldn't we speak
of something more pleasant?

575
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,469
Here I have some excellent brandy.

576
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,038
It's supposed to be
over 1,000 years old.

577
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,559
Would you like to try it?

578
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,958
You're murdering her just to
satisfy a cruel, jealous revenge.

579
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,472
May I?

580
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,839
Mah-Li has been betraying
military secrets to my enemies.

581
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,759
Can't you silence her in some other way?

582
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,438
Yes.

583
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,597
In the old days,

584
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,109
in the days of the Manchus...

585
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,110
I could have had her tongue cut out.

586
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,676
But now, since you missionaries
have taught her to read and write,

587
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,158
she's a constant menace
as long as she's alive.

588
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,750
I feel sorry for you, General Yen.

589
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,270
A powerful man like you
afraid of a poor little slave.

590
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,750
The only way to get
loyalty is to compel it.

591
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,916
Take Captain Li, for example.

592
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,319
He's the only son of a very powerful
family which claims to support my rule.

593
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,909
All right, I believe them.

594
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,634
But as evidence of their good faith,

595
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,150
I made them place him
in my hands as a hostage.

596
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,875
Now, if they would betray me,

597
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,436
the life of Captain Li
enables me to save my own face.

598
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,835
That's the way we get loyalty in China.

599
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,510
That's why China is 2,000 years
behind the times. Don't you see...?

600
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,837
Why are you so interested in Mah-Li?

601
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,398
I'm just as much interested in you.

602
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,716
Oh. I am deeply flattered.

603
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,598
But not deeply moved.

604
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,792
Can't you forgive her?
She's only a child.

605
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,117
You can always do so much more
with mercy than you can with murder.

606
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,356
Why don't you give her another chance?

607
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,950
Oh, I know you feel that she has deceived
you and sold information to your enemies,

608
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,958
perhaps even been unfaithful
to you. All that's dreadful.

609
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,197
And if it's true, you have a certain
justification in wanting to crush her.

610
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,278
But I want you to think of all
those things and then forgive her.

611
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,277
I don't know how you feel about Mah-Li.

612
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,359
I mean, whether you love
her as... Well, as a lover.

613
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,993
But that's of no importance.

614
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,078
I want you to see the beauty of
giving love where it isn't merited.

615
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,431
Any man can give love where he's sure
it's returned. That isn't love at all.

616
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,232
But to give love with
no thought of merit,

617
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,590
no thought of return, no
thought of gratitude even.

618
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,030
That's ordinarily the privilege of God.

619
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,037
And now it's your privilege.

620
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,028
Oh, general, with all you have within
you, your superior brain, your culture,

621
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,516
how can you be so blind
to spiritual greatness?

622
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,792
Do this thing I ask you. Do it for me.

623
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,152
Do it even blindly if you must, and
I promise you, I'm so sure of it,

624
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,430
I promise you that for
the first time in your life

625
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,029
you'll know what real happiness is.

626
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,356
You'll know that I...

627
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,869
I have one of my own.

628
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,309
That's what you said to me that day.

629
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,959
You must be sincere, Miss Davis.

630
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,957
I don't believe a word you say.

631
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,438
But when you ask me like that,
I forget I am General Yen.

632
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,996
Then you won't have her
killed? But I ask myself,

633
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,838
what do you get out of it?

634
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,315
You've hardly known her
more than a few days,

635
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,115
and still you act as if she
were of your own flesh and blood.

636
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,392
She is. We're all of
one flesh and blood.

637
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,439
Really?

638
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,719
Do you mean that?

639
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,991
Of course I do.

640
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,793
Words.

641
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,839
Nothing but words.

642
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,076
You came in here to preach.

643
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,472
Not my words. The one who first
spoke them gave up his life for them.

644
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,437
What are you willing
to give up for them?

645
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,909
What do you mean?

646
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,917
Surely your pleasure
wouldn't be complete

647
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,031
without some sacrifice on your part.

648
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,231
Sacrifice? Yes.

649
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,318
You are so interested to
save the life of Mah-Li.

650
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,592
Are you willing to be a
hostage for her future loyalty?

651
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,438
Like Captain Li?

652
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,436
I expect nothing from you.

653
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,599
Nothing but words and phrases
you learned in Sunday school.

654
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,952
You don't believe in
them any more than I do.

655
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,756
You were wrong when you
said I resent missionaries.

656
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,632
I despise them.

657
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,960
There should be another Great
Wall to keep your kind out.

658
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,912
You've already got a
Great Wall around you.

659
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,917
And it isn't built of mud and stones.

660
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,714
It's made of ridiculous
pride and inhuman cruelty.

661
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,718
You won't allow one single
human feeling to reach you.

662
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,797
You want me to be hostage for Mah-Li?

663
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,118
All right. I'm not afraid of
you. I'll answer for her loyalty.

664
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,510
JONES: Say, what the sam
hill is going on here?

665
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,472
Come here, Mah-Li.

666
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,398
I'm going to spare your life.

667
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,519
Are you off your nut? Get up.

668
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,594
Thank her. I'm going to
place you in her hands.

669
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,074
She agrees to answer
for your future loyalty.

670
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,273
But you know and I know,
the moment my back is turned,

671
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,630
you're going to throw a knife into it.

672
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,592
Miss Davis, I swear I'll
never betray your trust.

673
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,917
I swear by my father's head and
by the bones of my ancestors.

674
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,271
And by the holy book
in the mission school.

675
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,634
I believe you, Mah-Li.

676
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,232
What are you up to now?

677
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,631
I am going to convert a missionary.

678
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,871
Here's your slipper, Mah-Li.

679
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,308
You're so kind.

680
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,590
Now, I want you to promise
not to see Captain Li again

681
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,994
as long as we remain here.

682
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,909
Anything you say, Miss Davis.

683
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,230
Will you take me to the temple today?

684
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,634
What, again?

685
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,751
I want to have prayer
of forgiveness read.

686
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,510
See? I've written it
while waiting for you.

687
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,151
I'm so proud of you, Mah-Li.
I knew you were a good girl.

688
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,437
Certainly I'll take you
to the temple. Come on.

689
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,278
Here.

690
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,992
I couldn't sleep. I had to get up.

691
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,838
We gotta get this
money train out of here.

692
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,713
I got a hunch, and I
always follow my hunches.

693
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,309
Between war and women, the
general's got me about nuts.

694
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,317
Come on, open up
there. Hello, Mr. Jones.

695
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,035
I want you to take train away from here.
Bayside Station. Money no safe here.

696
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,559
Money no safe here, now. Yes, sir.

697
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,830
Hide train, other place. Chop-chop.

698
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,032
Tonight? What's that?

699
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,315
No train due here now.

700
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,108
I say, ever since this American girl
came here, you've been off your nut.

701
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,153
You wouldn't get rid of Mah-Li when I
told you to. Well, now try and find her.

702
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,396
Here, take a look at this
if you want to see something.

703
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,794
There it is, the whole works.

704
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,151
Position of the money car, right
down to what you had for breakfast.

705
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,675
Where did you get this?

706
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,279
Where do I get everything
else around this dump?

707
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,993
I paid a lot of money for it.

708
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,439
You wanted to see me,
general? Yes. Come in, please.

709
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,955
Must've been important to
have me dragged down like this.

710
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,229
I'll say it's important.
Where's Mah-Li?

711
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,395
Isn't she in her room?

712
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,318
No, she isn't in her room
and she isn't anywhere else.

713
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,475
What? You'll never see her again

714
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,079
around this ranch. Thanks
to you, she skipped out.

715
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,508
I don't believe it.
JONES: You'll believe it

716
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,153
when we all pay for it with our necks.

717
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,715
Did you ever see this
before, Miss Davis?

718
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,354
Why, yes. That looks like the
prayer Mah-Li had read at the temple.

719
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,199
Prayer? Prayer, my eye. That
thing read in the temple?

720
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,278
Why, there's enough dynamite in that to
blow Yen's province into the Yellow Sea.

721
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,549
There you are.

722
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,715
Tie that.

723
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,956
I told you, you were crazy to
listen to these screwy missionaries.

724
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,832
That will be enough.

725
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,912
Everything is going to be all right.

726
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,678
All right? Do you realise
that your money's all gone?

727
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,429
Money that I ground out of this
province by the sweat of my brow?

728
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,598
Now, the general and I and Captain Li
were the only ones with that information.

729
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,994
Now, how did Mah-Li get it?

730
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,797
I'm to blame, general.

731
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,549
That paper must've been in the shoe
that I carried from Captain Li to Mah-Li.

732
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,795
Oh, perfect.

733
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,194
There you are.

734
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,675
How long do you suppose your
troops will remain loyal now?

735
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,394
With all that dough, Feng will buy
them out right under your very nose.

736
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,029
You can say goodbye to
this little empire of yours

737
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,434
in about two days' time.

738
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,596
That will be all, Miss Davis.

739
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,109
You will remain in your
room until you hear from me.

740
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,398
That's a pretty fancy price to
pay for what you're counting on.

741
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,074
Oh, calm yourself.

742
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,512
Conquest of a province or
the conquest of a woman.

743
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,234
What's the difference? Oh, yeah?

744
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,357
There's one thing we
should be grateful for.

745
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,675
What's that?

746
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,757
We finally got some skin off your nose.

747
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,313
Oh...

748
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,558
Come in.

749
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,118
Well, Miss Davis.

750
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:19,552
You certainly gummed up the
prettiest setup I ever saw.

751
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,997
I had visions of making General
Yen the biggest thing in China.

752
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,195
But you sure queered that beautifully.

753
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,749
I hate your insides, Miss Davis.

754
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:33,475
But you're an American. We
got to stick together now.

755
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,908
Where's the general?

756
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,951
The general's all washed up.

757
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,835
His army's deserting him
as if he had the leprosy.

758
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,713
Darned if I'm not
even out of cigars too.

759
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,390
Yes, sir. He could've been
the biggest thing in China.

760
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,116
One thing you've got to say for
him. He sure can take it on the chin.

761
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,313
Darned if I don't believe he isn't
glad this thing happened to him.

762
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,234
Oh, come on, now. Don't
you get to worrying.

763
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,158
I'll get you out of this somehow.

764
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,557
I've been in tougher
spots than this before now.

765
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,639
You go on, get your things together.

766
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,348
Wait here till I come back for you.

767
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,757
Here, here, what's this?

768
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,720
You tell the general she's
busy now and can't see him.

769
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,517
JONES: Here, wait a minute. You don't
have to see him. Here, wait a minute.

770
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,190
Now, I'm warning you.

771
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,473
Your sportsmanship is magnificent.

772
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,394
Won't you sit down. Please.

773
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,314
You're just in time to
help me select my portrait.

774
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,270
Did you ever see a book like
this? It's a painter's catalogue.

775
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,393
The idea is to select the
features that most resembles one.

776
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,832
For example, ear number three...

777
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,076
and nose number six...

778
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,999
and the chin number
27 equal General Yen.

779
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,078
How do you like this nose?

780
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,919
Do you think it resembles mine?

781
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,116
Perhaps you wonder why I don't
sit for the picture myself.

782
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,913
You see, a Chinese is never painted...

783
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,791
until he has joined his ancestors.

784
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,390
May I offer you some champagne?

785
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,958
May I?

786
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,393
In the days of our greatest
civilisation, we drank to excess.

787
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,476
In fact, one of my
ancestors, a very famous poet,

788
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,719
was drowned in an attempt to
catch the moon in the Yellow River.

789
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,474
Oh.

790
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:48,511
This portrait is of his wife, who
was made very unhappy by his death.

791
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,911
She left a very famous
collection of swords.

792
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,350
I have them in my bedroom.
May I show them to you?

793
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,790
Oh, please. Why do you torture me?

794
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,549
I am afraid you misunderstood
my purpose in sending for you.

795
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,672
I'm not altogether a fool.

796
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,517
You didn't think I meant the
conventional thing, did you?

797
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,278
Didn't you?

798
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:36,156
Do you think General Yen could accept
anything that the heart did not freely give?

799
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,032
Oh, no.

800
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,915
That opportunity has been open
to me ever since you came here.

801
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:55,398
It was your life you put up as
a forfeit for Mah-Li's loyalty.

802
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,873
My life? Yes.

803
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,311
What else did you think it meant?

804
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,273
Oh, I see.

805
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,796
You are afraid of death
as you are afraid of life.

806
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,998
You want me to send you
back to your Dr. Strike?

807
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,634
He speaks the same
meaningless words as you do.

808
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,715
He has everything you want.

809
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,711
You would like to be
able to boast to him

810
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,390
that the great General
Yen, whom everybody feared,

811
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,434
was destroyed because he
was fool enough to hope.

812
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,832
Well, why don't you go?

813
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,477
Go on to him.

814
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,511
You've taught me a terrible lesson. Yes.

815
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,596
But to be able to do good
works, one has to have wisdom.

816
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,156
You depended too much on your beauty.

817
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,308
And also on the fact
that you are so young.

818
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,555
Young and pale as a lotus
blossom which blooms at night.

819
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,196
Oh, torture.

820
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,149
Real torture is to be
despised by someone you love.

821
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,872
Bargain or no bargain.
Province or no province.

822
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,877
Do you know what I
expected to do tonight?

823
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,838
I was coming to your room to kill you.

824
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,759
And then follow you to
some celestial garden,

825
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:40,069
where there is no General Yen or
no Megan Davis, just you and I.

826
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,717
I... I had to come back.

827
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,555
I couldn't leave.

828
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,910
I'll never leave you.

829
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,312
Silk.

830
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,598
China gave the world silk.

831
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,592
We ought to be in Shanghai in an hour.

832
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,830
I'll bet your week in China
seemed like a lifetime.

833
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,474
Maybe it is, at that.

834
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,274
You know, Yen once told me...

835
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,710
Yen's dead, ain't he?

836
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,036
Great guy.

837
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,114
I don't think you'll marry Strike.

838
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,389
I got a hunch you're
going back to America.

839
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:10,551
Yen once told me you could
crowd a lifetime into an hour.

840
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,070
Yeah, into a drink.

841
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,759
Great guy. Great gambler.

842
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,474
Told me he couldn't lose.

843
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,231
The joke was certainly on him.

844
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,550
He lost his province,
his army, his life.

845
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,157
Maybe not.

846
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,669
Maybe the joke's on us.

847
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,914
Maybe you will marry Strike, at that.

848
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,395
Yen was crazy.

849
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,989
He said we never really die.

850
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,668
We only change.

851
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,552
He was nuts about cherry trees.

852
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,196
Well, maybe he's a cherry tree now.

853
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,110
Maybe he's the wind
that's pushing that sail.

854
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,599
Maybe he's the wind that's
playing around in your hair.

855
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,916
It's all a lot of hooey.

856
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,997
I'm drunk.

857
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,953
Just the same, I hope when I cool off,

858
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:24,358
the guy that changes me
sends me where Yen is.

859
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,076
And I'll bet I'll find you there too.
