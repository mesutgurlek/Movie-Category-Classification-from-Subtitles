00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,405
Nothing will happen .

Behind those wooden shacks.

False alarm about paratroopers,

Sure stinks.
Hope the Jerries don't smell it.

278
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,666
Screw it on tight.

279
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,818
Stand still .

- Got the charts?
- Couldn't get them .

284
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,341
You said you would .

285
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,106
There's only one England
and it's there .

00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,114
No , it's there .

Why aren't you coming?

288
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,154
Someone's got to do
the dirty work here .

289
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,053
You're just afraid .

308
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,609

What kind of madness is this?

381
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:53,410
Robby, the Jerries

That's your trick.
Butter up a person . . .

448
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,802
. . . and then beat him .

Take them awa y.

497
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:25,196
Let me go !
lt's nothing to do with me .

498
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,072
- The y must ha ve followed me .
- Nonsense .

499
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,339
- Shit. Why me?
- Risky business.

500
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,036
l hope l don't talk.

501
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,638
- Try to escape .
- How?

502
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,780
No talking .

503
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,827
Stop!

504
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,669
'The traitor is Van der Zanden
in London'

505
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,635
Come with me .

506
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,449
On toilet paper!

507
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,223
- You're Lanshof?
- Yes.

508
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,291
'Yes, sir.'

509

510
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,102
Did you write this?

511
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,446
Yes, sir.

512
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,914
What did you write it with?

513
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,008
With shit, sir.

514
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,344
You must be mad .

515
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,188
This is no wa y
to apply for release .

516
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,990
Perhaps l didn't ha ve a pencil .

517
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:34,802
Ne xt time l'll ha ve you shot.

You ma y go .

519

Where?

520
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,133
Home .

521
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:56,022
- You can't just let him go .
- l'm not.

522
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,650
He'll be followed .

523
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,463
Bait? A lure .

524
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:02,588
Exactly.

525
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:07,460
He might try to get in touch
with the resistance .

526
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:12,407
- Then you'll ha ve new guests.
- We ha ve the space .

527
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:16,442
Here , or in the dunes.

Let me take your coat.

531
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,751
- lt's a wonder you're home .
- That's for sure .

532
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,825

534
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:16,961
Sit down .

535
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,704
lt's a bit of a mess.

536

537
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,308
- Tea?

538
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:29,980
No need .

539
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,712
Robby is back.

540
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,052
Has he been awa y?

541
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:42,292
You know quite well .
He told me about the plane .

542
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,963
We can stop pretending now.

543
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,333
Yes. Where is he?

544
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,743
l n The Hague .
He wants to talk to you .

545
01:01:58,681 --> 01:01:59,705
Come here .

546
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,213
See that man?

547
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,360
He tails me where ver l go .

548
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,491
Security Police .

Ale x!

552
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,692
A friend of yours?

553
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,125
Yes, and so what?

554
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:38,435
Bloody bastards.
And the y call themselves Dutchmen .

555
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,705
How ha ve you been?

556
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,902
lt was touch and go .

557
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:48,581
That vet had quite a go at me
on the kitchen table .

558
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:50,274
Decent chap, though .

559
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,689
My transmitter is operating again .

560
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,151
Join us, Eric.

561
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,020
John is dead .

562
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,427
l've lost the taste for it.

563
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:09,435
You're scared .

564
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,672
We were betra yed by someone
called Van der Zanden .

565
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,377
- How do you know?
- John told me .

566
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,807
And he's in London .

567
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,211
We ha ve to pass that on , Eric.

568
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,412
Go ahead .

569
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:33,159
- You really disappoint me .
- Too bad .

570
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:36,292
- l'm being watched .
- Probably.

571
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:38,993
l'm a threat to e veryone .

572
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,830
We'll decide that.

573
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,003
l'll decide for myself.

574
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,359
Did you see Robby?

575
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,563
Then we can open the curtains again .

576
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,956
Fine .

577
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,136
That chap must be wondering . . .

578
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,027
Let him .

579
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,670
Ex citing?

580
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,803
lt's a bo y's book.

581
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:32,176
l'll be off then .

582
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,650
The curtains were a good idea .

583
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,985
The things you think of.

584
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,094
Here , your shoes.

585
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,978
Are you sure about this?

586
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,350

Do you know where
Victoria Street is?

589
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,555

595
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,980
- What do you mean?
- Your transmitter.

596
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:14,213

597
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,684
- Do you smoke?
- No .

598
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,287

Thank you .

601
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:33,131
Would you work for us in the future?

602
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,231
No !

603
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,037
Look.

604
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,751
Your fiance l belie ve?

605
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:54,088
l saw her at Lanshof's.

606
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,327
She looks Jewish .

607
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:04,167
Jewish . She'll go to
a Polish labor camp.

608
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,809
Not so good for the health .

609
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,235
Many people die there .

610
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,045
Let's go .

611
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:34,131
Won't you reconsider working for us?

612
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:54,550
Graduated?

613
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,346

- l thought it would be you .
- l can't get finished .

616
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,467
Better hurry.
The university is closing .

617
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,093
Damn Jerries.

618
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,334
l've heard some
odd stories about you .

619
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,198
The resistance?

620
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,102

We must consider the future .

622
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,876
Let's go for a drink.

623
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,817
Degrees will count again
after the war.

624
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,895
There's Robby's fiance !

- Take a holida y.
- On the Riviera .

635
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,012
That's impossible with the war on .

636
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,378
Jack, you're so wonderfully naive .

637
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,978
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom .

638
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:39,683

Still want to go to England?

642
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,400
Are you joking?

643
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:56,076
There's a Swiss ship sailing
tomorrow. The y'll take you .

644
01:11:58,914 --> 01:11:59,903
ls it safe?

01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:04,980
Nice of you .

647
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,551
You're putting us in danger.

648
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,184
Here are your papers.

649
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,788
Your name's Jean de Kuyper.
