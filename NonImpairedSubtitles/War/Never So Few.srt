1
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:55,478
Yeah, this is it.

2
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,365
This is it, men!

3
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,519
Get this stuff back to the bivouac.

4
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:04,363
All you guys, and you, stay away
from the booze. We'll ration it later.

5
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:07,201
Okay, Hiawatha, start toting.

6
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:11,247
Don't you call me Hiawatha.

7
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:15,799
As a matter of fact, Sergeant Rich Boy,
you just keep your mouth shut.

8
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:19,678
A.J., Uba, pick them up, come on.

9
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,677
- When do you expect the Nips?
- Full moon tonight.

10
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,124
They'll hit early. Figure we're
gonna have booze for supper.

11
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:55,997
Can't win. Miss the drop and the yellows
starve you, take it down the chimney...

12
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:59,205
...they spot you and attack.
- Clever, these Japanese.

13
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:00,960
Brilliant.

14
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:12,124
- Busted as usual, huh?
- Yes. The morphine's had it too.

15
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:14,483
Again no doctor, <i>Dua?</i>

16
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,242
Nope. Here's the doctor.

17
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,483
To the gods of drink.

18
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,878
The spirit of spirits.

19
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:32,360
<i>- Dua</i> Tom, you our doctor.
- You one very fine doctor.

20
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:38,597
I.F. Amplifier.
Probably the local oscillator.

21
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:41,441
There's not one of those
within 500 miles.

22
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:53,639
It's got the cranks again.

23
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,805
Stop making excuses for that damn thing
and make it work.

24
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:00,687
We'll give it the old college try.

25
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,408
Okay, Hiawatha, belch a little Navajo.

26
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,157
Hold it.

27
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:18,122
I told you, Sergeant Rich Boy,
don't you call me Hiawatha.

28
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,520
On your feet.

29
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,479
What's your problem, Danforth?

30
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,764
I don't like this lash-up.

31
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:36,116
You volunteered.
This is what you volunteered for.

32
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:38,085
These are the people you work with.

33
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:41,081
I didn't volunteer to take puke
from Sergeant Rich Boy here...

34
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,557
...because I'm Navajo.

35
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:46,119
And I'll tell you something else.

36
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:49,678
I didn't volunteer to take orders
from that Nautaung that you sent.

37
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:53,397
He's a gook.
And I take no orders from gooks.

38
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:57,081
You know, Danforth,
it's a very small world.

39
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:01,967
You and Nautaung are relatives.
Yeah, you're blood brothers.

40
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:07,077
I was once told that the Kachins are
the revered ancestors of the Navajo.

41
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,121
I find that fascinating.

42
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:13,520
Like one of those indoctrination lectures
about democracy and the big picture.

43
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:15,599
I'm not sure I can spell democracy...

44
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,282
...and I don't know what
the big picture looks like.

45
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:21,008
But I do know you got a big mouth.

46
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:24,208
If you open it again spouting
about gooks...

47
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:26,836
...you're gonna get none of this
to pour into it.

48
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:29,920
- Now, let's go to work.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:35,566
It's on the berserk again.

50
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,599
Mail, <i>Dua.</i>

51
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,487
- Thank you, buddy.
- Moon coming up.

52
00:07:57,648 --> 00:07:59,240
Tonight we make fine ambush.

53
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:03,799
Always fine ambush.
Only, how long we go on like this?

54
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:07,881
Who knows?
We're the only active force in the hills.

55
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:15,204
Now it works.

56
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:18,440
- Hope the walkie-talkies are working.
- Here, Danny.

57
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:35,685
You chaps make a fine lot of decoys.

58
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:46,879
- Burn this up for me.
- I try, Danny.

59
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:51,687
Great way to play poker.
Come on, you sitting ducks, ante up.

60
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:04,202
From old man.

61
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,883
Column of Japanese are crossing river.

62
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,006
Taking the east trail
through the jungle.

63
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,966
They're right on.
Didn't I say they'd be right on?

64
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:16,437
- Drink, <i>Dua</i> Jim.
- Not tonight.

65
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:19,717
He says the hardware business
is good.

66
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:22,561
He bought two more stores cheap.

67
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:26,762
He thinks I should pray once in a while
because prayer never hurt anybody...

68
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:28,441
...and it don't cost a dime.

69
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:32,681
America very funny place.
Full of prayers and money.

70
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:37,925
Another column coming from the east.
Estimate over 200 men.

71
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,556
<i>One smaller column crossing river.</i>

72
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:42,757
Three.

73
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,278
<i>Right on edge of perimeter. Get ready.</i>

74
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:47,724
This is no way to fight a war.

75
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:54,599
Well, another evening of joy
unconfined.

76
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:10,605
Medic! Mike! Mike Island!

77
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,962
Sucked them in rather good, eh?

78
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,247
He got it in his stomach. It's hopeless.

79
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:42,478
He may last till morning, I don't know.

80
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:45,606
I wish to God we had that morphine.

81
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,636
Sorry, <i>Dua.</i>

82
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:19,163
You're a real soldier now, Bye Ya.

83
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:24,319
You've tasted the pain
of wound in combat.

84
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,797
- Get out.
- Tom.

85
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:51,967
Tom, you can't do it.

86
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,681
Would you rather he suffered
for another 12 or 15 hours?

87
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:59,045
You'd shoot a lousy horse
to end his misery. Now get out.

88
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,676
- A human is not an animal.
- Don't give me sermons.

89
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:04,442
- You're not the chaplain.
- You can't murder a man...

90
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:07,964
...without killing part of yourself.
- I've been killing all night.

91
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:09,800
- Now, get out.
- So have all of us.

92
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:13,005
- But that doesn't give you the right...
- Get out.

93
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,200
Why? Why'd you have to do that?

94
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:44,247
- Get back to your squawk box.
- Why didn't you let Nautaung do it?

95
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:48,087
Because it's my job, that's why.

96
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,763
You get back to your job.

97
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,761
Get hold of the colonel.
Tell him I'll meet his plane...

98
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:58,204
...at coordinates George six point three.
- Yes, sir.

99
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:13,247
Charlie Fox Dog calling Zebra four-two.

100
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:16,366
Over.

101
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,519
<i>Zebra four-two, over.</i>

102
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:26,083
George six point three.

103
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:29,878
Coded. Over.

104
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,601
<i>Over.</i>

105
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:37,646
They wanna know your purpose
for coming in.

106
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:33,163
My name's Ringa, sir.
Colonel Parkson's driver.

107
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:36,401
- Where's the colonel?
- Locked in a military mission.

108
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:40,243
He said he'd meet you at headquarters
at 0800 in the morning, sir.

109
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:44,526
What's he expect us to do till 0800 in
the morning? Play a fast game of jacks?

110
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:48,317
He suggested the captain use the time
to adjust himself to civilization.

111
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:53,164
You know, girls, booze. You got more
weapons here than a bank dick. Sir.

112
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,444
Yeah. We put no trust in slingshots.

113
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:59,486
Well, the jeep and I are both
at the captain's convenience.

114
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,240
Any questions, sir?

115
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:05,640
Yeah. You wouldn't happen to know
a Red Cross lady named Margaret Fitch?

116
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:07,924
- Fitch.
- Fitch.

117
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:12,158
Seems to me that the Empress Hotel
and a couple other creep joints...

118
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:14,558
...they're Red cross country.
I'll find her.

119
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,606
- Thank you, corporal.
- Thank you, sir.

120
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,842
- This is a grand way to live.
- This is even a better way to die.

121
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:50,359
Well, thanks for the toboggan ride,
corporal.

122
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:53,884
- But you really belong in a PT boat.
- My pleasure.

123
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:57,518
I'm just kind of sorry we didn't have
a flat tire or something, sir.

124
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,321
- Ma'am.
- Good night.

125
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:04,002
Well, when do we eat?

126
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:08,002
Take it easy, this isn't hurrying-up time.
This is slowing-down time.

127
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:10,602
- Drink easy and long and consistently.
- Right-o.

128
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:13,441
We'll drink ourselves
into a tortured hunger.

129
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:18,438
Darling! Oh, darling!

130
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:25,321
Well, what's happened to you?
You've changed.

131
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:27,877
Yeah, but you haven't.
Like to bent me double.

132
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:32,087
Where have you been? Everybody acted
as if you're top-secret or something.

133
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:35,524
Margaret, this is Danny.
He speaks English like he hates it.

134
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:38,156
- Margaret Fitch.
- What pumpkin did you pop out of?

135
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:39,841
- The Empress Hotel.
- You see?

136
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:43,239
Just like good old Corporal
Thank-You-Sir Ringa stated.

137
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:48,163
Would you think me terribly jay if I were
to ask just what you're doing in the war?

138
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:51,718
I'd rather tell you what I do.
I'm working on military secrets.

139
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:54,277
I'm looking for a beautiful spy
to sell them to.

140
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,087
Do you number
a beautiful spy among your friends?

141
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:58,761
We'll find you a girl, Danny.

142
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:02,125
As a matter of fact, if it weren't for Tom
and this and that...

143
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:04,518
...you'd have me completely enslaved.

144
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:07,360
I think it's the monocle.

145
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:10,088
- I think it's very chic.
- Oh, it's smashing.

146
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:15,399
I have an injured eye, through which I
take a rather jaundiced view of the world.

147
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:20,039
- Don't ask him how he keeps it in.
- How do you keep it in?

148
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,199
Well, the problem is getting it out.

149
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:26,486
You see, it can't even be dislodged
by a severe blow. Shall we demonstrate?

150
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,321
- Let's not play that game.
- Come on, Thomas old man.

151
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,207
One blow for the edification
of the lady.

152
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:46,001
Remarkable, isn't it?

153
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,082
Hello, Fred.

154
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:10,207
I suppose there's no use pretending
I don't know you.

155
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:12,359
Miss Carla Vesari, Mr. Nikko Regas...

156
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:14,439
...this is Reynolds and DeMortimer.

157
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,166
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

158
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:19,684
- Won't you join us?
- Delighted.

159
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:27,247
Oh, Margaret Fitch, this is Miss Vesari,
Mr. Regas and Colonel Parkson.

160
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:30,366
So these are the twin legends
you were telling us about?

161
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:32,598
- You're disappointed?
- Oh, no. Not at all.

162
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,407
It's just that you are rather young
to be legends.

163
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:38,726
Well, we're over 21.

164
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:43,799
- How do you plan to spend your leave?
- No leave. No plans.

165
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,801
We could shoot off a couple
of firecrackers or something.

166
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:52,326
We should be able to provide you with
something more exciting than sparklers.

167
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:54,126
Any suggestions, Carla?

168
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:57,803
I think the captain
will fill up his time eventfully.

169
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:05,200
I could use a little help with that.
Would you like to dance?

170
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,880
Of course, my dear.

171
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:18,118
Have you been in India long,
Miss Fitch?

172
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:20,165
Several months.

173
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:26,485
Allow me.

174
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:32,158
Or is it a brand of ownership?

175
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,967
Not at all. It's just a good old
American salutation.

176
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:37,278
- It means nothing?
- Nothing.

177
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:40,724
You'd be surprised at some of
the customs of my people.

178
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:44,923
- Well, relax.
- I beg your pardon?

179
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:46,760
Let it go.

180
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:50,284
I'm a mild-mannered, soft-spoken man,
a gentleman and an officer.

181
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:52,200
And I never make a sudden move.

182
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:53,960
I'm very pleased to hear it.

183
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:56,119
And what's your rank
and serial number?

184
00:23:56,288 --> 00:24:00,645
I'm cautious, conventional
and very, very careful.

185
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:02,719
And you're on the green side of 25.

186
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,641
You're put together
like a Christmas package.

187
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:08,766
And you remind me of a pretty girl
I saw in a perfume ad...

188
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,317
...before I became a Ionely soldier.

189
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:14,525
And I, too, am looking for signs
of ownership.

190
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:17,486
Are you attached to
the handsome old gentleman?

191
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,400
You're amusing.

192
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:22,765
It seems to be one
of your more astounding traits.

193
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,920
- Name another.
- Your love of combat.

194
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:29,000
You even bring the war back here
with you.

195
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:33,127
Well, sometimes men brawl
to forget combat.

196
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:36,280
Captain Reynolds,
is this your first war?

197
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:38,200
It is definitely my last.

198
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:42,407
I think you love it.
Like most men, you relish war.

199
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:48,438
Miss Vesari, this may come
as a shock to you, but I do not like war.

200
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:51,641
What did you do back home?

201
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:55,039
I worked in my father's hardware store
in Indianapolis, Indiana.

202
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:58,564
Look at you. You're having
more fun than you ever had in your life.

203
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:02,403
You're off on a great adventure.
Living in the middle of a travel poster.

204
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:06,481
And all because you found in yourself
a rare ability...

205
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:07,922
...for violence.

206
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:11,087
You are a gifted killer.

207
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:15,564
- Somebody had to leash the dogs of war.
- Of course. You're patriotic.

208
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:18,196
A fighter for freedom.

209
00:25:19,248 --> 00:25:22,718
All right. So I like war.

210
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,806
What do you like?

211
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:30,686
I like mature men, Captain Reynolds.

212
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:33,646
They ripen a girl,
if you know what I mean.

213
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:35,878
They know how to speak
to headwaiters.

214
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:38,437
They know how to behave in public.

215
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:42,920
But certainly a little thing
like an attachment...

216
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,397
...wouldn't make any difference
to you?

217
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:47,286
Hell, no.

218
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:51,327
However, I'm always interested
in improving myself.

219
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:53,479
What could you offer me?

220
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:58,046
I could send you flowers,
I could mow your lawn...

221
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,278
...I could buy you an ice cream soda.

222
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:04,043
- And we could hold hands in the movies.
- You tempt me.

223
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:08,201
But on second thought,
you couldn't even afford my cook.

224
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:13,081
- I'm not in the same league with...?
- The old gentleman?

225
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:14,476
Financially.

226
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:18,926
You are not in the same league with him
in any department.

227
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:23,044
Miss Vesari...

228
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:28,324
...can I see you again?
- Hell, no.

229
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,560
Nikko?

230
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:34,606
Yes, my dear?
Thank you for your hospitality.

231
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:38,317
I'd like to return it. We are going
tomorrow to our cottage in Kawagar.

232
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:41,002
Very rural. Very away from it all.

233
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:43,841
If you do ever get leave,
please stop around anytime.

234
00:26:44,008 --> 00:26:46,044
- Good night.
- Good night.

235
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,597
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss Fitch.

236
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,206
I will see you in the morning?

237
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:54,041
Yes, sir. 0800, sir.

238
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:56,479
Good night, gentlemen.

239
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:02,196
Well.

240
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:05,360
Danny, you know anything
about this guy, Regas?

241
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:07,564
- Well...
- Supposed to be in shipping...

242
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:11,084
...but I think he's an opium smuggler
in wolves' clothing.

243
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:13,967
What about Carla Vesari?
She's quite a crock of curry.

244
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:17,962
Nikko Regas is a shy, retiring
bloodsucker of all trades.

245
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:20,198
- What about Carla?
- What do you suppose...

246
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:23,405
...Fred's doing with him?
- What do you suppose she's doing?

247
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:26,366
What she's doing with him is obvious.

248
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:29,281
I think we've exploited
the possibilities of this joint.

249
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,676
Waiter, check.

250
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,079
All right, Ringa. Out.

251
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,039
Out!

252
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:20,124
Now, look, Ringa, I don't...

253
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:30,602
Good show.

254
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,085
One minute, sir.

255
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:59,918
Back in a minute, sir.

256
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:17,839
Sorry about the delay, sir.
Any time the captain's ready.

257
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:21,242
About those guardians
of law and order.

258
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:24,400
Yeah, well, he shouldn't have
jerked me up like that, sir.

259
00:29:24,568 --> 00:29:28,117
Any trouble or violence, naturally I
wanna be 1000 miles away from it.

260
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,085
But cops make me nervous.

261
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:33,996
Corporal, what did you do with them?

262
00:29:34,168 --> 00:29:35,726
Oh, they're relaxing, sir.

263
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:40,279
They're sort of allies of ours. Don't you
think there might be repercussions?

264
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:43,599
Well, not on an official level, sir.
I mean, I know these guys.

265
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:45,645
They've got their professional pride.

266
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:49,437
They'll probably report they were
hit by a truck or something. Ma'am.

267
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:57,160
What about an unofficial level?

268
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,364
Oh, well, I'll apologize.

269
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:02,884
I'll buy them a drink,
ask to see pictures of their children.

270
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:06,757
Say, you know that big Indian fellow?
Well, he's got four kids.

271
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:09,362
What will it be?
Something big and brassy, sir?

272
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:12,201
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Charge!

273
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:41,402
Excuse me for saying so, sir...

274
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,005
...but you look terrible.

275
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:47,566
Inside of my mouth tastes like
the outside of a crocodile.

276
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:51,084
There's some toothpaste in here.
You can use it on your finger.

277
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,125
And water for rinsing out your mouth.

278
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:56,086
But I'd caution the captain
against drinking that water.

279
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:58,000
It has a tendency to cause ulcers.

280
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:01,877
Now, for swallowing,
I suggest the gin, sir.

281
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:03,846
Gin?

282
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:08,843
Yes, sir. Old Panther. Very, very popular
among the enlisted personnel.

283
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:12,280
You mean to say they drink this?

284
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:14,120
Guzzle it.

285
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:16,244
Like the old story about
the crap game:

286
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,842
It's crooked,
but it's the only game in town.

287
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,839
Well, where do they get it?

288
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,122
From me, sir.

289
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:26,597
I make it, bottle it, label it, sell it.

290
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:28,520
I even drink it.

291
00:31:28,688 --> 00:31:30,644
God, you've got guts.

292
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:35,244
- You interest me, Ringa.
- Well, thank you, sir.

293
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:38,605
Knock off the "sir" detail.
You ever seen any combat?

294
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:40,759
Here and there, sir, a little bit.

295
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:44,004
Well, where and where, a little bit?

296
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:46,600
New York City, mostly.

297
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:50,397
I've seen action in Williamsburg,
Hell's Kitchen, Yorkville, Weehawken...

298
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:53,207
Well, of course, that's in New Jersey.

299
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:57,643
Funny part about it is, since I've joined
the Army and the war started...

300
00:31:57,808 --> 00:32:00,527
...I've led a comparatively
sheltered life.

301
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,642
Well, you're gonna be
about 10 minutes late.

302
00:32:14,688 --> 00:32:16,440
Good morning.
He's waiting for you.

303
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:19,160
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

304
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:20,886
Good morning.

305
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,801
Well, what can I do for you?

306
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:28,080
I want a doctor, Fred,
and I want one right away...

307
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,557
...or you won't have
a single Kachin left.

308
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,928
Did you fly down here
just to bicker about doctors?

309
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:36,648
Among other things,
but most important, the doctor.

310
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:40,005
We've only been here a few hours,
but I've seen 10, 15 doctors.

311
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,477
Where they coming from?
Where they going?

312
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:46,436
I'll listen to anything you gotta say.
But just who do you think you are?

313
00:32:46,608 --> 00:32:49,918
You and your jungle wallahs
coming here, flexing your muscles.

314
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:52,522
You're not the only guys
fighting a backwash war.

315
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:54,918
We're the only guys without a doctor.

316
00:32:56,968 --> 00:33:00,358
Find yourself an unassigned doctor
and I'll tag him for your outfit.

317
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,088
- What else?
- Morphine and medical supplies.

318
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,558
Those guys have been dropping them
in egg crates, busting them.

319
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:10,597
I'll demand extra care in packing.
Give each medical chest a double chute.

320
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,361
What else?

321
00:33:14,568 --> 00:33:17,128
What's being done to take
pressure off the Kachins?

322
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:21,600
Forty thousand Nips are rolling down
from Ubachi Air Field. Forty thousand.

323
00:33:21,768 --> 00:33:25,158
There's a strike scheduled for Ubachi.
We'll throw everything at them.

324
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:28,843
- When?
- You'll be the first to know.

325
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:35,238
- What's the catch, Fred?
- Catch?

326
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:38,445
- What are you up to?
- Want you and Danny to take a holiday.

327
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,645
Pick any rest area in the Himalayas.
Take two weeks.

328
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:44,166
Holiday?

329
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:48,207
No.

330
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:52,038
Out of the question. I couldn't
stay out of the hills for two weeks.

331
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,722
Kachins got by for hundreds
of years before you...

332
00:33:54,888 --> 00:33:57,561
...and they'll get by long after
I spit on your grave.

333
00:33:57,728 --> 00:33:59,480
At least for another two weeks.

334
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:03,960
Which you will take, and that,
as we desk colonels say, is an order.

335
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:12,048
We'll take the two weeks,
providing...

336
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:14,481
Providing?

337
00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:17,888
Providing the Kachins
are moved out to a rest area.

338
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:19,845
- And?
- We get Ringa.

339
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:23,398
- Who?
- R-l-N-G-A. Your driver.

340
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:25,798
Why, he's a kid.
He's a baby-faced kid.

341
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:27,367
- Is he?
- We want him.

342
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:29,325
You got him.
Where do you want to go?

343
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:32,921
Kawagar.

344
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:34,846
Kawagar?

345
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,597
Yeah, you heard what the man said.

346
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:42,841
Like to go up there and think things over,
like getting a doctor for my campaign.

347
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:45,806
- And a few other things. Right?
- Right.

348
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:48,607
- Colonel.
- Goodbye, sir.

349
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,359
- Do you have a reservation for Reynolds?
- Yes, sir.

350
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,843
- Captain, letter for you.
- Thank you.

351
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:49,397
Oh, we're invited to a party tonight.

352
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:51,286
By Mr. Nikko Regas.

353
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:53,006
How did he know?

354
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:55,284
There's something spooky
about that man.

355
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:56,676
How can you say that?

356
00:35:56,848 --> 00:35:59,316
He's the squarest shooter
on the road to Mandalay.

357
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:01,638
I wish I had a copy
of <i>Who 's Who in India.</i>

358
00:36:01,808 --> 00:36:04,959
Or the <i>Bombay Police Blotter.</i>
I'd like to look up friend Regas.

359
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:08,837
Anybody who invites us
to a party can't be all that bad.

360
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,886
And let's not bite the hand
that buys the booze.

361
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:42,440
Some cottage.

362
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:44,997
Very rural.
Stately, but rural.

363
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:49,004
You can bet he didn't get it
by trading beads with the natives.

364
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:53,006
Welcome, allies.

365
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,442
Mr. Regas.

366
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:56,519
We didn't realize you were
tossing a gala.

367
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:59,407
Oh, nonsense. This sort of thing
goes on every night.

368
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:02,366
But I want you to consider this
your home in Kawagar.

369
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:05,645
Your foxhole away from
your foxhole, so to speak.

370
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:09,403
Now, after you've enjoyed all this,
perhaps the pool might amuse you.

371
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:12,560
And tomorrow,
the gymnasium, the stables.

372
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:13,956
Stables?

373
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:17,803
Yes, I have a few Arabians.
Ex-polo ponies. They hack quite well.

374
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:20,038
Carla rides every day.

375
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:21,556
Jeannine.

376
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,926
That takes excellent care
of the captain in any language.

377
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:41,487
Now...

378
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:52,086
I say, how about some caviar instead?

379
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,356
Carla.

380
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:03,920
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you. Nice to see you.

381
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:05,885
Break any nightclubs lately?

382
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,326
Could I interest you in some caviar?

383
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,006
European seeks Chinese doctors...

384
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,966
...lawyers, merchants and thieves.

385
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:26,722
You're a terrible poet.

386
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,119
Mr. Regas throws quite a net.

387
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:37,724
- He has many friends.
- And much money.

388
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:42,480
It's just like Indianapolis,
except this goes up and down.

389
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,639
- Isn't it beautiful?
- It is.

390
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:48,039
You live here with Nikko?

391
00:38:50,648 --> 00:38:54,766
I want to tell you something, captain,
and then perhaps you'll let me alone.

392
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:57,488
I live here with Nikko.

393
00:38:57,648 --> 00:39:00,924
So why don't you go back to the hills
and play with your popguns.

394
00:39:04,048 --> 00:39:06,243
I still think he's a little old for you.

395
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,285
Your innocence is touching.

396
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:12,487
Do you really think the young have
all the advantages of the world?

397
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:16,048
I was thinking of certain advantages.

398
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:20,201
Tell me about Nikko.

399
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:25,078
He buys and sells things,
in seven languages, at all hours.

400
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:28,563
Nikko tells me you ride every morning.

401
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:31,117
Not every morning.

402
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:38,004
Would you ride with me tomorrow?

403
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,442
Perhaps.

404
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:50,557
- Danny lived like that once.
- For a while, but I couldn't stand it.

405
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:53,959
So I came back to the world
of men and their commodities.

406
00:40:54,448 --> 00:40:56,803
I couldn't stand that either.

407
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,641
Hey, you all right, chum?

408
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:02,437
I feel a bit clammy.
Too much nightlife and lazy living.

409
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:10,638
- You come here often?
- Yes.

410
00:41:10,808 --> 00:41:12,036
The sadhus...

411
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:15,565
I don't know how to say it...
Fascinate me.

412
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:20,722
They believe in prayer and contemplation
and take no interest in worldly pleasures.

413
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:23,482
Might set you a good example.

414
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,479
I could never make it.

415
00:41:26,008 --> 00:41:30,047
I no longer qualify for the state of grace.
I've been a soldier for three years.

416
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,199
What do you believe in?

417
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:34,279
Live and let live.

418
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:37,247
It's funny when you think
of the business I'm in.

419
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:42,007
Danny, what is it?

420
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:46,844
I always get a bit shaky when
there's an attractive girl around.

421
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:03,764
He has typhus. Better
get out of here, all of you.

422
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:06,078
I haven't got typhus.

423
00:42:06,768 --> 00:42:08,599
I beg your pardon?

424
00:42:08,848 --> 00:42:12,158
I have not got typhus.

425
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:14,678
You have a medical degree?

426
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:17,799
What is your opinion?

427
00:42:18,488 --> 00:42:21,764
Cerebral malaria.

428
00:42:21,928 --> 00:42:23,998
Cerebral malaria.

429
00:42:24,768 --> 00:42:26,998
The tests will tell.
I'll make them at once.

430
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:32,998
- He's right. Why don't you leave.
- No, I've seen typhus and malaria.

431
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:34,521
He's got malaria.

432
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:38,681
- Let me out of here!
- Wait!

433
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,203
Let me go. I'll kill you!

434
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:44,045
We're gonna have to tie him down.

435
00:42:47,528 --> 00:42:49,325
We have to sweat him
to break his fever.

436
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:50,762
Yeah.

437
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:52,202
Take it easy, Danny.

438
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,285
I obtained his medical history
from headquarters.

439
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:11,240
He's had cerebral malaria.
It's obviously flared up again.

440
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:17,446
He was trying to tell me.
How long has this been here?

441
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:19,439
A little over three minutes.

442
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,157
Nothing more to do
except keep sweating him.

443
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:25,637
Fever's breaking up.
Quinine in the morning.

444
00:43:25,808 --> 00:43:28,368
- He shouldn't be moved for a few days.
- Of course.

445
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:30,405
I'll see him tomorrow.
Good night.

446
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:31,796
- Good night.
- Good night.

447
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:34,436
Good night, doctor.

448
00:43:46,648 --> 00:43:49,640
What are you trying to do,
bring me back alive?

449
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:51,526
You scared the hell out of me.

450
00:43:51,688 --> 00:43:54,282
- I put on a good show, eh?
- Smashing.

451
00:43:55,608 --> 00:43:58,680
Now, you get some rest.
You've near ruined my leave as it is.

452
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:02,045
You wouldn't dare go and have fun
and leave me flat on my duff.

453
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,601
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I wouldn't.

454
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,483
I feel like an old serial.

455
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:13,687
- When does the train run over me?
- Oh, shut up and go to sleep.

456
00:44:18,714 --> 00:44:20,386
How's the Englishman?

457
00:44:20,554 --> 00:44:23,193
- He'll live.
- And the American?

458
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:24,787
He'll live too.

459
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,512
And you?

460
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,384
I'll live forever.

461
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:32,424
I'm going into china for a few days.

462
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:34,391
Would you like to come with me?

463
00:44:34,554 --> 00:44:36,670
I'd better stay here, if you don't mind.

464
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,826
We have guests
and one of them is ill.

465
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:42,747
Carla, dear,
beware of sickbed scenes...

466
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:45,553
...particularly against
a background of war.

467
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:48,023
A man and a woman
hovering over a sickbed...

468
00:44:48,194 --> 00:44:50,469
...make an abomination of romance.

469
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:55,505
She sees him as a selfless,
devoted pillar of strength.

470
00:44:55,674 --> 00:44:59,826
He sees her as tender and merciful,
a ministering angel.

471
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:02,787
- So, what happens?
- The patient dies?

472
00:45:02,954 --> 00:45:06,344
No matter whether he lives or dies,
the romance is a success.

473
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,948
Nikko, dear, I hate to dispel
your fantasy, but...

474
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:13,266
Now, let me dwell just for
one moment on the American male.

475
00:45:13,434 --> 00:45:15,584
They're absolutely insidious, carla.

476
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:19,303
They're full of the Ionesome
prairie and the smell of tumbleweed.

477
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:22,625
They're sincere and dedicated,
and your Tom Reynolds...

478
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:25,433
Really, Nikko, he's not
my Tom Reynolds.

479
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,505
Your Tom Reynolds is no exception.

480
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:30,791
A regular Abe Lincoln in North Burma.

481
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:34,305
A girl like you
with a sophisticated palate...

482
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:36,544
...is a pushover for the type.

483
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,103
What a terribly civilized man you are.

484
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:41,071
You never lose your balance.

485
00:45:42,394 --> 00:45:44,146
Let me be honest with you.

486
00:45:44,314 --> 00:45:48,148
I understand appetite,
and I know what it is to want things.

487
00:45:48,314 --> 00:45:51,704
But I must tell you something
rather disagreeable about myself.

488
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,546
I'm a bad loser.

489
00:45:58,234 --> 00:45:59,906
If I stay with you, Nikko...

490
00:46:01,074 --> 00:46:03,907
...it won't be because
I'm afraid of you.

491
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:07,032
In this day and age, my dear...

492
00:46:07,194 --> 00:46:10,709
...fear is a very good basis
for a relationship.

493
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:34,229
I thought an old monkey-Iover
like you would appreciate it.

494
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:37,227
When I was a kid, my grandfather
took me to the circus.

495
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,986
There was maybe 20, 30 monkeys.

496
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:41,588
I thought they were
all of the monkeys in the world.

497
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:43,824
Tell me about when you were a kid.

498
00:46:43,994 --> 00:46:45,950
Well, I was a sneak and I was satanic.

499
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:49,231
That's enough.
Tell me about your grandfather.

500
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:52,067
He was a sneak and he was satanic.

501
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:56,185
He told me he could never trust a
man...

502
00:46:56,354 --> 00:46:58,788
...who claimed that he never
hankered for women.

503
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:00,387
"Hankering"?

504
00:47:00,794 --> 00:47:02,227
Hankering.

505
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:03,986
To hanker...

506
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,351
...means to have a strong desire
for something or someone.

507
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:10,074
- In this case, a girl.
- I see.

508
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:11,667
You hanker.

509
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:15,147
I hanker for you alone.

510
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:18,508
Don't sweep me off my feet.

511
00:47:19,674 --> 00:47:21,426
What would you like for Christmas?

512
00:47:21,594 --> 00:47:23,630
A 12-foot statue of your grandfather.

513
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,353
No, be serious.

514
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:28,824
We jump off on December 25th
and the days are getting shorter.

515
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:31,667
You are the most depressing
seducer I ever fought off.

516
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:33,472
Then don't fight.

517
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:35,187
And then what?

518
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:37,584
Your jungle, hand in hand?

519
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,824
Or should I wait
until you can take me...

520
00:47:39,994 --> 00:47:43,464
...to live above the hardware store
in Indianapolis?

521
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:48,102
Don't. Please, stop sniffing
around me like an animal.

522
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:50,868
You know the kind of world I want.

523
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,389
And you know the kind
of world I've got.

524
00:47:53,794 --> 00:47:56,831
You've got a few
boyish notions about love.

525
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:59,667
I know love's reality.

526
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:01,428
Let's go back.

527
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:03,266
Nikko will be waiting for me.

528
00:48:06,074 --> 00:48:09,384
He's in good shape.
I won't have to see him again.

529
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:12,954
Well, when do I get out of here?

530
00:48:13,114 --> 00:48:16,231
You mean, when will you
be ready to play soldier again?

531
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,793
Three days.

532
00:48:17,954 --> 00:48:19,353
When will you be ready?

533
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:21,746
Ready? For what?

534
00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:24,312
We needed you in our outfit.

535
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:27,113
And I put in a request for you
and it was granted.

536
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:29,310
The request was gr...?

537
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:33,509
You might have asked me
how I felt about it.

538
00:48:33,674 --> 00:48:35,744
I'm not interested
in your considerations.

539
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:37,950
We needed a doctor and you're it.

540
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:41,424
We take a plane in three days
and bail out over the Kachin hills.

541
00:48:41,594 --> 00:48:43,789
- Bail out?
- Bail out.

542
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,830
- You mean...?
- Jump.

543
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:51,145
Parachute, old man.

544
00:48:56,074 --> 00:48:58,065
We'll see about this.

545
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:04,471
He's gonna love it up there
in the hills.

546
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:07,831
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

547
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:12,226
- How about dinner with us tonight?
- No, thanks. It's more comfortable here.

548
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:34,987
Carla.

549
00:49:36,154 --> 00:49:37,633
Carla.

550
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:46,713
Carla.

551
00:49:52,434 --> 00:49:53,992
Carla.

552
00:49:54,154 --> 00:49:55,507
Carla.

553
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:58,063
I'm in here. Come on in.

554
00:50:06,114 --> 00:50:08,150
I'm sorry. I must have
misunderstood you.

555
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:10,703
Come in and sit down.

556
00:50:24,594 --> 00:50:25,822
How is Danny tonight?

557
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:30,626
Oh, he's...
I guess he's all right.

558
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:34,470
When do you think it will be over?

559
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:40,510
The war, I mean.

560
00:50:43,154 --> 00:50:46,066
I don't know.
It may never be over.

561
00:50:48,514 --> 00:50:51,904
When it is over, what will
you do back in America?

562
00:50:53,514 --> 00:50:55,505
I've never thought about it.

563
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:57,551
I may never go back to America.

564
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:01,272
Relax.

565
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:09,549
Where would you go?

566
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:14,232
I better stay in the jungle.
It's a lot simpler there.

567
00:51:20,354 --> 00:51:22,151
Tom, wait.

568
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,550
Please, wait.

569
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:27,942
Wait for what?

570
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:32,387
Must it be like this just because
I'm not in the market for an affair?

571
00:51:32,794 --> 00:51:35,513
Oh, you're in the market.
It's just a matter of price.

572
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:36,948
I know when I'm well off.

573
00:51:38,314 --> 00:51:40,145
Do you now?

574
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:43,943
Is that why you invited me
in your bath?

575
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:47,265
Don't be so provincial. In Japan,
men and women bathe together.

576
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:49,709
This is not Japan,
and you well know it.

577
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:51,785
It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

578
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:54,229
- Does that satisfy you?
- No.

579
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:57,750
Your stern Midwestern
morality is so refreshing.

580
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:01,702
All right, you wanted me
to squirm, so I did.

581
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:03,747
But there's another thing.

582
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:06,223
I don't like striking out
until I get to bat.

583
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:10,023
You've got the wrong girl.
Wrong place, wrong time.

584
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:14,073
Okay. I'll see you get a Good conduct
Medal to add to the rest of your loot.

585
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,828
Meantime, let me pin this one on you.

586
00:52:23,394 --> 00:52:25,544
You're very sure of yourself.

587
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:29,473
I am now.

588
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:31,784
I kissed you, lady,
and you kissed me back.

589
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:34,710
- You...
- I got the message.

590
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:48,509
This, lady, is the Staten Island ferry.

591
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,551
We've sent the kids to my mother's...

592
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:54,263
...and this is the first time
we've been together in a week.

593
00:52:59,194 --> 00:53:00,832
Hi, junior.

594
00:53:02,074 --> 00:53:05,783
Little Petey just got over a cold.
We've had the chicken pox bit.

595
00:53:05,954 --> 00:53:08,388
And you said,
"Get me out of the house, or else."

596
00:53:11,954 --> 00:53:14,024
How many children do we have?

597
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,389
Four, and Jenny's on the way.

598
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:21,989
Do we have room
in the house for Jenny?

599
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:25,112
Of course. I'm gonna
move out to the fire escape.

600
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,393
Carla.

601
00:53:31,754 --> 00:53:35,633
And I have one of those wonderful
American wraparound electrical kitchens?

602
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:37,591
Giant economy size?

603
00:53:37,754 --> 00:53:40,712
- The payments are breaking me.
- All the food is frozen, no?

604
00:53:40,874 --> 00:53:43,434
Nope. Your place, woman,
will be at the stove...

605
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:47,826
...whipping up pasta, minestrone,
lasagna and zabaglione.

606
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:50,189
What do you want for tonight?

607
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:53,106
Lasagna.

608
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:56,745
In the summer we go to the country.

609
00:53:56,914 --> 00:53:59,986
And the children drink goat's milk.

610
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,587
At Coney Island?

611
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:04,188
Is that where one gets goat's milk?

612
00:54:04,354 --> 00:54:07,187
Yes, darling,
that's where you get goat's milk.

613
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:38,862
I'm going to miss you.

614
00:54:40,074 --> 00:54:42,907
Where I'm going
nobody smells of soap.

615
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:44,473
I shall worry about you.

616
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:46,868
Don't worry.

617
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,706
I'm not your responsibility.

618
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,622
That's precisely why I am worried.

619
00:54:55,874 --> 00:54:58,229
It was fun though, wasn't it?

620
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:00,865
That's the way I am.

621
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:03,992
A lot of fun with a heart
as big as the Himalayas.

622
00:55:06,074 --> 00:55:08,190
That's not what I had in mind.

623
00:55:08,634 --> 00:55:12,263
I've been looking for answers
to certain problems.

624
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,346
I don't think I've been asking
the right kind of questions.

625
00:55:15,514 --> 00:55:16,833
Well...

626
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:19,110
I'm falling in love with you, I think.

627
00:55:20,714 --> 00:55:21,988
Are you sure?

628
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,670
I can't be sure of anything.

629
00:55:26,234 --> 00:55:27,508
But I know one thing.

630
00:55:27,674 --> 00:55:29,824
I didn't figure it would
turn out this way.

631
00:55:30,114 --> 00:55:33,151
You tripped over your own shoelaces.

632
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:35,587
No.

633
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:39,584
I realized that I wanted somebody
to come back to. And I want you.

634
00:55:40,794 --> 00:55:42,944
Stay alive for yourself.

635
00:55:44,114 --> 00:55:47,265
My plans include you,
all of my plans from now on.

636
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:50,585
Please, Tom. We'll talk about it
when you come back.

637
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:53,109
Let's talk about it now.

638
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:56,272
You change your address.

639
00:55:56,434 --> 00:55:58,664
Tell Nikko it's over. Finis.

640
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:01,064
Tell him you're going down
the social scale.

641
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:03,111
You've taken up with a no good GI...

642
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:06,869
...who's gonna keep you barefoot
and pregnant and on the edge of town.

643
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:09,345
We're gonna be married.

644
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:18,386
I'll be back.

645
00:56:20,874 --> 00:56:22,626
Learn to cook.

646
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:56,192
Here's your spot, captain.
Hit the silk.

647
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:58,624
Happy landings, doc.

648
00:57:11,114 --> 00:57:12,593
Maybe I should've practiced.

649
00:57:12,754 --> 00:57:17,225
What's the sense of practicing what
you can only do wrong once, doc?

650
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:41,985
Merry Christmas.

651
00:57:49,754 --> 00:57:51,506
Merry Christmas.

652
00:58:12,594 --> 00:58:14,107
Well...

653
00:58:14,274 --> 00:58:17,710
...a little breast of peacock,
water buffalo...

654
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:20,752
...and the tiniest dollop
of monkey brains.

655
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,870
I'm a hairy brute
with an empty stomach.

656
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:31,993
Merry Christmas, <i>Dua.</i>

657
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:43,023
- Hey, what do you use for bait?
- Hand grenade.

658
00:58:43,194 --> 00:58:45,913
Grenade.
That's a funny way to kill fish.

659
00:58:46,074 --> 00:58:47,792
Or people.

660
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:53,745
Well, hi, boss. Hey, old Dad's...

661
00:58:53,914 --> 00:58:57,111
...kind of on a Yale-afternoon drunk.

662
00:58:58,194 --> 00:59:00,992
Hey, did you see what
Billingsly got me for Christmas?

663
00:59:01,594 --> 00:59:05,269
He went out on a mule-buying
expedish... Expedish...

664
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:08,551
He went out to buy some mules,
and he came back with this.

665
00:59:08,714 --> 00:59:12,627
I took her off his hands real cheap.
She's fine, boss, she's really fine.

666
00:59:12,794 --> 00:59:15,069
I am humble before you, <i>Dua.</i>

667
00:59:15,234 --> 00:59:18,067
I have heard great tales
about your many battles.

668
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:19,992
No, wait a minute.

669
00:59:20,554 --> 00:59:22,192
She's pretty nice, huh?

670
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:26,063
And if you're interested, chap,
then the line forms... Come here.

671
00:59:26,234 --> 00:59:28,623
Let her go, Danforth.

672
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:31,743
You fixing to pull rank, sir?

673
00:59:31,914 --> 00:59:34,348
You're a big man with the bars, huh?

674
00:59:34,514 --> 00:59:36,425
They come off easily enough.

675
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:41,145
Well, don't you worry about it, because
I'm gonna take them off for you. Okay?

676
00:59:42,354 --> 00:59:44,629
The whites are sure restless tonight.

677
00:59:44,874 --> 00:59:47,308
The line forms behind me.

678
01:00:03,194 --> 01:00:06,027
Give me that gun and get on your job.

679
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:09,872
What's happening?

680
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:50,587
Ringa.

681
01:01:59,234 --> 01:02:02,306
You won't need that, sir.
They're gone. It was hit-and-run.

682
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:05,264
You wanna hold that there, sir?

683
01:02:10,754 --> 01:02:12,631
How did we come out?

684
01:02:13,674 --> 01:02:15,392
We got hurt.

685
01:02:31,434 --> 01:02:32,787
Jim?

686
01:02:34,874 --> 01:02:36,353
Jim.

687
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,984
Hi, Danny.

688
01:02:40,154 --> 01:02:42,065
What's been going on?

689
01:02:49,554 --> 01:02:52,466
You're pretty good with the mortar.
Where'd you learn it?

690
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:56,625
I didn't. I was just trying to find
something to shoot them with.

691
01:02:56,794 --> 01:02:59,262
- Here we go.
- Easy, now.

692
01:03:08,874 --> 01:03:10,944
All right, doc, knock off the whistling.

693
01:03:11,114 --> 01:03:14,265
Nobody's interested in how
medically unconcerned you are.

694
01:03:14,434 --> 01:03:16,311
How is the wound, <i>Dua?</i>

695
01:03:16,474 --> 01:03:19,625
It's a good wound, old man.
A million-dollar wound.

696
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:23,503
It'll get me hospital leave and get
me out of sight of your ugly old face.

697
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:27,067
I still can't understand
how the Nips had us figured out.

698
01:03:27,234 --> 01:03:30,704
According to the scouts,
there wasn't a yellow within 40 miles.

699
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:33,104
I imagine we'll soon find out.

700
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:37,392
Ringa's got a Jap out there,
and I imagine he'll talk.

701
01:03:42,914 --> 01:03:44,950
You got a count on the wounded?

702
01:03:45,114 --> 01:03:47,674
Thirty walking, 22 litter.

703
01:03:48,794 --> 01:03:51,388
Danny, get the walking
wounded back on the line.

704
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:55,911
It'll keep them from griping
and feeling sorry for themselves.

705
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:01,748
You know, the movies
have got it all wrong.

706
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:04,553
A cigarette tastes lousy
when you're wounded.

707
01:04:13,914 --> 01:04:17,270
He's a tough one, pappy.
A real tough one.

708
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:19,186
But he split.

709
01:04:19,354 --> 01:04:20,912
Right down the middle.

710
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:23,986
Nautaung wants to tell you himself.
He'll be right in.

711
01:04:24,154 --> 01:04:26,065
You have a hard day, boy?

712
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:27,986
At the office?

713
01:04:29,034 --> 01:04:30,353
You hear what I said, doc?

714
01:04:30,514 --> 01:04:33,187
I asked him if he had a hard day
at the office.

715
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:39,628
I stand in disgrace before you, <i>Dua.</i>

716
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:42,389
He who betrayed us is of my people.

717
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:44,068
It was Billingsly.

718
01:04:50,074 --> 01:04:52,668
Billingsly and the Shan girl.

719
01:04:57,074 --> 01:05:00,146
What is your wish, Nautaung?
What is the wish of your people?

720
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:03,192
Billingsly will be put
in the circle tomorrow.

721
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,508
And the girl?

722
01:05:05,674 --> 01:05:07,983
She must be shot.

723
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:28,311
Reynolds, you're not judge and jury.

724
01:05:32,914 --> 01:05:34,188
You'll spill the plasma.

725
01:05:34,354 --> 01:05:35,833
You're a lousy barbarian.

726
01:05:36,794 --> 01:05:38,910
- You're a murderer.
- You're an idealist.

727
01:05:39,074 --> 01:05:40,393
And a lousy idealist.

728
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:42,272
Well, maybe I am.

729
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:45,028
But this is murder,
and we're all part of it.

730
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,624
You've got a lot to learn, Travis.

731
01:05:59,794 --> 01:06:02,149
You got a kid safe at home.

732
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:06,143
Suppose the information Ringa got
off the Jap could keep him safe at home.

733
01:06:06,314 --> 01:06:08,430
Would you call Ringa a murderer?

734
01:06:11,674 --> 01:06:13,983
And if the Kachins
assassinate a traitor...

735
01:06:14,154 --> 01:06:17,908
...in order to save their own lives,
you think they would be murderers?

736
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,632
Or us?

737
01:06:26,234 --> 01:06:28,748
Go to bed, doc. You got assistants.

738
01:06:28,914 --> 01:06:31,792
- They're tired.
- Sure.

739
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,866
And tomorrow you'll be tired
and all screwed up.

740
01:06:35,354 --> 01:06:36,946
But they'll be well rested.

741
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:39,184
Is that the important thing?

742
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:43,307
Well, when I give an order,
there's a reason for it.

743
01:06:45,194 --> 01:06:46,786
I'm sorry.

744
01:06:47,114 --> 01:06:51,471
Do as you're told until you find out what
year it is and you won't have to be sorry.

745
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:53,909
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink.

746
01:06:54,074 --> 01:06:57,146
- Not while I'm working.
- Don't be an ass, have a drink.

747
01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:04,033
I wish there was time to tell you
everything, but...

748
01:07:04,794 --> 01:07:08,787
Look, we don't drink to get drunk.
We... We nip.

749
01:07:08,954 --> 01:07:12,629
The booze just helps to keep you going.
Take my word for it.

750
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:17,226
How are the men?

751
01:07:18,794 --> 01:07:21,262
What men? They're boys.

752
01:07:22,874 --> 01:07:25,593
Say, didn't you do the field operating
around here?

753
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:27,028
Yeah.

754
01:07:27,194 --> 01:07:29,071
Yeah, well, you were lousy.

755
01:07:29,234 --> 01:07:31,509
The base surgeon said so.

756
01:07:33,474 --> 01:07:35,704
That's why I wanted you, doc.

757
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:40,507
Maybe you can teach me
a few things.

758
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:47,351
You know...

759
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:50,592
...the base surgeon didn't say
you were lousy at all.

760
01:07:51,674 --> 01:07:54,188
Matter of fact, he said
you were pretty good.

761
01:07:55,594 --> 01:07:58,267
I kind of made that up.

762
01:08:03,354 --> 01:08:06,312
- What's this?
- It's your airlift tag.

763
01:08:06,474 --> 01:08:09,272
I'm shipping you
to the base hospital tomorrow.

764
01:08:10,074 --> 01:08:11,746
Yes, sir.

765
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,232
Here's your lunch.

766
01:08:28,514 --> 01:08:30,550
Well, you're a new one.

767
01:08:30,714 --> 01:08:32,625
Mind if I ask you
the famous question?

768
01:08:32,794 --> 01:08:36,309
- Where am I?
- Still at the base at Assam.

769
01:08:40,514 --> 01:08:44,189
All right, knock it off, you guys.
Drop your griping and grab your socks.

770
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:47,107
Hey, <i>Dua,</i> no good in here.

771
01:08:47,274 --> 01:08:49,265
No rice, <i>Dua.</i>

772
01:08:49,434 --> 01:08:51,186
What's that all about?

773
01:08:52,114 --> 01:08:54,264
- Give me that robe.
- You stay right in bed.

774
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:55,708
Give me the robe.

775
01:08:55,874 --> 01:08:58,946
Stay in bed and watch your language.
You're not in the jungle.

776
01:08:59,114 --> 01:09:00,945
Stand back, lieutenant.

777
01:09:09,754 --> 01:09:11,187
Thank you.

778
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:13,273
If you'll excuse me.

779
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:18,864
Please, there are very sick men
in here.

780
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:21,502
You fellas wanna spend your lives
in the feathers?

781
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:23,665
Go back to the jungle
where you belong.

782
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:25,586
No can do, <i>Dua.</i>

783
01:09:25,754 --> 01:09:27,187
- There's no food.
- Can't eat.

784
01:09:27,354 --> 01:09:30,312
- No good.
- Our bellies sing with hunger.

785
01:09:30,474 --> 01:09:33,705
And they feed us torn-up weeds.

786
01:09:33,874 --> 01:09:35,102
No food.

787
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:38,984
Captain, please.

788
01:09:39,154 --> 01:09:41,429
And hot water smelling dead chicken.

789
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,186
- No good.
- Can't eat.

790
01:09:43,354 --> 01:09:45,310
- Can't eat, <i>Dua.</i>
- No good.

791
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:47,624
This we'll soon remedy.

792
01:09:54,154 --> 01:09:56,793
You get back into bed.
That's an order.

793
01:09:58,714 --> 01:10:00,625
Get back into bed.

794
01:10:01,754 --> 01:10:05,429
One day, I'm gonna meet a nurse who
doesn't sound like a troop commander.

795
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:08,154
Captain, I'm going to report you
to the colonel.

796
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:11,268
Tattletale.

797
01:10:11,434 --> 01:10:14,506
- Hey, come back here.
- Where you going?

798
01:10:32,594 --> 01:10:34,152
Colonel.

799
01:10:34,994 --> 01:10:37,030
Now, just what is this?

800
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:41,109
Colonel, I'd like to have a few words
with you about this stuff.

801
01:10:41,554 --> 01:10:45,229
Captain, may I remind you that
this is a hospital, and not a circus?

802
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:46,827
That's just an opinion.

803
01:10:48,794 --> 01:10:50,546
Put that down.

804
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:52,904
Surely you don't mind
if we have a drink.

805
01:10:53,434 --> 01:10:56,073
I'm not running a bar for Kachins.

806
01:10:57,594 --> 01:11:00,472
Well, you feel they're below
your station, doctor?

807
01:11:01,274 --> 01:11:04,903
You know, your type of so-called
democratic American burns my butt.

808
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:07,269
The captain is a mental case.

809
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:09,505
I'm gonna have to report this.

810
01:11:09,674 --> 01:11:12,632
- You realize how weak these patients are?
- Well, of course I do.

811
01:11:12,794 --> 01:11:14,591
They're wounded.
They've got dysentery.

812
01:11:14,754 --> 01:11:16,153
Why do you suppose that is?

813
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,544
- It's the water.
- It's the diet.

814
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:21,106
Salad.

815
01:11:21,434 --> 01:11:23,186
Chicken soup.

816
01:11:23,354 --> 01:11:24,673
Corn bread?

817
01:11:24,834 --> 01:11:27,029
We don't have the personnel
to cater to...

818
01:11:27,194 --> 01:11:30,231
These people are brought up
on pure red peppers, doctor...

819
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:33,704
...and when they can't get red peppers,
they get dysentery.

820
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:35,273
Now, do you feed them rice?

821
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:38,352
We do the best we can.

822
01:11:39,514 --> 01:11:42,586
Doctor, let's assume that you were
wounded in a strange place.

823
01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:46,588
And you were fed red peppers
and rice and monkey entrails.

824
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:48,073
That's what they eat.

825
01:11:48,594 --> 01:11:51,825
Don't you suppose that would
knock the slats out of your system?

826
01:11:51,994 --> 01:11:56,192
If you've got nobody to cook for them,
they'd be happy to cook for themselves.

827
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,073
That's the way they are,
and you gotta respect it.

828
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:04,344
Now, let's cooperate, shall we?

829
01:12:22,394 --> 01:12:25,306
I just had a rather interesting discussion
about garbage.

830
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:30,070
I heard the last part of it. I won't ask
how you feel. What can I do for you?

831
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:32,623
Well, you can get me some Scotch.

832
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,629
And what can I do for you?

833
01:12:58,994 --> 01:13:03,431
Soon as you get back to the hills, your
Kachins will attack the airfield at Ubachi.

834
01:13:03,594 --> 01:13:06,108
It's garrisoned by only a token force.

835
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,153
How large a token force?

836
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:10,066
We're not sure.

837
01:13:10,634 --> 01:13:14,707
- Your Kachin detachment will attack.
- You mean, all 324 of us?

838
01:13:16,074 --> 01:13:17,792
Infiltrating enemy positions...

839
01:13:17,954 --> 01:13:21,390
...blowing ammo dumps, gas tanks,
destroying all aircraft on ground.

840
01:13:21,554 --> 01:13:23,306
You'll chop it up good.

841
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:25,745
What about some support, Fred?

842
01:13:25,914 --> 01:13:28,508
You'll have trucks
from the Chinese border.

843
01:13:28,674 --> 01:13:31,825
Among other things, the trucks
will carry explosives and artillery.

844
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:33,347
They'll give you support.

845
01:13:33,514 --> 01:13:35,266
Chinese border.

846
01:13:35,434 --> 01:13:36,913
That's a long way.

847
01:13:37,074 --> 01:13:40,305
- Think they can make it?
- They'll be unpleasant.

848
01:13:42,554 --> 01:13:44,545
That's a lousy detail.

849
01:13:44,714 --> 01:13:47,990
I'd rather shinny up a thorn tree
with an armful of eels.

850
01:13:48,154 --> 01:13:51,783
Tom, you and your Kachins are
the only ones we've got for the job.

851
01:13:53,314 --> 01:13:54,633
Okay.

852
01:13:54,794 --> 01:13:56,671
I'll get you the Scotch.

853
01:13:58,074 --> 01:13:59,666
You've got a visitor.

854
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:01,313
In there.

855
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:29,910
Well, I'm glad to see
you have both your arms...

856
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:33,146
...and they are still
strategically placed.

857
01:14:33,954 --> 01:14:35,990
Can't you say something?

858
01:14:36,674 --> 01:14:38,312
I don't know what to say, l...

859
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,907
I'm just so glad to see you.

860
01:14:40,074 --> 01:14:43,862
Well, you were saying enough in there,
and at the top of your voice.

861
01:14:45,794 --> 01:14:49,104
I didn't expect to see you again
so soon. How did you know?

862
01:14:49,274 --> 01:14:50,832
Nikko and I were in town again.

863
01:14:50,994 --> 01:14:54,111
The colonel told us you were
badly chewed up.

864
01:14:54,274 --> 01:14:57,107
I'm so glad he exaggerated.

865
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:00,823
They didn't even lay a Band-Aid
on me.

866
01:15:01,474 --> 01:15:03,510
Can you break out of here?

867
01:15:03,674 --> 01:15:06,063
Can you sneak out the back door?

868
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:08,749
I don't like back doors, carla.

869
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:10,870
Whatever you say.
I don't care, darling.

870
01:15:11,034 --> 01:15:12,308
Tomorrow, then.

871
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:16,513
And in the meantime,
don't burn down the hospital.

872
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:31,468
I kiss you and the bells ring wildly
in my temples.

873
01:15:32,474 --> 01:15:34,385
Temple bells.

874
01:15:36,314 --> 01:15:37,793
Why do you suppose that is?

875
01:15:37,954 --> 01:15:39,706
Because you put me in a turmoil.

876
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:42,707
Oh, it's too difficult to explain.

877
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:46,869
Wouldn't it be wonderful if
there were no more goodbyes?

878
01:15:47,034 --> 01:15:48,945
It would indeed.

879
01:15:49,874 --> 01:15:53,833
That day will come, and when it does,
I'll lead you a terrible life.

880
01:15:53,994 --> 01:15:55,905
I will never let you out of my sight.

881
01:15:56,074 --> 01:16:00,465
I will be greedy for you
every hour of every day.

882
01:16:00,794 --> 01:16:02,147
I will be jealous too.

883
01:16:02,314 --> 01:16:05,465
And 20 years from now, if you dare
to look at another woman...

884
01:16:05,634 --> 01:16:08,546
...I wouldn't be ashamed
of making a scene.

885
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:11,790
All this, so beautiful.

886
01:16:11,954 --> 01:16:13,626
You like it?

887
01:16:14,394 --> 01:16:15,713
Yeah.

888
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:19,824
You do not like it.

889
01:16:21,554 --> 01:16:23,226
How do you expect me to?

890
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:25,191
Take a look around.

891
01:16:26,794 --> 01:16:30,264
Here we are playing house
in a hotel room, courtesy of Regas.

892
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:33,153
Flowers, courtesy of Regas.

893
01:16:34,234 --> 01:16:37,385
Even the booze, courtesy of Regas.

894
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:41,186
Tom.

895
01:16:44,714 --> 01:16:49,151
That day in the boat you made
a beautiful case for us.

896
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:50,713
For us alone.

897
01:16:50,874 --> 01:16:52,546
It was a fairy tale, Carla.

898
01:16:52,714 --> 01:16:55,353
- It was nice to believe for a while, but...
- But what?

899
01:16:55,514 --> 01:16:57,823
I told you about the kind of world
I live in.

900
01:16:57,994 --> 01:16:59,746
And this isn't it.

901
01:16:59,914 --> 01:17:02,428
What's the matter with you, Tom?

902
01:17:03,434 --> 01:17:05,823
You once told me I had
boyish notions about love...

903
01:17:05,994 --> 01:17:07,905
...and that you knew love's realities.

904
01:17:08,074 --> 01:17:09,632
Why must you spoil everything?

905
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:13,184
You said, "I think we'd better go
because Nikko will be waiting."

906
01:17:14,074 --> 01:17:15,712
And you were right.

907
01:17:15,874 --> 01:17:18,308
So let's be honest.
That's the way it should be.

908
01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:21,382
That's the way you want it.

909
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:23,545
Now I know what kind of man you are.

910
01:17:23,714 --> 01:17:26,148
So brave in battle, but so afraid of life.

911
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:30,230
You talk of the future, but you won't
take a chance on it.

912
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:34,271
I won't plead with you, Tom.

913
01:17:34,434 --> 01:17:36,152
I can't.

914
01:17:38,034 --> 01:17:39,433
I don't know how.

915
01:18:10,594 --> 01:18:12,391
Hey, Danny, where are those trucks?

916
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:16,024
I'm sick and tired and weary
of all this bird-dogging.

917
01:18:16,434 --> 01:18:18,311
The trucks aren't there.

918
01:18:18,954 --> 01:18:21,627
You want me to break out
another scouting party?

919
01:18:22,874 --> 01:18:25,672
We've had scouts out for two days.

920
01:18:26,714 --> 01:18:28,466
We're gonna move on Ubachi.

921
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:30,704
Without the artillery,
we got no support.

922
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:33,183
We're gonna hit Ubachi.

923
01:18:34,194 --> 01:18:37,027
- We're gonna get murdered.
- You take the flank.

924
01:18:37,514 --> 01:18:39,982
Well, things are gonna boil tonight.

925
01:18:49,874 --> 01:18:51,512
Move your men out, Danny.

926
01:18:51,674 --> 01:18:55,508
- What's your hurry? Let's think this out.
- Let's not.

927
01:18:55,674 --> 01:18:58,108
Tom, you're a man
of gruesome courage...

928
01:18:58,274 --> 01:19:02,108
...but moving on Ubachi without support
is as sensible as a hotfoot in hell.

929
01:19:02,274 --> 01:19:03,992
Nothing in this war makes sense.

930
01:19:04,154 --> 01:19:06,588
Why do you expect it
to make sense now?

931
01:19:37,034 --> 01:19:38,865
Ammo...

932
01:19:39,034 --> 01:19:40,786
...gas dump...

933
01:19:40,954 --> 01:19:42,387
...barracks.

934
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:51,270
I think it's time for a meeting.

935
01:24:26,234 --> 01:24:27,906
It's all right, Hiawatha.

936
01:24:28,074 --> 01:24:29,587
It's all right.

937
01:24:30,554 --> 01:24:32,067
Hiawa...?

938
01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:34,345
Why, you lousy...

939
01:24:34,674 --> 01:24:36,744
...Sergeant Rich Boy.

940
01:24:42,154 --> 01:24:43,633
Danforth.

941
01:25:19,754 --> 01:25:22,222
All right, old man, you can come out.
It's over.

942
01:25:32,314 --> 01:25:33,793
Nautaung.

943
01:25:33,954 --> 01:25:35,512
Old man.

944
01:25:37,354 --> 01:25:38,946
Is it bad?

945
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:44,667
You have been good to me...

946
01:25:44,834 --> 01:25:46,313
<i>...Dua.</i>

947
01:25:48,114 --> 01:25:50,070
I'm sorry...

948
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:53,431
...to leave you.

949
01:27:02,714 --> 01:27:03,988
I don't get it.

950
01:27:04,154 --> 01:27:06,384
This is the convoy
we were supposed to meet.

951
01:27:06,794 --> 01:27:10,230
I don't see how the Japs could've killed
our men without casualties.

952
01:27:10,394 --> 01:27:12,783
Unless they've been carrying off
their own dead.

953
01:27:13,794 --> 01:27:15,068
Get a load of these hats.

954
01:27:15,234 --> 01:27:17,589
And what are these uniforms
they're wearing?

955
01:27:19,554 --> 01:27:21,704
I found these men
in the village up ahead.

956
01:27:21,874 --> 01:27:25,913
They say these guys weren't killed by
the Nips, they were killed by the Chinese.

957
01:27:26,834 --> 01:27:28,665
What kind of Chinese?

958
01:27:28,834 --> 01:27:31,064
- Ton quon or dai chak?
- Dai chak.

959
01:27:31,234 --> 01:27:35,432
Renegades. Chinese troops of a warlord.
Holed up across the Chinese border.

960
01:27:35,594 --> 01:27:38,825
According to them, they got GI gear,
guns and everything else.

961
01:27:38,994 --> 01:27:43,670
These warlords or troops or whoever,
they just didn't knock off a convoy.

962
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:45,984
They've been killing our men.

963
01:27:47,314 --> 01:27:50,226
How would you people like to go
over the border to China?

964
01:27:51,634 --> 01:27:54,194
- You can't cross the border.
- They paid us a visit.

965
01:27:54,354 --> 01:27:56,629
- Let's return the courtesy.
- You out of your mind?

966
01:27:56,794 --> 01:27:59,991
- China's a bit off our beat.
- I'd follow them to the North Pole.

967
01:28:00,274 --> 01:28:04,665
- Take your suffering Kachins with you?
- I will. And you and the rest of you.

968
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:06,267
- Boss.
- Get the colonel.

969
01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:10,871
Tell him we're gonna cross over to
china. Release these guys. Let's move.

970
01:28:14,034 --> 01:28:15,547
Go home.

971
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:10,272
Little beauties asleep?

972
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:13,107
Yeah, they're not only asleep...

973
01:29:13,274 --> 01:29:15,993
...I'll bet you a fiver they're drunk.

974
01:29:16,154 --> 01:29:17,473
Good.

975
01:29:17,714 --> 01:29:19,033
Good.

976
01:32:51,074 --> 01:32:52,507
Get out.

977
01:34:00,994 --> 01:34:03,189
- Jim.
- Yeah, boss?

978
01:34:03,354 --> 01:34:05,504
- Your radio operating?
- It sure is.

979
01:34:05,674 --> 01:34:07,710
Tell the colonel we've
occupied this place...

980
01:34:07,874 --> 01:34:10,388
...we're taking these lice as prisoners.
- Right.

981
01:34:36,994 --> 01:34:38,393
Danny.

982
01:34:39,314 --> 01:34:41,225
Can you translate that?

983
01:34:45,234 --> 01:34:46,462
Yeah.

984
01:34:47,514 --> 01:34:50,153
It's a warrant from
the Chongqing government.

985
01:34:50,874 --> 01:34:53,593
"The bearer is charged and entrusted...

986
01:34:53,754 --> 01:34:58,305
...to preserve the territorial integrity
of China...

987
01:34:59,754 --> 01:35:02,143
...by preventive measures,
if necessary...

988
01:35:02,314 --> 01:35:05,465
...within or beyond the
geographical bounds of the Republic."

989
01:35:05,634 --> 01:35:08,387
- "Preventive measures"?
- Yeah.

990
01:35:08,554 --> 01:35:13,582
"The bearer is further authorized
to confiscate all military materiel...

991
01:35:13,754 --> 01:35:17,667
...to deal with all invaders,
to rout out all traitors...

992
01:35:18,154 --> 01:35:21,624
...domestic or foreign."

993
01:35:27,914 --> 01:35:31,668
Do you mean that this thing gives
these lice the right to raid and loot?

994
01:35:31,834 --> 01:35:33,745
And split the take with Chongqing.

995
01:35:33,914 --> 01:35:36,792
- Fifty-fifty.
- Chongqing issued that?

996
01:35:36,954 --> 01:35:39,866
That gives these bandits the green light
to kill Americans.

997
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:43,743
I've heard of warrants like this before.
All protected warlords have them.

998
01:35:43,914 --> 01:35:47,224
Chongqing licensed these warlords
to knock off American convoys...

999
01:35:47,394 --> 01:35:51,103
...and sell our gear to the Japanese,
and Chongqing pockets half the loot.

1000
01:35:51,274 --> 01:35:54,186
Say, what kind of a war is this?

1001
01:35:54,354 --> 01:35:57,187
Our government couldn't know
about that.

1002
01:36:08,474 --> 01:36:10,783
I thought I knew what a rat was.

1003
01:36:11,674 --> 01:36:13,904
I had no conception.

1004
01:36:19,994 --> 01:36:22,144
I got a message for you, boss.

1005
01:36:22,314 --> 01:36:24,703
Before I could get the other one off,
this came.

1006
01:36:24,874 --> 01:36:27,707
"Chinese government most disturbed
your crossing border.

1007
01:36:27,874 --> 01:36:30,434
Has filed complaint highest
American authority.

1008
01:36:30,594 --> 01:36:34,348
Do not make any attack. Repeat.
Do not make any attack.

1009
01:36:34,514 --> 01:36:39,349
Rearm and release any prisoners you
may have taken. Destroy any documents.

1010
01:36:39,514 --> 01:36:43,029
Headquarters will expect
immediate apology to Chongqing.

1011
01:36:43,314 --> 01:36:46,704
More afraid this is an incident.
Sorry. Signed, Fred."

1012
01:36:48,114 --> 01:36:50,674
Looks like we're gonna get
a court martial.

1013
01:36:50,834 --> 01:36:53,428
They couldn't have understood right,
boss.

1014
01:36:54,074 --> 01:36:56,224
We're gonna get a court martial...

1015
01:36:56,394 --> 01:37:01,104
...for stopping the Japs from getting our
gear. For stopping these dirty little rats.

1016
01:37:03,194 --> 01:37:05,583
Round up the prisoners and
anchor them somewhere.

1017
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:08,992
Yes, sir.

1018
01:37:15,714 --> 01:37:17,193
Whiskey.

1019
01:37:18,154 --> 01:37:20,907
- Just liberated it.
- How do you know it's not poisoned?

1020
01:37:21,074 --> 01:37:23,713
I don't. That's why I decided
to share it with you.

1021
01:37:23,874 --> 01:37:25,865
Thanks, chum.

1022
01:37:41,914 --> 01:37:43,950
What am I gonna do, Danny?

1023
01:37:45,074 --> 01:37:46,871
You're the boss.

1024
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:48,786
It's your decision.

1025
01:37:50,954 --> 01:37:53,388
How tangled can a knot get?

1026
01:37:54,234 --> 01:37:57,271
If I were you, I wouldn't
stick your head out any further...

1027
01:37:57,434 --> 01:38:00,824
...or somebody's gonna knock it off.
- You rather I kept it buried?

1028
01:38:00,994 --> 01:38:03,508
I want to see justice done
just as much as you do.

1029
01:38:03,674 --> 01:38:06,586
You can't right all the wrongs
yourself, or you'll be destroyed.

1030
01:38:06,754 --> 01:38:09,746
What's the sense of fighting a war
if you can't yell for what's right?

1031
01:38:09,914 --> 01:38:12,587
How can you be so damn sure
you know what's right?

1032
01:38:13,194 --> 01:38:16,630
I'm not sure. But I'm gonna
do something, even if it's wrong.

1033
01:38:19,874 --> 01:38:23,264
You know this war seems
to go on forever.

1034
01:38:23,514 --> 01:38:26,665
The longer it lasts, the smaller
my loyalties seem to get.

1035
01:38:29,074 --> 01:38:33,033
We've been together
for what seems like a lifetime.

1036
01:38:34,954 --> 01:38:38,663
Despite your hard and thorny nature,
I rather like you.

1037
01:38:39,394 --> 01:38:41,271
And I don't want to lose you now.

1038
01:38:50,794 --> 01:38:54,423
Travis! Travis! Ringa!

1039
01:38:58,514 --> 01:39:00,152
Travis!

1040
01:39:35,674 --> 01:39:37,869
Execute the prisoners, Ringa.

1041
01:39:38,034 --> 01:39:40,070
Shoot them all, right now.

1042
01:39:40,234 --> 01:39:43,226
Lay them out in a line
so the rest of these rats can see.

1043
01:39:52,154 --> 01:39:54,224
Message to Parkson.

1044
01:39:57,594 --> 01:40:01,792
To Parkson for Chongqing:
"Go to hell."

1045
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:07,827
To Parkson for headquarters, CBl:
"Go to hell."

1046
01:40:07,994 --> 01:40:11,873
To Parkson for Parkson,
if he goes along: "Go to hell."

1047
01:40:12,954 --> 01:40:14,307
Now, move.

1048
01:40:15,354 --> 01:40:17,424
Move it, Norby!

1049
01:40:51,314 --> 01:40:53,430
Your plane's ready, boss.

1050
01:40:56,834 --> 01:40:59,348
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
bad-news you, Jim.

1051
01:40:59,514 --> 01:41:01,823
This is not a particularly good time
to do it.

1052
01:41:01,994 --> 01:41:04,303
In this lash-up, one time's as bad
as the next.

1053
01:41:04,474 --> 01:41:07,910
- Someone's gonna have to run the outfit.
- Ringa?

1054
01:41:08,074 --> 01:41:10,110
I'm gonna jump him over you.

1055
01:41:11,354 --> 01:41:14,107
I was afraid you were
gonna take me off the squawk box.

1056
01:41:14,274 --> 01:41:16,469
Nothing as drastic as that.

1057
01:41:17,594 --> 01:41:20,062
Keep your glasses clean, junior.

1058
01:41:21,794 --> 01:41:24,467
I'm giving you a field commission.
Second lieutenant.

1059
01:41:24,634 --> 01:41:27,307
You let it change your ways
and you're a damn fool.

1060
01:41:29,114 --> 01:41:30,513
Yeah.

1061
01:41:31,354 --> 01:41:34,027
Meat-headed second lieutenant.

1062
01:41:34,194 --> 01:41:37,743
William Lewis Ringa. A gentleman.

1063
01:41:38,754 --> 01:41:41,393
By act of Congress.

1064
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:43,988
I'm just sorry it had to happen
this way.

1065
01:41:44,154 --> 01:41:48,625
But I'll tell you one thing.
I'd give you the shirt off my back.

1066
01:41:49,114 --> 01:41:51,582
You already did, remember?

1067
01:42:28,154 --> 01:42:30,827
This is one of our general
staff bungalows, sir.

1068
01:42:30,994 --> 01:42:33,906
The colonel said you're to consider
yourself under arrest.

1069
01:42:34,074 --> 01:42:36,349
Confined to quarters here,
the colonel said.

1070
01:42:36,514 --> 01:42:38,470
I can imagine what the colonel said.

1071
01:42:38,634 --> 01:42:40,625
May I go on, sir?

1072
01:42:41,114 --> 01:42:44,993
The colonel said he'll come
to see you. It won't be too long.

1073
01:42:45,154 --> 01:42:48,783
You have a visitor.
Your first and last, the colonel said.

1074
01:43:12,234 --> 01:43:14,873
I know why you are here, Tom.

1075
01:43:15,154 --> 01:43:19,944
I know how serious the charges are,
and what the penalty can be.

1076
01:43:22,394 --> 01:43:24,749
You seem pretty well-informed.

1077
01:43:25,754 --> 01:43:27,506
Nikko?

1078
01:43:28,074 --> 01:43:31,544
Tom, from what I've said to you...

1079
01:43:31,714 --> 01:43:34,990
...the way I've acted, and the people
you've seen me with...

1080
01:43:35,154 --> 01:43:39,670
...you should know that Nikko and I
are close to high authority.

1081
01:43:41,154 --> 01:43:43,509
I've never had any doubt.

1082
01:43:43,674 --> 01:43:47,508
He's with Allied Intelligence,
and I worked with him.

1083
01:43:49,034 --> 01:43:53,312
You acted the fool by trying to be noble
the last time we were together.

1084
01:43:53,474 --> 01:43:57,308
You mustn't be foolish now
or you'll be charged with murder.

1085
01:43:57,474 --> 01:44:00,625
Or they can certify you insane, or...

1086
01:44:03,434 --> 01:44:05,584
I couldn't stand that.

1087
01:44:10,594 --> 01:44:12,346
Funny thing.

1088
01:44:14,554 --> 01:44:17,068
I thought it was all over between us.

1089
01:44:18,554 --> 01:44:20,863
It's not all over between us, Tom.

1090
01:44:21,034 --> 01:44:26,392
It will never be. I want you,
not the medals of a hero.

1091
01:44:26,554 --> 01:44:28,749
What you did was right.

1092
01:44:28,994 --> 01:44:33,067
You must make them understand
you were suffering from battle fatigue.

1093
01:44:33,594 --> 01:44:36,506
You must make them realize this.

1094
01:44:36,674 --> 01:44:39,108
You've got to tell them, Tom.

1095
01:44:42,754 --> 01:44:44,984
I can't tell them, carla.

1096
01:44:45,994 --> 01:44:47,347
I can't.

1097
01:45:39,994 --> 01:45:41,109
At ease, Reynolds.

1098
01:45:41,274 --> 01:45:43,185
You might get an infection.

1099
01:45:43,354 --> 01:45:45,743
Not after I soak them in this stuff.

1100
01:45:46,554 --> 01:45:48,431
This is General Sloan.

1101
01:45:48,594 --> 01:45:51,188
The general's out of headquarters
in Washington.

1102
01:45:53,354 --> 01:45:55,151
You like a drink, general?

1103
01:45:55,314 --> 01:45:59,353
Thanks, Reynolds. I'd like one.
The colonel would like one too.

1104
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:07,393
Thanks.

1105
01:46:20,274 --> 01:46:22,071
Well, Reynolds...

1106
01:46:27,434 --> 01:46:29,709
...Iooks like you really did it.

1107
01:46:38,074 --> 01:46:41,703
This is one of the warrants from
Chongqing that I picked up.

1108
01:46:42,234 --> 01:46:45,431
This is my answer to anything
you people have to say.

1109
01:46:46,074 --> 01:46:48,952
Those documents
were ordered destroyed.

1110
01:46:49,674 --> 01:46:54,065
Have you any idea of the far-flung
complications that you have provoked?

1111
01:46:55,274 --> 01:46:59,506
The drastic effect it has on
American-Chinese relation?

1112
01:47:02,554 --> 01:47:05,227
General, I know a little something
about you.

1113
01:47:05,594 --> 01:47:08,427
You were a Medal of Honor winner
in the First World War.

1114
01:47:08,594 --> 01:47:11,472
Self-made millionaire in civilian life.

1115
01:47:11,874 --> 01:47:15,992
In both areas, your exploits are, what
they say in the comic books, a legend.

1116
01:47:19,474 --> 01:47:23,990
I expected something different from you,
instead of the usual old hogwash.

1117
01:47:24,154 --> 01:47:27,112
Like to say one thing, general,
before we go any further.

1118
01:47:27,474 --> 01:47:29,704
Captain Reynolds has had
a hard tour of duty.

1119
01:47:29,874 --> 01:47:31,193
Too much for any one man.

1120
01:47:31,354 --> 01:47:34,505
Butt out, Fred! I don't need
a public defender.

1121
01:47:34,674 --> 01:47:37,347
I'm here to nail down
a few things myself.

1122
01:47:38,074 --> 01:47:40,190
The hell you are.

1123
01:47:41,834 --> 01:47:46,669
You're here to hang, unless you
come up with the right answers.

1124
01:47:47,034 --> 01:47:50,344
Over there in the main house
is General Chao...

1125
01:47:50,514 --> 01:47:54,223
...official representative
of the Chinese government.

1126
01:47:54,394 --> 01:47:57,591
He's patiently waiting
for your personal apology.

1127
01:48:02,234 --> 01:48:06,705
I'll stand trial. I'll resign my commission.
But I will not apologize.

1128
01:48:07,994 --> 01:48:10,303
Suppose we confiscate this document.

1129
01:48:10,474 --> 01:48:11,953
I couldn't stop you.

1130
01:48:12,114 --> 01:48:15,584
Except I got a couple of them
stashed away in safe places.

1131
01:48:17,034 --> 01:48:19,070
Fairly tricky.

1132
01:48:19,554 --> 01:48:22,227
But you don't know
what genuine trickiness is.

1133
01:48:22,914 --> 01:48:25,428
I've got a couple of tricksters.

1134
01:48:25,594 --> 01:48:30,952
Real star-spangled-banner, hell-for-leather
tricksters, right outside that door.

1135
01:48:32,154 --> 01:48:36,306
An investigating team
from headquarters, CBI.

1136
01:48:36,474 --> 01:48:39,591
They're panting to chew you up.

1137
01:48:40,074 --> 01:48:43,464
I only hope I don't have to use them.

1138
01:48:51,834 --> 01:48:57,192
I've just seen 34 American GI's with
their heads blown off by Chinese troops.

1139
01:48:59,994 --> 01:49:01,222
And I wanna know why.

1140
01:49:06,834 --> 01:49:08,108
This is sickening.

1141
01:49:10,034 --> 01:49:15,506
Doesn't it strike you that your actions
were, to say the least, unprecedented?

1142
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:19,667
Doesn't it strike you that we're fighting
a rather unprecedented kind of war?

1143
01:49:21,114 --> 01:49:23,264
Isn't that right, general?

1144
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:28,103
Well, it has its bad moments.
But in the long run...

1145
01:49:28,274 --> 01:49:31,710
I don't give a damn about the long run
if it adds up to this.

1146
01:49:31,874 --> 01:49:33,705
You can't deny what's been going on.

1147
01:49:33,874 --> 01:49:36,593
What will continue unless
something's done about it.

1148
01:49:37,274 --> 01:49:39,868
I know I'm right about this.

1149
01:49:40,314 --> 01:49:42,623
And if you don't know it, I pity you.

1150
01:50:07,554 --> 01:50:10,705
Colonel Reed, Captain Alofson.

1151
01:50:17,794 --> 01:50:18,863
Drink?

1152
01:50:20,394 --> 01:50:22,350
Proceed, doctor.

1153
01:50:25,114 --> 01:50:27,423
No, not while you're in the room,
colonel.

1154
01:50:27,874 --> 01:50:31,662
Doctor, you know the regulations.
I've a right to a private examination.

1155
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:34,712
Particularly since every
blood-sucking politician...

1156
01:50:34,874 --> 01:50:38,025
...in the CBI is looking to snap me
out on a Section Eight.

1157
01:50:38,394 --> 01:50:40,112
Who said you were to be examined?

1158
01:50:40,274 --> 01:50:43,630
I didn't say that anyone said it,
did I, colonel?

1159
01:50:43,794 --> 01:50:47,389
Reynolds, you're in a sling. According
to your 201 File, your actions...

1160
01:50:47,554 --> 01:50:51,024
...have for some time refuted your
psychological fitness for command.

1161
01:50:51,674 --> 01:50:54,711
You should have my problems, colonel.
You really should.

1162
01:50:56,474 --> 01:50:57,827
Proceed, doctor.

1163
01:51:01,674 --> 01:51:04,472
You got a very neurotic friend there,
doc.

1164
01:51:07,634 --> 01:51:10,626
That's all that's left of
the 34 men we found.

1165
01:51:11,234 --> 01:51:13,429
Reynolds, I've got to examine you.

1166
01:51:13,594 --> 01:51:16,472
Okay. Mind if I smoke?

1167
01:51:16,634 --> 01:51:19,467
Supposing I said
I wished you wouldn't?

1168
01:51:20,154 --> 01:51:22,873
If you gave me a good reason,
I probably wouldn't.

1169
01:51:23,034 --> 01:51:25,912
But seeing as how you don't
outrank me, I think I will.

1170
01:51:26,074 --> 01:51:29,783
- That's a specific, logical answer.
- Thank you, doc.

1171
01:51:30,794 --> 01:51:34,230
About your 201 File...

1172
01:51:35,354 --> 01:51:39,313
...I guess we both know what
Colonel Reed had reference to.

1173
01:51:40,154 --> 01:51:41,712
For instance?

1174
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:45,751
For instance...

1175
01:51:47,034 --> 01:51:50,868
...your killing one of
your own men. Kachin.

1176
01:51:53,274 --> 01:51:55,026
I had to put him out of his misery.

1177
01:51:55,194 --> 01:51:58,231
We had no morphine. He couldn't
be saved. We had no doctor.

1178
01:51:58,394 --> 01:52:01,511
Without a doctor, how do you know
he couldn't have been saved?

1179
01:52:01,674 --> 01:52:05,872
I've seen a lot of bad belly wounds, doc.
This one was one of the worst.

1180
01:52:07,114 --> 01:52:08,513
What else?

1181
01:52:13,314 --> 01:52:15,908
You challenged the authority
of an Army physician...

1182
01:52:16,114 --> 01:52:18,947
...in his own hospital.
In his report to headquarters...

1183
01:52:22,514 --> 01:52:25,586
Man, they really stack the deck,
don't they?

1184
01:52:27,474 --> 01:52:31,513
About the Ubachi strike,
where you lost so many troops...

1185
01:52:32,514 --> 01:52:35,153
...would you say you were
under stress at the time?

1186
01:52:35,314 --> 01:52:36,588
Yeah, I think so.

1187
01:52:36,754 --> 01:52:42,465
Would you say that your subsequent
action in attacking the bandits...

1188
01:52:42,634 --> 01:52:44,909
...was influenced by the same kind
of stress?

1189
01:52:45,354 --> 01:52:49,188
No, doc, I knew exactly
what I was doing.

1190
01:52:50,954 --> 01:52:53,514
Chongqing is most understanding.

1191
01:52:53,674 --> 01:52:55,187
If Captain Reynolds is sick...

1192
01:52:55,354 --> 01:52:58,983
...and hospitalized, my government
will be satisfied.

1193
01:52:59,154 --> 01:53:03,670
Nevertheless, he must apologize
for his absurd charges.

1194
01:53:03,834 --> 01:53:06,632
Without an apology,
Chongqing would suffer...

1195
01:53:06,794 --> 01:53:11,822
...what many Orientals
characterize as a severe loss of face.

1196
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:16,226
As an American, I must say I am
outraged at captain Reynolds' attitude.

1197
01:53:16,954 --> 01:53:18,433
Doctor?

1198
01:53:19,074 --> 01:53:22,384
It's advised that Reynolds be
sent to the American hospital...

1199
01:53:22,554 --> 01:53:24,784
...in Delhi for further observation.

1200
01:53:24,954 --> 01:53:30,153
Gentlemen, shall we take
first things first?

1201
01:53:34,274 --> 01:53:36,469
How about that?

1202
01:53:44,954 --> 01:53:47,707
Those warrants were ordered
destroyed.

1203
01:53:47,954 --> 01:53:52,630
Well, you see, sir, Captain Reynolds
has several more of those...

1204
01:53:52,794 --> 01:53:54,546
...safely hidden away.

1205
01:53:54,714 --> 01:53:57,228
I am sure they could be recovered...

1206
01:53:57,394 --> 01:54:02,070
...but what bothers me is, why were
they issued in the first place?

1207
01:54:03,194 --> 01:54:07,506
Are you questioning, sir, the judgment
of the Chongqing government?

1208
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:10,268
I'm questioning the use
of these warrants.

1209
01:54:10,434 --> 01:54:14,871
You see, sir, if there's nothing
wrong with them...

1210
01:54:15,034 --> 01:54:17,673
...why do you want them destroyed?

1211
01:54:17,834 --> 01:54:21,588
These warrants were issued to troops
of independent Chinese generals...

1212
01:54:21,754 --> 01:54:24,951
...whose integrity cannot be questioned.
- Warlords.

1213
01:54:25,114 --> 01:54:28,743
For the purpose of prosecuting
enemies of the Chinese Republic.

1214
01:54:28,914 --> 01:54:32,623
Americans were, as you say,
prosecuted.

1215
01:54:33,754 --> 01:54:36,905
We of the Chongqing government
have no proof of that.

1216
01:54:37,074 --> 01:54:39,793
You have the sworn deposition
of an American officer.

1217
01:54:39,954 --> 01:54:43,993
Whose qualifications have already
been confuted by his own superiors...

1218
01:54:44,154 --> 01:54:49,182
...and whose rebelliousness
I personally find unbearable.

1219
01:54:49,354 --> 01:54:52,664
I must insist on Reynolds' apology.

1220
01:54:52,834 --> 01:54:58,545
And I, sir, must insist that these
warrants were misused by a warlord...

1221
01:54:58,714 --> 01:55:01,911
...who took it upon himself
to kill Americans.

1222
01:55:02,234 --> 01:55:07,024
And it's his conduct that should be
examined, not Reynolds'.

1223
01:55:08,434 --> 01:55:12,632
The high command of the American and
Chinese should be made aware of that.

1224
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:19,712
So there will be no apology.
Certainly not by Captain Reynolds.

1225
01:55:19,874 --> 01:55:23,105
You see, this boy has influence
in Washington.

1226
01:55:23,274 --> 01:55:25,185
Influence? Who?

1227
01:55:26,234 --> 01:55:27,633
Me.

1228
01:55:30,154 --> 01:55:35,182
Colonel Reed, I think you
fiddle-fouled this whole detail.

1229
01:55:35,354 --> 01:55:38,232
You and Alofson both.

1230
01:55:38,714 --> 01:55:43,105
It seems to me that Captain Reynolds
is saner than either of you.

1231
01:55:43,274 --> 01:55:45,310
Is that what you would
have us report?

1232
01:55:45,474 --> 01:55:50,673
I'll do the reporting, to your government,
and to the Chongqing government.

1233
01:55:52,794 --> 01:55:56,150
Do you wish to speak further
with me on this?

1234
01:55:57,674 --> 01:56:00,950
In the words of an old hymn:

1235
01:56:02,154 --> 01:56:03,667
"You go to hell."

1236
01:56:17,234 --> 01:56:18,508
Sir.

1237
01:56:19,914 --> 01:56:21,267
Gentlemen.

1238
01:56:41,474 --> 01:56:45,433
As for you, I could pulverize you
on a hundred raps...

1239
01:56:45,594 --> 01:56:48,950
...and make them, each of them, stick.
Disobedience of orders.

1240
01:56:49,114 --> 01:56:50,149
Yes, sir.

1241
01:56:50,314 --> 01:56:53,226
Conduct of a nature to bring discredit
upon the military.

1242
01:56:53,394 --> 01:56:54,383
Yes, sir.

1243
01:56:54,554 --> 01:56:59,309
Use of provoking words and gestures
to an officer, disrespect towards same.

1244
01:56:59,474 --> 01:57:00,463
Yes, sir.

1245
01:57:00,634 --> 01:57:03,626
Conduct against the prejudice
of good order and discipline.

1246
01:57:03,794 --> 01:57:06,228
Colonel, you got any more
of that foot wash?

1247
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:07,668
Yes, sir.

1248
01:57:07,834 --> 01:57:11,429
Conduct unbecoming an officer
and a what-do-you-call-it.

1249
01:57:11,594 --> 01:57:12,947
Yes, sir.

1250
01:57:15,754 --> 01:57:20,145
Now, may I say that I owe you
a debt of gratitude.

1251
01:57:21,194 --> 01:57:24,823
Perhaps you're not aware of the fact
that I got my Medal of Honor...

1252
01:57:24,994 --> 01:57:28,145
...for disobeying orders.
- No, sir.

1253
01:57:29,634 --> 01:57:33,229
I'd forgotten how fine it feels
to do what you think is right...

1254
01:57:33,394 --> 01:57:35,988
...regardless of the consequences.

1255
01:57:36,154 --> 01:57:39,385
I think there's one more thing
you should know.

1256
01:57:39,554 --> 01:57:44,674
"The chongqing government sincerely
deplores the actions of renegade bandits.

1257
01:57:44,834 --> 01:57:49,430
Possession and misuse of warrants
issued by the Republic of China...

1258
01:57:49,594 --> 01:57:52,711
...are being investigated
by proper authority.

1259
01:57:52,874 --> 01:57:57,026
Our wish Captain Reynolds be
exonerated of all charges immediately.

1260
01:57:57,194 --> 01:57:59,833
Signed, chiang Kai-shek."

1261
01:58:01,914 --> 01:58:07,511
Well, I guess the generalissimo
needed a little time to think things out...

1262
01:58:07,674 --> 01:58:09,904
...like the rest of us mortals.

1263
01:58:12,834 --> 01:58:15,667
I'll have an airplane
take you back to your Kachins.

1264
01:58:15,994 --> 01:58:18,428
I guess congratulations are in order,
all around.

1265
01:58:18,594 --> 01:58:19,822
Yes, sir.

1266
01:58:44,834 --> 01:58:48,588
I want our house painted white,
with blue curtains.

1267
01:58:48,754 --> 01:58:52,303
I want brass candlesticks
and a clock on the mantel.

1268
01:58:52,474 --> 01:58:56,069
And I want a little rocking chair
for the baby's room.

1269
01:58:57,034 --> 01:58:58,547
Already it starts.

1270
01:58:59,514 --> 01:59:02,745
We have to hold our head up
in the neighborhood, don't we?

1271
01:59:03,674 --> 01:59:06,142
Anything you say, <i>cara mia.</i>

1272
