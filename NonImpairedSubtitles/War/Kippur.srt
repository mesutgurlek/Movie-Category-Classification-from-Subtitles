1
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:57,261
Looks like Dayan and Golda
underestimated them.

2
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:03,780
l could do without neighbors
like that, anyway.

3
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,581
They're craftier than one thinks.

4
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:11,855
Why?

5
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,892
A surprise attack on Yom Kippur?

6
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,662
Nobody expected that.

7
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:26,501
What's wrong with this car?
Can't it go faster?

8
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:30,621
We should've taken my bike.

9
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,739
No, a helicopter!

10
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:38,340
Listen, Weinraub, this is war.
Real war!

11
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:42,014
And this time it's ours.
We're the right age!

12
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,657
Drive, man, drive!

13
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:13,651
You stressed out?

14
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:29,462
l only buy second hand cars.
On principle.

15
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,295
Because they're cheaper?

16
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:33,502
That's not it.

17
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:37,737
A car is for carrying people.
Not to show social status.

18
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:45,740
You should read Marcuse.
''One-Dimensional Man''.

19
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,775
lt'd make you think.

20
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:03,456
Forget Marcuse.
You just don't like new cars.

21
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:08,012
No.

22
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,977
We're all conned into buying

23
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,338
the latest model.

24
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:21,212
Marcuse says if we changed
our consumer habits,

25
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:23,618
this'd be a better world,

26
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:27,902
and if we got rid of advertising,

27
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:32,978
we'd be less alienated
by things we don't need.

28
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,338
Drop Marcuse.
Drive! There's a war on!

29
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:31,173
Close your door!

30
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:37,820
Get on the side!

31
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,901
Let us through!

32
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:47,613
Move!

33
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:04,059
Watch out!

34
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,661
Where are you headed?

35
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:34,375
- What's going on?
- You can't get through. Road's blocked!

36
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:35,458
OK.

37
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,972
- You won't get through.
- We will!

38
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,135
Come forward!

39
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:03,337
Come on, let us through!

40
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:28,820
Move over!
What's going on?

41
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:32,697
What are you doing here?
Turn around! Get out!

42
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:33,858
The Syrians are coming!

43
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:37,581
- Move on!
- To go where?

44
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:39,615
Go back to Metulla!

45
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:40,971
We have to go to Kuneitra.

46
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:45,733
- Are our troops firing?
- Shut up! Turn around.

47
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,022
Get going!

48
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:50,582
Why Metulla?

49
00:17:58,663 --> 00:17:59,982
Where do we go?

50
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:05,657
Go to Metulla!
Get out of here fast!

51
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:15,821
What's going on?

52
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:36,138
l don't get it.

53
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,935
- What's going on?
- Leave! The Syrians are here!

54
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:54,942
Where you going?

55
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:46,332
This silence is weird.
l thought we were at war.

56
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,821
Our unit has left.
There isn't even a sentry.

57
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,541
l'm starving.

58
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:08,058
This is better
than being in your Fiat.

59
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,096
Complain!

60
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,261
l pick you up,

61
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:16,062
drive you straight to the front

62
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:18,094
and you still complain!

63
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:23,101
They've all gone.
l never chased anyone this hard!

64
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:28,057
We don't have
to report to our unit.

65
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:32,059
We really don't have to.

66
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:35,979
l'd rather be with them.
But if we can't find them...

67
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:37,742
Too bad.

68
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,255
Let's try something else.

69
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:43,941
Listen...

70
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:47,782
Tanks are cramped.

71
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:51,896
They're slow and you're stuck
with 4 guys, swallowing dust.

72
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,253
You can't even piss
when you want to.

73
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:55,856
Get it?

74
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,895
Forget tanks.

75
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,737
The Air Force
is a bit better organized.

76
00:21:14,263 --> 00:21:16,731
Let's join
an airborne rescue unit.

77
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,896
Helicopters!

78
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:23,622
lt's not right.

79
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:26,339
We'd only see the war
from up high.

80
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,855
This silence is strange.

81
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:45,742
- Hi, l'm Keren. He's Oren.
- Hi.

82
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:50,653
Hi Keren, Oren.
You missed your train?

83
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,461
Wake up.
You're not on vacation.

84
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:57,502
This is a military base.
You forget, there's a war on?

85
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:01,059
- l was taking a shower.
- l hope the water was hot!

86
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:04,375
- You, Oren, get to your post!
- Yes, Lt.

87
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:11,415
Officers!

88
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:27,694
Wait for me in the Jeep!

89
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:30,777
Sorry. We were stuck
in a traffic jam at Rosh Pina.

90
00:22:30,903 --> 00:22:34,100
We're looking for our unit.
We met back there,

91
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,339
- and you sent us here.
- What happened back there?

92
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:39,532
Wake up, kids.
There's a war on.

93
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:41,893
l have news for you.
Your unit has left.

94
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:44,139
- l'll take you in mine.
- What?

95
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,742
l said in mine.

96
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:48,502
We'll show those dumb Arabs!

97
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:50,574
They didn't learn from the other wars.

98
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:54,531
ln 2 days we'll be in Damascus.
We'll destroy them!

99
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,819
Ginger, l need men like you.

100
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,501
Get your kit. And come back.

101
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:01,660
You, pal, get a haircut! And fast!

102
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:05,260
Cleaned your weapons? Answer me!

103
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:08,659
l want no surprises.
This isn't a game now.

104
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:11,820
Give him two towels,
in case he finds a shower...

105
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:14,656
Wake up, guys. Move it!

106
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:16,421
We're at war now!

107
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:19,180
Miss your mom already?

108
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:20,702
Get dressed fast!

109
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:22,017
Move it!

110
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,335
No smoking here!

111
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,181
Take off that hat! Make it snappy!

112
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:38,782
Can l have a sleeping bag?

113
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:41,775
- Got everything?
- Yes.

114
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:46,334
- We have to report to that officer!
- l don't trust him.

115
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:47,812
Why?

116
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:51,572
You want to follow him,
charging to Damascus in 2 days?

117
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:54,972
Forget it!

118
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,540
We have to find the others.

119
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,814
We'll load our kit in the car and go.

120
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:55,653
l'm Klauzner, an Air Force doctor.

121
00:25:55,783 --> 00:25:57,614
l'm headed for Ramat David,

122
00:25:57,743 --> 00:25:59,096
to the airbase.

123
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:10,256
l've been here all night.
My car broke down.

124
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:16,460
There are dead and wounded.
l'm urgently needed.

125
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:20,977
We're looking for our unit.

126
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:24,937
Ramat David is over there.
and the war's over there.

127
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,860
Yes, but it's urgent.

128
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:29,662
lt's urgent. l must get there.

129
00:26:33,063 --> 00:26:34,701
He wants to go to Ramat David.

130
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:39,342
What do you say?

131
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,093
All right.

132
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:46,299
lt's fine with us.

133
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,895
Thanks a lot. l'll get my things.

134
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:27,658
Let's try and organize this mess.

135
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:29,421
We'll divide up into teams.

136
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:31,181
A pilot, a co-pilot, a mechanic,

137
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:36,138
a doctor if one's needed,
medics, soldiers...

138
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:38,100
What's important...

139
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:48,652
Hi, doctor.

140
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:50,622
Hi, Noah.

141
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:53,416
- Gadassi, fill me in.
- They're new boys.

142
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,813
Hi. Who are you?

143
00:28:56,543 --> 00:29:01,617
Lt. Ruso, Sgt. Weinraub.
We lost our unit.

144
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:03,461
We met the doctor...

145
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:07,501
and here we are.

146
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:08,499
Sit down.

147
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:11,015
l'll start over.

148
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:15,659
We're briefing people.
To my right, Major Noah,

149
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:17,455
who's in charge of the rescue unit.

150
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,541
l'm Capt. Yoram, helicopter pilot.

151
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:22,898
We're trying to organize this mess.

152
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:24,661
And it's quite a mess.

153
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:28,173
Our unit has two essential duties:

154
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:32,535
evacuating the wounded
and recovering shot down pilots.

155
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:37,340
When we're recovering pilots,
we may be under enemy fire.

156
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:40,583
Don't forget that.
lt's important.

157
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:42,659
We'll fly our missions
in a Bell helicopter.

158
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,136
There's 6 on the base.

159
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:47,733
ln an emergency,
we'll be backed by Sikorskys.

160
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:50,178
They enable us to evacuate
up to 30 casualties.

161
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:53,176
The situation at the front
is complex.

162
00:29:53,303 --> 00:29:54,816
We've had heavy losses.

163
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:59,061
Visibility is bad, we can't fly.

164
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:03,175
Lt. Ruso, you're in charge
of the combat teams.

165
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:07,496
lf you've got anything
to say to your men, say it now.

166
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:14,771
He and l have been trained
for missions like this.

167
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:16,382
lf we have the doc with us,

168
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:18,181
and maybe one other soldier,

169
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:20,612
we can be operational in an hour.

170
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:25,215
We can discuss the assignments,
the teams etc.

171
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:27,413
after this briefing.

172
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:32,178
lf you have any questions,
this is my team:

173
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:33,777
Kobi,

174
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:37,339
Lt. Kobi, co-pilot,

175
00:30:38,143 --> 00:30:39,781
Kauchinski,

176
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:43,738
Shlomo Kauchinski, airborne mechanic.

177
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:48,896
That's all.
Noah, got anything to add?

178
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:52,658
That's enough words.
There's work to do.

179
00:30:52,783 --> 00:30:56,173
l wish you good luck. Dismissed.

180
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,660
Evacuate him.

181
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:15,293
That one, too.

182
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:21,621
Where's the doctor?

183
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,616
Evacuate him.

184
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:35,657
Weinraub, wait for the doctor.

185
00:32:35,863 --> 00:32:37,342
Go on, move.

186
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:43,535
Another one! Look, doctor.
They're all dead here.

187
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:47,298
- We have to evacuate them, doctor.
- There's nothing to evacuate.

188
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:52,414
- Evacuate him!
- No point, he's dead.

189
00:32:59,703 --> 00:33:01,375
Move him away.

190
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:11,460
- Evacuate him!
- No, don't!

191
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,381
Go on, Gadassi, follow him.

192
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:38,016
Keep your heads down!

193
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:39,732
Run!

194
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,136
Follow him.

195
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:47,012
Klauzner, go on, run!
Weinraub, your turn!

196
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:04,854
Where's the field hospital?

197
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:05,938
Over there!

198
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:10,136
- We've got to get there.
- Show me where.

199
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:13,582
- Behind the eucalyptus tree.
- By the truck?

200
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:15,898
Weinraub, check out the gate!

201
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:24,738
Form two groups.
You and the pilot, that way,

202
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:26,660
Klauzner and Gadassi with me.

203
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:28,342
Go!

204
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,939
We're close. Weinraub, go look!

205
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:54,821
lt's all clear.

206
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:58,175
l'll go. Stay behind me!

207
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:13,376
You see anything?

208
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,811
Get down!

209
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:23,019
Gadassi, stay with Klauzner.

210
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:51,542
Doctor, how many casualties you got?

211
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:59,454
Get the kit!
We have to intubate him.

212
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:01,540
Keep giving him mouth-to-mouth.

213
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:04,542
Klauzner, the unit doctor's here.

214
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:07,897
Change his bandages.

215
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:12,579
- l've got 7 casualties.
- Who do we evacuate, doc?

216
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:18,382
l've got one amputee.

217
00:41:18,503 --> 00:41:19,982
He's severely wounded.

218
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:22,339
Take him before he dies.

219
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:28,182
l've got one severely burnt,
another there.

220
00:41:28,503 --> 00:41:31,415
He's the amputee, evacuate him.

221
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:34,660
And those 5, too.

222
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,013
Not him, l said!
Take one serious casualty! Hurry!

223
00:41:37,143 --> 00:41:38,861
Put him down!

224
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:43,494
Ruso! Get him out in a hurry!

225
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:45,215
Watch his head.

226
00:41:45,343 --> 00:41:46,662
Raise him!

227
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:52,061
Turn him around!

228
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:56,093
Easy does it, watch out!

229
00:41:56,863 --> 00:41:59,935
l've got another 5 light casualties

230
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,416
unfit for combat.

231
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:06,375
- Not the light casualties.
- There's more all the time.

232
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:11,382
Prepare 4 serious ones,
there's no room for more.

233
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:13,261
Shut up, that's an order!

234
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:19,816
- Who do we take?
- Him, him and him.

235
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:22,979
Hurry up!

236
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:47,381
Come back, l've got more casualties.
Come back fast!

237
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,934
Can l bum a cigarette, doc?

238
00:51:13,783 --> 00:51:15,296
Sure, here.

239
00:51:18,023 --> 00:51:19,138
Thanks.

240
00:51:22,943 --> 00:51:24,376
You don't look good.

241
00:51:26,343 --> 00:51:28,811
These are tough days for everyone.

242
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:36,699
You lose your sense of time.

243
00:51:36,823 --> 00:51:40,862
Each day lasts a century.

244
00:51:42,383 --> 00:51:44,658
Today, we lost 4 Phantoms.

245
00:51:46,143 --> 00:51:49,260
We've had heavy losses
from the start.

246
00:51:50,743 --> 00:51:53,018
Three pilots were killed.

247
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:56,298
A fourth is missing.

248
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,818
A childhood friend of mine.

249
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:01,895
l'm sorry. The truth is...

250
00:52:03,503 --> 00:52:05,494
This time it's going badly.

251
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:09,218
l try not to think of it.

252
00:52:14,383 --> 00:52:16,135
Were you in the war of 1967?

253
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,412
The last two days,
l was sent into the Sinai.

254
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:23,217
But those were different times.

255
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:29,900
There was a kind of euphoria,
a victory euphoria.

256
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:33,016
Sure we had losses,
but nothing like this.

257
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:37,213
At the time l was in Belgium,
in a hospital.

258
00:52:40,263 --> 00:52:43,573
To me, a casualty's a casualty,

259
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,694
whatever the war.

260
00:52:47,383 --> 00:52:50,056
For me the war,
is getting them back home.

261
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:54,258
Didn't you want to be
a fighter pilot?

262
00:52:55,063 --> 00:52:59,739
No, my father and brother
both were.

263
00:53:00,703 --> 00:53:05,572
lt's a family tradition
to be a pilot, to serve.

264
00:53:06,863 --> 00:53:12,415
But you need an instinct
that l don't have.

265
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:16,172
l don't get it, what instinct?

266
00:53:16,703 --> 00:53:21,015
l can't explain it.
A hunter's instinct.

267
00:53:23,063 --> 00:53:27,022
A hunter's instinct?
What does that mean?

268
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,459
The killer instinct.

269
00:53:32,103 --> 00:53:35,300
That's what you need
to be a fighter pilot?

270
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:40,141
ln my home they say
the most dangerous thing

271
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,731
is to be one of the 3 worst pilots,

272
00:53:42,863 --> 00:53:45,502
or one of the 3 best.

273
00:53:46,063 --> 00:53:47,542
The 3 worst, you can see why.

274
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:53,932
As for the best,
they start to get careless.

275
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:04,502
Got any news about your friend?
Did he make it back?

276
00:54:04,903 --> 00:54:06,495
We don't know.

277
00:54:08,503 --> 00:54:10,892
Either he's a prisoner in Damascus...

278
00:54:11,743 --> 00:54:12,858
Or...?

279
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,335
Or he isn't.

280
00:55:17,543 --> 00:55:19,693
There's interesting stuff
in the paper.

281
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:21,537
Like what?

282
00:55:22,383 --> 00:55:24,180
Look at the headline in ''Ha'aretz''.

283
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:31,095
l don't read the papers,

284
00:55:32,423 --> 00:55:34,175
l just look at the photos.

285
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:41,373
''An important news item:
due to the state of emergency,

286
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:44,620
''fewer carbonated drinks
will be distributed.''

287
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:49,342
How about that?

288
00:55:56,663 --> 00:56:00,975
''All pilgrimages to Jerusalem
and tours of the President's home

289
00:56:01,183 --> 00:56:02,855
''are postponed.''

290
00:56:03,223 --> 00:56:05,862
You saw the photo of the prisoner?

291
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:09,661
The Syrian prisoner.

292
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:12,455
- On the Golan?
- Yes.

293
00:56:29,463 --> 00:56:30,816
Listen to this.

294
00:56:34,263 --> 00:56:36,777
''The University of the Negev
informs all its students

295

''that all convocations

296
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:44,859

297

299
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:57,101
- Hand me your tobacco, doctor.
- Here, help yourself.

300
00:57:57,783 --> 00:57:59,057
Thanks.

301
00:58:17,503 --> 00:58:19,539
They're tough to roll.

302
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,340
Give it to me, l'll help you.

303
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:33,660
Don't feel too lonely?

304
00:58:34,863 --> 00:58:39,459
My Belgian grandpa rolled 'em
one-handed in the dark.

305
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,301
Your grandfather was Belgian?

306
00:58:41,743 --> 00:58:44,177
- Mine was a banker in Milan.
- ln Milan?

307
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:46,612
Yes. l thought you were Polish.

308
00:58:46,743 --> 00:58:48,893
l'm half Belgian, half Polish.

309
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:55,139
My mother fled the Nazis in Poland.
l was 2 years old.

310
00:58:57,623 --> 00:58:59,659
We escaped to Belgium, to Brussels.

311
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:01,899
They caught her there.
Before she was arrested

312
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:04,776
and sent to a camp, she entrusted me

313
00:59:04,903 --> 00:59:06,814
to my adoptive family.

314
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:12,419
l grew up there.
l never knew l was Jewish.

315
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,701
There you are.

316
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,177
Need a light?

317
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,817
Poor thing, when she returned
from the camp, she looked for me.

318
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:35,012
When she found me, l didn't know her.
My own mom.

319
00:59:35,143 --> 00:59:38,738
l didn't want to go with her,
so l stayed there.

320
00:59:41,223 --> 00:59:43,737
And grew up in Belgium.

321
00:59:44,423 --> 00:59:46,095
What happened to your mother?

322
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:53,299
She died six months later,

323
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:57,143
of a broken heart, it seems.

324
01:00:03,623 --> 01:00:05,295
lt's strange.

325
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:09,860
l wanted to say how much
l miss my girlfriend,

326
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:13,374
and you tell me the story
of your mom and the Nazis.

327
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:25,016
At least you
miss someone who's alive.

328
01:00:28,423 --> 01:00:32,257
l don't know how you hold out.

329
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:38,533
This is hard for me. lf l'd known
l'd see people so badly hurt...

330
01:00:43,263 --> 01:00:46,061
Sometimes l think we're trying
to escape from something

331
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:48,492
that will happen anyway.

332
01:00:52,263 --> 01:00:54,458
But l've always felt
that something up there

333
01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:58,254
was smiling down at me...

334
01:01:10,303 --> 01:01:11,861
Are you scared?

335
01:01:14,823 --> 01:01:16,654
Scared of dying.

336
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,701
And tomorrow?

337
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:38,092
Like today. Same thing.

338
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:40,894
Just another day.

339
01:01:45,543 --> 01:01:47,693
Good night, doctor.

340
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:52,018
l'm going out for a breather.

341
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,776
Good night.

342
01:05:21,223 --> 01:05:23,054
Grab him, Gadassi.

343
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:25,011
l've got him.

344
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:32,501
- One moment, Gadassi.
- l won't move.

345
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:36,457
Wait!

346
01:05:50,543 --> 01:05:51,817
Over there.

347
01:06:40,303 --> 01:06:42,658
Put him down a moment.

348
01:07:03,943 --> 01:07:06,696
Wake him up.

349
01:07:09,543 --> 01:07:12,819
You can't stay here!

350
01:07:14,623 --> 01:07:16,261
Go on, lift him.

351
01:07:29,983 --> 01:07:32,213
On the floor, way in the back.

352
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:52,581
Ruso, the morphine!

353
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:55,575
Give him a shot.

354
01:08:40,423 --> 01:08:44,018
Stretchers, over here!

355
01:08:46,023 --> 01:08:47,615
Help me carry him.

356
01:09:12,263 --> 01:09:13,412
Wait!

357
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:17,742
l've got him.

358
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:26,255
On the other side.

359
01:09:45,863 --> 01:09:47,376
Hold him tight.

360
01:09:48,263 --> 01:09:50,219
Put him on the ground.

361
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:57,217
Hurry, doc, he's dying!

362
01:10:02,303 --> 01:10:04,976
l'm losing him, wait,
l'm losing him...

363
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,303
One second.

364
01:11:02,023 --> 01:11:03,820
Take him away.

365
01:11:04,063 --> 01:11:05,257
Where's the helicopter?

366
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:07,260
lt's a few minutes away.

367
01:11:07,383 --> 01:11:09,613
Hurry, we've got another one.

368
01:11:55,703 --> 01:11:57,614
Put him down!

369
01:11:57,743 --> 01:11:59,222
Gently.

370
01:12:03,263 --> 01:12:05,413
Klauzner, put him on an lV
and let's go.

371
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:13,891
Where's the helicopter?

372
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:16,378
- lt's beyond that hill.
- Gotcha.

373
01:12:42,383 --> 01:12:44,055
Raise him!

374
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:47,053
Put him on the side, Ruso.

375
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:55,932
What?

376
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:09,782
Come here a second.

377
01:15:20,303 --> 01:15:21,577
What?

378
01:15:23,623 --> 01:15:25,659
l dreamt that l was burning.

379
01:15:26,423 --> 01:15:27,902
You dreamt what?

380
01:15:29,383 --> 01:15:30,975
l was burning...

381
01:15:33,423 --> 01:15:34,981
in a tank.

382
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:45,135
Smoke everywhere...

383
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:54,537
and my shoes were on fire.

384
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,619
The hatch was jammed.

385
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:09,493
lt was a dream, don't think of it.

386
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:12,421
Go back to sleep.

387
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:18,334
You were already like that
when we were recruits.

388
01:16:21,663 --> 01:16:23,221
This is different.

389
01:16:27,023 --> 01:16:29,776
This time it was terrifying.
lt seemed real.

390
01:16:36,663 --> 01:16:38,176
l was scared.

391
01:16:39,103 --> 01:16:42,732
Calm down, Weinraub,
you're too edgy.

392
01:16:49,183 --> 01:16:51,936
lt's always the same with you.

393
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:58,253
You don't listen.
l tell you, this time it was real.

394
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:12,378
Nothing'll happen to you.

395
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:16,461
Don't forget,
we're in the same helicopter.

396
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:22,337
To hell with your dreams.
Let me sleep.

397
01:19:55,943 --> 01:19:58,503
You son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!

398
01:20:28,983 --> 01:20:30,780
My leg's stuck in the mud.

399
01:21:01,663 --> 01:21:03,301
We'll take him like that.

400
01:21:03,663 --> 01:21:05,972
Get him off me!

401
01:21:23,983 --> 01:21:26,417
- Help us, Gadassi.
- Grab a leg!

402
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,341
Fuckin' mud!

403
01:21:41,423 --> 01:21:44,495
Come here. Move with me.

404
01:22:47,183 --> 01:22:49,697
Go round the other side. Ready?

405
01:22:50,903 --> 01:22:53,258
No, let's raise him.

406
01:22:55,783 --> 01:22:58,456
- The stretcher!
- Get it!

407
01:23:47,463 --> 01:23:50,216
Klauzner, we'll wait for them here.

408
01:23:52,503 --> 01:23:55,097
Wait, l'm slipping...

409
01:24:04,063 --> 01:24:05,735
Get him out of the water.

410
01:24:13,863 --> 01:24:14,739
Get out a tourniquet!

411
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:18,571
Gadassi, come over.

412
01:24:19,303 --> 01:24:21,180
This earth...

413
01:24:25,903 --> 01:24:27,256
This shit...

414
01:24:27,383 --> 01:24:29,692
Get me out of this mud!

415
01:24:30,183 --> 01:24:32,174
What are we doing here?

416
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:40,936
Doctor, come dance with me.
Come dance...

417
01:24:44,823 --> 01:24:47,212
Come dance with me!

418
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:53,500
''Earth, earth...

419
01:24:53,623 --> 01:24:55,818
''Let me get off...''

420
01:24:56,303 --> 01:24:59,101
Doctor, deal with the casualty!

421
01:25:01,623 --> 01:25:03,261
Get me out of here!

422
01:25:10,383 --> 01:25:12,180
Go deal with the casualty!

423
01:25:12,343 --> 01:25:14,299
Calm down, Gadassi!

424
01:25:15,423 --> 01:25:18,062
lt's me, Klauzner. lt's me.

425
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:25,303
Take me in your arms,
Klauzner, hug me!

426
01:26:53,143 --> 01:26:54,337
One moment.

427
01:26:56,023 --> 01:26:58,218
- We've got to reach the chopper!
- Hand me the radio.

428
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,135
What's going on, doctor?

429
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,815
What happened to him?

430
01:27:24,703 --> 01:27:27,695
Ruso, we have to move.
We have to leave him here.

431
01:27:27,823 --> 01:27:29,575
We have no choice.

432
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:32,740
Grab all your men.
The chopper leaves in 5 minutes.

433
01:27:33,863 --> 01:27:37,219
Klauzner, is he alive?

434
01:27:38,903 --> 01:27:40,700
ls he dead?

435
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:43,781
We have to move, shape up!

436
01:27:44,103 --> 01:27:46,139
Leave him, guys. Move!

437
01:27:46,263 --> 01:27:48,697
Doctor, we don't have time.
We gotta go!

438
01:27:48,823 --> 01:27:51,018
Ruso, get your men and follow me.

439
01:27:53,983 --> 01:27:55,575
Come on, we've got no choice.

440
01:28:01,223 --> 01:28:05,057
Put him in the helicopter.
lt's empty isn't it?

441
01:28:05,183 --> 01:28:08,459
You don't load the dead
into a helicopter! You know that!

442
01:28:08,703 --> 01:28:11,171
- Let's go!
- But he's not dead.

443
01:28:11,303 --> 01:28:13,100
Help me. We'll put him
in the helicopter.

444
01:28:13,223 --> 01:28:14,975
Don't you understand?

445
01:28:15,303 --> 01:28:17,419
We don't take him, he's dead!

446
01:28:18,703 --> 01:28:20,375
Let's take him.

447
01:28:22,223 --> 01:28:25,693
We don't have time.
Leave him, you hear? We're going!

448
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,456
Kauchinski, follow me.

449
01:35:45,943 --> 01:35:49,094
Stand by for evacuation.
Keep his mouth open.

450
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:50,736
Open his mouth.

451
01:35:51,943 --> 01:35:53,854
Behind you, Gadassi!

452
01:36:02,943 --> 01:36:07,414
Ruso, put a tourniquet on him.

453
01:36:19,383 --> 01:36:21,817
Watch out for his leg!

454
01:36:25,343 --> 01:36:26,742
Hang on!

455
01:36:28,503 --> 01:36:30,255
Hold tight!

456
01:37:41,463 --> 01:37:43,294
Klauzner, his leg.

457
01:43:25,263 --> 01:43:27,254
They're the casualties
from the helicopter.

458
01:43:27,823 --> 01:43:30,018
He's seriously wounded.
A deep cut in the neck.

459
01:43:30,143 --> 01:43:31,701
Let me see.

460
01:43:32,943 --> 01:43:34,535
Shoulder wound.

461
01:43:36,023 --> 01:43:37,615

01:43:39,063 --> 01:43:40,860

463
01:43:44,263 --> 01:43:46,652
- Breathing difficulties.
- Breathe slowly.

464
01:43:54,423 --> 01:43:57,176
Put him on a respirator.
Drain the left lung,

465
01:43:57,343 --> 01:44:00,062

466
01:44:01,543 --> 01:44:02,453
Put him in intensive care.

467
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:04,335
Keep me posted.

468
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:23,416
One second. l won't hurt you.

469
01:44:24,703 --> 01:44:26,773
Put your head down.

470
01:44:27,023 --> 01:44:30,015
l won't touch anything, l promise.

471
01:44:30,343 --> 01:44:32,652
- Was the other leg hit?
- No.

472
01:44:34,303 --> 01:44:35,816
l'll just look.

473
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:38,856
Change the tourniquet.

474
01:44:39,183 --> 01:44:43,222
Artman 1000 plus 1000.
20 mg of Valium,

01:44:46,383 --> 01:44:48,499
To the orthopedic wing
for operation.

477
01:45:00,623 --> 01:45:03,456
Let's take a look...

478
01:45:03,783 --> 01:45:05,455
Yes, l see.

479
01:45:05,823 --> 01:45:07,336
Turn your head a bit.

480
01:45:13,143 --> 01:45:14,815
Open your eye.

481
01:45:16,303 --> 01:45:16,974
One second.

482
01:45:17,103 --> 01:45:18,297
OK, l saw it.

483
01:45:18,423 --> 01:45:20,493
Let me see the other one.

484
01:45:23,983 --> 01:45:25,939
Nurse. Wait..

485
01:45:26,063 --> 01:45:27,974
Don't move, l won't do anything.

486
01:45:30,703 --> 01:45:33,661
To neuro-surgery. Come this way.

487
01:45:45,543 --> 01:45:46,817
Hello,

488
01:45:47,543 --> 01:45:48,976
can you talk?

489
01:45:50,023 --> 01:45:51,741
Can you tell me what happened?

490
01:45:55,263 --> 01:46:00,383
Ruso has shrapnel
in the back of his head.

491
01:46:00,503 --> 01:46:03,813
So be careful.

492
01:46:05,703 --> 01:46:10,572
l couldn't intubate Kauchinski.

493
01:46:10,783 --> 01:46:14,253
lt was impossible.

494
01:46:15,663 --> 01:46:17,221
Are you the doctor?

495
01:46:19,423 --> 01:46:20,776

496
01:46:21,703 --> 01:46:23,295
Were you wounded?

497
01:46:24,183 --> 01:46:25,411
Me?

498
01:46:30,943 --> 01:46:33,935
l want to be with my mother...

499
01:46:37,623 --> 01:46:39,579
l'm sending you to X-rays.

500
01:46:41,063 --> 01:46:44,533
l won't let you talk,
it'll tire you.

501
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:50,173
Hang in there, doctor.
To X-rays.

502
01:46:57,583 --> 01:46:59,699
- Hello. You came with them?
- Yes.

503
01:47:00,463 --> 01:47:02,135

506
01:47:09,383 --> 01:47:10,736
- Here
- Yes.

507
01:47:11,103 --> 01:47:14,175
- The pain spreads to your leg?
- No.

508
01:47:14,303 --> 01:47:15,816
The leg's fine.

509
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:21,341
Can you stand up all right?

510
01:47:21,703 --> 01:47:23,580
No problem.

511
01:47:26,503 --> 01:47:29,336
You'll have to watch that.

512
01:47:29,463 --> 01:47:31,499
- You're wounded?
- No, l'm OK.

513
01:47:32,063 --> 01:47:33,701
You're the pilot?

514
01:47:34,863 --> 01:47:36,342
Can you tell me what happened?

515
01:47:36,863 --> 01:47:39,297
We were near
Tel El Ahmar in Syria

516
01:47:39,463 --> 01:47:41,499
to pick up a shot down pilot.

517
01:47:43,503 --> 01:47:44,982
A missile hit us,

518
01:47:45,103 --> 01:47:46,821
then 20mm shells.

519
01:47:47,263 --> 01:47:49,652
Many in the back got hit,
the co-pilot killed,

520
01:47:49,783 --> 01:47:53,253
it was shrapnel,
we made an emergency landing,

521
01:47:53,383 --> 01:47:56,773
the mechanic got a load
in his skull...

522
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:59,053
He's here.
We're taking care of him.

523
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:01,299
- You're wounded?
- No, l'm fine.

524
01:48:02,823 --> 01:48:05,212
l'd like you to be examined.

525
01:48:05,743 --> 01:48:11,022
l'm due at the base.
They need me.

526
01:48:11,143 --> 01:48:15,102
- Doctor, we've got a problem.
- l'm coming.

527
01:48:15,303 --> 01:48:19,091
First have them register
at admission.

528
01:48:19,543 --> 01:48:21,579
Send them to Akko rest center.

529
01:48:21,703 --> 01:48:23,500
They'll take care of them.

530
01:48:23,743 --> 01:48:26,257
l'm swamped. Good luck, guys.

531
01:48:27,023 --> 01:48:29,139
- Family name?
- Hattav.

532
01:48:30,463 --> 01:48:32,931
- First name?
- Yoram.

533
01:48:35,543 --> 01:48:36,771
That's for you.

534
01:48:37,543 --> 01:48:39,374
- Family name?
- Weinraub.

535
01:49:42,503 --> 01:49:44,300
That jeep broke my back.

536
01:49:58,103 --> 01:49:59,377
Weinraub...

537
01:50:08,703 --> 01:50:10,261
Every minute of silence

538
01:50:10,423 --> 01:50:12,334
is a great treasure to me.

539
01:50:14,023 --> 01:50:16,059
They wanted me to fly
to Tel Aviv...

540
01:50:16,183 --> 01:50:18,299
to take Moshe Dayan to the front.

541
01:50:19,943 --> 01:50:21,934
l told them that he should go...

542
01:50:23,943 --> 01:50:26,013
to the nearest bus station.

543
01:51:15,103 --> 01:51:17,617
l hope you steer better
than l did.

544
01:51:17,903 --> 01:51:19,814
You weren't so bad.
