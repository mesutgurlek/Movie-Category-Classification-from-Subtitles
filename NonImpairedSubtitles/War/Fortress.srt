OK! I m ay not be at you on a bike

636
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,774

Do you know
the history of M arathon?

652
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,265
In ancient Greece...

653
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,568
... a messen ger...

654
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,130

I st arted to run at 6th grad e

658
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:38,576
I felt then th at...

659
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,346
... if the country entrusted some...

660
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,712

I could hel p him with his j o b

662
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,733
Why d on ' t you h ave a computer?

You must be c autious

872

Of course!
But she never looks at me

876
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,694

Rabbit?

916
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,889
A rabbit is someone th at runs fast...

917
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,649
... but I acks the perseverance to
go all the w ay
