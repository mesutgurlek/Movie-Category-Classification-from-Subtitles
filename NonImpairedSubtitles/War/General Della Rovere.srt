1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,389
GENERAL DELLA ROVERE

2
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,349
- Has the curfew finished?
- Yes, it's ten past six

3
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,750
Luckily, the sky is also covered.
When it's cloudy is...

4
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,156
Lady, we are first

5
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,070
Eh, you, come here!
I've told you to come here

6
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,708
Shouting is useless, sergeant.
Probably he can't speak German.

7
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,393
Excuse me, sir, could you
tell us where could we find a phone?

8
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,479
I don't know. All the bars are
closed now.

9
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,589
Is it a puncture?

10
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,349
Yes, it's the fourth time and the
spare wheels are damaged.

11
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,156
Ah! If you're looking for a workshop,
there's one near here, round the corner...

12
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,349
...they repair tires.

13
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,595
- Do they?
- Yes

14
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,709
Thank you.

15
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,917
- A cigarette?
- Thank you.

16
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,674
Thank you. Ah, come here! It's
the first one on the left. 'Rechte'

17
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,749
Thanks

18
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,109
Thanks

19
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,029
- Genoese?
- Neapolitan.

20
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,591
Ah, Naples! Last year we were
in Naples at this time of the year...

21
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,154
...in the Vesubio hotel
- Vesubio

22
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,068
Yes. In the morning I opened
the window and I had the sea just there.

23
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,877
At one side Marcellina, Posillipo
and at the other Capri and Sorrento

24
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,197
- And under the window Aunt Teresa
- Ah! Aunt Teresa

25
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,718
We felt very sorry when we had to leave
Naples, we liked very much that city.

26
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,509
Nevertheless, your fellow 'citizin', I mean
your fellow citizen...

27
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,029
...were very happy when they
saw that we were leaving.

28
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,150
They were so happy that due
to their joy they even shoot us.

29
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,677
I'm not Neapolitan, really.
I was born in Sora...

30
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,997
...a little village between
Naples and Rome

31
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,431
As a matter of fact, I feel
more Roman than... Neapolitan.

32
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,511
Romans don't love as too much either.

33
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,675
Do you live in Rome?

34
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,394
No, I don't. I have been living
in Milan for six months.

35
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,511
Ah! Do you like Milan?

36
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,154
Nothing at all. The weather is unpleasant

37
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,794
...and the inhabitants are
distrustful, hostile and rebellious.

38
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,954
You Italians don't
like too much this war.

39
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,351
We don't like any war.

40
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,598
This is a necessary war
because it's fair.

41
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,513
Don't you agree with me?

42
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,313
Yes, I do, but everybody don't
think the same.

43
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,796
Yes, not everybody. That creates
very embarrassing situations.

44
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,117
- Can I do something for you?
- No, thank. Thanks.

45
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,077
- I'm going to work, by your leave
- Thank you very much, sir...

46
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,795
Grimaldi, engineer Grimaldi

47
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,629
Colonel Müller. I hope I will
see you again.

48
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,591
Me too. I hope it too.

49
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,395
- What time is it?
- Very early, it's six o'clock. Sleep.

50
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,472
Have you gambled tonight too?

51
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,151
Shut up now. We'll talk later.

52
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,679
Did anybody phone?

53
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,434
- You have lost today too, haven't you?
- I've asked you if somebody phoned.

54
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,835
I don't know! Ask Maria.

55
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,509
Maria?

56
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,956
- Who is it?
- It's me. Tell me, did somebody phone?

57
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,033
- Yes, the lawyer Borghesio
phoned twice.

58
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,550
- Someone else?
- No. Ah, yes! Lady Camelli

59
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,159
Cantelli. What did she want?

60
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,829
She told: "Tell the Colonel that
my brother is free

61
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,871
Regards and thanks anyway"

62
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,319
Have they set him free? Are you sure?

63
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,474
Yes, she said that he was at home.

64
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,273
Free. Who can understand
Germans?

65
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,120
- Do you want me to make some coffee?
- No, thanks. Keep on sleeping.

66
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,919
Ah, colonel!

67
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,151
You received a parcel.
I brought it to the dinning room.

68
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,518
I send you a parcel for my father,
I hope you could give it to him

69
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,518
Salami. Always salami

70
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,312
They have disconnected the light again.

71
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,636
Valeria, I'm in trouble

72
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,794
You have to help me

73
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,474
What do you want?

74
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,149
Lend me some things for some days,
I swear I will redeem them really fast

75
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,750
But yesterday Y saw you changing a very big
group of one thousand liras notes

76
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,951
I'm very unfortunate. 100.000 liras

77
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,037
The poor lawyer Borghesio gave them to me
for his son and I have gambled with them

78
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,073
With that money I wanted to earn 50.000
liras... that's what I wanted but...

79
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,958
Besides, it was my lucky night

80
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,915
The night before I lost just a little...

81
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,152
...so the next night I should have
won and look at me...

82
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,434
...the damned German
jinx took it all

83
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,512
It has been a terrible night

84
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,709
Only god knows what I've
suffered.

85
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,908
But if I run these risks,
I do it also for you

86
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,395
Do you that I don't know
what is to live with...

87
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,478
...a woman like you?

88
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,674
That I don't suffer for not
being able to give what you deserve?

89
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,551
You have been repeating the same
things for three months

90
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,473
I can't stand it more

91
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,908
Hello? Ah! It's, lawyer

92
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,311
No, you don't disturb me
at all, I get up very early.

93
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,949
News?

94
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,033
Listen, mister lawyer,
I'm doing my best

95
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,955
What do you say, sir?
The bill?

96
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,319
No, it hasn't arrived yet, but...

97
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,877
...I'm sure that this morning
...everything will be solved

98
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,269
Yes, I understand

99
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,757
I understand your anxiety, sir...

100
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,635
...but don't give up hope

101
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,111
Tell this to your wife too

102
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,949
Yes, I understand. Poor woman,
tell her I'll do my best

103
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
But you must trust in me

104
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,390
I've take this case very seriously,
I can't sleep at nights.

105
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,159
Yes, believe me, don't worry. Today, no
matter how much it takes, everything will be solved

106
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,918
Stay calm, sir

107
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,031
Sure, everything is going to be okay

108
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,713
Valeria, listen, is
a life and death situation

109
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,991
If before noon, I don't give
Walter, that avaricious German...

110
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,759
...greedy as a vulture,
the 50.000 liras I promised him...

111
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,394
...he will send lawyer
Borghesio's son to Germany

112
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,748
And what can I do?

113
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,912
If you let me pledge, at least
for a couple of days, something...

114
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,349
No, you've already stolen
me the earrings with the emeralds

115
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,117
- Stolen?
- Yes

116
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,993
But I will redeem them,
I swear it, don't you believe me?

117
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,429
No

118
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,039
Valeria, don't be cruel
I swear I won't gamble anymore

119
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,278
You can do whatever
you want... I'm going away...

120
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,038
- Where?
- To Turin

121
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,834
- I've been offered a job in the radio
- To do, what?

122
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,752
To sing, you stupid

123
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,992
To dance, to act...
to come back to life at last

124
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,550
Valeria, you don't realise these
are bad days...

125
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,231
...very dangerous days...

126
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,234
...but I'm prepared for everything,
I'm preparing something important

127
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,237
I want to organise a tour of
spectacles for the army

128
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,869
Then, when the war is over,
I've promised you that I will form that...

129
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,991
...revue company that your friends will envy...

130
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,430
...I have promised it, haven't I?
- You have promised me so many things...

131
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,390
But, tell me, what can I do if I've
got everything in the south?

132
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,396
Emanuele, you and your south. Do you know?
I'm starting to doubt that that south exists

133
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,029
Then?

134
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,795
Then, what?

135
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,435
I'm asking if you let me
pledge the necklace and the bracelet

136
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,790
Ah, yes! And the ring and the brooch

137
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,112
No, I said no. Don't insist

138
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,988
Listen, why don't you pledge
this ring you gave to me?

139
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,919
The ring with the Oriental
sapphire, ah? Take it

140
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,832
Come on, pledge this

141
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,315
Did you think that I didn't know
that it was a fake? Poor stupid

142
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,438
Nobody has been able to fool
Valeria yet

143
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,033
I never said anything
because I'm a lady

144
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,909
Who is Dorio?

145
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,029
- It's me
- Come in

146
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,718
Excuse me, can I talk to lieutenant Hageman?

147
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,637
- He's busy, but you can come in
- Thank you

148
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,553
May I come in? Do I interrupt you?

149
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,877
Come in. You can come in,
but wait a moment

150
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,477
He was arrested three weeks ago
in San Gregorio

151
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,194
I have been in Marazzi prison
to ask...

152
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,311
...and they have told me to come here
- What's his name?

153
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,998
Canevalli Alberto, de Matía

154
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,033
Check if that name is there

155
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,157
Canevalli Alberto, de Matía

156
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,439
If he is this communist, he was
shot last week

157
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,713
No, he isn't communist. My husband
never has been interested in politics...

158
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,316
...I swear it on this
child's head

159
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,513
He was arrested together with the
communists, but if it's true...

160
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,517
...that he is a good man that
is not interested in politics...

161
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,312
...he'll be set free

162
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,670
- But, when?
- That doesn't depend on us

163
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,076
Could I see him? Bring any parcel
to him, a few clothes?

164
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,192
You have to ask this to the
prison management

165
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,754
Thank you

166
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,075
- Excuse me, please
- Wait, I'm busy

167
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,519
No, ladies first

168
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,710
- What do you want?
- Thank you

169
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,070
We come to ask about lieutenant
Michele Fassio...

170
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,471
...he was arrested last Thursday in Savona

171
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,309
- Are you relatives?
- I'm his wife

172
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,709
I'm his mother

173
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,272
My son is not interested in politics
He fought in Africa and Albania...

174
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,392
...they gave him a medal
- Have you said Fassio Michele?

175
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,114
Please, look it up

176
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,552
Lieutenant Michele Fassio, of
Angelo and Matilde Mazzuero...

177
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,513
...born in Barigotti
on June the eighth, 1916?

178
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,629
Yes

179
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,354
This says that lieutenant Michele
Fassio has been arrested under the...

180
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,517
...charge of being member of armed gangs
that fight against...

181
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,235
...our troops and the legitimate
government of the Social...

182
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,429
...Italian Republic

183
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,029
That's not true

184
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,676
Since September the eighth my husband
didn't go out of my father-in-law's house

185
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,633
When his duty was to
present himself before his superior.

186
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,279
An Italian officer doesn't
need to be told...

187
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,435
...what is his duty

188
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,554
Relax. The Colonel only says that maybe
Michele should have presented himself

189
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,553
You have to understand it, they
are young boys, so many things have happened...

190
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,110
The war has affected Michele a lot

191
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,070
Yes, these are difficult
moments for everybody...

192
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,478
...it's necessary a lot
of comprehension

193
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,349
Hate policy exasperates
the spirit...

194
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,752
...but don't give up hope...

195
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,353
...our German comrades have always
been very comprehensive

196
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,911
Let's go, mum

197
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,389
I told you we couldn't expect
anything from this people

198
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,676
- What a temperament!
- A cup of coffee, colonel?

199
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,155
If it's coffee- coffee, yes. But
if it's like the last time...

200
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,558
- It's like the last time
- It's okay. Thank you, miss

201
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,115
- I have seen the lawyer Borghesio
- And?

202
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,395
He wasn't able to get the money,
but he gave something that is more valuable

203
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,479
Look at this wonder, an Oriental
sapphire, mounted in platinum

204
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,910
I'm sorry, but I wouldn't
know what to do with it

205
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,794
- I said 50.000 and it must be 50.000
- But this is much more valuable

206
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,079
- I want the money
- Jewels are a good investment

207
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,191
They can be identified and money can't

208
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,073
- A sapphire is always a sapphire
- I want the money

209
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,112
Don't be stubborn, Walter
What can I do? Where can I find it?

210
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,712
I think it's very easy. If the ring
is worth more than 50.000 liras...

211
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,037
...you can sell it and keep
the difference. It's easy, isn't it?

212
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,754
Yes, but it's a pity,
I wanted you to have it

213
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,474
You're engaged, someday you
will get married, won't you?

214
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,034
Someday. But can happen many things before
that day arrives

215
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,149
Here is the coffee

216
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,830
Then we agree, colonel

217
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,114
Always at your service

218
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,834
Thank you,
Walter. See you

219
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,399
Can we do anything for that mistress Fassio?

220
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,439
No. That is a hopeless case

221
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,390
- And I think that girl is very disagreeable
- I don't think so

222
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,835
Remember colonel...

223
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,478
...I wait for you tomorrow morning
- I'll be here

224
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,951
Ladies, I wait for you in
that bar. Good news

225
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,236
- Do you want to sit there?
- Thank you

226
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,435
Please

227
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,118
May I? Colonel Grimaldi

228
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,035
The Gospel say: Don't judge and
you won't be judged

229
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,038
So, you mustn't rely only
on appearances, lady

230
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,194
I have told you my name...

231
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,195
...don't ask me why I
am connected with Germans

232
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,233
These blue badges say that
I have served to my country...

233
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,035
...with fidelity and honour
The country, our country...

234
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,515
...denigrated and abused

235
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,158
Three coffees, but it has to be real coffee

236
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,713
- Neapolitan?
- Yes

237
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,152
Excuse me for the way in which
I've asked you to follow me...

238
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,714
...but these days we are living
in justify it

239
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,792
Ladies, I'll be brief

240
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,631
Let me be discreet about
some questions...

241
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,753
...as you probably will be in
other matters

242
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,917
- I suppose you have understand me
- No

243
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,189
I wanted to say that in these special
circumstances...

244
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,553
...some reserve is,
I would say, is... necessary

245
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,116
Listen, colonel, we should be outspoken

246
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,598
If you can do something
for my husband, tell me what and how

247
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,709
But Carla!

248
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,839
Let's come to the point. You ask me
if I can do something for your husband

249
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,758
I answer you: In the limit
of my possibilities, yes

250
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,315
Unfortunately, the charges, I don't know
if fair or unfair, are serious

251
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,679
Ah, somebody is waiting for me,
his case is very similar to yours

252
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,433
I think I've done the right thing, that's
what matters, help us each other

253
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,509
In spite of any party hate
Excuse me a moment, I'll be back right now

254
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,439
Carla, I think he is a good man

255
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,596
Listen, you can be calm,
your son won't go away...

256
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,994
...I'll give you my word

257
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,953
Thanks for all that you have
made for my poor son...

258
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,356
...and also for what you are going to do,
but, do you think that it's possible...

259
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,152
...that they set them free?

260
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,398
Don't ask for too much, for the present
we should be happy with this

261
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,635
Later, we'll see

262
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,355
Lawyer, I want to talk you about some matter

263
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,990
Two ladies whose names
I can't say...

264
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,838
...need to dispose of an
object of their family

265
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,159
An Oriental sapphire

266
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,751
- It's beautiful, very beautiful
- A unique jewel just for 50.000

267
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,111
50.000 liras!
Who will give them to me?

268
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,428
Listen, to be able to get the 100.000
liras that I've given to you...

269
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,634
...I've had to mortgage the house
And you can't imagine the conditions

270
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,796
- Yes, I can
- But, colonel, if you want...

271
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,717
...I can show it to some friends of mine

272
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,150
No, no. It doesn't matter, don't
worry. Goodbye, lawyer

273
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,078
- Thank you very much, colonel
- Don't worry

274
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,435
Excuse me. Haven't you
taken the coffee? It's authentic coffee

275
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,794
We have always drunk authentic
coffee at home

276
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,670
We have quintals in the cellar

277
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,276
Don't mind her, colonel

278
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,632
- She's nervous. Don't leave us
- No, don't worry, madam

279
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,629
Listen, colonel. If anything is necessary,
if you need something...

280
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,070
Mum, do you think that Michele can be
released because his father is rich?

281
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,557
And the others? All that men that
have been arrested like him...

282
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,275
...the others, will you pay for all them?
- I'll take charge of this

283
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,075
- Where could I find you?
- You can phone us. Fassio...

284
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,351
- 86386
- Fassio.

285
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,031
Fassio 86386. Very well

286
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,320
Madam, I hope that I will give
you information about your son as soon as possible

287
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,199
Thank you. Bye

288
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,793
There's nothing new in
the front of Anzio

289
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,230
An enemy bombardier has been
drifted by our fighters

290
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,433
Two planes haven't come back to
the base, they are disappeared

291
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,996
- This has been the first bulletin in the night
- Good morning, Mrs Pina

292
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,317
A bargain, a beautiful Oriental
sapphire. It belonged to my mother

293
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,910
An unique objet just for
100.000 liras. Look

294
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,156
Yes, it's very beautiful, but I can't

295
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,551
I can give you easy payments. You pay
a part now and the rest with hire system

296
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,638
It's very beautiful, I'd like
but we are in a bad moment

297
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,719
Pay me 50.000 and we take away the
rest from the money I owe you

298
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,911
Don't tempt me, I can't buy it

299
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,313
Look. I have been able to find
some chops. Good morning

300
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,556
- But, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Business with Mrs Pina

301
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,750
- Bye, Michelle. Good morning
- Good morning

302
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,800
A bargain, a beautiful Oriental
sapphire. Look what a wonder

303
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,998
- I've thought about you
- It's beautiful, very beautiful

304
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,079
- 80.000 liras
- I like it, but I'm not interested

305
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,270
I'm very sorry, but I don't want it

306
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,074
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry. It's beautiful, but...

307
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,838
A bargain, an Oriental
sapphire. Very beautiful

308
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,036
It belongs to a Jew lady. You understand
me, she has to sell it

309
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,516
- She content herself with 70.000 liras
- No, thank you. I'm not interested

310
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,431
It's closed. We open at two o'clock

311
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,915
I'm a friend of Miss
Olga. Open, please

312
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,151
- She is eating
- Tell her I'm an old friend

313
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,759
Who is asking about me?

314
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,116
- It's me, Olga
- Emanuele

315
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,149
Olga!

316
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,029
Olga!

317
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,032
- How did you know that I was here?
- I found a friend of yours two days ago

318
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,149
Evelina

319
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,750
Two days ago? She went away three weeks ago

320
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,271
I wanted to come right away, but
I had many things to do

321
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,631
I imagine it. And
now, why have you come?

322
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,198
I feel like seeing you again

323
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,236
- I expected that it would be reciprocal
- Seriously?

324
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,315
- I see I was wrong
- You are right, you were wrong

325
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,832
- Then, goodbye
- Olga, your food is getting cold

326
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,311
- Mrs Vera
- Emanuele

327
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,879
What a surprise! How are you?
And, what are you doing in Genoa?

328
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,673
The house of Livorno was bombed,
so I've moved here

329
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,276
Why haven't you told me that
Emanuel was here? Have you eaten yet?

330
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,799
Well, really, not yet

331
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,195
- Eat with us, we will love it
- No, I don't want to disturb

332
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,390
Don't be silly. Come on, get in

333
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,879
We have to talk a lot, it has been
ages since we saw each other.

334
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,517
- Do you mind?
- Me? She is the owner

335
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,320
- I'll stay
- Yes, of course

336
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,951
- Ready
- Come, come with me

337
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,234
- Give him your seat. Olga!
- Pleased to meet you, girls

338
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,316
You, take this plate off and
start to serve

339
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,276
Tell me, all this time,
what have you been doing?

340
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,516
- Where have you been?
- A little here, a little there...

341
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,349
- Sometimes up and sometimes down
- Yes, a little up and a little down

342
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,029
But you, always up. Do you know that
I see you really fine, Mrs Vera?

343
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,311
- I defend myself
- How is the job going?

344
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,432
What do you expect with the
curfew at night?

345
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,518
- Besides, people are worried
- Yes, that's true

346
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,476
And you, what are you doing now?
Apart from gambling, of course

347
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,519
I've quit it. Well, almost
I'm not interested in it anymore

348
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,313
- Now I'm a serious person
- Oh, come on!

349
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,111
- I buy and sell jewels
- As you did before

350
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,117
No. This is not the same

351
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,556
- Now I do business with this
- It's very beautiful!

352
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,949
Let me see

353
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,115
It's wonderful

354
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,429
Give it to me

355
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,799
Marvellous

356
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,829
It's a beautiful Oriental sapphire

357
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,438
This is a good moment to buy
There is necessity and it's sold cheap

358
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,993
The lira goes on falling and the
jewels don't stop increasing

359
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,273
It's a magnificent jewel, but
who knows how much it costs

360
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,315
Not too much, 50.000 liras. It belongs to
a woman who is in a bad moment

361
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,908
Her husband is in
Sicily

362
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,592
- Yes, but... 50.000 liras...
- I'll buy it

363
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,314
- You?
- Yes. Can't I buy it?

364
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,915
Well, Mrs Vera was interested and also
that other girl

365
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,873
- Oh, I don't care, if Olga likes it
- I'll give you a check

366
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,513
- Really I...
- Don't you trust me?

367
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,074
- No, it's not that
- Then, what's the matter?

368
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,828
- Has it been a long time since you saw her?
- Yes

369
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,073
- Since Livorno?
- Yes, since Livorno

370
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,192
- Then we went to Spezia and...
- She has changed a lot

371
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,356
She's nervous, she
quarrel with everybody...

372
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,994
...if I didn't love her as if she was
my sister...

373
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,591
Do you want Mrs Vera
to sign too?

374
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,118
Excuse me

375
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,109
Emanuele

376
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,109
Come

377
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,710
If Mrs Vera or one of the girls
had buy it...

378
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,230
...you'd have taken the money
Why not from me?

379
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,271
And you, why have you given me
the check knowing that this was a fake?

380
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,116
There are 30.000 liras. It's all
I have. Is it enough?

381
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,112
Why are you doing this for me?

382
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,271
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I know why

383
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,112
You hurt me, but with you
I spent happy days too...

384
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,672
...for the first time in my hole life
I live in the remembrance of those days

385
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,115
No, go!

386
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,993
Go. Go away and don't come back again

387
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,476
- Never
- Miss, go to the living-room

388
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,353
Ten thousand. Bank of ten thousand,
gentlemen

389
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,913
Ten thousand. Nobody wins

390
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,793
- Play, you can bet now
- Bank

391
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,672
Only bank

392
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,514
- Card
- Card. Good for the bank, sir

393
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,630
- And baccarat. 19.500
- Table

394
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,672
Bet, everybody can bet,
you can still play

395
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,549
- Bank
- Play. The bank goes on. Rien va

396
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,357
- No
- Huit a la banque.

397
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,673
- Turn off!
- There's one bank

398
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,270
Thirty-nine, madam. Take your
money, take your money

399
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,234
Calm down, don't worry, there's no danger

400
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,789
Sorry

401
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,032
Broadcast this immediately
"The tuner has arrived"

402
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:27,518
I gave you definite orders,
I thought I could trust you

403
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,034
For us, it was fundamental...

404
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,798
...that General della
Rovere was captured alive

405
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,594
I've transmitted your orders

406
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,753
You'll have to account
personally for his execution

407
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,790
We didn't know his point of arrival,
I couldn't be everywhere

408
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,912
You justify your conduct very well, but
it's your fault that a brave soldier...

409
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,749
...had been murdered like
a common bandit

410
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,753
But, even if we had caught it
alive, he would have ended up like this

411
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,033
And what do you know?

412
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,434
We could have interchanged him
kept him as a hostage

413
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,232
Listen, the responsible men will depart
immediately for the oriental front

414
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,831
And bury the General in secret
away from Genoa

415
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,872
We'll do it, Colonel

416
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,751
Meanwhile, you can tell that the
General is in our hands

417
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,468
Yes, sir

418
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,871
Something will happen. Somebody will move

419
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,674
You can leave

420
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,029
Can I?

421
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,109
- Hello? Hello?
- I'd like to talk to Mrs Fassio

422
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,957
- Yes, it's me
- Ah, it's you! Colonel Grimaldi

423
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,188
Don't cry, madam. I've got good news

424
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,394
I've taken your husband's case
with a lot of interest

425
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,872
- Really?
- Cheer up, Mrs Fassio

426
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,030
This isn't a very orthodox procedure

427
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,031
What? What are you talking about?

428
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,789
I know a men
who, unfortunately...

429
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,515
...well, fortunately for us,
hasn't got principles. So...

430
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,988
Are you talking seriously?

431
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,717
Alright, we'll meet in the same
café in which we were yesterday

432
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,030
See you, Mrs Fassio.

433
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,716
I'm sorry for the delay
Did my call surprise you?

434
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,074
No, not at all

435
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,794
I mean that maybe you didn't
expect that I did it so soon

436
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,076
But I'll tell you that, since I leave
you yesterday...

437
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,389
...I haven't had other concern
that your husband's situation

438
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,989
I have gone everywhere, I've
used all my connections...

439
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,715
...and I don't want to boast but,
I know many people

440
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,759
Results?

441
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,910
Results... ah... this is not
an easy case, I need time

442
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,833
And a lot of money

443
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,076
You don't know how avaricious
that Germans are

444
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,274
I imagine it

445
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,958
Here you are 100.000 liras, do you think
that this will be enough for the present?

446
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,470
Yes, of course, I'm going to
hand them over, wait for me here...

447
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,751
...I think I'll bring you good news...

448
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,431
...don't give up hope, and trust,
trust in my friendship

449
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,151
- Where is the phone?
- On the right

450
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,152
One moment, Colonel,
I'll be whit you in a minute

451
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,275
- Good morning, engineer
- Oh, Colonel, what a surprise!

452
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,075
What are you doing in suchan unpleasant place?
Any problem?

453
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,999
Yes. Do you remember, Colonel, that you
told me that this was a fair war...

454
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,875
...and I told you that I thought the same
but that not everybody thought that?

455
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,989
Perfectly

456
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:52,878
Well, I have a young relative and
this unfortunate boy, I'm not ashamed of...

457
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,912
...telling it,
doesn't think as I do

458
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,468
Son of an eminent jurist and
a noble woman...

459
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,628
...great-granddaughter of one of the thousand.
That young man didn't answer to the call of duty

460
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,754
He didn't answered to the call
of his country and besides we let them caught it

461
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,432
I mean he was arrested and
he is going to be deported to Germany

462
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,792
Why didn't he ask for fighting in our
side? He would have been released immediately

463
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,435
- Why?
- Yes, why?

464
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,834
- Do you want to know it?
- Yes, I do

465
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:37,759
Because of his pride. That boy is very
proud. He is like his... grand-grandfather

466
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,715
She said: If I ask for fighting in
our German comrades's side...

467
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:48,915
...they'll think that I do it for cowardice,
to avoid the concentration camp

468
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,149
I don't want the brave Germans to think
I'm a coward

469
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,830
- I'll see what can I do for him
- You'll talk to captain Schrantz?

470
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,317
I don't need to talk to anybody,
dear engineer. Come with me

471
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,755
Come in

472
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,075
- What's that boy's name?
- Borghesio, Vittorio Borghesio

473
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,637
Ah! But here it says that
besides deserting...

474
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,358
...that boy made clandestine
activities too

475
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,552
Mister colonel, if we paid attention
to everything the police says...

476
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,750
Engineer, I work in the police

477
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,909
Then, let me tell you that if all
the policemen were like you...

478
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,553
I don't like to be flattered

479
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,199
This Borghesio will stay in Genoa

480
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,916
- He is in the list of transferred
- Then cancel it

481
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:04,228
- Perfect. He'll stay here
- You are lucky to be able to do good deeds

482
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,715
But this doesn't happen often

483
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,519
I'm going to tell the good
new to his poor parents

484
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,428
And I take the liberty of anticipating
their gratitude and their blessings

485
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,114
I don't like neither gratitude
nor blessings

486
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,075
- Come and see me whenever you want
- I'll do it. Thank you, Colonel

487
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,188
Good news, excuse me, I'm doing an
urgent call and I'll be back right now

488
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,717
Lawyer Borghesio? I am the Colonel

489
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:11,517
Yes, mister lawyer. Victory!
No, no. Victory for Vittorio

490
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,794
He will stay here. And I hope
that he will be released

491
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,398
I'll tell you when we meet
and give this good new to your wife

492
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,638
No, I don't like neither gratitude nor
blessing. See you

493
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,913
Mrs Fassio, your husband is alright

494
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,839
It has been difficult but at the end
is the word freedom

495
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,960
My husband is free, Colonel...

496
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,713
...he was shot yesterday in the morning
behind the cemetery of Staglieno

497
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,109
Shot?

498
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,155
- But... then...
- Then, what?

499
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,950
- Come whit us. Calm down. Come on
- This is a big mistake

500
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,590
When did you meet that man?

501
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,551
Four or five months ago

502
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,476
In the Olimpia of Mondovi. I was
artist in a revue company

503
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,033
I am a dramatic actress, but these are
bad times and I have to adapt myself...

504
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,075
...besides if you are good at this...
- Try to be brief

505
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,108
- How do you meet this man?
- I've told you, it was in Mondovi

506
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,191
After the show I went with some friends
to a restaurant but it was late...

507
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,836
...and it has begun the
damned curfew

508
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,435
A patrol stopped us and they wanted
to lock us up, then the Colonel...

509
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,673
- What Colonel?
- Ah... him

510
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:04,038
- Well! You are a Colonel too
- Later... I'll explain it later

511
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,712
- Go on
- Then he escorted us to our hotel

512
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,908
- And then?
- Well, one thing leads to another...

513
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,113
- He obliged me to leave the company
- Go on, please

514
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,873
We went to Genoa, he promised me the moon,
he said that when the South was released...

515
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,676
What are Colonel's activities? And
say the truth, it will be better for you

516
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:36,069
I don't know what to say, only that he received
many calls, many people came...

517
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,839
...they bring parcels to him
- Parcels? And, what did they have inside?

518
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,233
Personal objects: Clothes,
food, a lot of salamis

519
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,830
I have eaten so much salami
that I have hives

520
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,432
That girl can leave. Over there

521
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,636
You, do you know that man?

522
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,039
Why? Why don't you answer?

523
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,233
Why don't you tell him that
you know me? It isn't anything bad

524
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:54,639
Colonel, maybe I've made a mistake,
but for a good reason

525
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,039
It started with Mrs Dominicis.
Mrs Dominicis, come here

526
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:04,109
She lives upstairs from me, one day I found
her crying, her son had been arrested

527
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,513
In the presence of a mother's
pain, what could I do?

528
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:15,075
- I told her: 'I'll help you', didn't I?
- Yes, Colonel

529
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:23,756
Do you see? I started this way. Later, more
people come and I feel obliged

530
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,237
What could I do? I wanted to help them
but they never were satisfied...

531
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:36,549
First they wanted to know if they are alive,
then give her news and parcels

532
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,550
Later they wanted me to avoid them
to be sent to Germany...

533
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,069
Later that I made them to be released
What could I do? Tell me

534
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,751
Put yourself in my place
I was trying to do good deeds

535
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:03,149
Later I knew terrible things
That they slept standing like horses

536
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,231
That they were beaten and tortured, that
they were sent in a wagon to Matthausen

537
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,752
And I shut up, I didn't have
the courage to tell it to them

538
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,471
Would have they preferred that I tell them?

539
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:28,591
No, it was better that they had a hope
Only me knew the truth

540
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,436
Set these people free

541
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,554
"Jawhol". You can leave, you're free

542
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,909
Come on

543
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,309
And now tell me: Do you prefer to summon at a
German war court...

544
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,389
...as a Colonel accused of
sabotaging the German law of war...

545
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,836
...or do you prefer to be Emanuel Bardone,
son of Luigi and Teresa Camarano...

546
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:28,035
...born in Sorrento on May the third
in 1894 and to be denounced for swindle...

547
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,712
...aggravated with the
illegal use of a title

548
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,719
Why are you asking me? In the first
case I could be shot...

549
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,469
...in the second case I will only spend
three years in prison

550
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:48,070
And the matter of the tittle is ridiculous,
They could fine me with 1.000 to 10.000 liras

551
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:55,830
The article 310 can be a problem
for offence during the war...

552
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:02,879
But this war will finish and then there
well be an amnesty like the other time

553
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,359
You were an cavalry officer, you were
expelled for debts and peculation

554
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,631
Later you were condemned for times
for swindle disabled people...

555
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,150
...for possession and sale of
narcotics and even for bigamy

556
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,597
If you had went on in the army,
you could wear a colonel uniform

557
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,830
Yes, of course. And also a general uniform

558
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,474
The sergeant Walter
Hageman has confessed

559
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,590
The sergeant Walter Hageman
was Bardone's accomplice

560
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,910
Well, he must be
punished severely
