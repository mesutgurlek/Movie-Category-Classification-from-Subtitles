Sir?

20
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,612

22

This is Capt. Sudhir Mishra
He's a doctor

43
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,840
You're getting very fit
these days, doc?

44
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,506
Jogging a lot!

45
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,016
Sir, I worry about Akbar

46
00:07:45,217 --> 00:07:48,345
Won't he need a doctor
if he faints en-route?

47
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,913
Your bag is kept inside

48
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:54,683
Go, have a look

49
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,325
At what?
- The bag or the room?

50
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:57,526
The room of-course!!

51
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:59,320
He must have seen his bag before

52
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,098
You go ahead, Karan

53
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,933
These two are always at it

54
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:07,105
Right sir

55
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:16,280
Now, the front will become exciting
When is the Bachelors party?

56
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,449
Whenever you want, sir

57
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:21,615
Hey Karan, Good evening,

My God! Did you guys see that?
Ramanna actually smiled!

64
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:41,137
Didn't say much as usual
but smile he did!

65
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:48,308
Excuse me sir
- Yeah... yeah

66
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:51,944

71
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:00,324
Yes sir

72
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:03,661

analysis by tomorrow evening

73
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:04,328

Take Karan along with you

75
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:14,503
It's time you saw what
you've been sent here to defend

76
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:15,673
Yes sir

77
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:19,400
Come on

78
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:24,845
Take it
- Thank you sir

79
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:30,851
You see that

80
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:35,689
These trophies, medals, certificates

81
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:40,023
They were won in different
battles, on different fronts

82
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:46,026
by the brave officers and
men of this regiment

83
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,370
Sometimes at the cost of their lives

84
00:09:54,746 --> 00:10:00,548
This regiment has always
given the nation and its army

85
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:03,784
news of success and victory

86
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:12,220
from this moment on,
you are a part of it's legacy

87
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,566
these trophies belong to you too

88
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:20,067
It is your duty to preserve
their honor and dignity

89
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:22,565
And to help you do that

faith of a billion people

00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:35,086
A billion people...

00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:41,084
who trust us to stay awake
so they may sleep

93
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:50,758
This trust is a great
honor and a great responsibility

94
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:56,763
You understand
- Yes sir

95
00:10:58,476 --> 00:10:58,942

00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:14,121
What's the score?
Is anyone winning?

101
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:16,294
Good morning sir
- Hey, morning

102
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:18,796
Shall I put your clothes in the room?

103
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:21,625
Yes and... keep the keys with you

104
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,970
Wife?

105
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:37,970
Girl friend?

00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:39,150
Sure, let's go

107
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:49,827
Good morning Sir!
- You go ahead

108
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:54,157
Aren't you playing today?

109
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:55,663
No, pritam Singh, Sahib

110
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:59,325
Karan, this is Sgt. Maj. Pritam Singh,
he is Lt. Shergill

111
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:00,834
Welcome, sir

112
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:07,839
pritam Singh is a very good man
and a respected veteran

113
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,009
It's officers like you
that have taught me all I know

114
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,351
We should get going now

115
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:15,849
Hail India (jai Hind)
- Jai Hind

116
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,197
This is the last Indian village
before the Line of Control

117
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:31,531
Soopra village

118
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,537
Hello
- Hello

119
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:41,538
Where are you from?

120
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:42,538
Delhi

121
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,377
The Capital

122
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,709
I'm from Maliyabad

123
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:50,884
Ever heard of it?
- Yes, sir

124
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:52,385
When was that?

125
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:56,717
Just now sir, from you!

126
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:16,743
This highway goes along
the river from Srinagar to Leh

127
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,410
It's the only link
between Kashmir and Ladakh

128
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:24,251
You see those mountains?

129
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:28,915
The LOC is behind that range

130
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:33,089
and across it are pakistani posts

131
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:34,954
You'll see it today

132
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:54,952
Everything okay here?
- Yes, sir. Nothing to worry

133
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,117
Where's Capt. Ravindran?
- In the bunker, sir

134
00:13:57,655 --> 00:13:58,952
Allright, carry on

135
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:07,119
Do you see the pakistani
post over there?

136
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:19,310
Wow! Unbelievable

137
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,477
That pillar marks the LOC

138
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:27,651
and from here to there
is no man's land...

139
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:29,653
Not ours Not theirs

140
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,985
Even so, we exchange
fire almost every day

141
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,488
If there's firing
we also retaliate

142
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:37,828
That's amazing

143
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,490
It's like I've always known,
but somehow...

144
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,497
I've never felt this Indian before

145
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,168
I'm an Indian

146
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,500
I still remember seeing
these borders for the first time

147
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,177
I understand how you must feel

148
00:14:58,883 --> 00:14:59,850
Come, let's go

149
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:19,532
I have been moved by
the affection and hospitality...

150
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:21,531
...extended to me...

151
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,875
...and the delegation
of eminent persons...

152
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,036
...who accompanied me

153
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,549
jammu and Kashmir is one
of the issues...

154
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,217
...we are discussing...

155
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:36,720
...within the framework of
our composite dialogue

156
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:49,066
You were watching our live
telecast from the Wagah border

157
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,228
This is a historic day

158
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:54,735
Today, India and pakistan
can hope that these steps...

159
00:15:55,106 --> 00:16:00,237
will bridge the distance
that has long divided us

160
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:05,905
Stay tuned for the news
in English, Thank you

161
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:13,113
Out. - Guruvindhar, was that okay?
- Perfect

162
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:18,255
Romila, call for you

163
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,755
Thank you

164
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:31,434
Hi Rajiv, tell me?

165
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:35,775
I've to read the news at 8,
lets meet after that

166
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,447
Okay, bye

167
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:45,118
Thanks

168
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:56,464
This must be special
- What do you mean?

169
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,462
I mean, we met by chance

170
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:01,297
kept running into each other

171
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:04,474
and now we're more than good friends

172
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:09,636
There must be something special
- perhaps

173
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,976
How about getting married?

174
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:15,812
What do you think?

175
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,486
Rajiv, its very sweet of you

176
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:23,653
We're friends, why not
leave it at that?

177
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,664
Do you plan on marrying
someone you hate?

178
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,659
Look, it's not like you
don't know me or don't like me...

179
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:38,005
I hope
- Of course I like you

180
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,005
You know it

181
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,678
Then what's the problem?

182
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:44,344
I haven't thought about marriage

183
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:45,678
So give it a thought now

184
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:55,682
Okay, say you'll think of it
Or is it asking too much?

185
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,690
No, it's not that

186
00:17:58,896 --> 00:17:59,692
I'll think about it

187
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,034
Hi mom

188
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:11,037
When did you come?
- A little while ago

189
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:14,211
Dinner?
- I've eaten

190
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:18,382
What're you reading?

191
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,382
Have a lecture at 9 tomorrow,
just making some notes

192
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:33,890
Rajiv asked me to marry him

193
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:38,894
What did you say?

194
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,235
What should I have said?

195
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:50,908
I think... whatever it was
you and Karan shared

196
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:53,584
...it's in the past?

197
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:57,754
It's something like that

198
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,416
What do you think?

199
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:05,592
You can't spend the
rest of your life in mourning

200
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,101
That's true but...

201
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:12,765
But what?

202
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:15,438
Nothing

203
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,282
Come on! Come on

204
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:32,952
Good shot

205
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:39,121
Well done Karan! Well done

206
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,456
Come on! Come on

207
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:48,298
Hello sir
- Hi Karan

208
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:50,637
You see that?

209
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:52,301
Sir

210
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:57,478
The snow is melting
Summer is here

211
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,650
How cold does it get
up there in winter, sir?

212
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:04,154
Minus forty degree, minus fifty degree
- Really

213
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:07,153
Yes, it's difficult to stay up there

214
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:11,825
Both, the pakistanis and
we vacate our posts in winter

215
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,331
It's like a gentleman's pact

216
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,835
that neither of us will
take advantage of this

217
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:21,994
Once the weather changes,
we man our posts again

218
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,001
I'd like to go there, sir

219
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:28,675
Someday you'll have to

220
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:36,854
Check
- Check

221
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:40,023
Sure you aren't a cousin of our
Grandmaster vishwanath Anand?!

222
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,193
Good morning sir
- Hey morning

223
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:44,194
Coffee?

224
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:45,521
Why not?

225
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,027
Ashok, another cup please?
- Yes, sir

226
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:54,938
from home

227
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,542
Do you like mangoes?
- Sir?

228
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:00,369
Mangoes?

229
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,704
I like them

230
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:05,879
Ever eaten mangoes from Maliyabad?

231
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:08,882
I will if you get them, sir

232
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:12,055
The fun lies in eating
them fresh at the orchard

233
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,715
Hey, Mishra!

234
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:16,559
Want to come home and eat
mangoes next season?

235
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,055
You plan this every year
but never take me there!

236
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:21,732
I wonder if he really has
any orchards at all!

237
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:23,901
Come on! It's your move

238
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:26,736
Check!
- Again?!

239
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:31,408
Why don't you...

240
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,075
Hey Karan...

241
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,082
Isn't she the girl whose
picture is in your wallet?

242
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,423
What happened? A tiff?

243
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:55,257
Excuse me sir

244
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:40,644
Hey Rajiv
- Hi brother

245
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:41,641
What's up?

246
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:42,638
Where you coming from?

247
00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:44,806
There

248
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:52,652
Where's Romi?

249
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,648
She's busy preparing
for tomorrow's protest march

250
00:22:57,695 --> 00:22:59,663
protest match? Again!?

251
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:08,501
Okay friends, the pamphlets are here

252
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:13,006
Now our volunteers must be at
every gate by 7 in the morning

253
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,677
Okay?
- We'll be there

254
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:17,514
Every student should
be given one, Okay?

255
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,182
And please ask them to read it

256
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:21,010
pamphlets are meant to be read

257
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:24,184
Is this poster okay?

258
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:25,355
Good

259
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:28,025
Where are the Hindi posters?

260
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,022
Almost complete Don't worry

261
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:34,520
Okay I'm going home
Call me if you need anything

262
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:36,359
Or tomorrow at 7 A. M, okay?

263
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:37,033
Hi Karan

264
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:39,202
What's going on?

265
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:41,371
Preparation for the march

266
00:23:41,572 --> 00:23:46,032
put up posters opposite
the vice Chancellor's office...

267
00:23:46,243 --> 00:23:47,369
...this very night, okay?

268
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,876
No more of the vice
Chancellor's dictatorship!

269
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,049
No more! No more!

270
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,717
Uncle, be honest...

271
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:56,045
Are all these rallies and
demonstrations of any use?

272
00:23:56,253 --> 00:24:01,054
Everyone has a right
to speak out in a democracy

273
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,727
But you shouldn't disrupt
law and order

274
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:06,722
Law and order? Hello aunty!

275
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:08,228
Hello Karan?
- How are you?

276
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:09,228
I am fine!

277
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,568
Where's Romi?
- In her room, Aunty

278
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:12,895
Sit please

279
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:19,232
The police resorted to using
water cannons at the last rally

280
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:24,073
Water cannons! She was lucky to
get away... or else she'd be in jail

281
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:26,749
Like mother like daughter!

282
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:30,250
I remember being arrested
in my student years

283
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:33,253
Aunty! Under arrest!!

284
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,926
Akhilesh...
- Yes?

285
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:37,754
I'm going to the
India International Centre

286
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:42,160
Okay - Bye... bye Karan
- Bye aunty - Bye

287
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:47,267
So tell me, what are your plans?

288
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:50,432
I'm going home right now

289
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:52,939
Then I'm meeting
my friends this evening...

290
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:55,612
I don't mean your agenda for today

291
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,110
I'm talking about life

292
00:24:58,482 --> 00:24:59,278
Life...!?

293
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:01,614
You mean life!

294
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:09,456
Right uncle! It's worth a thought

295
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:10,619
You know...

296
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:14,957
Whatever you do in life,
it's very important to do it well

297
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,163
You can become a scientist...

298
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,198
but what's the use
if you aren't a good scientist?

299
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:22,131
Mow lawns, if thats
what you want to do

300
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,306
as long as you do it well

301
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:24,197
Do you agree?

302
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:27,974
You're right, uncle

303
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:30,810
Anyway, I should get going

304
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:32,308
Aren't you waiting for Romi?

305
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:34,150
No problem! I'll call her later

306
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,828
Has Karan gone?
- Yes, he had to leave

307
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,157
That boy is very confused

308
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:52,161
That's his only problem, papa

309
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:54,333
He just can't decide
what he wants to do

310
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,339
His life doesn't have...
what's it called...?

311
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:00,168
An objective

312
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:03,506
Thats it! Objective!
He has no real objective

313
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:07,510
But wait and watch,
the day he finds his calling

314
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:11,021
...you'll see how far he goes

315
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,854
Your juice, sir

316
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:24,864
Switch on the geyser, will you?

317
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:35,571
Do meet them
they're good people

318
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:37,906
You're in philadelphia
now and they are too

319
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:40,413
Sridhar, breakfast
- Don't mix them!

320
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:42,085
Put the clean ones aside!

321
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:44,079
You're mixing them again!!

322
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,424
You should keep in touch
with family friends, son

323
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,759
Is that Udesh? Give me
the phone, please

324
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,427
You've know them
since you were a child

325
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:54,423
just a second, mom!
It's important give it to me

326
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:56,766
Yes!
- Mom

327
00:26:58,135 --> 00:27:00,763
Here! Just speak to Karan first!

328
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:09,273
Udesh! Can you check if the
jurassic park DvD is available

329
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,278
just check! It must be

330
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:15,782
just courier it to me,
okay, talk to mom

331
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:21,617
Hold on, Udesh... please
go speak to your father

332
00:27:21,825 --> 00:27:22,792
About what?!

333
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,627
He wants to speak to you

334
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:27,460
About what?!!

335
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,797
Hi dad
- Hi

336
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:33,970
You haven't gone to the office today?

337
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:36,806
I usually don't on Sunday's

338
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:38,967
Oh! Is it Sunday?

339
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:42,141
How would you know?

340
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:43,980
Sunday, Monday,
it's all the same to you!

341
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:50,149
Are you going to do
anything in life?

342
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:52,322
Of course I will, dad

343
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:56,493
But whatever I do, it's very
important to do it well

344
00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:58,821
I could become a scientist...

345
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:01,156
but what's the use if
I'm not a good scientist?

346
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:03,826
Mow lawns, if thats
what I want to do

347
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:06,161
as long as I do it well

348
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:09,339
That's what I feel about life

349
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,006
That's good

350
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:17,510
But just thinking won't help,
you have to do things

351
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:21,180
Udesh is just two years
elder to you, look at him!

352
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:46,176
Parvesh, tell me something

353
00:28:48,212 --> 00:28:50,510
parents, especially fathers...

354
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:53,009
Why do they always
ask the same thing?

355
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:56,019
What do you want to be?
What do you want to do?

356
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:58,521
Isn't there any other topic?

357
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:01,350
Who'll ask, if not fathers?

358
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,685
Mine is reverse!

359
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:08,521
I've told my parents I'm doing hotel
management before they could ask me

360
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,035
Girls have become
very sensible today!

361
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:14,362
Look at Romi!

362
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:16,869
She's been clear about wanting
to be a journalist all along

363
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:21,203
please, her father's the editor
of a leading daily

364
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:23,039
What problem would
she have becoming a journalist!?

365
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:24,544
What're you saying?

366
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:27,383
Whatever Romi decides
to do, she will do well

367
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:30,216
She's really different
and really smart

368
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:33,886
How could I forget who I'm talking to!?

369
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:36,225
I'm sorry lover boy

370
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,886
Romi is a genius!

371
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:45,402
Guess what, guys?

372
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:50,062
I haven't told my parents
yet but I've decided

373
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:52,742
What?
- Army

374
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:54,402
Army?

375
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:01,911
You! Join the army! You'll be
court-martialed the first day!

376
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:03,913
Ever woken up before noon?

377
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:08,754
I will when I need to!
Why should I for no reason!

378
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:10,093
You want to be an engineer

379
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:11,420
Did I ever say you won't make it?

380
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:13,763
Calm down!
Why are you over reacting?

381
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:14,931
Because you always put me down

382
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:20,597
But think about it,
buddy Army life isn't easy

383
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:23,439
Nothing is easy in the world

384
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:27,432
But I've decided and
that's that! I'm joining the army

385
00:30:30,647 --> 00:30:32,615
I feel my country needs me!

386
00:30:33,317 --> 00:30:36,445
Aren't Army uniforms
the smartest, Ashu?

387
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:40,119
You guys are giving me a complex!

388
00:30:42,826 --> 00:30:45,795
You're joining the army,
you engineering...

389
00:30:46,997 --> 00:30:47,964
you, hotel management

390
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:52,302
I'm the only one left!

391
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:55,801
Sometimes I think I'll do
this, sometimes that!

392
00:30:58,008 --> 00:30:58,975
Why am I like this?

393
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:28,167
Why am I like this?

394
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:31,000
Why am I the way I am?

395
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:36,009
When did I ever know
what I am supposed to do?

396
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:41,014
Looks like I'll be singing
this song all my life

397
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:43,345
What will happen to me?

398
00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:45,181
Will someone please tell me?

399
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:47,853
Why is it so difficult?

400
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:50,192
Will someone help me understand?

401
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:28,424
Why am I like this?

402
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,397
Why am I the way I am?

403
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:55,918
Now I feel like doing this,
but then again it's that

404
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:58,424
But why? I just don't know...

405
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:00,927
What it is that I must do!

406
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:03,425
What now looks clear and simple...

407
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,102
Tomorrow will seem all twisted

408
00:33:06,303 --> 00:33:10,933
I feel like my life is...
- Completely upside down!

409
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:15,271
Will I ever change?
Will I ever believe?

410
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:17,943
Will I ever improve?

411
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:20,116
I don't know if I will

412
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:23,619
What's to become of me now?

413
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,447
What do you think?

414
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:28,454
What's to become of me now?

415
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:31,457
Will I just remain the way I am?

416
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:46,132
When did I ever know
what I am supposed to do?

417
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:50,973
Looks like I'll be singing
this song all my life

418
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:53,308
What will happen to me?

419
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:55,311
Will someone please tell me?

420
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:57,983
Why is it so difficult?

421
00:33:58,689 --> 00:34:00,156
Will someone help me understand?

422
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:38,626
Why am I like this?

423
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:41,355
It's just the way I am!

424
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:37,983
I don't know why
you are the way you are

425
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:39,585
You think about it

426
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,464
Don't you get bored?

427
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:56,632
Where's the time to get bored?

428
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,798
There's so much going on
in the world...

429
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:04,978
...if a person is interested,
how can he get bored!!

430
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:07,309
Yeah I know

431
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,986
You are right

432
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:19,654
How come a girl like you
is into someone like me?

433
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,166
Why do you love me?

434
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:27,166
You want to be praised, is it?

435
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,664
Seriously...

436
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:36,509
I've never seen you
behave small or petty

437
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,515
I've never heard
you talk badly of someone

438
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,681
I respect that about you

439
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,348
I like that
- Really?

440
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:52,191
You're a good, big hearted person
that's why I love you

441
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,696
Thanks

442
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:08,211
Know what I think?

443
00:37:10,747 --> 00:37:12,214
You're not too bad yourself!

444
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:14,880
Shut up Karan

445
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:26,721
Your juice, sir

446
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:32,060
Switch on the geyser, will you?
- Yes

447
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:13,101
Hello Aunty! Is parvesh home?

448
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,068
What happened?

449
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:18,942
Romi, you always
say that I keep drifting

450
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:20,776
That my life lacks a...

451
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:21,780
An objective

452
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:23,782
The world is objective
- Exactly

453
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:26,615
Objective! Now listen...

454
00:38:27,324 --> 00:38:31,624
It's all clear to me now
I'm joining the army

455
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:34,289
You will join the army!?

456
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:36,460
Are you serious?

457
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:40,935
Romi, I've decided and that's that!

458
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:42,330
I'm joining the army!

459
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:44,338
I feel my country needs me

460
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,699
We all must do something
for our country

461
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,445
But when do we ever
realise our responsibility!

462
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,103
I have realised it!

463
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:55,642
The IMA is in Dehradun
Indian Military Academy

464
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:59,087
I have filled out the form
There's a written exam first...

465
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:02,152
If I pass, there'll be an
interview and a medical test

466
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:03,654
I'm sure to be selected

467
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,584
By the way, guess
who's coming with me?

468
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:06,589
Parvesh!

469
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm really stressed, man!

470
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:14,061
Remember we had applied
to IMA last month?

471
00:39:14,537 --> 00:39:15,367
Yes, so?

472
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:19,464
I got the letter today, for
the exam, didn't you get it?

473
00:39:19,843 --> 00:39:22,311
Maybe, I'll check at home, why?

474
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:24,177
I don't want to go!

475
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:26,139
Don't want to go!!!

476
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,779
What are you saying?
I applied because of you

477
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,222
I told you, this guy in the army?
He gets up at noon!

478
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:36,616
That's not the point!
My dad told me...

479
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,555
If I do an MBA from any
American university...

480
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:41,128
...I can get a job the
very next day in the U.S.

481
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:42,895
I can't believe you're off
to the U.S. Now!

482
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,167
What'll I do alone in the army?

483
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:47,829
Man! He's so unreliable!

484
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:09,354
Tell me something...

485
00:40:11,061 --> 00:40:14,827
How many years does
it take to an MBA in America?

486
00:40:22,972 --> 00:40:23,529
What is this?

487
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:25,433
What is this?

488
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:30,075
Did you apply to the IMA?

489
00:40:31,281 --> 00:40:32,748
Are you planning to
sit for the exam?

490
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:34,673
Actually parvesh and...

491
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:36,818
Did you ask us before
making this decision?

492
00:40:38,788 --> 00:40:42,349
Answer me! Did you ask
me or your mother?

493
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,857
You've lost your mind!

494
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,066
Think you can do
whatever you feel like?

495
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,061
Not in this house!
You better understand that!

496
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,136
But Daddy, what have I...
- Shut up

497
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:58,631
I've had enough!

498
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,012
Shalini, it's all our fault

499
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:06,406
He gets whatever he wants!
I'm here to earn the money!!

500
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:08,548
Where's the need for
him to do anything?

501
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:11,954
Apart from his regular nonsense

502
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,857
Now see this...
he wants to join the army!

503
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:19,656
Karan, look at me...

504
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:23,261
You will do as I say

505
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:27,130
Understand that! You will
do exactly as I say!

506
00:41:28,104 --> 00:41:29,002
Enough is enough

507
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:38,405
He's very upset

508
00:41:39,182 --> 00:41:41,412
What's gotten into you!
Just see how Udesh...

509
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:43,381
please mummy, I am not Udesh!

510
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:54,687
Karan, don't feel so bad yeah

511
00:41:55,198 --> 00:41:58,565
parents say things they
shouldn't when they're upset

512
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:00,830
But they don't really mean it

513
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,663
How do I know that?

514
00:42:04,974 --> 00:42:08,171
I hear what you say...
and I see what you do

515
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:12,673
Do you remember how in school...

516
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:14,611
...both your parents
would come on parents Day

517
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:19,152
My mom would, but did you
even once see my Dad?

518
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:22,886
You will do as I say!

519
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,558
...sorry, but I won't!

520
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:27,192
I want to join the army and I will!!

521
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:37,333
If you're serious,
then don't listen to anybody

522
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:39,472
Do what your heart tells you

523
00:42:40,243 --> 00:42:42,404
But if you're being
stubborn or egoistic

524
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,306
because your father
has said not to

525
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:47,015
then this would be a wrong decision

526
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:49,879
No, Romi, it's not about
being stubborn or egoistic

527
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,778
I want to join the army

528
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:55,348
So! It's decided then

529
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:56,985
Now cheer up

530
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,824
Come on... come on...

531
00:43:02,398 --> 00:43:05,799
My God! I never knew you could get
so angry!

532
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:07,026
I am really scared now

533
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:38,026
How did it go?

534
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:41,502
Romi, I'm sad I can't
show you my papers

535
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:44,134
There's just one fear

536
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,897
What's that?

537
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:48,310
I hope they don't think
I've copied everything

538
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:52,378
...because every answer
is just perfect!

539
00:43:53,316 --> 00:43:54,408
Very good

540
00:43:58,755 --> 00:44:02,657
Now that it's clear
what my future is...

541
00:44:04,294 --> 00:44:06,819
other thoughts are
brewing in my mind

542
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:07,822
Like what?

543
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:14,302
Like, in a couple of years I'll have to
get married... So what do you say?

544
00:44:14,837 --> 00:44:15,633
About what?

545
00:44:16,272 --> 00:44:18,365
About marriage!

546
00:44:19,876 --> 00:44:24,540
Karan, I knew that someday
we'd discuss marriage

547
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:28,679
But I never thought you'd
say it in this manner!

548
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:30,178
How should I say it?

549
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,852
I mean...
Can't you be more romantic?

550
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,121
I see

551
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:41,424
So you'd like me to...

552
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:43,197
...get you flowers...

553
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:53,700
...gaze into your eyes and say...

554
00:44:57,814 --> 00:45:00,874
Don't be stupid
I didn't say that

555
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:04,214
But it could've been
said in a nicer way - Really!

556
00:45:33,516 --> 00:45:38,453
If I say that I'm in love with you

557
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:42,614
you are my only desire
what will you say?

558
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:52,429
If I say that I'm in love with you

559
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:56,628
you are my only desire
what will you say?

560
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,335
I will say...

561
00:46:01,544 --> 00:46:06,038
that if you had said it
with a little more panache

562
00:46:06,249 --> 00:46:08,376
and a little more charm

563
00:46:08,584 --> 00:46:11,075
It would be nice

564
00:46:20,496 --> 00:46:24,023
If I say

565
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:29,464
that you are as fresh
as morning dew

566
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:33,506
Your lips as luscious
as flower petals...

567
00:46:34,811 --> 00:46:38,577
Your eyes twinkle like fireflies...

568
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:43,713
that my heart beats faster
when I think of you...

569
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,654
If I say

570
00:46:48,758 --> 00:46:51,192
If I say

571
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:55,558
that the moon is pale in
comparison to your beauty

572
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:58,325
What will you say?

573
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:06,798
I will say...

574
00:47:07,276 --> 00:47:11,770
please don't compare
me to the moon

575
00:47:11,981 --> 00:47:16,008
it has many blemishes

576
00:47:16,953 --> 00:47:21,219
And not a flower either
they wither and wilt

577
00:47:21,657 --> 00:47:25,923
As for fireflies... they just
vanish without a trace

578
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:28,454
If you'd stop using cliche's

579
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:33,192
and say it in a style
unique and original

580
00:47:33,402 --> 00:47:35,666
and with a little more charm

581
00:47:35,872 --> 00:47:38,102
It would be nice

582
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:45,604
If I say that I'm in love with you

583
00:47:45,815 --> 00:47:49,842
you are my only desire
what will you say?

584
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:31,285
If I say

585
00:48:32,094 --> 00:48:36,622
you have confused
me with your answers

586
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,826
How should I say
what I have to say?

587
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:45,972
Nothing I say seems to please you

588
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:51,178
Because I think you
don't even believe me!

589
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,281
If I say

590
00:48:56,052 --> 00:48:58,043
If I say

591
00:48:58,254 --> 00:49:05,126
Why is it that you don't know...
...that you already have my love?

592
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,825
I will say...

593
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:14,492
My heart does say
we are meant to be together

594
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,831
If we truly feel it
in both our hearts

595
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,633
then words don't matter

596
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:59,706
Don't worry, Shalini,
let him go if he wants!

597
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:02,243
He'll be back in no time,
i'm absolutely sure of it

598
00:50:04,553 --> 00:50:08,956
But I'm really amazed
that he got selected!

599
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:50,731
Gentlemen Cadets...

600
00:50:52,568 --> 00:50:56,629
I, Adjutant of the I.M. A,
Lt. Col. Pratap Singh...

601
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:58,864
...welcome you to the academy

602
00:51:00,176 --> 00:51:02,337
Today, you are
stepping into a new life

603
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:07,848
And I expect, that with
every passing day...

604
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:11,108
...you will prove worthy of
this great institution

605
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:17,253
Know that you are here
because you are special

606
00:51:18,894 --> 00:51:21,226
The Indian Military Academy
is a great institution

607
00:51:29,805 --> 00:51:32,330
...who's commitment cannot
be praised in just words

608
00:51:34,477 --> 00:51:35,535
first, our country...

609
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:37,937
second, the army...

610
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:40,148
then, his unit

611
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:44,646
and finally, concern for himself...

612
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,221
...that is the trademark of
an I.M. A trained officer

613
00:51:49,425 --> 00:51:56,422
Gentlemen cadets you must preserve
the honor and traditions of IMA

614
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:00,363
So, good luck to all of you

615
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:23,819
Gentlemen, there are three basic
rules in handling a weapon

616
00:52:24,627 --> 00:52:26,322
One, a strong grip

617
00:52:26,595 --> 00:52:28,119
Two, a focussed mind

618
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,890
Three, precise trigger operation

619
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:36,267
You will now learn how
to acquire a strong grip

620
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,834
Karan shergill
- Yes, Sergeant

621
00:52:55,224 --> 00:52:57,283
Detail, get ready to charge!

622
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,827
Charge!

623
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:07,133
Attack!

624
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:08,633
Stab!

625
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,305
Draw!

626
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:13,002
Hit!

627
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:16,001
Cut!

628
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:18,806
Charge!!

629
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:24,851
Detail, get ready to charge!

630
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:25,911
Charge

631
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:38,158
What's the matter?

632
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:41,668
Where's your energy?
Didn't your mother feed you?

633
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,906
You need to have fire in the belly!

634
00:53:45,774 --> 00:53:47,867
Move out of line and
watch the others

635
00:53:48,344 --> 00:53:50,005
Come on, move fast

636
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:52,080
Next

637
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:55,578
Detail, get ready to charge

638
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:51,203
Why're you scared?

639
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:55,207
He's getting nervous for
no reason, it's very easy

640
00:54:55,978 --> 00:54:58,469
You're next, we'll see

641
00:55:00,115 --> 00:55:03,107
All right, Rakesh my boy!
I'll wave to you from the top

642
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:16,262
very bad fail

643
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:19,231
You had to do it in a minute, next!

644
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:25,499
Go up, cross and jump,
all in a minute! - Sir

645
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:29,610
Make it fast

646
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:32,675
Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

647
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:34,380
All well?
- Under control, sir

648
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:36,448
Good carry on
- Yes sir

649
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,158
Gentleman cadet Karan Shergill
- Yes sir

650
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:19,557
You fell because you
were not concentrating

651
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:23,163
Do you think you can get away
for lack of discipline? - No sir

652
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:25,824
You shall be punished!
- Yes sir

653
00:56:26,535 --> 00:56:29,993
You will crawl in that trench,
no stopping till I say so!

654
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:31,233
Now, go

655
00:56:35,277 --> 00:56:39,907
You guys think it's a joke!

656
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,175
How do you like
the taste of mud, eh?

657
00:56:48,524 --> 00:56:50,754
Don't get up, go again

658
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:53,424
Move it! Fast!

659
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,262
Hands low G.C.!!

660
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:04,199
It's not easy becoming
an officer, is it?

661
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:05,430
Come on, hurry up!

662
00:57:06,742 --> 00:57:07,367
Don't get up

663
00:57:11,246 --> 00:57:12,008
Hurry up

664
00:57:17,286 --> 00:57:17,980
Come on

665
00:57:20,956 --> 00:57:21,752
Hurry up

666
00:57:24,426 --> 00:57:25,393
Come on, move

667
00:57:28,764 --> 00:57:32,700
Don't get up you will
stay on your knees all day

668
00:57:34,002 --> 00:57:36,095
Is that understood?
- Yes sir

669
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:54,483
What are you thinking?
- Nothing much

670
00:57:55,691 --> 00:57:56,658
Let it go, man!

671
00:57:57,126 --> 00:57:59,890
It was just bad luck the
Company Commander came by

672
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:03,187
And you did give him
reason to punish you

673
00:58:06,735 --> 00:58:09,602
Now forget everything
and get some sleep

674
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:12,501
Tomorrow is a fresh start

675
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,774
Don't give anyone
a chance to punish you

676
00:58:16,645 --> 00:58:20,103
Okay? See you in the morning
- Good night

677
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:27,951
Karan, Saket said goodnight,
at least wish him!

678
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:28,714
Good night

679
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:54,882
Did you get into a fight there?

680
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:57,480
No... I just...

681
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:01,380
Sit down

682
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:34,314
Whatever I have earned, acquired...

683
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:40,424
All that I have...
who do you think it's for?

684
00:59:48,437 --> 00:59:49,563
What did he bring with him?

685
00:59:52,741 --> 00:59:54,538
My entire family stayed
in one small room

686
00:59:58,413 --> 01:00:03,578
When I grew up, I'd hear of
the house we had in Lahore...

687
01:00:06,555 --> 01:00:08,352
...the status our family had...

688
01:00:13,095 --> 01:00:15,120
This would pierce
my heart like an arrow

689
01:00:19,835 --> 01:00:20,961
I vowed that...

690
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:25,900
I would restore the family
position to what it once was

691
01:00:28,443 --> 01:00:29,535
And I succeeded

692
01:00:32,014 --> 01:00:33,948
But my father didn't live to see this

693
01:00:37,819 --> 01:00:38,808
Now all I have is my family

694
01:00:41,757 --> 01:00:43,952
and if you have no respect
for what I have done

695
01:00:47,763 --> 01:00:52,666
then all my effort
has been in vain

696
01:00:58,173 --> 01:01:00,198
You must help him, son

697
01:01:01,076 --> 01:01:04,375
Start going to the office
from tomorrow, okay?

698
01:01:08,951 --> 01:01:09,713
All right, go

699
01:01:28,236 --> 01:01:31,865
Didn't I tell you he'll
be back in no time

700
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:36,377
I know him Shalini,
he's good for nothing

701
01:01:36,912 --> 01:01:39,540
Let it be now
At least he's back

702
01:01:40,449 --> 01:01:42,883
Only you expect anything from him

703
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:45,553
I fail to understand...

704
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:48,048
Why Karan can't be more like Udesh

705
01:02:12,214 --> 01:02:12,839
What's this?

706
01:02:13,048 --> 01:02:14,345
You arrived yesterday
but called me today!

707
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:16,513
Nice hair style

708
01:02:16,952 --> 01:02:18,852
Anyway, how long are you here for?

709
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:24,024
I'm not going back
- What do you mean?

710
01:02:29,564 --> 01:02:32,192
You ran away, didn't you!?

711
01:02:36,805 --> 01:02:40,263
For once you had made
your own decision

712
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:42,636
only to be defeated
in a few days

713
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,149
Your parents were upset

714
01:02:48,517 --> 01:02:52,476
But you said "It's my life,
I'll decide what I want"

715
01:02:52,754 --> 01:02:54,551
Is this what you decided?

716
01:02:56,825 --> 01:03:00,158
I can understand
you're annoyed, but...

717
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:01,659
What do you understand, Karan?

718
01:03:02,631 --> 01:03:07,261
Remember, it was here that
you said... you wanted to marry me

719
01:03:08,804 --> 01:03:10,101
perhaps even that decision
has changed!

720
01:03:10,305 --> 01:03:12,273
What are you saying, Romi!
- What should I say!?

721
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:17,277
When someone can't respect
himself or his own decision...

722
01:03:17,479 --> 01:03:18,605
How can I expect him to respect me?

723
01:03:18,814 --> 01:03:20,281
Please listen to...
- Don't touch me

724
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,284
I don't think I ever
want to meet you again

725
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,818
You accept that you have done wrong

726
01:04:31,753 --> 01:04:34,881
You accept that you have
disgraced this institution

727
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:37,558
please answer yes or no?
- Yes sir

728
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,820
Are you ready for any punishment
given to you? - Yes sir

729
01:04:42,864 --> 01:04:44,991
Your act was
not a minor misdemeanor

730
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:48,336
You will undergo a
28 day restriction period

731
01:04:49,037 --> 01:04:51,835
After that, your plea
will be considered - Yes sir

732
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:54,668
Say it loud and clear
- Yes sir

733
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:19,298
This is your path...
You know it now

734
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:28,303
This is your dream...
You realise it now

735
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:48,323
This is your path...
You know it now

736
01:05:50,532 --> 01:05:58,166
This is your dream...
You realise it now

737
01:05:59,941 --> 01:06:05,174
Now you have to prove it

738
01:06:10,752 --> 01:06:20,024
Nothing can hinder you or stop you
You will fulfill your objective

739
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:30,194
Your objective...
must be achieved at any cost

740
01:06:55,997 --> 01:07:00,400
When you walk with your
heart full of courage

741
01:07:00,769 --> 01:07:05,229
The ground will tremble
beneath your feet

742
01:07:05,941 --> 01:07:10,401
Distances will not matter

743
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:15,576
Your goal will step
forth and embrace you

744
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,514
When you walk with your
heart full of courage

745
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:20,951
The ground will tremble
beneath your feet

746
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:31,259
Stride forth, day or night
It's not for you to rest or stop

747
01:07:31,466 --> 01:07:35,766
You will fulfill your objective

748
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:42,774
Your objective... must be
achieved at any cost

749
01:08:04,499 --> 01:08:12,304
This is your path...
You know it now

750
01:08:14,476 --> 01:08:21,939
This is your dream...
You realise it now

751
01:08:23,885 --> 01:08:29,448
Now you have to prove it

752
01:09:21,076 --> 01:09:25,035
You are now officers
of The Indian Army

753
01:10:02,016 --> 01:10:03,916
Congratulations
- Thanks mom

754
01:10:05,086 --> 01:10:09,546
Udesh had called
He said to salute you on his behalf

755
01:10:10,658 --> 01:10:11,784
Typical Udesh

756
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,757
Your father did want to be here

757
01:10:16,965 --> 01:10:19,593
But an important meeting
came up at the last minute

758
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:20,926
It's okay, I understand

759
01:10:23,004 --> 01:10:24,528
My mom
- Good morning mom

760
01:10:24,772 --> 01:10:26,501
Meet my friends, Saket and Abeer

761
01:10:27,008 --> 01:10:28,805
They've graduated as officers today

762
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,477
Congratulations

763
01:10:30,678 --> 01:10:32,805
And once these stars
are on my shoulders...

764
01:10:33,014 --> 01:10:34,641
I'll be an officer too

765
01:10:34,849 --> 01:10:37,147
Lt. Karan Shergill
The enemy's worst nightmare!

766
01:10:43,258 --> 01:10:46,557
I will do my duty...

767
01:10:46,628 --> 01:10:49,722
honestly & faithfully...

768
01:10:49,898 --> 01:10:53,129
serve in the regular army...

769
01:10:53,234 --> 01:10:55,600
of the union of India...

770
01:10:55,737 --> 01:10:58,706
and go wherever ordered...

771
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,769
by land...

772
01:11:00,942 --> 01:11:02,273
sea...

773
01:11:02,443 --> 01:11:03,910
or air...

774
01:11:04,412 --> 01:11:06,039
and that...

775
01:11:06,214 --> 01:11:08,978
I will observe & obey...

776
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,209
all commands...

777
01:11:11,419 --> 01:11:13,319
of the president...

778
01:11:13,454 --> 01:11:16,116
of the union of India...

779
01:11:16,224 --> 01:11:17,418
and...

780
01:11:17,525 --> 01:11:19,254
the Commands of...

781
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:21,592
any officer...

782
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:23,390
set over me...

783
01:11:23,932 --> 01:11:27,766
even to the prior of my life

784
01:12:08,176 --> 01:12:11,577
Welcome once again to
"To each his own view"

785
01:12:11,746 --> 01:12:14,044
for those who have just tuned in...

786
01:12:14,249 --> 01:12:16,376
our topic for today is...

787
01:12:16,584 --> 01:12:19,052
Today's Woman in the
eyes of Today's Man

788
01:12:19,754 --> 01:12:22,222
Mr. Trivedi, you were
saying before the break

789
01:12:23,124 --> 01:12:25,217
Yes, first and foremost...

790
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:28,395
Woman is a mother,
wife and homemaker

791
01:12:28,596 --> 01:12:31,394
If you try changing her role

792
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:34,898
it will cause an upheaval in her
life and in society

793
01:12:37,839 --> 01:12:39,568
It's okay, it's your belief

794
01:12:39,774 --> 01:12:41,071
We'll come back to you

795
01:12:41,276 --> 01:12:45,235
Mr. Rajiv Kohli you are
a business executive

796
01:12:45,947 --> 01:12:51,249
Do you agree with him?
- No, I don't agree with him

797
01:12:52,153 --> 01:12:57,420
Today in the corporate or creative world
or any field, for that matter

798
01:12:57,625 --> 01:13:01,425
Women are not only matching
strides with men...

799
01:13:01,629 --> 01:13:04,257
but are gradually going ahead

800
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:09,925
No, don't clap, it's a fact

801
01:13:10,638 --> 01:13:12,936
Today's woman is a success story

802
01:13:13,641 --> 01:13:17,236
A shining example is with us today
Miss Romila Dutta

803
01:13:19,213 --> 01:13:19,838
Thank you

804
01:13:26,187 --> 01:13:26,881
Only soft drinks tonight?

805
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:29,949
How's it going, kids?

806
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,785
Call for you
- I'll be back

807
01:13:41,703 --> 01:13:42,067
Hello

808
01:13:44,339 --> 01:13:47,968
Hi Romi
- Karan

809
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,719
Congratulations
- Thank you

810
01:14:00,588 --> 01:14:01,714
I called to give you the good news

811
01:14:02,724 --> 01:14:03,349
By the way...

812
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:07,391
I've got a job as a
correspondent for Global News

813
01:14:08,863 --> 01:14:10,455
Why wouldn't you?

814
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:13,664
When are you coming to Delhi?

815
01:14:14,369 --> 01:14:15,165
Why?

816
01:14:16,371 --> 01:14:19,340
We should meet

817
01:14:26,481 --> 01:14:28,949
You can't make
all the decisions, Romi

818
01:14:29,884 --> 01:14:33,012
You decided that we should not meet

819
01:14:34,255 --> 01:14:39,192
Now if we should or should
not meet I will decide

820
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:43,323
Okay, bye!

821
01:15:35,049 --> 01:15:37,483
Hey Karan, where are you going?
- Home

822
01:15:38,686 --> 01:15:39,653
fansukh!

823
01:16:14,889 --> 01:16:17,357
One's missing, look over there

824
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:23,890
Okay Ashok

825
01:17:25,126 --> 01:17:27,253
Thanks for coming to the airport

826
01:17:27,995 --> 01:17:31,431
The army has polished
up your manners, I see!

827
01:17:31,632 --> 01:17:32,929
You wait and watch

828
01:17:35,803 --> 01:17:37,930
I'll see you this evening
I must get to work now

829
01:17:38,472 --> 01:17:42,101
I'm planning to go &
meet Romi this evening

830
01:17:45,313 --> 01:17:49,773
When did you last speak to her?
- Why?

831
01:17:51,819 --> 01:17:53,116
She's getting engaged today

832
01:18:39,867 --> 01:18:42,665
Reports of intrusion are
coming in from Drass

833
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:46,067
Intruders have also crossed
the LOC into Kaksar and Batalik

834
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:50,006
Regretable thing is that
after returning from Lahore

835
01:18:50,244 --> 01:18:51,711
prospects to peace is
rendered impossible

836
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:53,042
Oh my God!

837
01:18:53,881 --> 01:18:55,178
What's this new problem?

838
01:18:57,952 --> 01:18:58,441
Hi mom

839
01:19:03,224 --> 01:19:04,851
Where have you been all evening?

840
01:19:09,764 --> 01:19:10,526
Come in

841
01:19:12,633 --> 01:19:17,195
What's this news from Kargil?
You're posted there, aren't you?

842
01:19:18,406 --> 01:19:21,705
What news? I haven't heard anything

843
01:19:22,576 --> 01:19:25,875
Really? There was something
on the T. V about it

844
01:19:29,817 --> 01:19:30,283
Hello

845
01:19:34,422 --> 01:19:35,389
just a moment!

846
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:39,393
It's for you

847
01:19:43,998 --> 01:19:44,396
Hello

848
01:19:45,766 --> 01:19:47,825
Sir!
Lt. Shergill here Sir

849
01:19:50,104 --> 01:19:50,661
Yes sir

850
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:53,973
Sir

851
01:19:56,544 --> 01:19:57,010
Right Sir

852
01:20:00,448 --> 01:20:02,416
My leave is cancelled

853
01:20:03,884 --> 01:20:06,284
But what's happened?
You just got here!

854
01:20:06,487 --> 01:20:09,456
It's this news, isn't it?
What did he say?

855
01:20:10,024 --> 01:20:12,083
That I should report back at once

856
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:13,621
He must have said more!

857
01:20:15,696 --> 01:20:16,958
What are you hiding?

858
01:20:17,164 --> 01:20:18,961
I don't have anything
to tell you, Dad!?

859
01:20:20,334 --> 01:20:21,301
I've to go

860
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:50,222
Due to commencement of Operation vijay

861
01:20:50,898 --> 01:20:52,957
you are being made an Acting Captain

862
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:23,052
Army Intelligence has reported that
our neighbours... have betrayed our trust

863
01:21:23,764 --> 01:21:25,391
They have crossed the Line
of Control and infiltrated...

864
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:31,536
regions from Batalik to
Drass with armed intruders

865
01:21:33,207 --> 01:21:36,005
Our unit is responsible for peak 5179

866
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:42,676
I've called for a briefing
in the next 15 minutes

867
01:21:46,887 --> 01:21:51,847
Come what may,
we must recapture peak 5179

868
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,358
At any cost!

869
01:22:25,459 --> 01:22:31,694
This is the mountain known
as peak 5179 on the map

870
01:22:33,067 --> 01:22:36,366
We cannot access it's northern side...
without crossing the LOC

871
01:22:37,571 --> 01:22:39,698
And we have been given
precise orders...

872
01:22:40,407 --> 01:22:44,537
that under no circumstances,
can we cross the LOC So!

873
01:22:46,247 --> 01:22:49,216
That leaves us with three sides

874
01:22:50,784 --> 01:22:56,188
The western side is a sheer cliff
850 to 900 feet high

875
01:22:56,423 --> 01:22:58,891
The enemy has a natural defense here

876
01:23:00,861 --> 01:23:02,328
That leaves two sides

877
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:07,826
This is the southern side, facing us

878
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:12,998
But there's open plain
from here to there

879
01:23:13,207 --> 01:23:13,832
No cover at all

880
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:16,669
The enemy perched on the mountain...

881
01:23:16,877 --> 01:23:21,678
can easily watch our
movements from his bunker upto 3 km

882
01:23:23,384 --> 01:23:28,378
This means that we are left with
only one option the eastern side

883
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:30,015
That's right

884
01:23:32,726 --> 01:23:34,023
We will send a small team

885
01:23:35,863 --> 01:23:37,888
They must move undetected and explore

886
01:23:38,232 --> 01:23:43,465
and chart possible routes
that will provide us...

887
01:23:44,738 --> 01:23:46,467
with maximum cover

888
01:24:05,192 --> 01:24:06,159
There!

889
01:24:06,593 --> 01:24:10,120
Their bunkers must
be across that ridge line

890
01:24:11,498 --> 01:24:13,125
That's the only access to this side

891
01:24:14,668 --> 01:24:16,636
They would've definitely covered it

892
01:24:30,017 --> 01:24:32,144
Hello, Ghaznavi 1

893
01:24:33,354 --> 01:24:35,151
Hello, Ghaznavi 3, come in, over

894
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:38,651
Sir, I can see Indian soldiers
one and half kms away

895
01:24:39,193 --> 01:24:40,660
A patrolling party, perhaps

896
01:24:41,362 --> 01:24:42,158
No firing

897
01:24:42,629 --> 01:24:45,325
Don't reveal your position

898
01:24:45,532 --> 01:24:47,864
Understood, sir, over

899
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:54,472
Karan, get back!

900
01:24:59,813 --> 01:25:01,781
Why were you in the open?
- Sorry, sir

901
01:25:04,952 --> 01:25:06,749
I felt a presence on the mountain

902
01:25:08,555 --> 01:25:09,783
I felt like I was being watched

903
01:25:37,051 --> 01:25:39,019
Come on, get the camera, quick!

904
01:25:39,586 --> 01:25:40,917
Come on... come on... hurry up

905
01:25:41,955 --> 01:25:44,583
Hey, isn't that Romila Dutta?

906
01:25:45,459 --> 01:25:46,255
You're right

907
01:25:54,201 --> 01:25:55,498
Hello
- Hi!

908
01:25:56,270 --> 01:26:00,070
How far is that shelling from here?
- About 3 kms away

909
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:04,503
The pakistanis on the mountain...
...are trying to cut off the highway

910
01:26:04,878 --> 01:26:07,176
I see
- Don't worry, they won't succeed

911
01:26:08,248 --> 01:26:11,308
Where are you going? - Kargil
Actually we are from Global news

912
01:26:11,452 --> 01:26:12,680
You don't need an introduction!

913
01:26:14,521 --> 01:26:14,987
Hi

914
01:26:15,489 --> 01:26:16,012
Hello

915
01:26:16,857 --> 01:26:17,289
Hi

916
01:26:19,059 --> 01:26:20,686
The shelling you hear
is from the other side

917
01:26:21,061 --> 01:26:25,020
Our Artillery will see where best
to retaliate and then fire back

918
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:41,809
In mountain warfare...

919
01:26:43,183 --> 01:26:46,152
the side occupying the
heights holds the advantage

920
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:53,649
Therefore! Before any attack on
the feature's eastern side...

921
01:26:55,028 --> 01:26:56,655
we need to know...

922
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:02,065
the exact position of
the enemy's bunkers

923
01:27:02,769 --> 01:27:04,236
The strength of their fire power

924
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:08,897
An aggressive patrol will
be sent to accomplish this

925
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:10,335
What's the plan, sir?

926
01:27:14,848 --> 01:27:15,542
Thank you sir

927
01:27:19,286 --> 01:27:22,585
four teams! The first from this side

928
01:27:23,457 --> 01:27:28,554
You will lead it Second team, Kaushal
- Yes sir

929
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:31,088
You will apply pressure onto this area

930
01:27:31,965 --> 01:27:34,934
Third team, Satish and Capt. Ramanna

931
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,267
You will go till here

932
01:27:37,804 --> 01:27:43,504
And Akbar, Karan & Sgt. Dharamvir Singh
You will position your team here

933
01:27:43,877 --> 01:27:44,969
and open fire

934
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:51,782
This will not be an actual attack
but they should feel that it is real

935
01:27:53,654 --> 01:27:59,786
When they return fire... we'll get to know
their positions and weapons

936
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,017
Yes sir

937
01:29:24,344 --> 01:29:30,806
Engagement ring! - Congratulations
- Thank you.

938
01:30:24,237 --> 01:30:26,501
Alright! Here we go...

939
01:30:26,773 --> 01:30:28,536
Ready pradeep
- Yes sir

940
01:30:32,346 --> 01:30:34,314
All teams open fire!

941
01:31:10,884 --> 01:31:14,718
Sir, Oscar Tango 3 degrees,
distance 800 metres

942
01:31:14,888 --> 01:31:16,014
they have a medium machine gun

943
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:19,053
Here! NW of team D!

944
01:31:22,629 --> 01:31:23,220
Sir!

945
01:31:25,132 --> 01:31:26,759
Hello Tiger!
This is team 2 here

946
01:31:27,234 --> 01:31:28,360
Hello tiger, there's a bunker
on the Camel's Hump

947
01:31:28,902 --> 01:31:30,870
Bunker on the Camel's Hump?
Okay vinodh!

948
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:37,871
Hello Tiger - Go ahead Koushal
- A bunker! On the landing!

949
01:31:38,578 --> 01:31:40,546
Bunker on the landing, mark it!

950
01:31:42,582 --> 01:31:46,541
Oscar Tango 23 degrees,
distance 650 metres

951
01:31:46,753 --> 01:31:47,720
There's a bunker on the ridge

952
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:50,048
On the ridge! Return to base

953
01:31:53,427 --> 01:31:56,885
All teams return to base...

954
01:31:57,230 --> 01:32:02,031
Mission accomplished...
I repeat, Mission accomplished

955
01:32:05,472 --> 01:32:08,930
They have a medium and light
machine gun in these bunkers

956
01:32:09,976 --> 01:32:11,773
There are 4 bunkers up there

957
01:32:11,978 --> 01:32:15,937
And they have an 81 mm
Mortar at the top of this feature

958
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:19,118
Sir...
- Yes, pritam Singh, go on

959
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:22,117
They have two 81 mm mortars
up there, not one

960
01:32:22,322 --> 01:32:26,622
It takes at least 10 seconds
to reload this weapon...

961
01:32:27,027 --> 01:32:29,621
but the second round comes
in well before that

962
01:32:31,498 --> 01:32:32,294
He's right

963
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,626
Now that's experience

964
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:37,636
Hello

965
01:32:38,672 --> 01:32:42,631
Sir, we pushed them back
- You fool!

966
01:32:42,843 --> 01:32:46,472
They came to check out our bunkers
and weapons... and succeeded!

967
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:51,413
Stay prepared and alert
The real attack isn't too far now! Over!

968
01:32:51,585 --> 01:32:53,849
Understood, sir! Over!

969
01:32:57,524 --> 01:32:59,151
Yesterday, at one point
I thought my gun had jammed

970
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:01,156
and almost picked up a
stone to chuck at the bunker

971
01:33:02,529 --> 01:33:04,087
Sir!
- Relax... relax

972
01:33:04,865 --> 01:33:07,333
As per the CO's plan,
we must shift base today

973
01:33:07,934 --> 01:33:10,664
The new base will be closer
to the eastern side

974
01:33:10,871 --> 01:33:11,838
At Soopra village

975
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:14,507
Right, sir

976
01:33:22,682 --> 01:33:26,675
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...

977
01:33:26,887 --> 01:33:31,017
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear

978
01:33:35,595 --> 01:33:39,497
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...

979
01:33:39,799 --> 01:33:43,860
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear

980
01:33:44,504 --> 01:33:48,372
We must keep moving now

981
01:33:48,642 --> 01:33:52,510
with one single thought
in all our minds

982
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,807
We must keep moving now

983
01:33:57,317 --> 01:34:01,185
with one single thought
in all our minds

984
01:34:01,388 --> 01:34:05,552
Come what may! We will melt
stone with our intensity

985
01:34:05,759 --> 01:34:09,718
Come what may! We will
overshadow mountains like clouds

986
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:13,764
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...

987
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:18,196
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear

988
01:34:27,647 --> 01:34:31,743
Lets enter the battlefield
ready to sacrifice our life

989
01:34:31,952 --> 01:34:36,252
Never rest until we have
reached our destination

990
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:48,427
We have the courage to
laugh in the face of adversities

991
01:34:48,635 --> 01:34:52,765
We have the strength to
twist the arm of death

992
01:34:52,973 --> 01:34:56,932
We are a wall of steel
guarding our borders

993
01:34:57,143 --> 01:35:01,273
We are alert and ready
for any enemy

994
01:35:01,481 --> 01:35:05,611
Come what may! We will melt
stone with our intensity

995
01:35:05,819 --> 01:35:09,983
Come what may! We will
overshadow mountains like clouds

996
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:13,853
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...

997
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:18,292
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear

998
01:35:54,768 --> 01:35:58,727
Keep the flame of fervor
alight in your heart

999
01:35:59,072 --> 01:36:03,168
And you shall sing
the song of victory

1000
01:36:03,476 --> 01:36:07,037
Keep the flame of fervor
alight in your heart

1001
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:11,414
And you shall sing
the song of victory

1002
01:36:11,951 --> 01:36:16,251
The portrait of victory
we're out to paint

1003
01:36:16,456 --> 01:36:20,017
will be coloured by our blood

1004
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,690
We all know, in our hearts now...

1005
01:36:24,898 --> 01:36:28,698
It's either do or die!

1006
01:36:33,139 --> 01:36:37,940
Even if fire and lightning
befall our path

1007
01:36:39,546 --> 01:36:44,882
You will not be alone,
my brothers in arms

1008
01:36:45,819 --> 01:36:49,880
Whatever be the hardship
whatever be the strife...

1009
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:54,390
Your comrades are with
you now and forever

1010
01:36:54,594 --> 01:36:58,724
Come what may! We will melt
stone with our intensity

1011
01:36:58,932 --> 01:37:03,392
Come what may! We will
overshadow mountains like clouds

1012
01:37:03,603 --> 01:37:07,061
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...

1013
01:37:07,273 --> 01:37:11,573
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear

1014
01:37:29,496 --> 01:37:37,403
I often think about the one I love
Her memory torments my heart
