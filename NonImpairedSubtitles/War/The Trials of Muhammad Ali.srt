(SILENCE)

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,062
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

3
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,031
Well, now, with just a
slight skip of the heart,

4
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,666
we have, I think, got through
to Chicago and Muhammad Ali.

5
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,936
- Are you hearing us from London,
Muhammad? -<i> Yes, Sir. Loud and clear.</i>

6
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,273
- <i>How are you doing today? - Very
well. Thank you. Welcome to the show.</i>

7
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:46,645
<i>Thank you for allowing me to come to
you live by Early Bird satellite.</i>

8
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,815
Now, let me just get a few
facts straight with you.

9
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,618
You're a professional
fighter, right?

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,789
<i>I am a minister of the
religion of Islam also.</i>

11
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,824
A professional fighter
and a minister as well.

12
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:04,063
- <i>Yes, Sir. - David Susskind would
like to ask you some questions. David.</i>

13
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,431
Well, I don't know
where to begin.

14
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:11,003
I find nothing amusing or interesting
or tolerable about this man.

15
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,406
He's a disgrace to his
country, his race...

16
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,609
and what he laughingly
describes as his profession.

17
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,013
He is a convicted felon
in the United States.

18
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,515
He has been found guilty.

19
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,483
He is out on bail.

20
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,786
He will inevitably go to
prison, as well he should.

21
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,623
He's a simplistic
fool and a pawn.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,728
(MAN)
Muhammad Ali.

23
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,499
One of the greatest
athletes of all time.

24
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,903
As the first three-time heavyweight
boxing champion of the world,

25
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,040
he thrilled, entertained
and inspired us.

26
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,743
<i>(LOUIS FARRAKHAN) He was
given the Medal of Freedom...</i>

27

<i>by the president of
the United States.</i>

28
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,883
(PRESIDENT BUSH) The American people
are proud to call Muhammad Ali...

29
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,819
- one of our own.
- (APPLAUSE)

30
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:12,064
<i>(FARRAKHAN) What does it
mean, the Medal of Freedom?</i>

31
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,599
<i>We bring you up. Oh, yes.</i>

32
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:19,104
<i>This is Muhammad Ali, the great
fighter, the great humanitarian,</i>

33
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>the great Muslim.</i>

34
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,608
<i>Years ago,</i>

35
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,544
Ali came and sat right here.

36
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,413
And Ali looked at me.

37
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:33,318
He said, "Still a nigger."

38
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,755
I said, "Oh, Ali."

39
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,591
Don't talk like that."

40
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,795
He said, "Still a nigger."

41
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,400
What did my brother mean?

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,718
(APPLAUSE)

43
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,559
<i>(ALI) Olympic champion,
and the flag is going...</i>

44
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:17,529
(Humming
"Star-Spangled Banner")

45
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,798
<i>And I'm standing so proud.</i>

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,999
<i>I just hear the man say,</i>

47
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:25,737
"Champion of the whole world...
Cassius Clay."

48
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,240
(RAHAMAN)
Olympic champion of the world...

49
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,041
...from Kentucky.

50
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,811
Southern boy raised poor becoming
a gold medal winner, oh, man.

51
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,014
Oh! I still get excited.

52
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:41,153
Me, my mother, my father were
standing at the terminal

53
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,322
when he came off the plane.

54
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,723
I was so happy.

55
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,459
It was beautiful. Beautiful.

56
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,032
Any ideas now as to whom
you might sign with?

57
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,769
I would like to get with a nice,
honest crowd. Nice, clean people.

58
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,106
And with the right backing, I
believe I'll have a chance...

59
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,774
<i>to become the world's
heavyweight champion.</i>

60
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:07,846
It's best to be with somebody you know
and from your own town if possible.

61
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,924
I'm Gordon B. Davidson, attorney for
the Louisville Sponsoring Group,

62
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:25,063
owner of Cassius Clay and the hired hand to
keep the group and Cassius Clay together.

63
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,768
<i>(DAVIDSON) We had a contract
with Ali for six years.</i>

64
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,806
<i>We were as powerful a group as you
could put together in Louisville.</i>

65
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,776
These were all capitalists.

66
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:42,047
I'm Bill Faversham, vice
president of Brown-Foreman,

67
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,983
and one of the founders of
the group of Cassius Clay.

68
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,552
<i>I'm also his manager.</i>

69
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,989
I'm W.L. Lyons Brown,

70
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,660
chairman of the board of Brown-Foreman
Distillers Corporation.

71
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,062
I'm also a farmer and
in the oil business.

72
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,866
<i>(DAVIDSON) The original
group, they're all deceased.</i>

73
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,235
I'm the only survivor.

74
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,574
<i>The reason for the group was
to aid, assist and protect...</i>

75
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,844
<i>this fine Louisville athlete.</i>

76
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,815
<i>He was a young fellow
who wanted to be great.</i>

77
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,908
<i>(MAN) Cassius, you
say you're gonna be</i>

78
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,055
<i>champion by the time you're 21.
Is that right?</i>

79
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:28,193
As you know, today is the jet age.
Everybody's trying to break records.

80
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:32,297
<i>There's the man who says that
he'll be on the Moon by 1970.</i>

81
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,233
<i>They're gonna make cars
that will run by sunlight.</i>

82
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,003
Well, those are pretty
game predictions.

83
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,172
<i>I wouldn't want to do too
much bragging about it,</i>

84
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,631
<i>but everybody that watches
me, they say that.</i>

85
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:47,112
<i>I'm the greatest that
they've ever seen.</i>

86
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,615
<i>(DAVIDSON) But did I think he
would be the heavyweight champion?</i>

87
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,984
<i>I had doubts about it.</i>

88
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,753
And I think the group
had doubts about it...

89
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:58,357
because the odds, it's like
winning the Kentucky Derby.

90
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:02,361
<i>You have a horse, and the
horse looks pretty good,</i>

91
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,464
but it is gonna win the Derby?

92
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,667
<i>He never had a doubt about it.</i>

93
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,037
<i>For me to say it was
a civic thing...</i>

94
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,005
<i>...it was.</i>

95
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,710
This is the house behind us that
Muhammad and I were raised in...

96
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,880
<i>for the first 13
years of our life.</i>

97
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,921
<i>(MUHAMMAD ALI) Who's the champ?
I'm the champ.</i>

98
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,490
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>You come on.</i>

99
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,960
I was good, but he was
more gifted than I.

100
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,562
Left jab,

101
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,897
right cross,

102
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,332
hook.

103
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,904
<i>(RAHAMAN) And we shared a room together.
It had twin beds.</i>

104
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,739
<i>He had a bed on one
side on the room.</i>

105
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,041
I had a bed on the
side of the room.

106
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,414
<i>And from Mom, we got kindness,</i>

107
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,884
gentleness, sweetness
and affection, love.

108
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,386
All the good things from Mom.

109
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,790
My father, his name was
Cassius M. Clay Sr.

110
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,392
As I understand, I'm
Cassius Marcellus Clay Vi.

111
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:11,029
<i>Well, Cassius Marcellus Clay
is a great name in Kentucky.</i>

112
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,131
<i>(DAVIDSON)</i>
<i>Cassius Marcellus Clay...</i>

113
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,333
the old guy, the white guy,

114
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,836
<i>for whom Cassius was named...</i>

115
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,206
<i>he was a very strong
abolitionist.</i>

116
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:26,812
<i>I did talk to the Clays a lot.
Always a very friendly relationship.</i>

117
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:32,384
The father was kind of an
in-and-out sort of fellow...

118
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:37,255
<i>who painted signs and other
things for a living.</i>

119
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,994
(RAHAMAN) My father was painting
the churches here in Louisville.

120
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,647
My dad painted this
beautiful portrait of

121
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,650
Jesus Christ rescuing Peter.

122
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:10,856
Peter started denying to believe
in Christ and he started sinking.

123
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,858
<i>(ALI) When I went
to church on Sunday,</i>

124
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,092
<i>and I always asked my mother,</i>

125
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,894
<i>"How come is
everything white?"</i>

126
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,465
I said, "Why is Jesus white
with blond hair and blue eyes?"

127
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,633
<i>Angels are white."</i>

128
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,337
<i>I knew something was wrong,
but I couldn't pinpoint it.</i>

129
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:30,275
<i>(DAVIDSON) They had a lawyer
whose name was Alberta Jones.</i>

130
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:35,013
<i>She was an African-American
lawyer and a very good one.</i>

131
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:40,952
<i>He had little regard for money,
except he wanted to have it to spend.</i>

132
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,521
<i>When the group had him,</i>

133
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:48,193
<i>the top rate for
income tax was 91%.</i>

134
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,794
It's now 35.

135
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:55,901
So the more he made, the more
he paid to the government.

136
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,569
<i>To solve that problem,</i>

137
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,038
<i>the group paid for
everything...</i>

138
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,609
<i>so he could just
concentrate on his boxing.</i>

139
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:09,347
<i>(MAN) Cassius, do you
believe that a fighter...</i>

140
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,283
<i>actually tries to
kill another fighter?</i>

141
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,885
<i>Does he get that vicious?
Do you get that vicious?</i>

142
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,322
Every time I enter a ring,
I intend to down him.

143
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,490
And if he should
fall, he falls.

144
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:23,662
<i>Well, that's everybody's
intention or we wouldn't go in.</i>

145
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:32,070
We had a fund that we fondly jokingly
called "The Orange Juice Fund."

146
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,007
<i>When he was in Florida,
we would get the bills...</i>

147
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,444
<i>and they would be in
the range of, say,</i>

148
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,914
<i>2,000 gallons worth
of orange juice.</i>

149
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:48,753
And we knew that he wasn't drinking
2,000 gallons of orange juice.

150
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:54,125
<i>But the entourage managed to get

00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,204
I remember the exact moment
we told my dad and mom.

442
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:51,909
We said, "The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad gave us our name".

443
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,277
They became very angry.

444
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,045
They said, "What in the
world do you mean?"

445
00:26:55,047 --> 00:27:01,051

Ali." You got to accept it.</i>

What does it mean?

447
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:07,124
"Muhammad" means "worthy of all
praises" and "Ali" means "most high."

<i>(LIPSYTE) At theNew York

<i>And it really kind
of bothered me.</i>

Nobody asked John Wayne or Rock
Hudson what their names were.

453

<i>But I tried to slip
it in when I could.</i>

<i>I usually ended up writing "Muhammad
Ali, a.k.a. Cassius Clay."</i>

His change of name,
what did it threaten?

456
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:40,357
If he was white, they would be referring
to him as the All-American boy.

<i>(MUWAKKIL) It was an

cultish as the Nation of Islam.

- Or Muhammad, you're talking...
- I'm not no white man.

463
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:02,046
So you want to keep calling me a
white man's name. I'm not white.

464
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,682
I don't want to be called
after your name no more.

465
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:08,285
I'm not no slave.
I'm Muhammad Ali.

One of the main reasons is your

if it doesn't adopt the
Sunni practice of Islam,

533

that it will disintegrate
and fall apart.

There's no organization

that could do more for the
struggling black man...

than the black Muslim
movement if it wanted to.

the possession...

or should I follow the teacher

Elijah Muhammad called
all of his officials...

national officials to
Chicago in October...

547
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:23,367

maim any of his followers...

731
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:28,231
"If I went to war, I would probably be in
one of them boxing things like Joe Louis.

732
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,400
I wouldn't be really
fighting in the war."

733
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:32,235
I says, "That's
not the point."

734
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:38,107
You have to understand that once
you sign your name to that army,

735
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,645
then you are their
slave forever.

736
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,080
Okay?

737
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:47,150
So just say hell no,
you ain't gonna go.

738
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:50,119
Rhyme it. Do what you do best.

739
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:54,357
Those people over there in
Vietnam did not lynch you,

740
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,226
<i>did not break up your family.</i>

741
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:01,030
Those Vietnamese people
are your brothers.

742
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,033
<i>This was a wrongful war.</i>

743
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,602
<i>War is wrong. Period.</i>

744
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,977
<i>"War is made from the devil."</i>

745
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:25,321
I was sitting in my office in
Louisville and the phone rang...

746
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:26,255
and it was Angelo Dundee.

747
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:32,528
<i>And he said the champ is gonna announce
he's gonna be a conscientious objector,</i>

748
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,065
<i>and he's not gonna take
that step forward.</i>

749
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,068
And I said, "Oh."
(CHUCKLES)

750
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,472
I said, uh, "I'll
be right up there."

751
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:50,113
<i>The conscientious objector
thing was a complete shock.</i>

752
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,318
<i>A conscientious objector,
as a matter of law,</i>

753
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:02,625
was that if you believed that you should
not kill somebody or carry a weapon...

754
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:07,663
or participate in an activity
which would result in death,

755
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:11,234
<i>that you did not
have to serve.</i>

756
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:13,569
<i>I personally told him...</i>

757
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:18,374
that this was gonna cost
him millions of dollars.

758
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,476
<i>And then I went over,
chapter and verse,</i>

759
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:24,180
the contracts that were on
my desk to be signed...

760
00:46:24,182 --> 00:46:28,084
would not be offered
to him again.

761
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,154
<i>(ABDUL RAHMAN MUHAMMAD) If he
had not become Muhammad Ali,</i>

762
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:32,455
<i>he'd have been Cassius Clay,</i>

763
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,557
<i>and he would have
went into that army.</i>

764
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,125
<i>'Cause he asked
me straight up.</i>

765
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,195
He said, "What would you do
if you was in my shoes?"

766
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:40,630
I said, "I'd do what
Elijah Muhammad done."

767
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:43,666
He said, "What would he did?"
I said, "He went to jail."

768
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:48,404
<i>(FARRAKHAN) Elijah Muhammad
went to prison for five years.</i>

769
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:52,074
For sedition and
draft dodging,

770
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,110
<i>they called it.</i>

771
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:57,213
He set the standard.

772
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,415
<i>(DAVIDSON)</i>
<i>The contract with the.</i>

773

<i>Louisville Sponsoring

774
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,754
<i>The group... they
were disappointed,</i>

775
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:08,224
<i>and one or two didn't want
to be affiliated with...</i>

776
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:13,262
It was more of the draft business
than it was the Muslim business.

777
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,731
Although that was part of it.

778
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:20,736
He called all members to say
thanks and shake hands,

779
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:24,607
<i>and au revoir.</i>
<i>(CHUCKLES)</i>

782
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:43,159
I will not go 10,000

788
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:09,418
<i>To tell me that I'm
fighting for America...</i>

789
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,821
and her way of life.

790
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:14,957
What<i> is</i> her way of life?

791
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,827
<i>To come back home

792

with all these
medals on our chest?

793
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:22,431
Hell, no.

794
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,902
Mr. Muhammad Ali has just
refused to be inducted...

795
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,737
into the United
States Armed Forces.

796
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:32,441
Notification of his refusal is being
made to the United States Attorney...

797
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,477
<i>and the local Selective
Service Board...</i>

798
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,412
<i>for whatever action
deem to be appropriate.</i>

799
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,388
<i>(MAN) And so it is all
over for the heavyweight</i>

800
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:42,385
<i>champion of the
world, Muhammad Ali.</i>

801
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,887
What happens now to his title?

802
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:46,522
He will doubtless be
stripped of it...

803
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:49,292
by every state boxing
commission in this country...

804
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:50,927
and by the World
Boxing Association.

805
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:53,496
All type of moves have
been made against me...

806
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:55,898
that's never been made before
in the history of boxing.

807
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,503
Regardless of the ultimate
disposition of his case legally,

808
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:04,173
<i>he will no longer
be the champion.</i>

809
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:14,884
Well, now that they've taken Cassius Clay's
title away, do you think they should have?

810
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:17,687
Well, I don't know. I
think they should, yes.

811
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,623
I think that any man who don't
wanna fight for his country,

812
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,526
I don't think he should have
the honor of being champion.

813
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:24,293
The tragedy to me is...

814
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:29,532
that Cassius has made millions of
dollars off of the American public.

815
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:33,502
And now he's not willing
to show his appreciation.

816
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,071
<i>Hurts the morale of a lot of</i>

817
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:37,473
<i>young Negro soldiers
over in Vietnam.</i>

818
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,841
<i>(MAN) You won't fight
for your country?</i>

819
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,610
- You refuse to go into the...
- I'm a minister. My religion.

820
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:42,845
This country has
laws for ministers.

821
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,747
- <i>Are you an ordained minister?
- By my leader.</i>

822
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:49,885
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Almighty
God Allah fights battles for us.

823
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:52,822
We are forbidden to carry
anything like a weapon.

824
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,690
<i>We are peaceful people.</i>

825
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,459
<i>(MAN) Do you think
there's anything wrong...</i>

826
00:49:56,461 --> 00:50:00,896
<i>in someone like Cassius Clay,
Muhammad Ali, in refusing induction?</i>

827
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:01,898
Yes, Sir, I certainly do.

828
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,000
- Why? - 'Cause he's no
better than the rest of us.

829
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,302
I got a wife and three kids
I'd like to stay here with,

830
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:07,603
but if they need me,
I reckon I'll go.

831
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,439
Simply because Muhammad
Ali has these beliefs,

832
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:14,110
there's no reason why people
should go against him.

833
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,485
It took an all-white jury
less than a half hour...

834
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:26,889
to find Muhammad Ali guilty of
all charges and specifications.

835
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:30,826
He was sentenced to the maximum
five years in prison...

836
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:33,696
and was fined $10,000.

837
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:38,401
<i>(MUWAKKIL) To have a heavyweight
champion refuse to be inducted,</i>

838
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:39,502
that was almost blasphemous.

839
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:44,373
(MAN) This would mean, of course, that
you stand the chance of going to jail...

840
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,609
as a result of not
going into service.

841
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,910
Well, whatever the punishment,

842
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:52,281
whatever the persecution is for
standing up for my religious beliefs,

843
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,884
even if it mean facing
machine gun fire that day,

844
00:50:54,886 --> 00:51:00,689
I will face it before denouncing Elijah
Muhammad and the religion of Islam.

845
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:01,991
I'm ready to die.

846
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:06,896
<i>(KHALILAH) I was happy that this
black man, he actually stood up...</i>

847
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,365
and did what a
Muslim would do.

848
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:12,568
And that took a lot of balls.

849
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,739
<i>And he would come into my...</i>

850
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:21,544
<i>He would try to, you know... try
to get to me, but he couldn't.</i>

851
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,580
<i>And he would be trying
to look for me.</i>

852
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,349
<i>But by us having all
the white unis on,</i>

853
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,386
<i>he had to try to look at your
face because he couldn't tell.</i>

854
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,621
So he would always eye
at me in the mosque...

855
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:36,892
and keep his eyes and all that...
you know, flirting like.

856
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,929
<i>I knew he was mine.
He was mine then.</i>

857
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,932
<i>(ABDUL BEY MUHAMMAD) When I find
out that's who he was gonna Marry,</i>

858
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:43,566
<i>I jumped for Joy.</i>

859
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:47,770
<i>(ABDUL RAHMAN MUHAMMAD) It was a big
blessing to him. She was a virgin.</i>

860
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,672
To Marry a virgin...

861
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:55,411
I said, "Boy, you hit the
jackpot." That's what I told him.

862
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:56,512
And she was young and pretty.

863
00:51:56,514 --> 00:52:03,085
Khalilah... one of a kind.
She's the female Muhammad Ali.

864
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,121
<i>Sweet, kind, good lady.</i>

865
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:09,358
He loved the fact that I stuck with
him when he didn't have anything.

866
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,827
<i>I tried to keep
everything positive...</i>

867
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,530
<i>and started a family, and
that was a good thing.</i>

868
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,932
- (CRYING)
- I'm not having no trouble out of you.

869
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,601
There ain't but one big
mouth in this family.

870
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,804
<i>(KHALILAH) I said, "Brother,

your mind clear, you will win this fight."

872
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:30,179
The government fight has
cost nearly some $200,000...

873
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:34,016
plus my living expenses... my mother, my
father, my brother, my wife, my children.

<i>(MAN) Boxing commissions around the
country wouldn't sanction his fights.</i>

875

to work here now in America.

876

I'm not allowed

877

Is there any chance
of you boxing?

878
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:48,964
I really don't know.

879
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:50,833
One day we might.
I'm not too sure.

880
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:54,803
<i>(MAN) I tried to get him
back into the ring...</i>

881
00:52:54,805 --> 00:53:00,075

him to fight in their state.

882
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:02,878
<i>Alabama.</i>

883

<i>Utah.</i>

884
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,015
Jackson, Mississippi.

885
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:09,518
The white man told me to
get back on the airplane.

886
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,888
<i>I tried Alcatraz Island.</i>

887
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,791
<i>I tried every place
that I could think of.</i>

888
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:18,861
<i>(MAN) The only answer to the
beleaguerments of Muhammad Ali...</i>

889
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:23,866
<i>might be the stripped jet plane sailing
above all local jurisdictions...</i>

890
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:26,101
<i>with two fighters
and 200 fans.</i>

891
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:30,139
They had tried to put
a ring inside a 757.

892

<i>(MAN) Wilt, there's been rumors that
you are ready to fight Cassius Clay.</i>

893
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:34,944
<i>Are any of these rumors true?</i>

894
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:37,947
<i>(CHAMBERLAIN) Actually fighting
Muhammad Ali was not a rumor.</i>

895
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:41,550
That was a plan. But right
now it's all down the drain.

896
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,387
We start doing the
speaking engagements.

897
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:50,059
<i>(LIPSYTE) That was the circuit
that really sustained him.</i>

898
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:50,993
<i>He got paid.</i>

899
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,863
<i>(ALI) Black and white are
opposite of one another.</i>

900
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:57,132
The opposite of good is bad.

901
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:59,034
The opposite of hot is cold.

902
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:02,805
<i>(LIPSYTE) In the
beginning, he was terrible.</i>

903
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:05,774
And the opposite
of black is white.

904
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:08,244
He would go into Muslim dogma.

905
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:11,747
What is it that the
Muslims believe?

906
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:17,586
Number one, we're gonna say a few
things on what the Muslims want.

907
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,990
Remember, he was 12 years old...

908
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:23,759
when he committed
himself to boxing.

909
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:27,062
<i>Suddenly, you're in this
tunnel of your talent.</i>

910
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:32,868
<i>You just concentrate on being this
great boxer, which he became.</i>

911
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:37,373
<i>You wave through so many
of the tollbooths of life.</i>

912
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:43,279
<i>So now suddenly, it's 1967.</i>

913
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:46,482
<i>He has refused
to step forward.</i>

914
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:48,984
<i>He's 25 years old.</i>

915
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,689
<i>He's out on his own. He's
on college campuses.</i>

916
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:56,692
<i>He thought all these kids were
really smart kids out there.</i>

917
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,560
<i>They were going to ask him
really tough questions,</i>

918
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,729
<i>which, to a great
extent, they did.</i>

919
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:04,533
In time of peace, would you
allow yourself to be drafted?

920
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:07,503
- Would you?
- Yes, Sir.

921
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:09,104
Why?

922
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:13,642
Do you think that the United
States will eventually separate...

923
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,278
into two different
societies, black and white?

924
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,816
Well, the latest government
fact-finding committee...

925
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,285
said that this is what
it's coming to be...

926
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:25,554
and this is what it's
shaping up to be.

927
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,990
I'd like to ask you why
you're still a Muslim...

928
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:32,661
since it's a far-gone conclusion
that the Muslim... Muslims...

929
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,230
or two or three... I
don't know which...

930
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:37,800
did assassinate Malcolm X.

931
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,002
Anybody that'd
assassinate anybody...

932
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:42,938
or anybody that carry
weapons are not Muslims.

933
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,307
A Muslim wouldn't
carry a weapon,

934
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:47,142
and a Muslim wouldn't
assassinate nobody.

935
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:52,981
<i>(KHALILAH) Muslims have always been
under surveillance all our lives.</i>

to find anything they can to
put these Muslims down or out.

939
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:07,463
They're there waiting
for that moment.

<i>(WINSTON) I did a lot
of those spots with Ali.</i>

941

He got exposure, being free.

942
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,416
And away from being coached,

943
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:31,220
I just watched him grow
up to become a man.

944
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:37,092
Well, I would say Black Power would be the
same thing to me that White Power is,

945
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,994
but leave out the brutality.

Building your own houses,
factories and hospitals.

950
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,482
I think that he's
teaching the black people

951
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,279
to hate white, and I
think that's very wrong.

952
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:59,848
I was opposed to his views
before he came here,

953
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,383
and I still am opposed
to his views...

954
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,118
because I feel if he
wants American rights,

955
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,887
then he should assume
responsibility of the draft.

about you. You got to keep going."</i>

961

we're your enemies.

1042
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:32,521

see it every day.

1043
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:35,390
And every black man watching
this show know you our enemies,

1044
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:37,359

It may be with the

01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:44,999
and now the high court will
decide whether he's right.

1232
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,301
Is your client a pacifist?

1233
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:50,038
A pacifist is, uh... is...
is, uh, strict language.

1234

him as a pacifist.</i>

Of course there's this

1460
01:24:55,557 --> 01:25:00,627
<i>(ABDUL RAHMAN MUHAMMAD) Ali... he
has made more people examine Islam.</i>

1461
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:03,831
And they find that Islam
ain't what the government...

1462
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:08,469
and the enemies of Islam
trying to make it out to be.

1463
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:10,003
<i>(MUWAKKIL)</i>
<i>Since 9/11,</i>

1464
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:14,775
Islam has acquired so many layers
and dimensions and textures.

1465
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:17,911
<i>When the Nation of Islam was
considered as a threatening religion,</i>

1466
01:25:17,913 --> 01:25:22,749
<i>traditional Islam was seen
as a gentle alternative.</i>

1467
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:25,686
- (CHANTING)
- <i> And now quite the contrary.</i>

1468
01:25:25,688 --> 01:25:28,989
<i>The Nation of Islam is seen
as a tame domestic version...</i>

1469
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:32,993
<i>and traditional Islam is seen
as the threatening thing.</i>

1470
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:36,096
<i>Muhammad Ali occupies a
weird kind of place...</i>

1471
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:40,534
<i>in that shifting
interpretation of Islam.</i>

1472
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:45,639
<i>(KHALILAH) He'll always be
the greatest fighter ever.</i>

1473
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,442
<i>But I just outgrew him.</i>

1474
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,747
My father's first marriage
was to Sonji Roi,

1475
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:56,950
<i>and it didn't last
long, about a year.</i>

1476
01:25:56,952 --> 01:26:00,354
<i>His second wife, he
had four kids with.</i>

1477
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,689
(MOUTHING WORDS)

1478
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:06,126
<i>His third wife, Veronica
Porsche, my mother,</i>

1479
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:09,096
he had myself and
my sister, Laila.

1480
01:26:09,098 --> 01:26:10,931
And his current wife, Lonnie,

1481
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:12,933
<i>they adopted
together one child.</i>

1482
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:16,837
<i>And my father has two children
by women he was not married to.</i>

1483
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:19,373
<i>So there's nine of us, and
we're one big happy family...</i>

1484
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:22,509
<i>'cause he brought us together
in the summers every year.</i>

1485
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:27,381
Probably drove my mother crazy and
everybody else crazy. We had a ball.

1486
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:33,020
<i>(KHALILAH) I see him at
certain family events.</i>

1487
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:35,522
<i>It hurts sometimes to
look at him too long.</i>

1488
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:40,360
I can be around for a few minutes
and then I have to walk away.

1489
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:44,565
<i>But then I see there's
a good Aura there.</i>

1490
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:47,668
Then I'll penetrate it
with some good memories.

1491
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:52,272
And then I fall in love
with him all over again.

1492
01:26:52,409 --> 01:26:55,209
<i>(ALI) All the wealth
of the universe...</i>

1493
01:26:55,211 --> 01:27:02,749
and all the wealth on Earth
is equal to mosquitoes...

1494
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:05,852
compared to what you
get in the next life.

1495
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:11,225
Some who know him believe that all those
blows to the head damaged his brain,

1496
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:14,628
that he is no longer
the man he was inside.

1497
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:18,131
<i>(HANA) He has Parkinson's,
as the world knows.</i>

1498
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:19,566
But he's healthy otherwise.

1499
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:23,804
He is happy being Muhammad Ali.
He enjoys who he is.

1500
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:24,905
<i>He's not in any pain.</i>

1501
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:27,741
<i>He believes that everything
has a purpose and a time.</i>

1502
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:30,611
<i>And, you know, he's...
he's happy.</i>

1503
01:27:30,613 --> 01:27:33,981
When you do the right thing, man,
you will prevail at the end.

1504
01:27:33,983 --> 01:27:36,717
It's just a matter of you being
out there in the front...

1505
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,621
of the people who haven't
caught up with you yet.

1506
01:27:40,623 --> 01:27:42,923
(CHEERING)

1507
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:52,165
When he lit the
Olympic torch in '96,

1508
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:54,568
<i>I felt tears in my eyes.</i>

1509
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:57,838
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

1510
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,007
(APPLAUSE)

1511
01:28:00,009 --> 01:28:04,244
<i>(ANNOUNCER)</i>
<i>The greatest of all time!</i>

1512
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:08,515
But to see him carry that,

1513
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:12,953
uh, it was a big-time howdy.

1514
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:16,223
It was a perfect
poetic moment.

1515
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:22,829
If anybody should've lit the
torch in any Olympic Games,

1516
01:28:22,831 --> 01:28:26,533
<i>it should have
been Muhammad Ali.</i>

1517
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:28,568
<i>(LIPSYTE)</i>
<i>In the '60s and '70s,</i>

1518
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:33,674
<i>he was the most recognizable
face in the world.</i>

1519
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:36,810
We created a symbol.

1520
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:43,550
<i>Muhammad Ali has long
since been supplanted...</i>

1521
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:47,621
<i>by what we believe he is.</i>

1522
01:28:47,623 --> 01:28:50,157
One more time! Who's the
champ of the world?

1523
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,091
(AUDIENCE)
Muhammad Ali!

1524
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:54,161
<i>(LIPSYTE) There are so many
ways of looking at him...</i>

1525
01:28:54,163 --> 01:28:57,297
<i>that have only
to do with us...</i>

1526
01:28:57,299 --> 01:29:02,069
<i>and have nothing
to do with him.</i>

1527
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:07,574
When Muhammad Ali
took that stand...

1528
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:12,279
- That was a hell of a stand.
- It certainly was.

1529
01:29:12,281 --> 01:29:15,649
<i>(HANA) And my father was
always more than a boxer.</i>

1530
01:29:15,651 --> 01:29:17,951
To me, he's the eighth
wonder of the world.

1531
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:19,219
That's the one title
I'm waiting for.

1532
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:23,190
Muhammad Ali... the eighth
wonder of the world.

1533
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:30,197
<i>(RAHAMAN)</i>
<i>I love you, champ.</i>

1534
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:31,832
You're my soul and my heart.

1535
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:34,101
Only brother I got. Love you.

1536
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:38,038
I love you. Peace.
