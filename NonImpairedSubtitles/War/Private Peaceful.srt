1
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,242
This field general court martial
finds the accused, Private Peaceful,

2
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:31,207
guilty as charged in accordance
with Section 4 of the Army Act.

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,535
You will remain in custody until sentenced.

4
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,373
These proceedings are now terminated,
take away the prisoner.

5
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,050
Sir, prisoner and escort, left turn.

6
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,421
Left, right, left, right, left.

7
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,595
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

8
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,387
Left, right, left, right, left, right...

9
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,278
Ten to midnight.

10
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,652
I shan't sleep.

11
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,154
I won't dream it away.

12
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,999
Tonight, more than any other night of my life,

13
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,494
I want to feel alive.

14
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,097
Let's go. Before we get caught.

15
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,437
Twelve pheasants.

16
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,781
- Twelve?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,450
My land, my pheasants.

18
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,170
We should be out, working in the fields.

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,041
We'll learn more at school. It's not so bad.

20
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,633
Honest.

21
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,136
Whenever you say honest, Charlie,

22
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,881
I know it's not true.

23
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,678
H6)'...

24
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,404
Fred.

25
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,825
All right, Pete.

26
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,829
- Hello.
- Hello.

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,202
Watch where you're going, Peaceful.

28
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,704
Mr Munnings is coming!

29
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,343
You do not come to school in bare feet.

30
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,507
You do not lie.

31
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,597
You do not cheat.

32
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,855
These are my commandments.

33
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,687
Do I make myself clear?

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,855
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,907
Admiral Nelson.

36
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,906
General Baden-Powell.

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,783
Great British heroes.

38
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:24,793
Fighting for king and country.

39
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,291
From Waterloo...

40
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,593
"Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,

41
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,553
"O, what a panic's in thy breastie!"

42
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,260
"Still thou are blest, compared wi' me!"

43
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,804
"The present only toucheth thee."

44
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,218
Yes, Nipper?

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,058
Why am you be talking foreign, miss?

46
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,899
It's not foreign, it's about a mouse.

47
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,146
It's Scottish.

48
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,061
And where is Scotland?

49
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,405
England, miss?

50
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,610
I can do it, Charlie.

51
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,914
Double knot, so it will never come undone.

52
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,660
Is he your brother?

53
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,663
What does your dad do?

54
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,421
Gamekeeper.

55
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,424
My dad's a rat catcher.

56
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,506
Like the Pied Piper?

57
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,637
Yes. Only he don't like children.

58
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,423
Tommo.

59
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,513
Hello, Joe.

60
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,474
That's lovely, Joe.

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,768
Oranges and lemons...

62
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,650
- He's got a loony for a brother.
- What did you say, Jimmy Parsons?

63
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,489
Your brother's a loony,
your brother's a loony.

64
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,111
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

65
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,667
Jimmy Parsons
won't be doing that again, Tommo.

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,673
Got him in the goolies.

67
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,890
Your wife, sir.

68
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,193
Can't we stay outside
in the fresh air a little longer?

69
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,781
It's far too cold.

70
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,033
Thank you.

71
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,290
And what did you boys
get up to at school today?

72
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,920
This and that.

73
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,629
What have you done to your face, Tommo?

74
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,931
Bread and butter pudding, my favourite.

75
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,392
Tommo.

76
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,782
My favourite.

77
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,416
- Hello, Joe.
- Father.

78
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,915
How was the shoot, James?

79
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,339
Ask the boys.

80
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,293
We were at school. Honest.

81
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,086
Colonel saw the best of it.

82
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,423
He's a silly old fart.

83
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,137
Mad old duffer.

84
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,765
He may well be a silly old fart,

85
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,315
but it's the Colonel who pays your wage
and puts the roof above your head.

86
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,192
It's not his money, he married into it.

87
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,195
- Now, now...
- He's a silly old bugger.

88
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,115
You must show more respect.

89
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,281
Well, I show my respect
where respect's due, my love.

90
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,615
"What big eyes you have, Grandma, '

91
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,200
"said Little Red Riding Hood.

92
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,374
"'All the better to see with, ' said the wolf.

93
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,501
"What big teeth you have, Grandma.'

94
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,382
"'All the better

95
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,714
"'to gobble you up."'

96
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,347
We're too old for this.

97
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,847
Big Joe don't get stories
like you do at school.

98
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,969
School.

99
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,554
Will you come up to the woods with me
on Saturday, Tommo?

100
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,140
We'll clear the dead trees.

101
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,978
The only dead wood around here
that needs clearing's in Tommo's head.

102
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,564
I thought you were putting the boys to bed.

103
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,576
What are all you men looking at?

104
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,047
Seems sad to chop down the old trees.

105
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,383
Well, it clears space for the walnuts.

106
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,385
I don't like walnuts.

107
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,171
Walnut trees are special.

108
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,844
- Why?
- It's the grain of the wood.

109
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,510
It makes fine furniture.

110
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,102
Come on, Biddy,
these ladies haven't got all day.

111
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,728
Yes, Miss Far.

112
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,235
Some may not even have that long.

113
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,693
Morning, Aunty.

114
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,907
And what might you be after, Hazel Peaceful?

115
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,402
More blacking for the stove.

116
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529
Well, you'll have to take your turn
like everyone else.

117
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,707
Come on, Joe.

118
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,629
Morning, madam.

119
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,427
The Colonel's usual, if you please.

120
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,554
I'll deliver it myself.

121
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,550
There you go.

122
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,401
My deliverer.

123
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,279
Your pinch of snuff, Colonel.

124
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,573
I'd like to pinch you, Miss Far.

125
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,157
Colonel.

126
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,245
Don't mind him, he's the soul of discretion.

127
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,001
How is your good wife?

128
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,624
Poorly.

129
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,630
Still?

130
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,672
Not long to go, I fear.

131
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,512
I love it here.

132
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,635
Just the two of us.

133
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,940
It's a damn sight more peaceful,
just the one of you.

134
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,612
Which one of us do you love the most?

135
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,356
Me or Charlie?

136
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,486
Or Big Joe?

137
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,363
Or Big Joe.

138
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,991
Well, you know, Big Joe is special.

139
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,453
You know, I have three sons, Tommo.

140
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,203
And each one I've loved so much
that when the next one's come along,

141
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,004
I didn't fathom
how I had any more love in me.

142
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,130
But since you ask,

143
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,305
I love my heir apparent, Charlie, the most.

144
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,174
I hate you.

145
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,803
- I hate you!
- I'm teasing, Tommo!

146
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,334
"Wee, sleekit, cowrin,"

147
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,211
"tim'rous beastie..."

148
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,881
"...sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,

149
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,000
"O, what a panic's in thy breastie!"

150
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,427
"Still thou are blest, compared wi' me!"

151
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,263
"The present only toucheth thee."

152
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,561
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,189
Stay back!

154
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,861
Run!

155
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,621
Run! Tommo, run!

156
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,914
Run!

157
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,105
He should wear his Sunday best.

158
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,322
Needs pressing.

159
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,951
And there's a button missing.

160
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,572
Very James Peaceful, I must say.

161
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,616
James Peaceful was a good man.

162
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,706
One of the finest workers I have known.

163
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,205
Always cheerful as he went about his work.

164
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:12,463
The Peaceful family
have been employed by my family,

165
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,007
by my wife's family,

166
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,593
five generations.

167
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,259
And in all the 20 years,

168
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:28,604
he worked as gamekeeper
and forester on the estate.

169
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,486
James Peaceful was a credit

170
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,325
to his family and his village.

171
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,492
We shall remember him.

172
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,117
We now commit his body to the ground.

173
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,004
Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes.

174
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,502
Dust to dust.

175
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,302
In the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life

176
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,213
through our Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

177
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,306
Amen.

178
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,574
I have no wish
to intrude upon your grief, Mrs Peaceful,

179
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:23,243
and forgive me if this seems
a little indelicate.

180
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,032
But there is the matter of the cottage.

181
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,409
Our cottage?

182
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,082
Strictly speaking, it's a tied cottage.

183
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,756
Tied to your husband's
employment on the estate.

184
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,050
Now, of course, that he's gone...

185
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,422
You want us out?

186
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,171
Well, not if we can come to an arrangement.

187
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,726
There's a position up at the house
that might suit you.

188
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,594
Lady's maid to my dear wife.

189
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,064
That's very good of you, Colonel,
but I have my children.

190
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,684
I have considered that.

191
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,772
And I'm pleased to offer Charles
employment in my hunt kennels.

192
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,782
Thomas, of course, is still at school.

193
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,777
As for the other one,

194
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,123
well, there's always the lunatic asylum.

195
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,252
I could never do that, Colonel, never.

196
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,464
You do understand
the position you're in, Mrs Peaceful?

197
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,582
Yes, I do.

198
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,928
My condolences, Mrs Peaceful.

199
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,931
Miss Far, good day.

200
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,766
You married the first man
that turned your head.

201
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,817
Nothing but a forester.

202
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,944
He couldn't even do that properly.

203
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,280
I'll need your help, Aunty.

204
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,273
No, Hazel.

205
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,571
Please.

206
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,133
How beautiful.

207
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,434
Where has she got to?

208
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,187
Come along now, eat up.

209
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,313
I'm not hungry.

210
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,530
Waste not, want not.

211
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,862
I want bread and butter pudding.

212
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:25,326
Potatoes is all you'll be getting
from now on.

213
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,664
Coarse and vulgar, and no manners.

214
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,493
Mother.

215
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,868
Not now, Joe.

216
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,167
I don't know
what the Colonel was thinking of.

217
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,506
A lady's maid at your age.

218
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,502
Please don't go yet.

219
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,338
I have no time, Hazel.

220
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,966
I have a business to run, you know that.

221
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:59,653
One day, the woodcutter's sons
spied the evil old Colonel

222
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,990
pushing his harmless,
dear little wife into the lake

223
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,324
to drown her.

224
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,243
Charlie...

225
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,404
And so the nasty Colonel
and horrible Grandma Wolf

226
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,702
lived unhappily ever after.

227
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,701
And had lots of monster children

228
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,544
with hairy whiskers
coming out of their nostrils.

229
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,672
Charlie?

230
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,877
Are you thinking about Father?

231
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,179
How he died.

232
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,220
What are we gonna do?

233
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,095
About what?

234
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,017
About Mother.

235
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,397
About Grandma Wolf,
being hungry all the time.

236
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,894
We'll scavenge in the forest.

237
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,772
We can tickle for trout in the river.

238
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,903
It's the Colonel's river.

239
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,575
His land.

240
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,860
You work for him.

241
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,622
No one owns the wildlife, Tommo.

242
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,588
Empire Day.

243
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,090
The late Queen's birthday.

244
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,391
God bless her.

245
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,265
Today we remember the warriors

246
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,600
who died with honour
fighting for their country overseas.

247
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,101
And God bless the British Empire

248
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,107
and the taming of the natives
to the greater glory of civilisation.

249
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,493
But whilst we must cherish our past,

250
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,908
we must all look forward to the future

251
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,120
and the greatness that lies therein.

252
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,828
And with that, I now declare

253
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,133
the Empire Garden Féte well and truly open.

254
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,591
Thank you.

255
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,986
Who are you?

256
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,455
Queen of the Amazons.

257
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,959
Molly Monks,
my father's the Colonel's new gamekeeper.

258
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,501
Where are you from?

259
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,964
Peru.

260
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,500
What?

261
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,132
This is my little brother, Tommo.

262
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,509
I'm nearly 11.

263
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,839
Hello, Tommo.

264
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,808
- She's called Molly, and she's from Peru.
- Where?

265
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,344
And I'm Charlie Peaceful.

266
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,392
Age 13.

267
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,395
Meet Charlie in the barley for a parley?

268
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,693
This is my older brother, Big Joe.

269
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,858
Little Joe.

270
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,860
Pleased to meet you, Peaceful brothers.

271
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,657
What does your father do?

272
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,530
He was the Colonel's gamekeeper.

273
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,027
I see.

274
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,363
- He's dead.
- Dad's dead.

275
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,411
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,584
Have you got brothers and sisters?

277
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,412
No, I haven't even got a mother.

278
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,216
Hey, no secrets, Tommy Peaceful.

279
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,385
Tommo. I'm Tommo.

280
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,550
Come on, Charlie.

281
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,846
Where are you off to?

282
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,048
Nowhere.

283
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,551
Honest.

284
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,076
Shite and onions.

285
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,569
That was your fault.

286
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,741
What did I do?

287
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,406
This way.

288
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,250
Monks, the gamekeeper.

289
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,461
Run, Tommo.

290
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,872
No, Charlie,

291
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,128
if one goes, we both go.

292
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,716
You best stay put then.

293
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,419
'Cause I'm going nowhere.

294
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,062
Be careful.

295
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,907
What do you think of Molly?

296
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,785
She's all right for a girl.

297
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
Morning.

298
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,516
Mr Monks.

299
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,650
I'm the bearer of sad news.

300
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,780
It's the lady of the house, she passed away.

301
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,943
She's been unwell, you know.

302
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,051
Goodbye, Mr Monks.

303
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,634
What is it, Mother?

304
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,978
The Colonel's wife has passed away.

305
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,397
I don't believe it.

306
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,516
The Colonel killed her.

307
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,063
No, of course he didn't.

308
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,566
What a terrible thing to say, Tommo.

309
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,736
She's been frail for a long while now.

310
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,695
She died peacefully in her sleep.

311
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,157
So, that's it then.

312
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,576
You lost your job,
the Colonel's throwing us out.

313
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,074
No.

314
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,576
- You're to stay on his hunt kennels.
- Good.

315
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,418
And I'm to take in
the Colonel's laundry, here.

316
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,039
So I can look after Big Joe again.

317
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,586
And what about Grandma Wolf?

318
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,218
- Now, don't call her that.
- Why not'?

319
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,422
She prowls around in sheep's clothing
whenever the Colonel's watching.

320
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,390
What did she get up to now?

321
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,071
What did you do that for, Jimmy Parsons?

322
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,701
Go on then, Peaceful.

323
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,576
- You're not worth it.
- Need your big brother to fight for you?

324
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,742
Form a scab and drop off, dung breath.

325
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,806
There, you keep it.

326
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,149
Keep it forever.

327
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,772
I will.

328
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,611
Till the day I die.

329
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,943
You'll need to wash it before then.

330
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,654
How did your mother die, Molly?

331
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,445
She died as I was born.

332
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,576
She gave me life, Tommo.

333
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,580
Don't you feel bad that you...

334
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,841
I feel sad that she isn't here to love me.

335
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,135
I still love her.

336
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,467
Like you still love your father.

337
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,594
I suppose.

338
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,787
Can I tell you something, Molly?

339
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,365
Tell me what?

340
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,041
- I think you're...
- Race to the river!

341
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,293
Hey!

342
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,838
Wait for me.

343
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,542
H6)'...

344
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,341
Hold on.

345
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,237
I dare you to take off all your clothes.

346
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,067
- No!
- Go on.

347
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,198
- No!
- I will if you will.

348
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,491
- No.
- No.

349
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,051
Come on in, the water's lovely.

350
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,891
Come on.

351
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,189
Come on, boys, be a man.

352
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,362
See, it's not that cold.

353
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,206
Come on in, Tommo, the water's lovely.

354
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,802
Don't worry, Tommo,
the fish won't nibble your bits.

355
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,632
See, it's not that bad.

356
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,646
It's freezing, I'm turning blue.

357
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,932
No peeping...

358
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,945
I said no peeping.

359
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,955
I want to die.

360
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,582
Right here and now.

361
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,459
Because no tomorrow
could ever be as good as today.

362
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,464
I'm going to tell the future.
I've seen gypsies do it.

363
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,188
The stones say
that as long as we stick together,

364
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,272
we'll be lucky and happy till the day we die.

365
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,985
Do the stones say who you'll marry?

366
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,649
Yes.

367
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,485
Mr Peaceful.

368
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,362
Crossed fingers, Molly's stones.

369
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,000
They're just <i>as</i> reliable
or unreliable as praying to God.

370
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,961
Well...

371
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,338
I want to see my brother.

372
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,173
I don't think so.

373
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,142
I want to see Charlie.

374
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,641
I didn't hate my father.

375
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,357
He died trying to save me.

376
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,861
Fathers and sons.

377
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,701
Fathers and sons.

378
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,700
Father?

379
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,201
Your father is in God's hands now.

380
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,751
As we're all destined to be, my son.

381
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:26,213
I don't believe in heaven.

382
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,593
I'm not sure I've ever really believed in God.

383
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,554
At church, I'd look up at Jesus
hanging on the cross,

384
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,104
and wonder why God,

385
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,099
who is supposed to be his father,

386
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,067
almighty and powerful,

387
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,405
would let them do that to him.

388
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,737
Would let him suffer so much.

389
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,789
If there is a God, why was my father killed?

390
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,915
Why did this war happen?

391
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,962
Why will morning come?

392
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,772
Happy in your work, Thomas Peaceful?

393
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,110
Afternoon, Tommo.

394
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,820
Afternoon, Molly.

395
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,947
Mind out, you clot.

396
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,792
- Sorry, Grandma.
- Don't you call me that around here, Thomas.

397
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,752
Makes me sound old and crotchety.

398
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,924
- When really you are young and kind-hearted.
- I can hear you, Thomas Peaceful.

399
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,793
The Colonel wants tea for two.

400
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,132
At 3:00.

401
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,503
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,097
And how do I take my tea?

403
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,266
Same as yesterday, ma'am.

404
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,976
Precisely.

405
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,145
Same as the day before...

406
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,684
Stop muttering, Molly Monks.

407
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,692
Well, he's old and slow.

408
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,155
He's no use for hunting.

409
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,024
- No, sir.
- No use to anyone.

410
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,116
No, sir.

411
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,784
Well, you know what to do.

412
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,453
- Sir.
- Charlie?

413
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,492
What is it, lad?

414
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,706
He's done you no harm.

415
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,044
The hounds are my property,
I decide whether they live or die.

416
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,162
Yes, you do, sir.

417
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,624
- But he's Molly's favourite.
- That's sentimental rot.

418
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,675
<i>He's a useless old beast.</i>

419
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,838
- I got him, sir.
- Good man.

420
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,181
Take care of it.

421
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,390
Charlie.

422
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,710
Bring the car out!

423
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,887
Go on now, go on now, boy!

424
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,886
He had no idea, Charlie, we did it.

425
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,347
That's it, run! Run!

426
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,516
A proper job, Tommo.

427
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,397
I'll make an apple pie to go with the stew.

428
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:34,064
Here, boy, in here, in here.

429
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,692
Get out of my way!

430
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,908
4330995!-
Get him inside, get him inside.

431
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,531
The Colonel's following.

432
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,576
He's not just following you, Charlie Peaceful,
he's right behind you.

433
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,578
I've got the sheets
ready for you now, Colonel.

434
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,996
I'm not here for the blasted linen.

435
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,916
- Thomas?
- Sir?

436
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,342
- Charles.
- This dog had run away, sir, honest.

437
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,761
Liars as well as thieves.

438
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,091
- I beg your pardon, Colonel.
- I had to do it, Mother.

439
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:05,932
- Do what, Charlie?
- He told me to shoot him.

440
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,427
- Shoot who?
- I can do as I like with him.

441
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,557
With Who?

442
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,347
He stole one of my hounds, Mrs Peaceful.

443
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,266
And as magistrate of this village...

444
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:18,269
So, am I to understand, Colonel,
that if you were to shoot this hound,

445
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,113
then he was of no use to you at all?

446
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:21,607
No, no use.

447
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,404
Joe, would you fetch the money
mug from the mantel piece, please?

448
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,038
Money mug.

449
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,200
- Money, Mother.
- Thank you, Joe.

450
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,121
There you are, Colonel. Six pence.

451
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,711
Not a bad price for a useless old dog.

452
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,297
So now he's not stolen, is he?

453
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,722
You're both fired.

454
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,478
I don't know what you're so pleased about.

455
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,648
You've both just lost your jobs.

456
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,998
- Thomas Brass, sir.
- Hello, lad.

457
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,120
Morning.

458
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,456
Any work for a young labourer?

459
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,167
No, I've got no work for you here, lad.

460
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,497
Nothing?

461
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,502
No, I've got my men, I don't need no more.
Sorry, lad.

462
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,520
And another pint then, please.

463
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,138
Hang on.

464
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,691
No. You better make that a half.

465
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,980
To your health.

466
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,374
Nice one, Jimmy.

467
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,959
I did it for you, Fred. We're a team.

468
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,286
Buck up, Nipper.

469
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,553
Nice one, Freddo.

470
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,214
- All right, Tommo?
- Nipper.

471
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,512
Out of a job, is it?

472
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,055
Well, you know, Pete.

473
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,058
There's a card game Friday fortnight
against the King's Arms.

474
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,727
We could do with a reserve.

475
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,900
Old enough now
to play with the lads, are you?

476
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,563
Young Peaceful.

477
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,354
I'll have a go.

478
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,489
- What's trumps?
- Hearts.

479
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,760
- Sod it.
- What'd you play that for?

480
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,595
You're supposed to be counting the cards.

481
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,422
Looks like someone's lost their place
on the card team, Jimmy.

482
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,892
Better luck next time there, Jimmy.

483
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,099
Well done, Tommo.

484
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,600
So, how is the farm?

485
00:34:58,847 --> 00:34:59,939
Hard on your own?

486
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,228
I'll get by.

487
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,607
- There's always help at harvest.
- It's a lot of work, though.

488
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,446
And you're not getting
any younger, mind you.

489
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:07,735
Hey, cheeky.

490
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,366
Well...

491
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,907
Well what?

492
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,077
How about I come and work for you?

493
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,295
I suppose that'd serve the Colonel right,

494
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,706
if I did take you on.

495
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,797
- Both of you.
- Both of us?

496
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,920
But one wage, mind.

497
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,681
We brought our hound to see you, look.

498
00:36:18,682 --> 00:36:20,975
Hello, Billy old boy.

499
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,311
You smell sweet.

500
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,646
That pong's not Billy, it's you.

501
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,822
That's horse poop.

502
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,155
- It's better than dog shite, though.
- Hey!

503
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,202
We don't want you Peacefuls here.

504
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,866
Bothering our Molly.

505
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,865
She don't want to see you.

506
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,791
Go on.

507
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,206
Go on.

508
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,673
Come on, Billy.

509
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,561
Charlie?

510
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,889
Charlie?

511
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,148
How are we gonna see Molly again?

512
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,361
We're not.

513
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,239
No.

514
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,493
It's good to have women out of your hair.

515
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,434
- I'll walk.
- All right.

516
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,186
Don't be late, though, Tommo lad.

517
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,763
I won't.

518
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,972
Get up there, boys.

519
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,061
I think Molly might meet us later.

520
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,483
In secret.

521
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,105
Play your little daft games
without me, Tommo, all right?

522
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,942
Work, Tommo!

523
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,624
Thank you.

524
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,338
Damned Hun.

525
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,585
Call in the cavalry.

526
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,302
We shall be fighting with the Frenchies
against the Bosch.

527
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,103
Molly.

528
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,026
Molly?

529
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,858
- Make yourself scarce.
- Hey, come here.

530
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,157
I miss you, both.

531
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,365
Come here. Come here!

532
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,795
Come on, girls. That's right.

533
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,548
There's one.

534
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,545
There's one. There's one.

535
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,673
There's two, there's two.

536
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,884
Come on in, girl.

537
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,808
Bring us another one.
Bring us another one. That's it.

538
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,061
- Come on, girl.
- There she is.

539
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,398
Ooh err, look at this at one.

540
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,362
I think I'm in love.

541
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,696
Pardon?

542
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,071
I think I'm in love.

543
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,327
Well, which one? Her?

544
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,050
You're far too young to be in love, Tommo.

545
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,594
All right, boy'?

546
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,597
Come on, girls.

547
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,467
Thanks, Charlie.

548
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,521
I dare you to take off all your clothes.

549
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,151
No!

550
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,613
Come on, boys, be a man.

551
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,703
That's strange, Joe.

552
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,480
It's war.

553
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,692
Horses and guns.

554
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,566
That's how we beat the Boer in the Cape.

555
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,490
And how we knocked the stuffing
out of the Zulu in Natal.

556
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,571
Horses and guns.

557
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,533
But we work with cart horses,
you daft old bug...

558
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,000
You'll need hunters, not ploughers.

559
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:06,509
Our horses will no sooner charge into battle
than I skip home before last orders.

560
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,214
It's not just the cavalry.

561
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,263
How do you move the great guns,

562
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:15,931
the ammunition trains,
the supply magazines?

563
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,097
The army needs all the horses it can get.

564
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,932
And all the men.

565
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:25,612
Fit, able-bodied young men,
ready to fulfil their patriotic duty.

566
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,944
The old fart...

567
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,742
Up the revolution!

568
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,633
They've thrown her out.

569
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,769
Her father and the Colonel
have thrown her out.

570
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,473
- It's your fault, Charlie.
- Why? What's going on?

571
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,068
What's going on
is that she's gonna have your baby.

572
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,730
That's what's going on.

573
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,928
I didn't want to hide it from you, Tommo.

574
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,981
- But you did hide it from me.
- She didn't want to hurt you.

575
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,776
You love her, don't you?

576
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,030
But I love her, Tommo.

577
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,783
She loves me.

578
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,363
She's not a girl any more.

579
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,331
- I hate you.
- No, you don't, Tommo.

580
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,341
And besides, who'll be my best man?

581
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,885
Jimmy Parsons?

582
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,803
- You're getting married?
- Of course.

583
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,218
But not to Jimmy Parsons.

584
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:23,888
Fﬂends?

585
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,751
Well, James,

586
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,039
he left school sooner than you wanted.

587
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,417
And now he's gone
and got a nice girl pregnant.

588
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,178
Who does that remind you of?

589
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,432
Thank you.

590
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,768
No wedding bells?

591
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,808
No bells.

592
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,264
Like triplets.

593
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:36,983
Joe?

594
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,190
Are you awake?

595
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,991
Father died because of me, Joe.

596
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,031
It was my fault.

597
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,996
Oranges and lemons,

598
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,707
say the bells of...

599
00:47:55,456 --> 00:48:00,713
You owe me five farthings,
say the bells of St Martin's.

600
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:07,219
When will you pay me?,
say the bells of Old Bailey.

601
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,892
Who would shoot their own soldiers?

602
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,235
- Itchy <i>sods,</i> lice.
- Could be worse.

603
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,907
Could be crabs.

604
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:27,243
I see the French and they shoot
their lot for cowardice all the time.

605
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,073
What good's that do?

606
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,498
And the generals and the politicians,

607
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:38,257
they think it stops us from asking
what we're doing out here in the first place.

608
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,842
Well, it bloody doesn't.

609
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,845
Why don't you just let him off?

610
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,590
Let him sit out the war behind bars?

611
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,928
Anything.

612
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,520
No.

613
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:59,779
Here comes a candle to light you to bed.

614
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:05,910
And here comes a chopper
to chop off your head.

615
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:10,328
Chip chop, chip chop, the last man's dead!

616
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,664
Tommo!

617
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,208
Don't sweep up where I just cleaned then.

618
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,420
Well, do it yourself then.

619
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,555
All right.

620
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,401
Come on, Tommo, go on and punch me.

621
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,900
Come on, yourself.

622
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:46,826
Come on. Come on, then, Tommo.
Come on, Tommo.

623
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,743
- Come on, then, boy.
- I'm not a boy.

624
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,995
Break it up, lads. Break it up!

625
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:03,259
It's official. War Office, they want my horses.

626
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,131
That's stupid.

627
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:09,678
You can't argue with them, Charlie.
We dance to their tune.

628
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,851
"Calling all horse herders."

629
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,642
I need you to deliver them to market.

630
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:16,810
I'll do it.

631
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:57,517
- Here, sir.
- That's quite all right. Thank you.

632
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,733
Look after 'em, won't you?

633
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,780
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

634
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:08,740
I shan't beat about the bush.

635
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,408
I shan't tell you it's all tickety-boo
out there in France.

636
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,080
It's an hard slog.

637
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,035
There's only one question you need to
ask yourselves about this war.

638
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,500
Who would you rather see
marching through your streets?

639
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,253
Us lot? Or the Hun?

640
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:29,132
Because if we don't beat them over there,
they'll come marching through right here,

641
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,762
burning your houses, violating your women,
killing your children.

642
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,886
They've not only beaten brave little Belgium,

643
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,848
but now they've taken
a fair slice of France, too.

644
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,648
If we don't beat them at their own game,
they'll gobble us up <i>as</i> well.

645
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:49,524
- Well, do you want the Hun here?
- No!

646
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,904
'D0 you?
- No!

647
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,328
- Shall we blast them to kingdom come?
- Yes!

648
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,910
Then we shall need you.

649
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,160
And all the brave lads out in France
need you, too.

650
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,247
And remember one thing, lads,
and I can vouch for this,

651
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,008
all the ladies love a soldier.

652
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,794
Come on!

653
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:14,223
Now, who'll be the first brave lad
to come and take the King's shilling?

654
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,097
I'm looking for boys with hearts of oak,

655
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,807
lads who love their king and country,

656
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,107
men what hates the lousy Hun.

657
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,107
Go on, son. Go and fight.

658
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,690
It's every man's duty to fight
when his country calls.

659
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,866
Go on!

660
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,114
You're not a man.

661
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,164
Coward! Coward!

662
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,160
Coward!

663
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,668
Farmer Cox sent me to market.
The army was there recruiting.

664
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,220
Jimmy Parsons joined up, and Pete, Fred.

665
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,720
Don't worry about it, Tommo.
They can't make you go.

666
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,893
You're too young, anyway.

667
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,306
I'm nearly 16.

668
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,310
You gotta be 19 to serve overseas, Tommo.
They don't want boys.

669
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,561
I'm not a boy.

670
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,317
- Baby boy, baby boy...
- Stop it now, Joe.

671
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,864
Anyway, that's what
the professional army's for.

672
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,742
They're a brave lot, though, the volunteers.

673
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,696
If women had their say,
there wouldn't be war in the first place.

674
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,117
Charlie, you wouldn't go, would you?

675
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,668
No, don't be daft.

676
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,583
I'd shoot a rat, because it might bite me.

677
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,885
I'd shoot a rabbit, 'cause I could eat that.

678
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,551
But why would I wanna shoot a German?

679
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,091
I never met a German.

680
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:43,892
You've seen the lists, Tommo?
All the killed and wounded?

681
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,939
What's it for?

682
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,901
So a few little rich men
can hang on to power a little while longer

683
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,353
while they bleed us dry?

684
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,731
- I don't know about that, Charlie.
- No, it ain't right.

685
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,942
I couldn't bare the loss.
Not with James gone.

686
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,444
It's better than shovelling shit.

687
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,201
It's better than breaking your back
all your life working someone else's land.

688
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,327
And it's better pay, too.

689
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,204
It's not a job that lasts forever, though,
is it, Tommo'?

690
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,541
Well, who wants to get stuck here forever?

691
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,370
Here is home, Tommo.
This is where you're from.

692
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,376
Who would you rather see
walking through the streets?

693
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:11,582
Us lot or the Hun?

694
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,133
Grow up, Tommo, please.

695
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,551
You're a coward, Charlie Peaceful.

696
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,675
And you're tired, Tommo.

697
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,846
So don't say anything
you'll regret in the morning.

698
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,391
- Name?
- Thomas Peaceful.

699
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,111
- Occupation?
- Farm labourer.

700
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,941
- Date of birth?
- Fifth of October.

701
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,155
Year?

702
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,449
Year, lad?

703
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,911
Fifth of October, 1895.

704
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,835
Sign this.

705
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,055
Now report to the doctor.

706
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,884
Next.

707
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,639
- Name?
- John Moody.

708
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,096
- Occupation?
- Labourer.

709
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,685
Date of birth?

710
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:12,692
Cough.

711
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,066
Fit as a fiddle.

712
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,065
Stand up straight, lad.

713
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,359
There you are. 5'10".

714
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,115
Breathe in.

715
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,377
Come along, Tommo!

716
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,224
Watch me.

717
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:29,724
Louise.

718
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,107
- Nipper.
- Tommo.

719
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,986
I love you, Molly.

720
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,685
What, you're not embarrassed
to kiss me in front of your pals?

721
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,807
No.

722
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,522
No, why should I be?

723
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:59,109
Charlie, what's bothering you?

724
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,491
All the lads going off to war,
and I'm staying here.

725
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,694
Charlie, they're not about to become fathers!

726
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,512
My little boy. What have you done?

727
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,556
It's what Father would've wanted.

728
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,637
I'm not so sure, Tommo.

729
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,437
There. Your father wanted you to have it

730
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,523
when you were grown up.

731
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,780
I don't smoke.

732
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,305
Put that bloody fag out!
You want your head blown off?

733
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,476
Sergeant?

734
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,681
No smoking in the trenches at night!

735
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,148
Why not?

736
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:24,945
Because Fritz will snipe your cobblers off,
you berk!

737
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,240
But we're not in the trenches, Sergeant,
and it's daytime.

738
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:31,239
Stand still! Chest out!

739
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,867
Stomach in! Look to the front!

740
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,539
Jesus Christ.

741
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,343
And you're the best
they can send us these days?

742
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:53,306
And I'm supposed to make
bloody soldiers out of you.

743
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:02,979
Name!

744
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,903
Peaceful, Sergeant. Private Tommo Peaceful.

745
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,399
- You want your head blown off, Peaceful?
- No, Sergeant.

746
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:13,361
- You want your nuts blown off, Peaceful?
- No, Sergeant.

747
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,947
- You want your arse blown off, Peaceful?
- No, Sergeant.

748
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,376
- Then you do what I say, when I say it.
- Yes, Sergeant.

749
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,577
Thank you, Sergeant Hanley.

750
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,046
Captain Wilkins, sir!

751
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,922
At ease.

752
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,762
You've all had a long voyage, men.

753
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,844
A hard march.

754
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,516
You have leave to visit the local estaminet.

755
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,650
- The what, sir?
- The pub, and the first round's on you.

756
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,272
Sir!

757
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,241
Who are they?

758
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,872
Indians, Tommo. Soldiers like you and me.

759
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,625
- Are those fellows singing foreign?
- Foreign.

760
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,923
No, I don't understand
a word they're saying anyway.

761
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,342
Who's that?

762
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,803
- Hey, Tommo lad!
- Charlie!

763
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,729
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, someone had to look after this one.

764
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,147
I can look after myself.

765
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,849
And what took you so long, mate?

766
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,855
- Parsons.
- Better late than never.

767
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,188
If you'd left it much longer,
the war would've been over.

768
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:36,910
- Where'd you get that?
- Mother. It's the best watch in the world.

769
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,862
It's Father's watch.

770
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,406
- Heir apparent.
- Grub's up!

771
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:45,039
And she is the hors d'oeuvre.

772
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,668
You are a fighting boy, Tommy?

773
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,798
Not Tommy. Tommo.

774
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,302
I do not understand.

775
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,093
But I think you are too young to be in a war.

776
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,051
I'm old enough. I'm fighting here
with my pals and my brother.

777
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,302
Go home, Tommy.

778
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,309
No likey, Monsieur Bum Fluff.

779
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:11,562
Vous likey un tumble dans the hay avec moi.

780
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,360
You're just boys.

781
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,865
- Anna, where is the blaze?
- Yeah.

782
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,538
Here! More beers.

783
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,544
That is my daughter.

784
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,794
I'd rather have a cider.

785
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,547
Five beers, one cider.

786
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,048
And what are you laughing at, baby face?

787
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,179
Parsons, you've got a face like
an old whore's arse.

788
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:43,893
Stuff a sock in it.

789
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:47,519
- Hey, here's to home.
- And Mr Munnings.

790
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,400
- Grandma Wolf.
- Cheers.

791
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,228
And the Colonel. May they all suffer
the misery they so richly deserve.

792
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,938
- Fair enough.
- Yeah, I'll fetch the beers.

793
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,988
What's your name, Private?

794
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,242
Peaceful. Private Peaceful.

795
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,746
Are you being funny?

796
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,123
You know what these three stripes are, boy?

797
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,752
That makes you a sergeant,

798
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,959
which means you'll never make an officer.

799
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,379
Which makes you one of the lads.

800
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,092
Thank you.

801
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,431
Good luck, Sergeant.

802
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,313
Here he is.

803
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,069
Right, to Molly.

804
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,901
That's for me to say. To Molly.

805
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,156
- Molly.
- Molly.

806
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,663
- To Molly.
- To Molly.

807
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:03,174
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile.

808
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:11,315
While you've a Lucifer to light your fag
Smile, boys, that's the style.

809
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,894
What's the use of worrying?

810
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,866
Off home, lads?

811
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,569
England's that way, boys.

812
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,778
Do send our love.

813
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,409
Platoon, halt!

814
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,793
Private Peaceful.

815
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,745
- Sergeant?
- Sergeant?

816
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,752
Sentry duty. Both of you.

817
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,959
Well, what do we do then?

818
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:46,850
If you nod off, it'll be a court martial
if Fritz doesn't shoot you up the arse first.

819
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,357
Quick march!

820
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,782
Fine night for poaching, Tommo.

821
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,460
What happened to all the trees?

822
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,904
What's the matter, Peaceful?
Scared of mice?

823
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:49,158
Parsons, save that for them, all right?

824
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,619
Big man, Private?

825
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,164
Not exactly, Sergeant.

826
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:59,256
I'm just a country boy, like yourself.

827
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,306
Message received.

828
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:19,734
- Why are we here?
- I'm sure it's important.

829
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,277
As you were.

830
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,864
We have orders to send out
a patrol into the trench opposite

831
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,237
to bring back a prisoner for questioning.

832
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,992
HQ need to know
what enemy regiments have been deployed.

833
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,499
Righto. Volunteers.

834
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,750
There's a double rum ration in it
for anyone who does.

835
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,921
- I'm in then, hell.
- I'm in.

836
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,089
Me, too.

837
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,293
The old village card team?

838
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,351
Jimmy, Fred, with the Sergeant.

839
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,019
Pete! Pete!

840
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,517
Fetch the stretcher bearers on the double.
Keep your heads down, lads.

841
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,565
Keep your head down, Sergeant.
Keep your head down, Sergeant.

842
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:00,858
Stretcher bearers!

843
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,561
Come on, Sarge! I've got you.

844
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,022
Up you get. On your feet, sir.

845
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,027
Come on, Sergeant. Come on up, Sergeant.

846
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,108
Leave me, get yourselves out.

847
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,529
One goes down, we all go down.
Ain't that right, Sergeant?

848
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,285
Come on, come on!

849
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,618
Keep his head down, fellas. Keep it down.
Come on, come on.

850
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,718
- Thank you, Peaceful.
- Anything for an officer.

851
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,609
Gas! Gas! Gas!

852
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,237
Gas! Gas! Gas! Gas!

853
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,826
Follow the drill!

854
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,116
Don't panic, Tommo.

855
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,947
Gas drill!

856
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:48,542
Tommo, listen. Listen!
Stick with me, all right? Come on!

857
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:54,639
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

858
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,931
Don't shoot me, mister, please!

859
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,358
I don't shoot boys. Go, boy.

860
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,187
Go, Tommy, go. Go!

861
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:13,275
I'll kill you. I'll kill you, you German bastard!

862
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,998
All clear!

863
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,841
Prepare for counter-attack!

864
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,867
Stretcher bearers. Stretcher bearers.

865
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,454
- You'll be all right, Charlie Peaceful.
- All right, good luck, Fred.

866
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,715
Next.

867
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:23,182
Private Peaceful, Doctor.
I was in the gas attack.

868
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,097
Let's take a look at you.

869
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:30,776
Mouth.

870
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,493
Breathe in and out.

871
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,036
You didn't catch a whiff of it. Next!

872
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,789
I can't see straight. I can't breathe.

873
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:50,504
Calm down, man. You were lucky.
Take a look outside.

874
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:51,873
Next.

875
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,708
All right, come on.

876
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:11,522
Tommo!

877
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,145
Charlie! What happened?

878
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,315
Bullet, shrapnel.

879
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:21,282
Bled like a pig, boy.
They're sending me back.

880
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:22,578
Back?

881
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,782
Congratulations, Peaceful. Your ticket home.

882
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:28,455
I'll be sure to send your love, Sergeant.

883
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,664
They're not taking you now, Charlie?

884
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,540
Together.

885
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,377
Tommo, you'll be all right.

886
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,547
Hey, Tommo, keep your chin up.

887
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,722
I'll write to you.

888
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,508
Better still, you write to me.

889
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:47,016
- Well, we'll see you soon, Charlie.
- Cheerio, lads.

890
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:51,812
Don't any of you other yellow bastards
go shooting yourselves in the foot.

891
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:54,273
Hey, hey, hey!

892
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,571
All right, don't you worry, Sergeant,
we won't.

893
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,487
All right, come on. Come on, Tommo.

894
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,739
All that fighting, no gain on either side.

895
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,540
Have another beer.

896
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,664
- Here's to a horrible bloody Hanley.
- All right.

897
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,588
I'm going after Charlie.

898
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,295
And how will you get there? Swim?

899
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,221
I'll find a way. I'll get back somehow.

900
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,345
But that's desertion, Tommo.
They shoot deserters.

901
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,017
Hang on! Tommo!

902
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,012
Forget him.

903
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,604
Tommo!

904
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,609
- Tommo!
- Well, he won't have gone far.

905
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,200
You gave me a fright.
What are you doing here?

906
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,835
Er... you are ill?

907
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,165
Hiding from your friends?

908
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,084
I've seen you before, I think.

909
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:02,674
My name is Anna.

910
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:05,844
I'm Tommo.

911
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:09,678
So, it's true then.
Every English soldier is called Tommy.

912
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,022
No, not Tommy. I'm Tommo.

913
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:16,893
And what do you do when you're at home,
Tommy-Tommo,

914
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:20,191
when you're not playing soldiers?

915
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:21,986
I work on a farm.

916
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,483
You're a farmer?

917
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,445
No, I'm not really.
I work on Farmer Cox's farm.

918
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:29,788
In the fields. Sheep, horses.

919
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,537
- Horses?
- Yes.

920
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,045
He's magnificent.

921
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,531
Anna!

922
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:18,914
You promise you return? Yes?

923
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,418
I promise.

924
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,703
Charlie.

925
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:10,678
"They brought young children to Christ,
that he should touch them.

926
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:13,510
"And his disciples rebuked
those that brought them.

927
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,847
<i>"But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased,</i>

928
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:21,526
"and said unto them,
'Suffer the little children to come unto me,

929
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,854
"'for of such is the kingdom of God.'"

930
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,364
"And he took them up in his arms"

931
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,908
"and blessed them."

932
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:37,325
And who's left to make the ammunition?

933
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,035
Bloody women.

934
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:43,665
See, the problem with Kitchener's army
is they're all amateurs.

935
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,761
In my day, we were a regular army.
Professionals.

936
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,679
Well, the Hun would be on the run now

937
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:54,385
if these young scamps
were as brave as we were then.

938
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,469
Just one big push.

939
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,680
You're a silly old fart, Colonel.

940
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,231
I beg your pardon.

941
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,435
The world's changing, old man.

942
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:07,818
When you lot stop ruling our bloody lives,
England will change, too.

943
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,649
There'll be no more empire.

944
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:12,030
No more land owners exploiting
the labour of the masses.

945
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,077
And there'll be no more bloody war!

946
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,742
You anarchist!

947
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,323
Call me what you like, Colonel.

948
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:22,295
You can blast us to smithereens out there
on the front line, but you'll not stop us.

949
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:27,921
We're fighting the Germans,
but we're at war with your kind, too.

950
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:32,680
And the whole world's about to be
ripped apart by the likes of me.

951
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,121
Mr Monks.

952
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,673
- You're a grandfather.
- I heard.

953
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:18,341
One day, when this war is over,
we shall all be together again,

954
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:21,972
and young Tommo will see his uncle
for the first time and smile.

955
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,733
Big Joe already smiles at him.

956
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,524
And little Tommo has Big Joe's great grin,

957
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,363
and Charlie's nose and your blue eyes.

958
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,826
Because of all this,
I love him more than I can say.

959
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,029
Your Molly.

960
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,748
- All right, Tommo?
- All right, boys.

961
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,171
Where's Anna?

962
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,090
Anna? The girl that works here?

963
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,597
We had a rendezvous.

964
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,524
She's with her other
gentlemen friends, lover boy.

965
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,946
Monsieur. Anna? Where's Anna?

966
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:23,907
Pardon?

967
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,408
Gone.

968
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,036
Gone? Gone where?

969
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,797
God. Anna's dead.

970
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,215
I don't understand.

971
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:36,261
Dead? Dead! My daughter is dead!

972
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,465
How? What happened'? She can't be dead.

973
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,639
Fetching eggs from the next village.

974
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,221
For you soldiers. For your supper.

975
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:49,438
One big bomb shell. Boom, and she's dead.

976
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,610
I'm sorry.

977
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,571
Go to hell, Tommy.

978
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:01,616
Go to hell, you English, you Germans,
you French.

979
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,452
And take your war with you.

980
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:04,914
The hell...

981
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,341
Silly man! You know I do...

982
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:22,429
They won't want you back.
You were injured.

983
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:23,930
And Tommo?

984
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,262
And little Tom mo?

985
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,646
You think I should just stay here
and let them fight without me?

986
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,808
That'll make our son proud?

987
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:34,483
I just want everything to be <i>as</i> it was.

988
01:19:34,484 --> 01:19:36,151
And then you'll love me?

989
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,989
I do love you, you silly man. You know I do.

990
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,610
Well, be more loving then, Mol.

991
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,947
Christ's sake, there's a bloody war on.

992
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,300
You've upset little Tommo
with your bickering.

993
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,469
No, we're not bickering, Mum. Honest.

994
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:04,137
Charlie,

995
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,010
being married is hard,

996
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:10,644
but not having a husband and a father
for your children is the hardest of all.

997
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:15,570
So listen to what your wife has to say before
making promises to yourself and your pals.

998
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,155
You curse the filthy Hun!

999
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,828
You insert your bayonet,

1000
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,875
you twist it, you pull it out clean again.

1001
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,372
Twist it!

1002
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:38,760
I'm the best bloody teacher
you lads will ever have.

1003
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,087
Stand down.

1004
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,840
All right, now.

1005
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:47,886
These old lads will now show you the ropes.

1006
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:49,853
Which am I then, Sergeant?

1007
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,848
A new lad or an old clown?

1008
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:56,064
Well, well, well, Private Peaceful.

1009
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,355
Back for second helpings?

1010
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,949
Well, I wasn't gonna miss this, Sergeant.

1011
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:06,530
I'm warning you. I've got my eye on you.

1012
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,239
One step out of line...

1013
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:12,085
Don't you worry about me, Sergeant.
I'll be good as gold.

1014
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,708
Cross my heart and hope to die.

1015
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,129
- Get to the end of the line, soldier.
- Sergeant.

1016
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:26,887
High port!

1017
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:32,805
- How's Molly? Little Tommo?
- Don't ask me about them.

1018
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:34,931
Why not?

1019
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:37,435
I can tell you plenty about home.

1020
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,739
Hedgerows are untrimmed, fields lie fallow.

1021
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,494
There's no one to plough the fields, is there?
There's no lads.

1022
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,579
Just don't ask me about them, Tommo.

1023
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,659
Not out here.

1024
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,005
They don't belong here.

1025
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,300
They belong back there at home.

1026
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,169
Do you understand?

1027
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,098
Port arms!

1028
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:18,605
Clear.

1029
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,529
Clear.

1030
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,991
Filthy.

1031
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:34,038
Private Peaceful, rifle above your head, now!

1032
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,710
About turn!

1033
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,788
Doubling at the double!

1034
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,458
Double! Double!

1035
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:46,303
Double! Double! Double!

1036
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:49,973
Double! Double! At the double!

1037
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,518
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1038
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:57,689
You move.

1039
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:03,356
You drop that rifle, Private Peaceful,
you begin the punishment again.

1040
01:23:03,357 --> 01:23:05,321
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, Sergeant.

1041
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,366
- I didn't hear you!
- Yes, Sergeant!

1042
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,368
Now move your feet!

1043
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,370
Move!

1044
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,828
You get up.

1045
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,921
Get up. Get up!

1046
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:25,877
You wanna try it, Sergeant?
You wanna pick on someone? Leave him be!

1047
01:23:25,878 --> 01:23:27,002
Go on!

1048
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,551
Leave it, Charlie.

1049
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:31,889
You were saying?

1050
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,891
- Leave it, Charlie.
- The rest of you men, fall out!

1051
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,391
Charlie.

1052
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:52,695
Steady up there.

1053
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:56,452
Lieutenant Buckland.

1054
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,375
Attention!

1055
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:03,381
Insubordination in a time of war is mutiny.

1056
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,589
And mutiny is punishable by death
by firing squad.

1057
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,963
Now, this time, Peaceful's been let off lightly.

1058
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,048
Field punishment number one.

1059
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,430
Fall the men out, Sergeant.

1060
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:17,724
Fall out!

1061
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,065
Not so cocky now, are you?

1062
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:31,741
Soldier.

1063
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:33,744
Don't outdo me now.

1064
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,113
- He seemed to like you.
- Thank you.

1065
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,411
Thank you very much indeed. Cheers.

1066
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,919
Move! Move, soldier!

1067
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,145
Move it, Parsons!

1068
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,445
Come on, boys.

1069
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,449
Keep going! Come on, boys!

1070
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,531
Nipper!

1071
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,037
Come on, boys!

1072
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,049
Fred! Fred! Pete!

1073
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,510
Dig, men! Dig!

1074
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,475
Tommo! Tommo!

1075
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:47,650
Tommo!

1076
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,568
Tommo! Tommo! Come here, lad.

1077
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:55,993
Come on. Come on. Come on, boy!

1078
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,662
All right, come on!

1079
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,662
All right. All right, all right.
It's all right, Tommo.

1080
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,002
We thought we lost you, Tommo lad.

1081
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,334
We're in the middle of bloody no man's land.

1082
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,175
We'll get you home, Tommo.

1083
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:17,676
Home? We're on a bloody holiday.

1084
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,350
We've gotta get out of this, lads!

1085
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,014
No, we can't move.

1086
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:23,892
Well, then we better stay put then,
hadn't we?

1087
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:30,853
Stay put? We're only 5O yards
from the German trenches.

1088
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,902
I want all of you on your feet, now!

1089
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,400
What the hell is the matter with you lot?

1090
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:40,704
You send us out there, Sergeant,
watch the machine guns mow us all down.

1091
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:42,031
On your feet!

1092
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:45,209
Are you disobeying my order,
Private Peaceful?

1093
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:48,370
Are you disobeying my order?

1094
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:52,915
He can't walk, Sergeant, let alone run.
He's wounded!

1095
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,635
I want all you men on your feet now,

1096
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,297
or it's a court martial, Peaceful.

1097
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,632
Do you hear me?

1098
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:03,557
Let's go! Go! Go!

1099
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:06,270
I want you over the top!

1100
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,307
Let's go!

1101
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:19,155
Fix bayonets!

1102
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,322
Charge!

1103
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:33,586
Fred!

1104
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,933
Charlie, I have to tell you.

1105
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,687
I heard about the girl.

1106
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:58,527
I'm sorry.

1107
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:01,114
Her name was Anna.

1108
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:03,991
She was lovely.

1109
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,454
But it's not her.

1110
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,793
I know.

1111
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,129
You still have feelings for Molly.

1112
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,001
- I'll love her till the day I die.
- Tommo.

1113
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,342
Listen.

1114
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,134
I am.

1115
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,641
Father needn't have died.

1116
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,313
He was trying to save me.

1117
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:35,311
If only I'd have ran when he called out to me,

1118
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:38,146
the tree wouldn't have fallen on him.

1119
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:40,653
He'd have lived.

1120
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,245
It was that tree that killed him, Tommo.

1121
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:48,369
Not you.

1122
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,417
Here.

1123
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,512
I want you to have this.

1124
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:05,758
It's such a wonderful watch.

1125
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:11,851
You wind it regular and time will never stop.

1126
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,899
You have to promise
to look after it, though, Tommo.

1127
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,362
I promise.

1128
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,075
Fred?

1129
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,099
Keep going, Tommo.

1130
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,051
Come on, Charlie.

1131
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:24,798
Hanley.

1132
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,525
Shoot him. Kill the bastard!

1133
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,276
He'll put Tommo on charge.

1134
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:45,608
Go on!

1135
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,989
Left, right, left, right, left!

1136
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,658
Left, right, left, right!

1137
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,201
Halt!

1138
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,664
Escort, two paces to the rear. March!

1139
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:39,874
I, Major Fitzpatrick,
convene this field general court martial

1140
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:44,206
to try the case of
cowardice in the face of the enemy

1141
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:45,675
against Private Peaceful.

1142
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,595
He disobeyed my orders, sir,

1143
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:51,514
the order from High Command,
to press home the attack.

1144
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,013
Peaceful, you're a worthless man.

1145
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,352
Worthless.

1146
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,564
This field general court martial finds

1147
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:06,188
the accused, Private Peaceful,
guilty as charged.

1148
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,694
- Take away the prisoner.
- Sir!

1149
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,863
Escort, attention!

1150
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:35,596
Charlie.

1151
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,937
I can't stop thinking of home.

1152
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,400
Mother, Big Joe.

1153
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,403
- Molly.
- Molly.

1154
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,279
Little Tommo.

1155
01:32:58,448 --> 01:32:59,574
Will they know?

1156
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:02,123
They'll know.

1157
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:04,913
They'll know.

1158
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,009
No tears, Tommo lad.

1159
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:14,760
No tears.

1160
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,110
Both brothers were charged,
both were imprisoned.

1161
01:33:33,111 --> 01:33:35,985
So why bring only one of them to trial, sir?

1162
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:37,908
Shouldn't both cases be dismissed?

1163
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,954
We cannot have soldiers disobeying orders
in the face of the enemy.

1164
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:45,337
I must pass the maximum sentence,
then the final decision is for the General.

1165
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,421
And Haig could show mercy.

1166
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:50,963
Then why bother
to recommend the firing squad, sir?

1167
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:52,961
I'm not recommending it.
I'm bound by the Army Act.

1168
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,804
You blame the government.

1169
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,506
This army runs on strict discipline.

1170
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,475
But we're not inhuman.

1171
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,181
Carry on.

1172
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,701
An hour is all we give him?

1173
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,033
One hour for a man's life?

1174
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:44,573
General Haig has confirmed the sentence.

1175
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:49,248
"Private Peaceful will be shot for cowardice
in the face of the enemy"

1176
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:53,090
"at 6:00 on the morning
of the 25th of June, 1916."

1177
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:04,593
Firing party!

1178
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:07,558
Attention!

1179
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,275
Present!

1180
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:17,946
Ready!

1181
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:21,485
Aim!

1182
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,246
Fire!

1183
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,324
Parade,

1184
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:06,371
fall out!

1185
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,479
I said fall out.

1186
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,228
Tommo, wait for us.

1187
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:28,610
They say there's gonna be an almighty push.

1188
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:31,865
We'll push them away from the Somme
all the way back to Berlin.

1189
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,581
I will survive somehow, Charlie.

1190
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:36,918
I must.

1191
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:41,086
I have promises to keep.
