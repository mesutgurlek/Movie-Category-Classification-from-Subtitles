8
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,693
Moscow Vnukovo Airport, 1957

9
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,027
Mr. Khrushchev has invited
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt,

10
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:33,539
to a solemn reception in honor of
her arrival in the Soviet Union.

11
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:36,387
The program...
Excuse me, Mr.James.

12
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:38,845
First, we will go to this address.

13
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,093
I must remind you that the even
First Lady of the United States,

14
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:48,445
has no right to be late.
We shall go!

15
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:53,782
Nikita Sergeyevich can wait.

16
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:58,930
It is a pleasure for a gentleman
to wait for a lady.

17
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:04,467
And who is this mysterious stranger,
who can make Nikita Sergeyevich wait?

18
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:10,004
I shall introduce you to this woman.

19
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:20,098
Battle for Sevastopol

20
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:28,054
I first saw Lyudmila in 1942,
at a student assembly...

21
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:31,494
International Students Antifascist Assembly, 1942

22
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,499
She was a tiny little girl.
She looked like a child dressed in uniform.

23
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:38,121
I wanted to know her closely, to see her smile.

24
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:43,545
Fang Hui, killed eight enemies.
Well done.

25
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:48,232
Krasavchenko Nikolai Prokofievich, the head 
of the Soviet student delegation.

26
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:52,203
Communist.
I am very pleased.

27
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,683
Communists in the White House are rare.

28
00:02:56,962 --> 00:03:00,969
And how many of the enemy
have you killed?

29
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,410
I am a party worker.

30
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:10,028
I prepare comrades for great acts.
It is very important!

31
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,358
Party worker. I prepare my comrades for great acts.
It's an important job.

32
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:15,001
Very good, very important.

33
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:22,760
Vladimir Pchelintsev, sniper.
152 killed in 154 shots.

34
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,327
Ah! Excellent...

35
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:31,306
2nd Lieutenant, Lyudmila Pavlichenko.
And who are you?

36
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:35,352
I am a sniper.
A woman sniper?!

37
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:43,447
And how many men have you killed?
Not men, fascists.

38
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,388
Three hundred and nine.

39
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,663
What do you feel when you kill?
Where have learned to kill?

39
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,663
Where have you studied?

40
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,860
Kiev State University , 1937

41
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,774
Excuse me.

42
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,876
Excuse me, let me pass.

43
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:19,226
Lyuda! Hurray!

44
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,349
Get over here!
Come here!

45
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:25,991
We have been accepted!
Let's go to the park!

46
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:29,047
Come on, why aren't you happy?
No, I'm happy.

47
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:32,338
I'm buying beer? Come to the park!
No, I'm going home.

48
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,372
All right. We'll wait for you there!
Be sure to come!

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,550
Hooray!

50
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,652
History faculty:
1. Pavlichenko L.M.

51
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,737
Mom.

52
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:57,391
Mom, may I wear your dress today?
Yes, today you may.

53
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:59,827
I'm changing my clothes then and
coming to help you.

54
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,439
Budarin said, "Spanish war has shown, that 
time to swing swords passed long by"

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,457
Vigernikov grabbed the sword, 

56
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,567
and chased him down!
Luckily he was to slow.

57
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,046
I'll wait for you outside.

58
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:20,428
I'll change my clothes and we can go.

59
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:23,497
Hello, Father.

60
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:28,538
What an outfit.

61
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:30,834
Good, that my coat is not on you.

62
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,313
Bring me my boots.

63
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,315
I was accepted.

64
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:38,594
First on the list!
Well done, congratulations.

65
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,277
You can be proud of me.

66
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:54,321
Misha...be more gentle with her today.

67
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,116
Dad! When will you be back?
Dad?

68
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,027
Do not wait for me for dinner.

69
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:14,898
We invited the neighbors.
To celebrate my admission!

70
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:20,008
To celebrate what?
You had to enter and you did it.

71
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:26,009
Bravo!
Father!

72
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:29,354
Promise me, you'll come home not too late.

73
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:36,569
Lyuda?

74
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,717
Lyuda!

75
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,227
We are now historians.
We must strive for the truth.

76
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:05,478
In movies it is fairytale,
and in a shooting range it's real.

77
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,183
Your change, please.
Girls, come over here.
78
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,402
In the shooting range everything is real.

79
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:15,275
The cartridges are genuine,
the guns are real.

80
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,010
Shall we go?
The smell of gunpowder.

81
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:20,849
What gunpowder? 
Why do we need to smell the gunpowder?

82
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:25,130
In movies it is not real,
but life has to be a fairytale. You promised me!

83
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:30,909
I choose a cinema too.
There is passion, love, music! And it never ends.

84
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,654
I'm voting for a shooting range.
Lyuda?!

85
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:36,817
Three against three.
Stop! Let me suggest a toss!

86
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:40,156
Heads - we shoot,
tails - cinema.

87
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:42,863
I bet a beer, that it's going to be heads.
I do not want to bet.

88
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:51,002
What was it?
Well?

89
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,802
Heads.

90
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:04,008
Guys, what takes you so long?
Start shooting.

91
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:09,963
Maybe we can make it to the cinema theater!
It's not just a shooting, it's the competition.

92
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,664
I 'd like that as well.

93
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,028
You can shoot after.
No, I want to compete.

94
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:20,722
That's right, show these cinema haters.

95
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,056
Pavlichenko, don't worry.
Fourth place is also honorable.

96
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:31,161
Each of you has five shots.
The winner is determined by points.

97
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,604
Could you tell me how?
Take the gun.

98
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:39,029
Load!

99
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:44,885
Insert the cartridges into the magazine.

100
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:52,312
Fire!

101
00:08:56,777 --> 00:09:02,925
Align the rib with front sight and aim on the target,

102
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,284
breathe slowly...

103
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:11,971
Hold your breath and
gently press the trigger.

104
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,681
Then...fire.

105
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:27,352
Put the gun on the deck!

106
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,746
Put the gun on the deck.

107
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,262
Shout your family names,
loud and clear!

108
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,285
Kolesov.
Curzyh.

109
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,638
Feldman.
Pavlichenko!

110
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:43,436
Pavlichenko, as you can see, shooting
is not a women's job.

111
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:49,054
We'll see about that!
Look he can't find any holes on the target!

112
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:54,234
The winner is Pavlichenko.
47 out of 50 points.

113
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,702
Comrade commander,
have you checked really well?

114
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:00,181
You can go and see yourself.

115
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,699
How many Fieldman has?

116
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,863
Good that we didn't go to the cinema, right?
You asked for it, guys!

117
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:14,899
Every war ends with peace or ceasefire.

118
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:20,299
In 1651...

119
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:25,092
Excuse me, Pavlichenko.

120
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:30,133
Yes?
The Rector wants to see you.

121
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:34,430
Take your things, just in case.

122
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,268
Pavlichenko!

123
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:44,061
Here.

124
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:55,175
Pavlichenko Lyudmila Mikhailovna born 1916.

125
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,731
Mother, N.G.Pavlichenko, English teacher.

126
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:03,807
Father, M.S.Pavlichenko, NKVD Major.
Well.

127
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:12,486
Write it down, comrade Rector.

128
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:19,525
Is that accurate?

129
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:22,579
Yes.

130
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:29,116
You have a nerve.
The captain did not lie.

131
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:37,039
According to the report by Kovalchuk,
shooting instructor on June 20...

132
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,063
You showed excellent shooting skills.
You have talent.

133
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:47,579
We've decided to send you to a 6 month 
precision strike training. Congratulations!

134
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,031
What about studies?
What about it?

135
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,991
I think the rectorate
is not against it.

136
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,124
After six months you will come back
and finish your studies, correct?

137
00:11:56,349 --> 00:12:00,487
Yes, of course.

138
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:05,693
You will come back and finish
your studies then.

139
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:10,537
Can I reject it?

140
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:18,187
I recommend you to not
jump to that conclusion.

141
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:21,486
Take at least a sweater.
They will provide us everything.

142
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:25,663
What if they don't?
Here's a small pie.

143
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:30,218
They won't give you home baked pie there.
Aren't you going to say anything?

144
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,395
That's for half a year!
Misha, it's in the winter!

145
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:40,613
Father can call and they'll postpone it.
Lyuda!

146
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:04,405
You tried to make a boy from her all her life.
See, what happened? Why didn't you stop her?

147
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:08,144
Half of my life I've spent in wars.

148
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:14,601
The worst thing in  war is a woman.
And soon there will be another war.

149
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:19,880
We are thankful for the
US loan and rental program,
"USA, International student assembly, 1942"

150
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:25,383
but if we together want to defeat
Hitler as quickly as possible,

151
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:30,746
then you need to take a decisive stand.

152
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,955
The Soviet delegation requests

153
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,637
to make the opening of the second front 

154
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:42,971
as the main topic of the Assembly.

155
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:00,362
Here.

156
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:10,951
The Soviet people need help,
but do not need alms.

157
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,928
So on behalf of the
Soviet delegation,

158
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,029
I will ask you to end these ugly jokes immediately!

159
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,591
People want to help you,
and you call it a joke?

160
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:27,369
Is my money not good enough for fighting Hitler?
Someone in your position shouldn't be fussy,

161
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:32,485
any amount would help. And why is the main 
member of the delegation silent?

162
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,748
I'm talking about miss Pavlichenko, Lady Death.

163
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:41,473
Lyuda, speak!

164
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,464
Pavlichenko?

165
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,163
We the students Assembly, agree...

166
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,623
but to bring the opening
of the second front...

167
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:59,680
that is the area of concern of
politicians and military men.

168
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:04,324
To bring it on to the agenda
is not in our plans.

169
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:09,438
Mrs. Roosevelt, many of us
have the impression,

170
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:13,915
that this was the beginning of the next
election campaign for your husband.

171
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,968
Are you planning to spend your
entire life in the White House?

172
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:20,356
And why not let us
ask questions?

173
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:26,121
This may affect that Americans will
spill their blood on foreign land.

174
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:36,044
I know one thing for sure, it is useful to
have friends, who can give you weapons.

175
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:38,862
But it's even better, when you have
friends who would take

176
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:42,153
his weapon and fights side by side with you.

177
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:45,907
Your English is suspiciously good
for a regular soldier...

178
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:51,595
Were you specially trained for this?
Who are you anyway? I need the truth.

179
00:15:54,124 --> 00:16:01,009
My mother taught me English.
She was an English teacher.

180
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,368
In University I studied history.
First in Kiev, then in Odessa...

181
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,537
how we got to be here?

182
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,810
For the whole summer... no, for the whole life!
Odessa, June 1941.

183
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:16,908
I thought... History! We will
dig Troy's royal tombs, mounds!

184
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:23,920
What we can dig here, tell me!
Just take a look, it's awful!

185
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,835
Your documents are ready.
Here they are.

186
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,704
Come on Monday. Goodbye.
Thank you!

187
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:40,974
Lyuda, do you like sailors?
I like militia men.

188
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:44,260
Militia men?
Why?

189
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:50,096
If you do not work, I'll call them.
Exams soon. Where is your mind wandering?

190
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:53,789
Well, I still would like a sailor.

191
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:57,969
I would wait and wait for him to come back...

192
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:05,590
Go to the beach, girls.
There will be sailors and airmen!

193
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:09,991
And even militia men.
An elegant choice.

194
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:12,453
Did you hear, militia men!

195
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:19,066
Sonichka...Sonia!
They do not understand.

196
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,518
It's Friday already, I have
to close the archives soon.

197
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,770
I understand you, I also would like to have a word with them.
Yes! Yes! Yes.

198
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,535
Sonichka, tell me who do you prefer,
sailors or airmen?

199
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:43,371
You know, take a doctor.
Where?

200
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:46,083
I'm going to the beach.

201
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,072
My brother Borya is going to be there. 
He is a doctor. Is he good looking?

202
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,153
As a child he had a dream of becoming a pilot.
That's it, I want a doctor!

203
00:17:54,415 --> 00:18:02,549
Let's go. Lyuda, you will bury us alive here.
Lyuda, you have to learn to relax.

204
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,680
Alright.

205
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:10,698
On Monday morning we continue.
We'll start in the...

206
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
...early morning.

207
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:16,945
What do you think, Dr. Koifman himself 
said after the surgery?

208
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:20,430
Boris, you have hands of gold!

209
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:24,561
Do you understand, what he said?
He say, that my Boris has golden hands.

210
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:28,807
He will soon go to Kiev and
perhaps even Moscow.

211
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,396
Sit down!
Lyuda, this happened only once.

212
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,803
What happened?
Heat stroke. Sit down, Masha!

213
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:36,647
Yes, sit down.

214
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:41,850
Lyuda, what if the war breaks out?
Everyone talks about the war now.

215
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,714
Girls...sorry about that!

216
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,985
We're sorry.
That happened by accident!

217
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:55,950
How can we make it up to you?

218
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,931
Masha has put this all behind!
You may go now!

219
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:04,046
Masha, nice to meet you! Grisha.
I'm Nikolay.

220
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,342
Well...what are you reading?
Hey, get back here!

221
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:14,121
We will win and return to 
celebrate our victory. Follow me.

222
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:24,463
Masha?

223
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:28,545
Lyuda! Who do you like more, Kolya or Grisha?

224
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:33,938
I haven't looked at them.
So look then!

225
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,194
Sonya!

226
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:54,072
Borya!

227
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:57,027
Hello.
Masha.

228
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,969
Meet my brother, Borya.
Hello.

229
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:05,000
Masha, let's go swimming!

230
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:07,570
May I sit by you.
Sure.

231
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:09,936
Thank you.

232
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,735
I recognized you immediately.

233
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:18,896
And what did Sonya tell you about me?

234
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:22,855
She asked me to shave, spray cologne,

235
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:26,309
polish my shoes and get to the beach.

236
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:31,821
To impress you.
That's it?

237
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:39,164
No, she wanted me to see you in a swimsuit
and understand that I have to marry you.

238
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:43,938
Did you?
Boris.

239
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:50,719
Lyudmila.

240
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,808
But if seriously...
They are airmen!

241
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:57,087
I need some time.

242
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,135
Yes...a very interesting book, Lyuda.

243
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:09,448
So...it is Lyuda.
Nice to see you again.

244
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:11,357
Lyudmila.
Masha.

245
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,395
As promised, you are invited to
join in to celebrate our victory.

246
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:18,158
And for you, young man,
you are welcome to join as well.

247
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:21,408
I disagree with you.

248
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:25,744
How can you be against war?
It will create a fair world.

249
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,096
And we will create it!

250
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:34,502
No, that opinion is very popular today.
But I never believed it.

251
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:40,838
You are wasting your fume.
There will be no war.

252
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:44,177
I can see better from above,
the war has already begun.

253
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:48,391
You are afraid to admit it.
And that's your weakness.

254
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,185
Why?
Because you're a coward.

255
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:58,219
You want others to protect families, country, women.
Can you protect anybody?

256
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:04,045
Protect...no.
But to save lives, yes!

257
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:09,507
Time for a toast?
Let's drink to...

258
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,335
For the ball that bounced!
Yes exactly!

259
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:16,734
To the ball!
To the ball!

260
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:20,469
Lyuda, have you flown in a plane?
Unfortunately, no.

261
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:24,787
We are making training flights on Sunday.
Thank you, Nikolay, but on Sunday...

262
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:28,143
Lyuda and Masha have been
invited to our home by Boris...

263
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:31,994
to lunch. He stands here quietly 
and girls almost flew away.

264
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:36,360
Sonia I'm sorry, I would like to go flying.

265
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:42,661
Lyudmila, join Masha.
Or I can fly away as well.

266
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,214
You're the only child in family?
Yes.

267
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:54,908
And where do you live in Kiev?

268
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:58,636
Do you live in a house or an apartment block?
In a residential block.

269
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,183
Shared housing?
No, separately.

270
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:06,530
How many rooms do you have?
Three and it's 2.9m in height,

271
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:10,923
parqueted floors, IV floor
with large windows an telephone.

272
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:15,219
Why do you ask all this nonsense.
Lyusik, this is not nonsense.

273
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:21,558
Lyudmila, tell me, have you thought about,
how many children you would have?

274
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:25,145
How many boys? 

275
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,978
And what is the most important thing 
for you in your husband?

275
 00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:31,300
If he earns good money?
If he loves you dearly?

276
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:34,424
Father, mother, don't tire our guest.
No, no, this is interesting.

277
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:39,518
I...I haven't thought about all this.
We have baked fish coming up!

278
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:42,053
What do you think about our son Borya?

279
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,392
I know him hardly.
Oh, I will tell you.

280
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:49,229
Borya is our big problem.
He is a very good boy.

281
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:54,415
All best things in Odessa we've invested in him!
He graduated school with a gold medal.

282
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:57,601
It's hard to get into a
Medical Institut in Odessa.

283
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:00,738
You know what Koifman said about him?
That he has golden hands.

284
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:06,059
Lyusik, it is known even in Kiev!
But that's not important!

285
00:24:06,376 --> 00:24:11,229
My son can make people around him happy.

286
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:15,674
And when he meets this woman,
he will give her a wedding ring!

287
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:19,859
Borya, get the ring and show it to Lyudochka!

288
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:25,088
Lyudmila...don't expect to much.
The ring isn't particularly valuable,

289
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:28,604
Mother: When Lyusik gave me a ring,
Boris: it isn't even gold.

290
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:32,724
Mother: he had higher rank than Deriba!
Father: this is one more value of our family,

291
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:35,387
Sonia is an outstanding cook!
Dad!

292
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:42,995
Here's a joke...a grandfather in a Jewish family is dying.
He lays on the couch, his soul is leaving...

293
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:46,607
when a boy came into the room.
Grandpa says, 'Come on, son'.

294
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:51,052
'Grandma has prepared fish.
I smell great fragrance from the kitchen' .

295
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,855
'Ask grandma to bring me a bite.'
The little Fima goes and returns.

296
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:58,502
Boy says, Grandma said, 'We'll save it for later...'

297
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:01,836
Do you understand?

298
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:09,356
You know what that means?

299
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:17,341
Laughing? Turn on the radio, it has begun!
What has begun?

301
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,170
Listen! 
Radio: The Soviet Union,

302
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:29,491
was attacked by German troops
without a declaration of war.

303
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:33,020
Radio: Attacking our borders...
What did I tell you?

304
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:37,716
Bombing Zhitomir, Kiev...
It's all over.

305
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:42,233
Radio: Sevastopol, Kaunas and some others.
No, it's...

306
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:44,636
Radio: ...killed and wounded over 200 people.
it's not over.

307
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:49,530
Father: Hitler had his agenda, we have ours.
Borya, me and your mother insist you to take Lyuda to the theater.

308
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:53,806
Radio: Raids of enemy aircrafts and gunning...
Father: Today's play is the 'La Traviata'.

309
00:25:54,075 --> 00:26:00,106
Radio:  ...were made from Romanian and Finnish territory.

310
00:26:26,178 --> 00:26:30,032
What has your father said?

311
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:36,056
We must go now or we'll be late.

312
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:54,947
Lyuda, we don't have to do this.

313
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:02,287
War is not a place for women.

314
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:08,579
War is not a place for cowards.
Young people, be quiet!

315
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:24,397
Lyuda?

316
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:30,029
The war is a massacre.
I am a doctor, I can make a booking.

317
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:37,804
Please understand, you cannot participate...
You're right, Boris, but...

318
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,770
Dad said that I must do it.

319
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:51,249
 I wouldn't be able to hole up here, I'd be ashamed.
And you? Could you do that?

320
00:27:51,739 --> 00:28:00,303
I'm more needed here.
Everyone does their part.

321
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:05,541
And I finished course of precision strike.

322
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:09,687
They need me more over there.

323
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:12,191
Get back to the opera.

324
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:21,826
Lyuda!

325
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,596
Here we are strangers.

326
00:28:42,774 --> 00:28:44,942
USSR Embassy, USA, 1942

327
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:48,171
There is a war going on and here...

328
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:54,582
and here all they care is if I'm with silk 
underwear and what lipstick I wear.

329
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:00,098
Lyuda, can you explain what this is?

330
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:10,276
What were you whispering about
with the President's wife in English?

331
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:12,474
Nikolay?
What have you agreed to?

332
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,365
Could you explain normally?

333
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,809
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt has
invited Miss Pavlichenko

334
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:25,847
to live in the White House
during her visit to America.

335
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:30,939
And only Pavlichenko was invited!

336
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:34,034
Do we have any instructions
on this occasion?

337
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:40,678
Soviet citizens have never been in the
White House without a delegation.

338
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:45,055
I may not to go anywhere!

339
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:54,006
We must hold on to every chance!

340
00:29:54,227 --> 00:30:00,427
Important issues are solved in the presidential premises.
It'd better to have our man there.

341
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:09,057
Well...

342
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:16,726
You know, Miss Pavlichenko...

343
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:20,581
make this decision yourself.

344
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:36,701
It will be hot next week.
What kind of clothes we should to give her?

345
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:43,076
I need her in uniform.
The press are used to see her that way.

346
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,330
Have you done everything I asked?
Certainly.

347
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:56,319
I wanted to understand her
as a woman.

348
00:30:56,629 --> 00:31:00,421
How could she kill 309 men
in cold blood?

349
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:05,255
Why did she take firearm?
It is not a woman's job.

350
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:09,542
Our journalists called her 'Lady Death'.

351
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:12,698
I noticed, how it stung her.

352
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:17,734
She was smart and well educated.
She was a beauty!

353
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:22,070
But war just came to her home,
and she really had no choice.

354
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:28,928
Especially, she had talent
to be unseen and aim perfectly.

355
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:32,223
Training camps, summer 1941

356
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:36,990
Sniper's first task:
get into position without being noticed.

357
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:40,719
To accomplish this you need to
crawl facing down on your stomach.

358
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,446
Keep your butt down!
Lower!

359
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:45,258
Move your left foot, move the rifle
and then move your right foot.

360
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:51,678
Glide, do not wriggle! Arm on sling swivel mount.
Lower your head. Faster, faster.

361
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:58,041
You are dead! Protruded butt!
Excellent target for an enemy.

362
00:32:05,945 --> 00:32:08,751
Sergeant major!

363
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:22,227
How will you fight with all this?

364
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,311
Stop neighing!

365
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,565
I can see that you don't
believe the Germans...

366
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:37,873
took Zhitomir, Riga, and now is 
heading to Kiev and Leningrad!

367
00:32:38,274 --> 00:32:42,605
We anticipated a short war
and a quick victory.

368
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:48,627
But we had to withdraw.
And suffered huge losses!

369
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,992
And tomorrow you are going
to be these losses! And you!

370
00:32:55,345 --> 00:33:00,200
All non statutory things has to be burned.
Do it now!

371
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:23,911
Wider steps!

372
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:27,065
With strength!

373
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:30,094
Faster.

374
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,067
Go on!

375
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:44,587
Dig deeper!
Lower your butt and crawl away!

376
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:48,427
Move quickly, do it together!

377
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:09,529
Move around!
Report the changes!

378
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:13,409
A stone disappeared.
Cross too.

379
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,441
The hay-straw is moved to the left.
Five meters.

380
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:19,034
The tussock moved to the place of the stump.

381
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:23,793
Is that it?
The stone was moved to the left, one meter.

382
00:34:24,086 --> 00:34:28,108
Not bad.
Turn around!

383
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Types of camouflage

383
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:49,359
Incorrect! Let's see...
This is the correct position.

384
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,419
You're dead.

385
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:08,537
Interesting decision but ineffective.

386
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:20,532
She is dead. Flowers do not belong in this meadow.

387
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:40,111
Comrade major, you are dead.
When do we start to shoot?

388
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,945
Pavlichenko.
Here!

389
00:36:31,142 --> 00:36:34,959
Do you still want to shoot?
Yes sir!

390
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:38,026
Are you sure?

391
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:42,377
I am sure of it.

392
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:48,653
Position!

393
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:57,884
Comrade major, move away.
Shoot.

394
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,142
You are a sniper, not an artilleryman.

395
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:17,571
Nine. Not bad for a starter.

396
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:21,361
The first five on the
firing line, action!

397
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:25,769
All shoot two ammunition allowances.

398
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:32,677
At your command.

399
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:48,732
Conscript the men, leave the girls behind.
They have a lot to learn.

400
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,974
They haven't even fired once,
bullet supply just arrived.

401
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:59,362
All have passed a course on shooting.
Half a year they have shot there.

402
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:09,123
It's a pity.
I feel sorry about my men too.

403
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:12,182
Less than half of them left.

404
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:15,312
Listen,

405
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:19,807
you will have to protect one girl.

406
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:25,441
She is going to be great soldier... Pavlichenko.

407
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:36,017
Odessa, September, 1941.

408
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,276
Do not let them too close.

409
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,402
When you see an officer, shoot!
If you killed the commander,

410
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:49,267
you'd kill half of the squad.
Save ammunition. Questions?

411
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:53,337
Tanks, comrade captain.

412
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:59,421
A tank can be stopped in two ways.

413
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:04,803
First, with grenades from a short range,

414
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,560
And number two?
Number two...

415
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:11,343
Shoot to the tank's eye slit with
armor-piercing rounds.

416
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,304
Shoot twice at the same spot
and the glass will crack.

417
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,259
With the third shot kill the driver.

418
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:20,575
Understood.

419
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:28,249
Captain, give me armor-piercing rounds.

420
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:42,623
Bombers!

421
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:41,926
Are you hurt? Where are you hurt?
Is that your blood?

422
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:54,334
Take a swig...it's alcohol.

423
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,435
Wait here.

424
00:44:32,644 --> 00:44:37,773
Major General Petrov, Commander of 
25th Chapaevsk division, personally assigned

425
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:44,712
 a semi-automatic SVT rifle to Red Army
 soldier Pavlichenko for the destroyed tank.

426
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:51,206
Aviation plays a separate role
in wiping out enemy troops.

427
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,721
Squad, attention!

428
00:44:56,614 --> 00:45:02,141
Soldier Pavlichenko, leave the line!
Yes, sir!

429
00:45:03,518 --> 00:45:06,364
Ah!

430
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:12,184
Pavlichenko, Mikhailovna?
Your father is Michail Yurievich?

431
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:15,385
He fought in the Civil War?
Yes, sir!

432
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:20,791
Misha is our hero!
Well...

433
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:25,516
If you need anything, let me know.
Congratulations, combatant Pavlichenko!

434
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:30,569
Thank you, comrade general.
Comrades!

435
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:35,415
This is my battle friend's daughter
from the Civil War.

436
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:40,504
See her as a role model!

437
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:44,384
Come, say something to our soldiers.

438
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:49,754
I swear...

439
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:53,319
to not spare myself in this 
fight against the enemy.

440
00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:56,669
To kill a 100 fascists with this gun!

441
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:58,891
Dismiss them, commander.
Dismissed!

442
00:45:59,077 --> 00:46:01,194
Makarov.

443
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,714
Keep an eye out for her, if she
follows the path of her father...

444
00:46:06,982 --> 00:46:09,986
You understand, right?
Yes.

445
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:14,358
You should always adjust
new gun to yourself.

446
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:18,365
There are no identical rifles.
Each rifle has a character.

447
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:25,630
You need to understand it and handle
the rifle as you would your wife.

448
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:33,650
Do you have a wife, comrade captain?

449
00:46:34,888 --> 00:46:38,207
No, I do not.

450
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:47,772
I had a wife, once.
At first I was afraid to marry.

451
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:57,403
I came back after Finnish war. I could not believe 
that such a young and beautiful girl loves me.

452
00:46:57,893 --> 00:47:01,720
At the beginning of the war...

453
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:07,752
I wasn't able to save her.
I was too late.

454
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:11,648
Lyuda!
Masha.

455
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:14,512
Lyuda!
Masha!

456
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:18,562
Finally I found you!

457
00:47:22,074 --> 00:47:26,940
I have so much to tell you.
We will fight together, me, you and Grisha.

458
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:31,568
Who is Grisha?
Don't you remember?

459
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:36,072
My pilot Grisha.
Grisha is mine!

460
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,956
And is he yours?

461
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,345
He is going to be soon.

462
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:00,772
Miss Pavlichenko, what do you think,

463
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:03,595
can Russia defeat Fascism 
on his own without our help?
USA, White House, 1942

464
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:09,338
Currently the Soviet Union 
fights with Fascism alone.

465
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:12,403
But the fascist aggression
is the problem of the Worlde.

466
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:17,599
And you are not aggressor?!
Then explain Finland and now the Polish occupation!

467
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:23,649
The increase of prison camps in the Soviet Union.
You are even fighting against your own people!

468
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:29,236
You have not seen how we lived before.
And you have no right...

469
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:34,369
I am a Russian!
And miraculously left Russia in 1928.

470
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:37,305
I have every right to talk about it.

471
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,705
Gentlemen!

472
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,911
Do...do sit down.

473
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:52,398
My apologies, but the press conference is now over.
Thank you for all your questions.

474
00:48:52,829 --> 00:49:00,386
Lyudmila, your mistake is that you looked
for discussion in to the direction you need.

475
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:06,118
Always begin knowing precisely what you
are going to say and always be confident.

476
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:11,305
And confidence comes with a smile.

477
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:22,981
More softly...naturally.
The smile is your main weapon.

478
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,955
It's hard to talk like that...

479
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:30,240
Of course this is hard.
It takes years of practice.

480
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:36,385
And you must hold that smile as long as you can.
Speak loudly, confidently.

481
00:49:36,732 --> 00:49:45,624
And always look the person directly in the eyes.
Try to relax. Remember something, that makes you smile.

482
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:50,614
Comrade captain, I got three more.
Odessa, September 1941.

483
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,738
Write down the statement, comrade captain.

484
00:49:53,963 --> 00:49:57,210
We are the witnesses. She killed two on spot.
And she waited for the third. 

485
00:49:57,448 --> 00:50:01,313
We even made a bet. German had lit up the 
cigarette thinking he was invisible,

486
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:07,717
she shot and we had to crawl.

486
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,700
Here.

487
00:50:08,998 --> 00:50:13,104
Now you can see how harmful smoking is.
Take it.

488
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:16,539
Lyuda, come to intelligence service in the evening.

489
00:50:16,776 --> 00:50:20,246
We will surround you with warmth and care.
Here is warm too.

490
00:50:20,493 --> 00:50:23,726
We will wait for you anyway.

491
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,834
There Lyuda,

492
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:37,114
you are going to get a medal.

493
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:43,394
Comrade captain...have you had 
direct hits in the night?

494
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:47,074
I have had my moments.

495
00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:53,532
I remember in Finland, was out sniping.

496
00:50:53,868 --> 00:50:59,634
Interesting position occurred.

497
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:04,331
If I aimed from that position like this

498
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:09,071
I would clear three targets simultaneously.

499
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:16,535
I go out to that position and wait.
Boom! And that would be it.

500
00:51:16,937 --> 00:51:21,376
But in the statement they 
had written only one.

501
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:25,758
They didn't believe it!
I made only the single shot.

502
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:31,140
Three?

503
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,700
Krepchuk.
Yes.

504
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:03,952
Where is Pavlichenko?
Went to the right, she changed positions.

505
00:52:25,202 --> 00:52:26,000
Help me.

506
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:25,166
Pavlichenko, come here!

507
00:53:25,918 --> 00:53:29,474
Pavlichenko, who authorized you
to leave your position?

508
00:53:29,725 --> 00:53:32,484
Can we talk about this later?

509
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:56,179
******.
Danke dir. (German: Thank you)

510
00:53:56,403 --> 00:54:00,203
That's it...

511
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:10,170
Come on! Get up!

512
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:22,966
What are you doing, fool!?
What?

513
00:54:23,169 --> 00:54:27,968
You showed me yesterday how to kill three with one shot.
If it were not you, I would have shot my 73rd!

514
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,096
They could kill you!
And you too.

515
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:33,842
Wait.

516
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:39,616
Do you want to be tried by a 
court-martial for your excesses?

517
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:44,226
Get back to your position.
Understood.

518
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:55,046
Comrade captain, at the right side of the forest
next to the shell crater.

519
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:01,268
Is wounded good for account?
Write down on more for me.

520
00:55:01,488 --> 00:55:04,529
Calm down, you blockhead.
Stop!

521
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:07,625
It hurts.

522
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:19,895
Today I saved two.

523
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:25,560
That would make it my 20th.

524
00:55:25,827 --> 00:55:30,091
No, my 21st.
Blow on it.

525
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:34,995
21st?
I shot 73 Germans.

526
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:37,965
Could have been more,
had it not been for Makarov.

527
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:41,877
Give me permission to land here.
Permission is given!

528
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,763
Hello, Lyuda.

529
00:55:43,934 --> 00:55:46,987
I missed you so much!

530
00:55:58,238 --> 00:56:01,124
Hello, captain.

531
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:07,574
Why do you sew it yourself? You have
women subordinates at your disposal, ask them.

532
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:12,916
I love to sew, it calms me.

533
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:25,523
New orders: to begin preparations for troops
evacuation to the Crimea.

534
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:31,894
The troops will assemble at the port.
Your task is to provide the cover.

535
00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:35,117
Here...

536
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,906
and here.

537
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:41,902
We're leaving tomorrow.

538
00:56:48,403 --> 00:56:52,474
Why surrender Odessa?
We can still resist them.

539
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:56,284
Authorities know better.

540
00:56:56,537 --> 00:56:59,105
I am myself from Odessa.

541
00:56:59,314 --> 00:57:06,150
It kills my soul to imagine fascists 
creeping around Dyuk's monument.

542
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:11,184
Can I take short cut over to Prishtup troops.
Yes, but stick to the left.

543
00:57:11,485 --> 00:57:15,141
Well, take care.

544
00:57:22,496 --> 00:57:26,098
Come on, let me through.
I have no breaks.

545
00:58:04,701 --> 00:58:10,632
Let's drink.
Let's drink to Odessa.

546
00:58:10,984 --> 00:58:17,315
To the city, which...
To the city where I fell in love.

547
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:31,536
It seems we are out of fuel.
I have it, one second.

548
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:35,685
Excuse me.

549
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:39,450
Wait!
That's an order.

550
00:58:44,756 --> 00:58:46,888
Grisha!

551
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:08,378
 I  wanted for a long time to 
 be alone with you.

552
00:59:08,706 --> 00:59:11,206
Why?

553
00:59:14,966 --> 00:59:17,160
That's enough! Don't do it!

554
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,761
I do not love you.

555
00:59:22,957 --> 00:59:27,359
We are grown people.
War and death is everywhere.

556
00:59:27,645 --> 00:59:30,487
Tomorrow we may be killed.

557
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:37,792
It hurts! Let me go!

558
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,677
My groin...

559
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:48,107
Thanks, but there is no need
to save me so often.

560
00:59:48,342 --> 00:59:51,543
You could tell me right away,
you have a man.

561
00:59:51,778 --> 00:59:55,701
I told you.

562
01:00:21,104 --> 01:00:26,001
Forgive me.
Why?

563
01:00:27,352 --> 01:00:29,856
 I have promised.

564
01:00:30,065 --> 01:00:32,205
To whom?

565
01:00:34,585 --> 01:00:36,685
To myself.

566
01:00:45,147 --> 01:00:48,264
Let me help you.

567
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:57,129
This you can do.

568
01:00:59,592 --> 01:01:02,416
I can't.

569
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:07,113
Is it because of your wife?
Because of the war.

570
01:01:07,356 --> 01:01:11,789
If you were killed...
You are a coward, comrade captain.

571
01:01:14,476 --> 01:01:18,538
We have to believe we 
are not going to be killed.

572
01:02:09,077 --> 01:02:13,405
Lyuda! Can you hear me?
Breathe!

573
01:02:16,051 --> 01:02:18,190
Just a little more.

574
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:21,175
Come on!

575
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:39,049
Can you hear me?

576
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,155
Quiet. I managed to take you out.

577
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:03,261
Makar, Makar...

578
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:13,345
I love you.
Quiet, quiet now.

579
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:21,474
Go to sleep.

580
01:03:22,813 --> 01:03:26,666
Everything will be fine now.

581
01:03:31,947 --> 01:03:37,985
Boris Larionovich, Polyakov has
a fever and delirium again.

582
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:45,335
Well...change his bandage.
What bandage, Boris Larionovich?

583
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,399
Oh, excuse me.

584
01:04:02,374 --> 01:04:06,178
Doctor! Doctor.

585
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,657
I have a personal request.
This fighter Pavlichenko

586
01:04:11,909 --> 01:04:15,865
is very valuable and important.
Take good care of her.

587
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:20,108
We take care of  all patients.
She is not 'all'.

588
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:26,763
She's special...
I know she is special!

589
01:04:27,133 --> 01:04:32,133
I love her too. And I've loved 
her for a long time..

590
01:04:35,933 --> 01:04:43,123
So I can be rest assured,
you will take good care of her.

591
01:04:43,528 --> 01:04:48,349
She later will decide herself,
who she is going to stay with.

592
01:04:48,653 --> 01:04:53,669
Too bad you haven't
taken care of her.

593
01:05:00,858 --> 01:05:02,954
The White House, Washington D.C, 1942

594
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:07,118
This needs to be poured into the pan for the Borscht.

595
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:11,937
Borscht...
No, soft and more naturally.

596
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:16,844
Borscht...
Borscht.

597
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:28,498
In the Soviet Union, women do this.
In America women do this!

598
01:05:42,974 --> 01:05:46,143
What a day!

599
01:05:50,754 --> 01:05:56,787
It's alright! It's only a frying pan.

600
01:06:09,496 --> 01:06:14,666
Sorry...

601
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:18,195
What happened?

602
01:06:21,217 --> 01:06:28,444
I was covered...in earth five minutes
and nearly died.

603
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,674
I can only imagine...

604
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,893
how terrible it has been.

605
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:49,356
Sevastopol Evacuation, Autumn 1941

606
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:08,166
Take it.

607
01:07:08,701 --> 01:07:10,887
Eat.

608
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:27,983
Lyuda, I wanted to ask you...

609
01:08:54,271 --> 01:08:59,421
Dear, do not be afraid.
Fear not, everything will be fine.

610
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:11,809
Grisha is flying over us.
There, look!

611
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:16,819
He flies above! Fear not, drink.
Soon you will see Makar.

612
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,441
Do not be afraid.
How are you?

613
01:09:57,678 --> 01:09:59,497
I will be back soon.

614
01:09:59,677 --> 01:10:04,891
- Get up. - I have to
You are not a soldier.

615
01:10:05,214 --> 01:10:10,193
Get up, you have a disability.
You won't get to the front anymore.

616
01:10:10,504 --> 01:10:12,636
You do not understand, I have to.

617
01:10:12,829 --> 01:10:16,907
Under these conditions
I cannot heal you!

618
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:20,768
So treat me.
Come on, cure me!

619
01:10:21,023 --> 01:10:26,286
I'll testify to the commission you are not able!
I'm a doctor, not a magician.

620
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:34,694
The headquarters of Sevastopol
defensive area. November 1941.

621
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:38,849
Ivan Evtimovich!

622
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:44,173
Hello, Lyudmila.
Please sign the report that I am healthy.

623
01:10:44,461 --> 01:10:48,317
Bravo, good to see you are able.

624
01:10:49,937 --> 01:10:55,617
Here, come with me.
Let's drink some tea.

625
01:10:55,956 --> 01:10:58,849
What happened to your arm?
She's with me.

626
01:11:09,288 --> 01:11:12,073
Wait here a moment.

627
01:11:12,293 --> 01:11:15,637
We have received an order from
headquarters to protect the city!

628
01:11:15,883 --> 01:11:18,743
At any cost.

629
01:11:18,966 --> 01:11:23,796
This is General Petrov.
He arrived from the first line of defense.

630
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:29,960
And he likely has suggestions.
Please, General.

631
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:35,936
The first line of defense is
now in 13 km from Sevastopol.

632
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:42,515
Thus the city is vulnerable to German artillery.
We cannot drive the enemy back.

633
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:46,161
Even if we could, the defense 
line would stretch,

634
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,884
and we will not be able to defend it.
How to protect the city.

635
01:11:51,174 --> 01:11:55,668
One hit with 305mm linkorov caliber shrapnel

636
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,168
covers the area with width of 250 meters
and a length of 1 km.

637
01:12:00,448 --> 01:12:05,521
Only on the battleship 'Paris Commune' alone
are 12 guns of this type.

638
01:12:05,834 --> 01:12:09,754
They can crush the artillery of enemy.

639
01:12:10,023 --> 01:12:16,094
But as far as I know, your order dispatched
almost all the ships to the Caucasus.

640
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:20,054
I deem it necessary to bring the 
ships back immediately!

641
01:12:20,308 --> 01:12:24,629
My task is to protect the fleet.
And in this situation I have no right...

642
01:12:24,915 --> 01:12:27,587
Our common task is to protect Sevastopol!

643
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:32,468
Theater of operations has moved on land long 
time ago. Your inability and unwillingness,

644
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:37,726
to learn how to fight in this field is
leading to a great number of deaths of sailors.

645
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:41,812
They don't want to dig trenches, to blend in.
They don't want to crawl on their bellies.

646
01:12:42,075 --> 01:12:48,649
Why can't you change uniform?
Our uniform is our pride.

647
01:12:54,027 --> 01:12:59,122
Comrades, meet Sergeant Lyudmila Pavlichenko.

648
01:12:59,437 --> 01:13:02,322
As they say, God sent. She's a sniper.

649
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:08,343
Tell us now, in real combat situation
who has more chances to survive,

650
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:13,501
me with protective shirt
or this man in black uniform jacket?

651
01:13:13,804 --> 01:13:16,362
I would kill a uniform jacket first.

652
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:20,039
I would have to seek for you,
comrade General.

653
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:23,707
That's that.
Thank you, Lyudmila.

654
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:28,094
Dyachenko! Prepare orders to change the uniforms.

655
01:13:28,341 --> 01:13:33,210
Ivan Efimovich!
And my report?

656
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:40,783
If the doctors allow it,
you may fight in full force.

657
01:13:44,904 --> 01:13:48,173
Anyone seriously wounded?

658
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:10,995
Comrade Major, get out of the way!

659
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,253
How many beds do we have available?

660
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:21,649
Boris, I need the note I'm healthy.
Sign here.

661
01:14:22,285 --> 01:14:27,231
Boris Efimich, Sidorenko has a massive blood 
loss, needs amputation of both limbs.

662
01:14:27,539 --> 01:14:31,705
Take him straight up to the
3rd floor operating room.

663
01:14:31,983 --> 01:14:37,222
Zhuk, severe liver damage.
Zhuk?!

664
01:14:38,845 --> 01:14:44,547
Send him to the 1st hospital.
Vadim!

665
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:52,878
Where? Where is our squad?
Where is she?

666
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:58,180
Look, there they are.

667
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:29,640
Lyuda!

668
01:15:30,982 --> 01:15:34,838
How good that you are here.

669
01:15:38,642 --> 01:15:41,856
I promised Makarov.

670
01:15:42,095 --> 01:15:46,774
He really wanted this be yours.

671
01:15:57,048 --> 01:16:00,938
That's the way it is in the war.

672
01:16:02,244 --> 01:16:07,270
We have to live.
We have to live.

673
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:22,455
Boris!
Lyuda.

674
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:24,797
Where did you go?
I need to the front lines. Sign it.

675
01:16:24,992 --> 01:16:28,863
No offense, but...

676
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:33,933
You are not cured after contusion.
It would be murder to send you there.

677
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:39,276
I cannot do this.
Makarov died.

678
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:46,433
Did you hear me?
Excuse me.

679
01:16:50,855 --> 01:16:55,457
Stay here Boris!
You do not you understand, with this, I can...

680
01:16:55,753 --> 01:16:58,586
'Suitable for service'.

681
01:17:11,498 --> 01:17:14,398
Thank you, Borya!

682
01:17:26,443 --> 01:17:28,117
USA, White House, 1942

683
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:30,120
Yes!

684
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:36,103
I am ready.
Close your eyes.

685
01:17:37,601 --> 01:17:40,406
Don't peek!

686
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,343
Open them.

687
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:06,485
This is for you.

688
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:16,792
Close your eyes.

689
01:18:21,457 --> 01:18:24,224
Don't peek!

690
01:18:33,217 --> 01:18:34,902
Open.

691
01:18:35,918 --> 01:18:42,918
It is so sad that nobody
sees the woman in you.

692
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,853
People...

693
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,781
don't always see the woman in the lead.

694
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:58,332
When it all began between
Franklin and I, I was so happy.

695
01:18:58,727 --> 01:19:04,332
Oh! He was intelligent and
successful and handsome.

696
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:12,031
Why did he pay attention to me?
I wasn't at all beautiful, I was so tall.

697
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:15,472
And he chose me.

698
01:19:21,884 --> 01:19:25,644
I'm your new boss.
Let's go to kill fascists!

699
01:19:25,904 --> 01:19:29,099
Masha, you fool!
Sevastopol, November 1941.

700
01:19:29,339 --> 01:19:34,173
Hey, Lyuda.
Look what I brought!

701
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:41,111
I traded alcohol for it.

702
01:19:41,352 --> 01:19:43,486
And so...

703
01:19:46,489 --> 01:19:50,004
Voila! Voila!

704
01:19:50,254 --> 01:19:55,725
The smaller one for me,
bigger one for you.

705
01:19:56,372 --> 01:19:59,508
Thank you.
Thank you...what kind of 'thank you' is this?

706
01:19:59,742 --> 01:20:02,566
'Thank you'.
I'm going to freeze.

707
01:20:02,787 --> 01:20:07,721
We will walk and lay on these stones.
We still have to bear children in the future.

708
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:12,852
Let's go together next time.
We can visit Grisha as well.

709
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:19,159
He has been very lonely,
since they shot down Nikolay.

710
01:20:26,917 --> 01:20:32,489
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

711
01:20:32,826 --> 01:20:35,776
Have you seen your new commanding officer?
Does he look good?

712
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:40,212
No.
He is not handsome?

713
01:20:40,495 --> 01:20:43,230
I have not seen him.

714
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:48,162
Can you imagine, maybe he is some old man.

715
01:20:48,462 --> 01:20:51,509
And if he were young...

716
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:56,604
he would definitely start to harass.

717
01:21:01,893 --> 01:21:05,667
Captain Leonid Kitsenko,
your new commanding officer.

718
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:8,605
Welcome to the table.

718
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,605
We have special tasks.

719
01:21:10,903 --> 01:21:13,706
Diversions behind enemy lines,
hunting down enemy snipers.

720
01:21:13,927 --> 01:21:17,267
Do we start tomorrow?
Yes.

721
01:21:17,509 --> 01:21:22,684
Are we allowed to take the dog-tags from the bodies?
Lyudmila, eat.

722
01:22:15,925 --> 01:22:18,080
Stand down.

723
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:26,347
Retreat.

724
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:30,404
Follow me!

725
01:22:33,644 --> 01:22:38,878
Stop. Stop!
About face!

726
01:22:40,367 --> 01:22:43,979
We can't do that, 
 we are not fascists.

727
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:48,101
Why didn't you let me kill him?
They do not deserve an easy death.

728
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:52,603
They killed... -It's not about them.
It's about you.

729
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:55,808
You can't live your life for the sake of revenge.

730
01:22:56,034 --> 01:23:01,032
War is not only death,
it is also...  That's life.

731
01:23:01,346 --> 01:23:04,384
If you do not find out
what to live for in the wartime,

732
01:23:04,614 --> 01:23:08,102
you'll get killed.
They can kill me. Why do you care?

733
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:13,151
I don't want to lose another partner.

734
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:31,389
Both of you, here are two positions,
precise and dangerous tactic.

735
01:23:33,478 --> 01:23:36,347
It's a long shot.

736
01:23:39,373 --> 01:23:43,953
Listen to your heart.
Shoot between heartbeats.

737
01:24:05,413 --> 01:24:07,517
Taking a photograph.

738
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:54,071
Take it.

739
01:25:37,545 --> 01:25:41,273
Schnappsen.
Let's drink.

740
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:44,066
Here is to the medal for Grisha!

741
01:25:44,276 --> 01:25:48,596
He did like this, I did like that and went behind him...
shot and he went down!

742
01:26:05,976 --> 01:26:08,076
Celebrating.

743
01:26:15,122 --> 01:26:18,975
For them it is Christmas!

744
01:26:42,653 --> 01:26:47,579
If you don't want to give to
the fascist with the rifle

745
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:53,412
your home, wife, mother,
all that you call homeland.

746
01:26:53,743 --> 01:26:59,505
Remember that no one will save the motherland,
if you do not save her yourself!

747
01:26:59,851 --> 01:27:05,071
Remember that no one will kill him,
if you do not kill him!

748
01:27:05,391 --> 01:27:11,371
Kill the fascist, so that him was laying 
on the ground but not you.

749
01:27:11,725 --> 01:27:17,855
So that the grief was in his home
but not in yours.

750
01:27:18,214 --> 01:27:25,193
So kill at least one!
Kill him quicker!

751
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:33,400
As many times you see him,
as many times kill him!

752
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:53,586
This night Hitler wanted to celebrate
the New Year in Sevastopol.

753
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:59,564
But thanks to our persistence,
we're celebrating for the second time!

754
01:27:59,861 --> 01:28:03,622
We have pushed the enemy 
from the city walls!

755
01:28:03,922 --> 01:28:09,506
Sevastopol is alive.
Sevastopol will live!

756
01:28:10,216 --> 01:28:15,229
Leonid, meet my friend Boris.

757
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:18,049
I knew him  before the war.

758
01:28:18,257 --> 01:28:20,228
Boris.
Leonid.

759
01:28:20,412 --> 01:28:25,839
In connection with  delivery of the ammunition
I command to begin immediately

760
01:28:26,172 --> 01:28:32,808
liquidation of 1,500 cases of champagne
and to vacate tunnels.

761
01:28:33,187 --> 01:28:38,736
Happy New Year 1942!
Hurrah, comrades!

762
01:28:44,818 --> 01:28:47,015
To comrade Stalin!

763
01:28:51,511 --> 01:28:56,546
Wait! Do not open it.
I'll bring cups.

764
01:28:59,983 --> 01:29:05,346
Last time we drank champagne
with darling at my house.

765
01:29:09,365 --> 01:29:13,176
How long have you known her?
I fell in love with her before the war.

766
01:29:13,438 --> 01:29:16,138
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

767
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:20,074
Do you regret it?
That I fell in love?

768
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:23,056
That you are in a war.

769
01:29:23,273 --> 01:29:28,546
No, then I would have to regret
that I fell in love with her.

770
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:32,964
And here I can see her sometimes.

771
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:38,669
And you?
Do you love her?

772
01:29:42,337 --> 01:29:45,421
Hands off! What are you doing?!

773
01:29:45,655 --> 01:29:48,584
You spend time only with officers?

774
01:29:49,434 --> 01:29:53,256
Officer scum!

775
01:29:56,553 --> 01:29:59,887
We have to beat the Germans, not each other!

776
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:14,446
Happy New Year.

777
01:30:51,137 --> 01:30:56,366
I thought this happens differently.

778
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:55,017
USA, Chicago 1942

779
01:31:57,926 --> 01:32:02,570
Excuse me, Miss Pavlichenko.
I came here without my agent.

780
01:32:02,866 --> 01:32:08,100
I have an offer. I have project for you.
Look, these are cigarettes.

781
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:14,439
I'll give you a million bucks if you allow me 
to print your photo on my cigarettes, and then....

782
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:18,007
That man is my agent.

783
01:32:18,245 --> 01:32:21,054
That guy?
Yes! Talk to him.

784
01:32:21,278 --> 01:32:23,779
Thank you.

785
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:28,565
Sorry about the wait.
My guitar also kills.

786
01:32:28,789 --> 01:32:32,357
A good weapon.
Thank you, everyone has their own weapon.

787
01:32:32,609 --> 01:32:35,724
Let's go to my dressing room.

788
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,281
it's impossible to talk.
I've something for you.

789
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,345
Miss Pavlichenko...

790
01:32:42,296 --> 01:32:44,353
Lyuda!

791
01:32:44,826 --> 01:32:47,739
Pavlichenko!

792
01:32:47,965 --> 01:32:50,709
What were you thinking?
Are you insane?

793
01:32:50,928 --> 01:32:55,340
I'm your agent?
Miss Pavlichenko, let me ask you two questions.

794
01:32:55,627 --> 01:33:00,771
Please. Hold on. Hold on.
Listen to me!

795
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:06,974
Miss Pavlichenko, do you really think the
President will forgo his election promise,

796
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:10,750
and sends our soldiers away to
die on foreign land?

797
01:33:10,998 --> 01:33:13,406
Sorry!
Please.

798
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:19,114
At the press conference, they'll ask you a lot 
harder questions and you won't be able to answer.

799
01:33:19,448 --> 01:33:24,346
You are more popular than me,
Miss Pavlichenko.

800
01:33:56,891 --> 01:34:00,886
Do you like it?
Yes, I like it.

801
01:34:01,157 --> 01:34:07,017
I've written  this song about you.
May I perform it for my fans? 

802
01:34:07,365 --> 01:34:12,473
No one dedicated me a song.

803
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:19,463
Sevastopol, Spring 1942

804
01:34:39,892 --> 01:34:43,081
You know, I've decided having
a boy with Grisha.

805
01:34:43,321 --> 01:34:46,750
Masha, you are crazy.
I want to have something

806
01:34:46,996 --> 01:34:49,803
that belongs to me, in here.

807
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,254
Grisha is not against it.

808
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:10,402
Lyuda!

809
01:35:10,577 --> 01:35:12,705
I have news!
What, Masha?

810
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,926
Come, I will tell you.

811
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:21,369
Come tomorrow to our wedding.

812
01:35:21,645 --> 01:35:23,558
Where?
To the wedding.

813
01:35:23,743 --> 01:35:27,226
To the wedding, to have fun!
We are going to have fun.

814
01:36:08,713 --> 01:36:11,561
Aunt Lyuda!

815
01:36:11,783 --> 01:36:14,854
How many have you killed today?
Two.

816
01:36:15,085 --> 01:36:17,527
It's OK.
It's not enough.

817
01:36:17,733 --> 01:36:21,409
Aunt Lyuda, look!
Excellent.

818
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:24,391
You can see that I can aim too!

819
01:36:24,607 --> 01:36:29,160
Will you teach me to shoot a gun?
Me too...

820
01:36:29,453 --> 01:36:33,498
I will teach you everything.
But not right now. Practice this for now.

821
01:36:38,364 --> 01:36:40,464
I'm Lyuda! No, I'm Lyuda!
Watch out!

822
01:36:48,034 --> 01:36:52,402
You are late. 
I'm sorry.

823
01:36:52,686 --> 01:36:57,198
I invited you to the wedding,
and it turned out to be the wake.

824
01:36:57,802 --> 01:37:03,758
Grisha has been killed.
Let's drink as a farewell.

825
01:37:20,413 --> 01:37:23,463
 I don't regret it.

826
01:37:23,693 --> 01:37:28,260
No doubt war kills people.

827
01:37:28,555 --> 01:37:32,358
But we thought, if we were together...

828
01:37:32,621 --> 01:37:36,440
it wouldn't be so scary.

829
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:42,265
Being together is always better, Lyuda.

830
01:37:45,508 --> 01:37:51,755
We have to love.
We should celebrate!

831
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:11,723
Lyonya... I want a boy.

832
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:24,901
You told me that war is such a life.

833
01:38:58,845 --> 01:39:00,418
Yes.

834
01:39:04,474 --> 01:39:08,772
Good morning.
Good morning.

834
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,972
USA, Chicago 1942

835
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:13,150
Pavlichenko, what is all this masquerade?

836
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:22,322
Get out of that dress immediately.

837
01:39:22,922 --> 01:39:26,863
Let them see that I'm a woman.

838
01:39:28,571 --> 01:39:35,605
You're not a woman, you're a Soviet soldier.
Remember that!

839
01:39:36,105 --> 01:39:43,180
You'll come out. Stalin, we've common enemy, second front.
No actions on your own!

840
01:39:44,559 --> 01:39:47,646
Are we clear?

841
01:39:49,128 --> 01:39:52,288
Yes, sir.

842
01:40:24,656 --> 01:40:29,059
What have they done to you?

843
01:40:35,628 --> 01:40:38,525
I cannot take it anymore.

844
01:40:38,948 --> 01:40:43,748
The men should have protected you.

845
01:40:52,715 --> 01:40:56,497
Sevastopol, Summer 1942

846
01:40:56,757 --> 01:40:58,436
Lyuda?

847
01:41:06,144 --> 01:41:08,244
Lyuda, you...

848
01:42:30,502 --> 01:42:33,756
Help!

849
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:42,033
Help!

850
01:42:49,187 --> 01:42:53,173
Help! Lyonya!

851
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,940
Help!

852
01:42:57,653 --> 01:43:02,799
Leonid!
Leonid!

853
01:43:08,593 --> 01:43:10,942
Lyonya!

854
01:43:20,877 --> 01:43:23,749
Where is...Lyonya!

855
01:43:23,974 --> 01:43:27,967
Where is Lyonya?
Quiet. Lyonya died.

856
01:43:28,236 --> 01:43:30,681
Calm down, listen to me.

857
01:43:30,886 --> 01:43:37,295
I am guilty! The war is over for you.
You are discharged and unfit for military service.

858
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:40,671
Who are you going to discharge here?

859
01:43:40,901 --> 01:43:46,855
Pavlichenko is not an ordinary soldier now.
She is a symbol, and symbols can't be discharged.

860
01:43:47,206 --> 01:43:52,036
Leave the hospital immediately!
Do you want a military tribunal?

861
01:43:52,342 --> 01:43:56,006
This is not a sanatorium
for pre-war girlfriends.

862
01:43:56,262 --> 01:44:00,044
Haven't you read this?!
The Germans say, they have killed her.

863
01:44:00,305 --> 01:44:04,769
Third assault is approaching. 
My soldiers fight with her name on their lips.

864
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:08,997
I will complain to General Petrov.

865
01:44:09,266 --> 01:44:14,532
It's his order to put her on her feet.
We need her in the front.

866
01:44:14,854 --> 01:44:18,672
Put your hands up. Hold it.
Let me do it.

867
01:44:19,665 --> 01:44:21,797
Higher?

868
01:44:26,902 --> 01:44:30,986
She does not look particularly heroic.

869
01:44:31,991 --> 01:44:33,814
Smile.

870
01:44:34,425 --> 01:44:39,984
Raise your head.
Be merrier.

870
01:44:40,984 --> 01:44:41,984
Attention.

871
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:30,651
Comrade Commissioner.
Pavlichenko, come in.

872
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:34,234
Take a look.

873
01:46:34,478 --> 01:46:38,238
One of the best German snipers,
Otto von Singer.

874
01:46:38,497 --> 01:46:41,418
He came for you!
They believed you are still alive.

875
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:47,201
Your photo worked.

876
01:46:47,744 --> 01:46:52,923
According to our intelligence, 
his nests were found in this area.

876
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,923
I won't be able, comrade Commissioner.

877
01:46:54,244 --> 01:46:56,652
Lyuda, drop it. Do you understand
how important is to win this duel?

878
01:46:56,897 --> 01:46:59,204
He is best sniper, I am not anymore.

879
01:46:59,404 --> 01:47:05,694
The report from the military doctor says,
I am unfit for military service.

880
01:47:06,058 --> 01:47:09,922
Do you understand how many of your 
comrades-in-arms this Singer is going to kill?
I won't be able.

881
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:14,579
You have to do this, it's not for me...
I won't be able...

882
01:47:14,865 --> 01:47:19,410
it's not for you.
Do this for Leonid Kitsenko.

883
01:47:21,023 --> 01:47:23,244
Okay.

884
01:47:25,249 --> 01:47:26,619
Okay...

885
01:50:51,288 --> 01:50:54,538
I need to see the Major General, please.

886
01:50:57,591 --> 01:51:00,829
Comrade Major General...

887
01:51:01,067 --> 01:51:04,180
 what have you got there?

888
01:51:04,414 --> 01:51:08,417
We must evacuate Sergeant Pavlichenko,
as soon as possible.

889
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:14,154
How about others? We are now preparing 
evacuation of archive and documentation.

890
01:51:14,485 --> 01:51:19,122
Of all the people I have right to evacuate 
only Party workers and valuable specialists.

891
01:51:19,418 --> 01:51:22,291
I have my orders.
Hundreds of dead Germans.

892
01:51:22,517 --> 01:51:26,483
Four times wounded in battle,
contusion.

893
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:31,492
She is a woman, after all.
Isn't she valuable?

894
01:51:31,794 --> 01:51:35,075
Does she not deserve that?

894
01:51:55,794 --> 01:51:56,575
We are Soviet people!

894
01:51:58,794 --> 01:51:59,975
Let us through!

895
01:52:03,689 --> 01:52:06,116
I am a military doctor!

896
01:52:12,178 --> 01:52:14,981
I am a Party worker!

897
01:52:18,602 --> 01:52:20,902
Lyuda, wait, I'm...
Where you're going!

898
01:52:32,325 --> 01:52:37,053
Back!

899
01:52:38,393 --> 01:52:41,504
Lyuda!

900
01:52:51,764 --> 01:52:54,185
Stop this panic!

901
01:52:54,802 --> 01:52:58,638
Boris, wait.

902
01:53:00,948 --> 01:53:06,176
The sea smells like in Odessa...

903
01:53:06,499 --> 01:53:08,639
as then...

904
01:53:08,831 --> 01:53:16,094
Sonia took us to the beach and said,
you'd see me in swimsuit.

905
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:22,436
Sonia's fish, 'La Traviata',
your parents, family ring...

906
01:53:22,786 --> 01:53:26,966
The archive...
Wait, you remember the ring?

907
01:53:27,244 --> 01:53:31,480
I always knew, that one day 
I will give it to you..

908
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:37,268
You know we would have five children.
Wow, five, Boris?

909
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:40,667
Sonia  would teach you
how to cook.

910
01:53:40,899 --> 01:53:44,073
I know how to make dumplings.

911
01:53:44,311 --> 01:53:46,642
Well, we would sit at the big table.
Yes, everyday.

912
01:53:46,843 --> 01:53:50,950
Every day, except when we go to the opera.

913
01:53:51,223 --> 01:53:54,799
No, Borya. I don't like opera.
I prefer cinema.

914
01:53:55,053 --> 01:53:58,633
Quick, we are running out of time.
Be careful with her!

915
01:53:58,886 --> 01:54:01,903
Lyuda, take your suitcase, 
there is everything you need.

916
01:54:02,133 --> 01:54:05,794
Boris, what about you?
We are ready to dive!

917
01:54:06,050 --> 01:54:11,421
I will take the next steamer.
I am a Jew from Odessa, I'll get out of here.

918
01:54:11,749 --> 01:54:16,832
Borya! Let me go. Wait.
Get ready to the emergency dive!

919
01:54:17,667 --> 01:54:20,027
Borya! Boris!

920
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:24,560
Let me go.
Wait! Stop!

921
01:54:24,845 --> 01:54:26,835
Borya!

922
01:54:33,271 --> 01:54:39,684
Lyudmila opened for me one of the most
terrible pages of this great war.

923
01:54:40,057 --> 01:54:44,034
The defense of Sevastopol
lasted 250 days,

924
01:54:44,303 --> 01:54:47,697
but the city was seized.

925
01:54:47,942 --> 01:54:52,725
Neither military fighters nor
citizens were evacuated.

926
01:54:53,029 --> 01:54:56,722
General Petrov and several dozen 
officers from the command,

927
01:54:56,980 --> 01:54:59,992
were evacuated by submarine.

928
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:05,973
With aircrafts, submarines and boats 
were evacuated about 3000 people 

929
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:09,958
from Sevastopol to the Caucasus.

930
01:55:10,212 --> 01:55:15,715
Admiral Oktyabarskiy, was evacuated on a plane.

931
01:55:29,862 --> 01:55:32,653
It was a miracle Lyudmila stayed alive.

932
01:55:32,873 --> 01:55:37,648
A miracle, granted by a man,
who never had a chance to propose.

933
01:55:37,952 --> 01:55:44,017
But he gave his pass to escape and
it was a pass for a future life.

934
01:56:03,334 --> 01:56:07,280
Boris who loved Lyuda, her best friend Masha,

935
01:56:07,548 --> 01:56:11,838
and about 80,000 defenders 
and inhabitants of Sevastopol

936
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:16,057
ended up face to face with enemy.

937
01:56:18,466 --> 01:56:22,980
Most of them were sentenced
to death and captivity.

938
01:56:23,271 --> 01:56:29,274
Lyuda often said to me ,
that they all were heroes.

939
01:56:33,732 --> 01:56:38,991
USA, Chicago, 1942

940
01:57:11,523 --> 01:57:17,566
Gentlemen...I'm 25 years old.

941
01:57:20,205 --> 01:57:26,234
And I have killed 309
fascist occupants by now.

942
01:57:27,112 --> 01:57:30,928
Don't you think, gentlemen,

943
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:36,879
that you have been hiding behind
my back for too long?

944
01:57:58,532 --> 01:58:03,246
We became friends.
From her letters I know

945
01:58:03,545 --> 01:58:05,688
she did not turn back to the front.

946
01:58:05,882 --> 01:58:08,934
She worked as an instructor
at snipers school.

947
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:13,393
After the war Lyuda
finished university.

948
01:58:13,673 --> 01:58:20,091
She was awarded the highest rank:
Hero of the Soviet Union.

949
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:31,165
Moscow, 1957

950
01:58:31,478 --> 01:58:37,381
She won all her wars, as a soldier, 
as a diplomat, and as a woman!

951
01:58:37,733 --> 01:58:43,734
I want to see her son.
I'm sure he'll look just like her.

952
01:58:44,086 --> 01:58:47,738
Yes, Mr. Khrushchev can probably wait.
