Well, he might.

But at least you don't have
to worry about e-mail.

Just one rat,

107
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,669
Just one Mohamed Atta,
one Ziad Jarrah...

108
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,548
There are more homeless
and hungry in Los Angeles County...

109

than anywhere else in the States.

110
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,053
This is
''The hunger capital of America''.

111
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,614
l just had no idea!

112
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,057

113
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,360

ls there no press?

117
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,134
No, it's all on lraq.

118
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,043
And if it wasn't that, they'd just find
something else to spin in its place.

119
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,111
Everyone buys it.

120
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,884
One big lie after another.

121
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,336
We handed the tents out
a few weeks ago.

122
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,433
Some wealthy woman bought a hundred
of them and brought them down.

123
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,213
l wish she'd come back
and bring some food.

124
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,946
lt's just too many!

125
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,576
We can't feed 'em all anymore.

126
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,190
How far are we from the mission?

127
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,850
You're just about to film it.

128
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,606
<i>Hey Chief! Who is the cutie?</i>

129
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,972
This is Lana.
l'll introduce you in the morning.

130
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,474
She's gonna be
with us a while, so...

131
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,746
she comes and goes
whenever she wants.

132
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,642
<i>Got it!</i> <i>See you tomorrow,</i>

Night, Sherman.

134
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,723
God! That lock!

135
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,397
This is the men's dorm.

136
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,002
Most of the drug dealers
work the streets at night...

137
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,630
so we lock them out
and go to bed kinda early.

138
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,202
You're probably beat anyway?

139
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,210
Yeah...

140
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,139
l'm a little tired.

141
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,159
Come on!

142
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,693
Are you hungry?

143
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,666
No, not really.

144
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,604
Good! You'll do well here.

145
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,856
l like it.

146
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,084
Sure you do.

147
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,593
No, l really do.

148
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,656
You are going to do
very well here.

149
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,831
Bathroom is down the hall.

150
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,527
And this key unlocks your door...

151
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,573
our kitchen,
and a few other things.

152
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,742
lt would be bad to lose it.

153
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,143
We usually have tea around six.

154
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,309
That sounds good.

155
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,710
Okay.

156
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,621
Night!

157
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,756
Good Night!

158
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,299

-You got it! Keep it coming.
-Get the fuck out of my way!

There you go.

167

You got it.

168
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,056
More shredded paper? Great!

169
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,764
Can you reassemble it?

170

All of it?

You got some more water.

-Where is it from?
-Read it!

175
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,215
What do you know about Borax?

176
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,813
Borax?

177
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,152
Yeah.

178

180
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,090
l wanna know what else
you can do with it.

181
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,594
What do you mean?
Like build a bomb?

182
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,395
-Just check it out.
-Alright.

183
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,832
l'll run it on the net.

184

What?

185
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,773
l was just thinking...

186
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,970
You know, everybody's
worried about a ''dirty bomb''.

187
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,642
Wouldn't it be funny
if it was made out of Borax?

188
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,231

is the real hub of activity, so...

213
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,170
we usually
leave this door closed.

214

Okay, got it.

215

-How you're doing, Marth?
-Hi, Henry?

218
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,816
You know, they've been
over capacity since, well...

219
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,049
since the last time
the fire marshal was here.

220
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,921
And we have a small room
for reading and prayer in there.

221
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,794
-And down here...

And then,
the real action is in here.

225
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,480
Café Maison.

-Your uncle? You got the wrong house.
-Paul... his name is Paul Jeffries?

259
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,697
No, no, no, never heard of him.
No!

260
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,045
l've been overseas for a long time
and l just got back into town.

And l'd really like to see him.

262

l kind of need to actually.

263
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,080
But the guy that lives here
doesn't have any relatives.

264
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,584
Well, he does.
He has one. lt's me.

265

Yeah, l was chubby.

266
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,759
So is there a way
that l can get in touch with him?

267
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,660
Cause l'm staying at a homeless mission
right now and l don't have a phone.

268
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,179
Look, you didn't...

269
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,954
you didn't get this from me, right?
Some little birdie told you.

270
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,294

Well, l don't know. What did they say

the food service

312

<i>Thanks for the update.</i>

320
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,326
<i>You have no idea</i>

322
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:58,365
<i>And how about</i>
<i>''ooh Ia Ia''Itzhak?</i>

323
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,971
<i>Itzhak who?</i>
<i>I've never heard of him.</i>

324
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,146
<i>Okay. Yish-mor-cha ha-eI...</i>
<i>Iove, YaeI.</i>

325
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,318
<i>God bIess you too, Lana.</i>

326
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,502
What's the matter, Jeffries?

327
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,803
Napalm getting to you?

328
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,573
Somebody get Polly here an APC
for his god-damn menstrual cramps.

329
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,716
Don't you get sick on me now,
Jeffries.

330
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,123
Charlie's not sick
hiding in that rat-hole.

331
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,563
There wasn't anybody sick
in Boston on September tenth.

332
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,892
l can guarantee that.

333
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,532
ln Washington and Newark...

334
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,195
they weren't sick and tired.
They were preparing...

335
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,038
god damn it!

336
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,711
Go ahead and laugh,
you fucking cowards!

337
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,976
Come on, laugh, you fucking,
lousy fucking Chuck.

338
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,843
You pull a box cutter on me,
motherfucker!

339
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,188
We'll see what happens.

340
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,918
Just one of those planes.

341
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,027
lf l had just been
on one of them...

342
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,030
Where the hell was everybody?

343
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,441
This country's been good to me.

344
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,681
This beautiful country...

345
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,782
Oh, God!

346
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:11,539
<i>GratefuI to you</i>

00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,813
l'm way out of my depths here...

349
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,987
yesterday l was still
in the West Bank, and then...

350
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,859
all of a sudden l'm here...

351
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,155
in my own country, but...

352
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,296
it feels so strange.

353
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,103
You gotta back me up
on this one, God...

354
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,962
even if l'm wrong...

355
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,571
l know that l need help.

356
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,302
l know that l can't do it
on my own.

357
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,941
<i>Do what on my own? I don't even</i>
<i>know why I'm here, in America.</i>

358
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,051
<i>To deIiver a Ietter?</i>

359
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,520
<i>There must be more to it,</i>
<i>it's not just for Mom.</i>

360
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,587
l don't have to be afraid.

361
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,655
l know that You're with me.

362
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,590
And l know
that You're always there...

363
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,601
with Your arms
stretched out wide.

364
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,137
Thank You, God.

365
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,267
Thank You for this day...

366
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,406
for this room...

367
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,275
for my life. Thank You!

368
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,784
We're falling! We're falling!

369
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,517
How is it going?

370
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,597
Maybe we'll talk later.

371
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,226
Hey!
How're you doing?

372
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,763
What, you serve me a couple of meals
and now we're supposed to be friends?

373
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,206
Come on. Sure, why not?

374
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,035
But you don't even know my name!

375
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,739
ls that one of the rules
of friendship?

376
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,910
How can you be someone's friend
when you don't know what to call them?

377
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,684
Well...

378
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,615
l don't know,
but l bet you there's a way.

379
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,559
Charles, is this your drink?

380
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,060
What's so funny?

381
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,436
Nothing. But you're standing there
with your foot in your mouth.

382
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,267
So she knows my name.
Big deal.

383
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,901
Charles...

384
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,179
-How you're doing?
-How you're doing?

385
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,476
-l'm good.
-They call me Dee Dee.

386
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,676
Dee Dee, it's nice to meet you.
l'm Lana.

387
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,541
Nice to meet you, too.

388
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,544
-You got some meat in there?
-Right.

389
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,783
-There.
-Thank you, thank you.

390
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,150
This is no coincidence,
this is a sign.

391
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,685
Yeah. Or maybe... instinct.

392
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,386
Maybe is just pure instinct.

393
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,895
Thirteen-twenty six.

394
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,395
Suspect relocated:
Bread of Life Mission.

395
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,491
Still inside. l remain in position.

396
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,836
l got all day, pal.
You take your time in there.

397
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:10,214
<i>Enjoy that sandwich!</i>
<i>Because that sandwich is gonna cost you.</i>

398
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:10,908
Hello.

399
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,643
<i>No free Iunch in this country.</i>

400
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,208
-l'm Lana.
-l'm Hassan.

401
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,221
Where are you from?

402
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,194
My home is not a place...

403
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,394
it is people.

404
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,367
Okay. Here we go.

405
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,173
Thirteen-forty eight.
Suspect engaged.

406
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,349
Standing on the northwest corner
of Winston and Los Angeles Street.

407
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,887
Under full surveillance!

408
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,384
Lead the way,
my little Pied Piper!

409
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,684
Lead the way.

410
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,863
He's got some more borax?
You got a lot of laundry, don't you?

411
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,301
So, you've ever been on a camel?

412
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,540
What?

413
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,071
ln Palestine, or wherever...

414
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,275
No, they have cars now.

415
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,546
That's where you're from, right?

416
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,051
Well, for the last
couple of years.

417
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,618
l was born in Ohio,
but l grew up mostly in Africa.

418
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,182
ln Africa?

419
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,225
My dad's a missionary.

420
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,823
So...

421
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,235
you've ever been on an elephant?

422
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,614
Suspect entered...

423
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,256
the Nidal Chemical
Bleaching Company...

424
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,997
at 645 lmperial Street.

425
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,535
That's an awful lot of barbed wire
for a bleaching company.

426
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:22,973
Bleaching.

427
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,145
Chemicals!

428
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,352
Hey, Boss.

429
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,882
<i>So, what'd you find</i>
<i>out for me on Borax?</i>

430
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,990
Didn't you get the information
l printed out for you?

431
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,720
l put it in the envelope
next to your seat.

432
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,991
l haven't had time.

433
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,995
You know those printer cartridges
just aren't cheap!

434
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,032
l got one report out of Trinidad.

435
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,540
There's an lslamic military group there,
and they're threatening attacks...

436
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,838
on the UK and The States.

437
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,377
Chemical attacks!

438
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,538
-And?
<i>-And, wow, wow...</i>

439
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,981
<i>weII, they're pIaying around</i>
<i>with a Iot of stuff. CobaIt.</i>

440
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,415
Cobalt sulfate, but they're using...

441
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,218
they're using Borax.
Borax is definitely part of the mix.

442
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,320
<i>Is that right?</i>

443
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,088
Yeah, but l don't know if they use it
or if they're boiling it down...

444
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,825
for boron acid or what. You know,
there's four different kinds of boron.

445
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,226
Pentahydrate boron,
dexahydrate boron...

446
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,099
anhydrous sodium
sulfate boron...

447
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,695
Good! Good work, Jimmy.

448
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,670
l'll get back to you.

449
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,573
And there is one
other kind of boron...

450
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,310
Serge?

451
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:00,402
<i>If anything sounds fishy to you</i>

Do we need the wars,
and the killing...

458
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,483
and the exploitation of man
by his fellow man?

459
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,752
Does God...

460
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:20,327
favor some people so he makes them
rich and powerful...

461
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,196
and we're the ones
who have fallen out of grace?

462
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:30,663
l wanna tell you right now, l have
some very good reasons not to think so.

463
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,239
Cause when Christ lived with us...

464
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,243
and he walked among us...

465
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,044
he preferred your company!

466
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,419
He would rather stay
with the outcasts...

467
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,449
and the whores and the underprivileged
than the rich and the hypocrites.

468
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,964
ln fact, when he sat at the table
of the wealthy, he couldn't even take it.

469
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,932
lt was an insult to him!
And that is where...

470
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,465
he told that story...

471
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,800
of a certain beggar,
a man called Lazarus...

472
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,768
who was on his knees at the...
at the gates of a mansion...

473
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,370
covered in sores...

474
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,645
asking for the crumbs that fell
from a rich man's table.

475
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:18,184
<i>This beggar was treated</i>
<i>worse than that man's dogs.</i>

476
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,083
<i>But after his death</i>
<i>he wasn't forgotten.</i>

477
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,589
l know l'm missing
critical information right here.

478
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,686
Goddamn it! l can sense it!

479
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,842
Holy shit!

480
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,736
Let's move, let's move.

481
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:43,905
Bring him over here.

482
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,035
Right here, come on!

483
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,471
Come on! Hold on now!
Hold on, my brother.

484
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,911
Come on! Let's go,
put him right there.

485
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,052
Hold on! Hold on!

486
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,945
Sherman, call an ambulance.
Ann.

487
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,050
Lord, help us!

488
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,559
Ann, get me a towel, a bunch of them.
And water.

489
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,589
-Hold on, my brother! Hold on!
-Hollow point forty-four.

490
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:10,664
What?

491
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,835
The bullet explodes on impact.
lt tears a big hole in you.

492
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,770
So, what do we do?
You know CPR? Come on?

493
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,640
Ambulance is on the way!

494
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,939
Save me! Save me!

495
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,815
Tell me who it was.
Anything you can tell.

496
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,114
Just give me a name.

497
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,451
-Trona... Trona.
-Trona? Okay.

498
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,014
Just give me a name!
Any name!

499
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,468
What did he say?

500
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,572
ls he going to make it?

501
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,314
No.

502
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,047
What happened?

503
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,220
lt was a drive-by.

504
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,987
You look a lot like your mother.

505
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,429
What?

506
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,229
Especially your eyes.

507
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,224
On my bed,
at night l remember you.

508
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,133
And l think of you through
the watches of the night...

509
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,364
because you are my help.

510
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,865
l sing in the shadow
of your wings.

511
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,100
My soul clings to you.

512
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,543
Your right hand upholds me.

513
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,480
Holy father,
accept this soul into heaven...

514
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,576
with all your divine mercy
and love.

515
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:37,879
Amen.

516
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,643
Who's that man, Lana?

517
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:16,343
Perpetrators approached the kerb
in a black Humvee...

518
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,312
at twenty-two hundred
and twenty hours.

519
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,721
Conversation with the victim
was unrecordable.

520
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,688
However, within the Hummer,
l identified laughter.

521
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,261
Authentic laughter!

522
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,767
That's not ClA.

523
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,169
lt's definitely not DHS.

524
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,500
That's a negative.

525
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:43,405
They wanted to make a statement,
but not too big of a statement.

526
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,218
A hundred and twenty
thousand dollar vehicle.

527
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:02,028
Now where'd that money come from?
Saudi Arabia? Pasadena?

528
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,965
Either way, it's an Op.

529
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:09,072
A small elite cell
that was gonna start some trouble...

530
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:11,772
that was gonna screw something up.

531
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,537
They didn't wanna work
for Al Qaeda or Jemaah lslamiyah...

532
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:19,241
or whatever the hell, so the big boys
had to send them a message.

533
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,252
Yeah. But the big question is:
what is the big plan...

534
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:28,655
that the small plan
was gonna screw up?

535
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,836
That laughter sounded Arabic.

536
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,511
Definitely Arabic.

537
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:44,595
<i>Damn it.</i>

538
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,536
-What?
<i>-PauI, it's Lana.</i>

539
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:58,141
-Congratulations! What do you want?
<i>-I wanna ask you a question.</i>

540
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,314
Well, now is not a good time.

541
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:02,983
<i>You shouIdn't be even using this phone!</i>
<i>It's for emergencies.</i>

542
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,213
Who's Trona?

543
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,456
What'd you say?

544
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:10,318
Trona. l heard what that man said to you.
He said ''Trona''.

545
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,220
<i>I just wanna heIp.</i>
<i>That's why I'm asking.</i>

546
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,363
Listen, there is a lot more to this
than you think there is.

547
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,461
l met him in the food line today
and he told me his name...

548
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:21,800
Hassan.

549
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,305
Don't say anything else.

550
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,435
This is not a secure line, alright?
l'll come to see you tomorrow.

551
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,729
Time to make the donuts!

552
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,366
Now this is critically important.
Are you with me?

553
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:01,774
Yeah!

554
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,042
Okay.

555
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:04,512
Number one.

556
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,540
Crime scene?

557
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,913
l'll explain it later. But l need you
to make a dub of this tape...

558
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,184
and deliver to all four local networks
by o-nine hundred.

559
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,748
Can you handle that?

560
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,391
Of course, l can handle it.

561
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,392
Alright.

562
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,129
And then have this Arabic document
translated and analyzed...

563
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,165
ASAP.

564
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,498
l will do. Consider it done.

565
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,330
Good.

566
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,865
-By o-nine hundred.
-O-nine hundred.

567
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,374
l want you all to listen to this again.
Neither death...

568
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:33,971
nor life...

569
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,612
nor rulers, nor powers...

570
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:43,050
will separate you and me
from the love of God. You are loved.

571
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,091
When you're asleep
out there in the streets...

572
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,718
you are loved!

573
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,761
When you're collecting cans
for a nickel each, you are loved.

574
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,511
Wow!

575
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,249
ls this like
your surveillance vehicle?

576
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,616
lt's one of them, yeah.

577
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:24,621
Up, l got it.

578
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:26,858
Thanks.

579
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,890
Stand by...

580
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,906
September fifteen, eleven hundred o-six,
Paul Jeffries, USASF.

581
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,540
Update on the situation.

582
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,010
lndividual identified as Hassan.

583
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,974
Was that his first name?

584
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,415
First name is Hassan.

585
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,750
-You know his last name?
-No.

586
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,289
Further investigation needs to be
conducted before determining last name.

587
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,619
Okay.

588
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,522
So,
when you had this situation...

589
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:06,399
this dialogue, do you remember
exactly what was said?

590
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:07,835
Yeah.

591
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,335
Okay.
So, just start from the beginning.

592
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,771
Tell me word for word.
lt's very important.

593
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,979
l said ''hello'',
and then he said ''hello''.

594
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,617
Then l said ''l'm Lana'',
he said ''l'm Hassan''.

595
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,988
And then l asked him where he was from,
because he looked middle eastern.

596
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,151
What did he say to that?

597
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,752
He said
''My home is not a place, it is people''.

598
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,162
What the hell does that mean?

599
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,963
l mean, l don't really know.

600
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,939
-That was it?
-Yeah, yeah.

601
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,274
Then he took his food
and he walked away.

602
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,708
''My home...

603
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,945
is not a place...

604
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,318
it is people''.

605
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,218
That means...

606
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,186
his home...

607
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,997
is people.

608
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,264
Something like that. Okay!

609
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,502
-ls this for the Agent Orange?
-What?

610
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,769
Mom told me that
when you were in Vietnam...

611
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,872
that you had been exposed
to Agent Orange.

612
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,007
Well, your mom was wrong.

613
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:41,796
lt wasn't Agent Orange.

614
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,590
The Defense Department
called it Agent Pink.

615
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,931
But then they probably realized
it was too strong...

616
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,734
so they watered down the dioxin
and gave it a different name.

617
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,838
But l was around
before they did that.

618
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,644
-What did it do to you?
-Nothing, really.

619
00:51:58,748 --> 00:51:59,646
Paul...

620
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,381
Listen, someone needs to figure out
who killed this guy.

621
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,315
lt's extremely important to me.
l can't do it sitting around here.

622
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,084
You've done well,
you've helped me.

623
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:09,723
l wanna keep in touch.

624
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,802
Hey, Alimi.

00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:38,083
The ''business'' in question...

their ''business'' phone...

632
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,256
lf l was paranoid,
that would look suspicious.

633
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,664
Check for possible
one-man-submarine, out.

634
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,813
Fertilizer...

635

They'll figure it out.
They'll have fingerprints or something.

651
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,200
l'd say at least half the homeless
that die on the streets...

653

What happens to them?

654
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,573
They get cremated...

655
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,918
tossed into a mass grave
out at the county cemetery.

656
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:51,743
But he was murdered!

657
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,520
The least that they can do for him
is to find his family.

658
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,718
He deserves that much!

659
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,691
The truth is...

660
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,197
nobody really cares about him.

661
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:12,804
Bingo.

662
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,422
Hi boss, l got it!

663
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,693
The name of the company is...

664
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,860
lBC,
lnternational Boron Chemicals.

665
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,404
They pretty much built
the town of Trona themselves.

666
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:43,963
How far is it?

667
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:47,675
How far is it?

668
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:48,733
How far is it?

669
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:49,744
lt's...

670
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,448
it's about
a hundred eighty miles.

671
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:57,876
Anyway, the whole town
is built on a dry salt lake...

672
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,148
in Death Valley.

673
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:04,690
lt says that the company is digging out
all sorts of minerals and chemicals...

674
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,229
from the salt flats and turning them
into Boron products.

675
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:08,195
And get this.

676
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:10,466
They ship most of the stuff
to China.

677
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,165
-China?
-China.

678
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,285
-You said China?
-That's what it says.

679
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:33,921
What else?

680
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,518
Well...

681
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:42,992
it says that the area was originally
settled in 1870 by this guy John Searles.

682
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,864
His father was from Chicago
and he lived there.

683
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,233
ls the lake bed secure?
ls the factory secure?

684
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:50,465
Have there been
any reported break-ins?

685
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,336
Do any of the names look Arabic
in the telephone book?

686
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,312
How they transport the Boron
to the coast before it goes off to China?

687
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:02,378
Well, this is just a preliminary report.
l was gonna get into all that stuff.

688
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,348
Good. Because l'm going
there in the morning.

689
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,121
ls that stuff turning blue yet
in the test tubes?

690
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,787
That's gotta wait
at least a half hour.

691
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,384
That's right. You told me that.

692
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,269
-Are you okay?
-What do you mean?

693
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:28,270
l can see that your Agent Pink
is acting up.

694
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,538
lt's on your neck.

695
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,109
lt comes and it goes.
l can't stop it, you know that.

696
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:35,174
Yeah, but l also know that when
you get yourself too worked up...

697
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,219
-it just makes it worse.
-l'm not ''worked up''.

698
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:38,686
Alright.

699
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,524
l got you more meds
through the Canadian deal.

700
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,389
-They're in...
-We have a critical situation here.

701
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,326
We may be dealing
with the major cell.

702
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,931
Our work could be saving
thousands of lives, maybe more.

703
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,896
And you want me
to be calm right now?

704
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,402
Now is not the fucking time to be calm!
Okay?

705
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,200
Okay.

706
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,432
America needs us.

707
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,140
Jimmy, l'm gonna need you
for my C & C on this one.

708
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,408
lf l need tags pulled...

709
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,040
if l need to have a background check
or a favor pulled...

710
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,915
l need you to...
you need to stick by that phone.

711
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,811
lf l have to reach out...

712
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,014
l gotta know
you're gonna be there.

713
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,790
Alright, l'll be your REMF on this one,
Serge.

714
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,953
The phone will never ring
more than once.

715
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,064
They're trying to destroy
our country!

716
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,996
They're trying to infect us!

717
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:27,964
l am not gonna let 'em.

718
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,529
l am not gonna let them do it!

719
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,877
Do you want a...

720
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,851
a bottle of Tiger Piss?

721
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,921
Yeah... that sounds good.

722
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,967
-''Semper Fi.''
-''De Oppresso Liber.''

723
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:08,442
-l got a case inside the house.
-Good.

724
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,819
<i>Did you know him?</i>

725
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,787
<i>I am just trying to heIp find</i>
<i>his famiIy.</i>

726
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,260
Okay. Just a minute.

727
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:02,521
Excuse me!

728
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:25,281
That was the drive-by killing
on Winston Street, right?

729
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,083
Right.

730
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,925
Still at the coroner's office.

731
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,327
He's been upgraded
from a John Doe, though.

732
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:43,069
lt says his name
is Hassan Ahmed.

733
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,971
A-h-m-e-d?

734
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,332
That's it.

735
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,705
Hassan Ahmed.
Thank you so much.

736
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:49,876
Any time.

737
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,270
You forgot your phone.

738
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,445
<i>PauI, it's Lana.</i>

739
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,915
No, this is Jimmy.

740
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:30,418
<i>-We met the other day.</i>
-Hi, Jimmy.

741

742

<i>No, he aIready,</i>
<i>he aIready Ieft.</i>

743
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,491
Okay, well, how can l reach him?
'Cause l...

744
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,228
l have some information...

745

01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,876
What case might that be?

748
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,341
The murder, Jimmy...
With Hassan and the Hummer.

749
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,782
<i>So you know aII about that?</i>

750
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:02,512
Yeah.

751
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:06,612
He already left for Trona
and l guess he'd left his cell phone.

752
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,181
He left for Trona?

753
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,823
<i>Can you do me a favor?</i>

754
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:16,963
When you do talk to him, will you let him
know that l know who the victim was...

755
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,398
and that l need to speak to him?

756
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,102
Alright. l'll tell him.

757
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,735
<i>WeII, I appreciate it very much.</i>
<i>Thank you, Jimmy.</i>

758
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:50,958

Shit!

762
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,351
Give me a minute!

763
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,221
No other listing?

764
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,298
No, no, that's the only one
that l can find and it's disconnected.

765
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,063
l think...

766
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:36,003
l've got a number of a parish
in Ridgecrest.

767
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:43,446
lt's twenty miles from Trona,
so maybe they can send someone over.

768
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,849
-That'd be great!
-Yeah.

769
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:51,592
What day is it, anyway?

770
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,494
Alright!

771
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,213
Hi.

772
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,440
l needed to be somewhere today...

773
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,110
instead, l'm talking
to my twenty year old niece...

774
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,780
who all of a sudden wants
to become a private detective.

775
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,623
-l'm just trying to help.
-l don't need your help.

776
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,453
Where can we talk?

777
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:28,093
Should we go on the roof?

778
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,274
Good view point...

779
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,501
Okay, so what's his name?

780
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,703
-His name is Ahmed.
-Ahmed?

781
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,277
Yeah, and l talked
to his brother.

782
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,309
Excuse me?

783
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,353
Well, to his half-brother, actually.
And that's his only living relative.

784
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,084
You contacted his brother?

785
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,886
No. The morgue did.

786
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:04,693
Well, a parish from Ridgecrest actually,
but then the morgue, sort of.

787
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,792
And then he called...
he called Henry.

788
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,898
Lana, what the hell
are you talking about?

789
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,539
Well, they need help.

790
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:15,538
The LA morgue e-mailed
a photo of Hassan to Trona.

791
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:19,138
And his brother identified the photo,
but he doesn't have a car.

792
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,513
And Henry has offered
to pay for the burial...

793
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,985
but he only has a truck and
l don't think it's appropriate to...

794
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:26,521
l, now wait... Who's Henry?

795
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,416
He's the pastor from here.

796
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,527
You've entirely disrupted
this investigation!

797
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,630
l mean, you don't have a damn clue
what's at stake here.

798
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,902
Okay, l'm sorry,
l didn't mean to disrupt anything.

799
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,976
Okay, l thought that
this information would help you.

800
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,445
How's this supposed to help me?

801
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,339
Well...

802
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,673
the brother, l mean he might have
some information that you could use...

803
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:57,650
Yeah...

804
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,223
and if we would'a take
the body home...

805
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,554
then that might be kind of
a good cover for you.

806
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,324
A good cover?

807
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,769
That's great!
That's just... that's perfect!

808
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,037
lt all worked out.

809
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,371
Good.

810
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,085
Listen, l appreciate your help.

811
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:31,810
Likewise.

812
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,050
A lot of people
wouldn't take the time.

813
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,622
No, they wouldn't.

814
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:42,727
So, what've you got there,
a little flag?

815
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:46,733
That's right.

816
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,468
So, you're looking
after my niece?

817
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,800
Well, l just gave her a room.

818
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,347
She's pretty good
at looking after herself.

819
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,338
So, you're looking after her,
then?

820
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,284
Yeah, of course.

821
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,985
She's only twenty or so.

822
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,126
Over here!

823
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,464
-Wheel it in closer!
-ln there?

824
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,367
Yeah, in here. What'd you think?
We're gonna tie him up on top?

825
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,671
Okay, let's go!

826
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,611
l've never seen
a set-up like that before.

827
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,045
Excuse me!

828
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:39,855
You got everything?

829
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:41,686
No.

830
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,351
You're gonna need the coroner's report.
Did they put that in there?

831
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,223
Yeah.

832
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,532
-You're all set.
-Alright, thanks.

833
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,500
Touch base, if you can.

834
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,733
Just give me a call.

835
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:07,547
God speed.

836
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,953
l guess, you probably think l'm...

837
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:47,385
one of these vets...

838
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,955
that got all screwed up in 'Nam,
right?

839
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:54,424
-On the brink of insanity, right?
-No.

840
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,132
Nope.
l'd love you anyway though...

841
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,598
''Uncle'' Paul.

842
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,669
You want me to tell you something
about the Vietnam War?

843
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:11,176
Yeah.

844
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,216
We won!

845
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:18,584
The war?

846
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,179
That's right!

847
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:26,319
Metaphorically?

848
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,056
No, in actuality.

849
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,060
lt wasn't just
the Vietnam War, you know?

850
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,969
There was a little thing
called the ''Cold War'', too.

851
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:40,773
Right.

852
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,945
We stopped the spread of Communism
for ten thousand days.

853
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,618
We drew a line in the jungle...

854
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,823
and eventually they crossed it,
but when they did...

855
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,625
they were already depleted.

856
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,564
They were
completely exhausted.

857
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,466
lt was a critical time.

858
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,269
A critical place.

859
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:14,608
We won!

860
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:44,973
Uncle Paul...

861
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,066
can l ask you a question?

862
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,178
Sure.
What do you wanna know?

863
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,410
How come you never wrote
my mom back?

864
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:03,323
She sent you all those letters
over the years...

865
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,617
can you just tell me why?

866
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,026
l just never opened them,
that's all.

867
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:12,561
Why?

868
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,166
Well, it's hard to explain.

869
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,965
Listen, sometimes in life,
you just can't sit there, you know.

870
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:25,475
Sometimes
you have to make a break.

871
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,850
The only way to leave
something behind...

872
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,522
is to leave it all behind.

873
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,629
We didn't always see
eye to eye, you know.

874
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,097
All that fanatic
commie liberal stuff...

875
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:54,736
and dragging you around
to all those god-forsaken countries...

876
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,706
But l guess
she was a good mother.

877
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,579
She was.

878
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,511
She should have taught you
what America means.

879
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,555
What it stands for.

880
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:09,655
She did.

881
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:12,257
She taught me everything
that it's supposed to stand for.

882
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,319
l think that's the reason
l came back.

883
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,556
Supposed to?

884
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,133
We're in Trona.

885
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,472
Paul Jeffries,
September eighteen.

886
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,682
Heading north
on one-seventy-eight.

887
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,451
Now entering the town of Trona.

888
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,056
He lives in the trailer park.
But it doesn't say which trailer.

889
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:53,625
Excuse me, please.

890
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,398
We've arrived at position one,
the trailer park.

891
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,334
Outskirts of Trona, California.

892
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,268
Greenwich Mean Time
fourteen hundred hours...

893
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:03,470
Fourteen twelve!

894
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:04,509
What?

895
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,608
lt's actually fourteen twelve...

896
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,774
l don't know if that matters.

897
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,145
General time frame
is all l'm looking for.

898
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:26,499
Preliminary observation detects
inconsistencies, right off the bat.

899
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:31,503
There are approximately twelve
to fifteen dwellings in the compound...

900
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,707
yet for some reason
there are about forty mailboxes.

901
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:37,573
l'd like to see someone explain
that one.

902
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:40,712
Paul...

903
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,042
l was thinking
that it might be best...

904
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,981
if l went in and spoke to the family
while you took care of the body.

905
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,155
lf that's okay with you.

906
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,791
l just thought that it just might seem
a little bit strange...

907
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,363
driving there
with him in the back.

908
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:57,999
-lt's fine with me.
-Okay.

909
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,192
So why don't we meet
back somewhere over here...

910
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,032
when you're done
with the funeral home?

911
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:03,534
Sure.

912
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,168
Okay.

913
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,400
Great!

914
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,247
What do you think you're doing?

915
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,981
-What?
-What?

916
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,493
Does this look like
an amusement park to you?

917
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:27,895
Do you see any roller coasters?

918
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,730
l don't see any ferries-wheels.

919
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,357
l don't know what you mean.

920
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:33,865
Listen...

921
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:36,537
don't get delusions
or anything like that but...

922
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,402
you're not an operative on this.

923
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:40,764
But anyway...

924
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:42,442
l have some stuff here.

925
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:45,840
Police-issued pepper spray.

926
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,211
Don't point that
toward your face.

927
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:51,449
You may need this.

928
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,085
Do you really think
that l'm gonna need a flashlight?

929
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,384
And this.

930
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,626
lf you have to ditch everything,
you do not ditch this!

931
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,521
Alright, maybe
you don't need that.

932
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:08,662
Okay, channel three.
lt has a twenty mile range.

933
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:12,239
Now, you tell me you need me,
l'm there.

934
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:14,431
l'm your uncle...

935
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:18,069
but that part doesn't really matter.
You're on my Op.

936
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:21,476
-Remember, okay? You got it?
-Got it!

937
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,947
-l said three, right? Channel three.
-Channel three.

938
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,679
Okay.

939
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,124
Hello?

940
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,129
What?

941
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:12,690
l'm sorry, l don't mean to disturb you.
l'm looking for Mr. Ahmed.

942
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:14,794
What do you want?

943
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:19,239
l'm helping out with a family issue.
He's expecting me.

944
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,542
What? What's the matter?

945
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:31,310
Well, Mr. Ahmed,
l'm just trying to find his home.

946
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,814
l don't know anybody like that.
No!

947
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,919
ls he dark-skin?

948
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,258
Excuse me?

949
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:41,986
The dark-skin guy lives
in the last trailer up the hill.

950
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:44,325
The last trailer up the hill.

951
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:52,697
lt's Paul Jeffries.

952
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,531
Fourteen hundred
and twenty hours...

953
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,977
one hundred and eighty miles
from the epicenter of Los Angeles.

954
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,081
Striking distance,
but a world apart!

955
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:05,149
Trona. Look at this place!

956
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:07,780
A couple of pedestrians...

957
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,085
a few stool pigeons
sitting around without a clue.

958
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,153
But they're here!

959
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,125
Sleeper cells.

960
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,490
l can feel 'em!

961
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,347
Hello?

962
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,326
Massive numbers
of burned dwellings...

963
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:50,454
Completely... charred,
flamed to the ground.

964
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,566
At first pass l can determine
no clear pattern...

965
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,264
aside from arson.

966
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,433
Somebody lit these fires.

967
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,413
Probably to cover their traces.

968
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,279
l bet l'm being observed myself.

969
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:14,716
lt's just like in 'Nam.

970
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,358
Burnin' the damn Elephant Grass.

971
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,190
They know l'm here.

972
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:21,453
Somebody does.

973
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,310
Mr. Ahmed?

974
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,321
This is the body from Los Angeles.

975
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:27,555
Somebody is expecting it.

976
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,161
Me?

977
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,058
l don't know.
Are you expecting it?

978
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,692
-We use a gurney for that.
-Well, l don't really like gurneys.

979
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,396
And l'm on kind of a schedule.

980
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,637
What's the matter with you?
You've never seen a dead body before?

981
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,900
Put that thing over there
in that room.

982
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,555
l'm watching you.

983
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,168
Hello!

984
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,144
You are from the mission?

985
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,615
-With Henry?
-Yeah!

986
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:24,511
God bless you!

987
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,515
God bless you.

988
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:33,959
l am eternally grateful to you,
whoever you are.

989
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:36,289
-l'm Lana.
-And l am Joe.

990
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:40,832
-Nice to meet you.
-lt's good to meet you, Lana.

991
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:42,863
Let's see...

992
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,869
l have tea, water
and some very bad vodka.

993
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,710
Tea sounds lovely.

994
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:51,878
We'll have tea.

995
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,978
Come, go!

996
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,408
They just throw things out.

997
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,586
Perfectly good things.

998
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,624
Not in the mood for it anymore?
Trash it.

999
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,135
l'm gonna take it.

1000
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,874
What is that?

1001
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,652
Chemicals!

1002
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:41,694
Located...

1003
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,127
probable retired mobile...

1004
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:47,893
chemical and or biological
manufacturing unit.

1005
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:50,332
Going aboard.

1006
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,183
Pistol targets!

1007
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,147
Wood stove!

1008
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,731
Strange green liquid.

1009
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:35,947
Holy shit!

1010
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,878
lt's Borax boxes!

1011
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:44,058
Who is this?

1012
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,059
Two new suspects
approaching in van.

1013
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,390
They're getting out.

1014
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,164
They're loading the boxes!

1015
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:58,296
They're loading
the boxes into the vehicle!

1016
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,403
Jesus! l go in
for closer observation.

1017
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,927
Observe, track and report.

1018
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,099
l just hold off for now.

1019
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,734
Never interrupt the enemy
when he's making a mistake!

1020
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:32,831
Just lay chilly...

1021
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,474
wait it out.

1022
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:41,777
Suspects fleeing.
l'm going for the van.

1023
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,354
Got it!

1024
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:59,526
Alright.
Let's look at these...

1025
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:05,396
-Who is that?
-This is my father. And Hassan's father.

1026
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,472
-Where was that picture taken?
-This is in Pakistan.

1027
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:12,236
Look at his pants.

1028
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:15,074
Funny, huh?

1029
01:24:16,351 --> 01:24:20,014
They're pulling out of town!
Going south now on one-seven-eight.

1030
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,352
They're baiting me.

1031
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:28,161
They think they're luring me in.

1032
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,965
That'll be the day, my friend.

1033
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,895
You back me into a corner...

1034
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,798
and you'll rue that day,
Chuck.

1035
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:41,973
You'll rue that day
for a long time!

1036
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,751
He's turning left
into the side road.

1037
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:16,041
Suspect vehicle parked
in front of isolated house.

1038
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,509
That's perfect!
lt's a perfect sleeper hide-out.

1039
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,180
Probably goes underground.

1040
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,519
Probable chemical
weapons containers...

1041
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:32,890
being transported into what
is most likely Trona headquarters.

1042
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,662
Suspects out of view.

1043
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:40,556
This is it!

1044
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,303
You've done your job.

1045
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:47,138
You've done your job well.

1046
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,104
Every time l told you
to be patient...

1047
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,207
and you wouldn't listen.

1048
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,107
Well this is why.

1049
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,718
You stick to your game plan,
you stick to your strategy...

1050
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,758
and you never fluctuate.

1051
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:08,852
And then you find yourself here.

1052
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,471
These are the moments
that define your life.

1053
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,766
My father and his brother...

1054
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,744
at his brother's wedding.

1055
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:26,773
And here is my mother.

1056
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,114
Look at her!

1057
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:35,982
This is a picture of Hassan
and me together, at his wedding.

1058
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:41,226
Suspects loading full chemical containers
into cargo van.

1059
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:44,527
License plate has been recorded,
clear photographs had been obtained.

1060
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:49,034
lndividuals leaving the scene.

1061
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:53,369
l will not continue
surveillance of the vehicle.

1062
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:57,403
Repeat,
vehicle is free of observation.

1063
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:05,249
SSG Jeffries, SSG Jeffries.
Copy?

1064
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:08,713
S<i>SG Jeffries, come in.</i>

1065
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,351
l'm sorry.

1066
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:14,528
S<i>SG Jeffries,</i>
S<i>SG Jeffries, copy?</i>

1067
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:19,458
That's my uncle.

1068
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:22,332
S<i>SG Jeffries,</i>
S<i>SG Jeffries, come in.</i>

1069
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,370
SSG Jeffries. Copy?

1070
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:30,941
This is L. Swenson reporting.

1071
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:34,513
<i>Do you have my ceII phone number</i>
<i>in your possession? Over.</i>

1072

1073
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,520
<i>Listen to me very carefuIIy.</i>

1074
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:43,549
lf you do not hear from me
within the next twenty minutes...

1075
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,783
l want you to call that number.

1076
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,255
lt will be forwarded
to an operative.

1077
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:50,829
And he'll make arrangements for you.
Over.

1078
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:53,857
What do you mean?
What arrangements?

1079
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:57,965
ln the event l become indisposed,
he will transport you back to base.

1080
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,433
To your mission. Over.

1081
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,145
lf you become ''indisposed''
in the next twenty minutes...

1082
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:07,308
l'm supposed to call a number
that will be forwarded to an operative?

1083
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:08,280
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1084
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,315
No fucking way.

1085
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:12,182
What?

1086
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,316
No! Tell me where you are
and what the hell you're doing?

1087
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,090
<i>You watch your mouth,</i>
<i>young Iady.</i>

1088
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:19,153
Wait, Uncle Paul, please...

1089
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:22,488
l am not at liberty
to disclose this information.

1090
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:25,860
And l also strongly suggest you refrain
from addressing me in that manner.

1091
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,525
<i>This is simpIy</i>

<i>-Out!</i>
-Wait, Uncle Paul...

1093
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:34,773
This is Staff Sergeant Paul Jeffries,
US Army Special Forces.

1094
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:38,407
lt is seventeen hundred hours,
September eighteen.

1095
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:41,548
l'm going in!

1096
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:47,106
<i>First of aII, I want to thank you aII</i>

<i>It's a big crowd.</i>
<i>We're honored.</i>

You dress funny.

1101
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,860
But l guess you could say
the same thing about me.

1102
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:09,062
<i>I came to this office</i>
<i>to soIve probIems, not to...</i>

1103
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:13,198
Whatever is left to pack
is back there in the corner.

1104
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,272
There should be some boxes.

1105
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:24,841
For two months,
no one has been able to fix this.

1106
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:31,081
l've been stuck on the same channel!
l can only control the volume!

1107
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:38,624
<i>Terrorists decIared war</i>

1108
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,195
<i>and war is what they got.</i>

1109
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,403
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>our buddy has won $1 7,000...</i>

1110
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,709
Thank you, friend.

1111
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:00,279
You're welcome.

1112
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:30,317
You're in the shit?

1113
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:36,449
No. l checked it out.
Those people are the wrong people.

1114
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:39,256
A subdivision, maybe.

1115
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:43,059
<i>Look,</i>
<i>I got some criticaI information.</i>

1116
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,255
<i>You wanna caII me</i>

1117
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:47,229
No. Go ahead.

1118
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:49,800
They made an arrest
on the Humvee drive-by.

1119
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:52,130
<i>-Names?</i>
-Nothing yet.

1120
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:54,504
<i>They brought in two suspects,</i>
<i>that's aII I know.</i>

1121
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:56,770
<i>And I'm waiting</i>
<i>for a caII from Zucker.</i>

1122
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:58,175
<i>I'II have something</i>

1123
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:00,046
You call me immediately.

1124
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:02,713
<i>AIright. WiII do. And PauI?</i>

1125
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:04,509
What?

1126
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:07,514
Your niece called me
on my line.

1127
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:09,818
lt was forwarded from your phone
so l answered it.

1128
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,119
l know how to handle that...

1129
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:14,026
You know when to call me.

1130
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:16,463
<i>I'II have something</i>
<i>in Iess than sixty.</i>

1131
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:51,288
-Hi.
-Are you okay?

1132
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:00,467
Paul, this is Hassan's brother,
this is Joe.

1133
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:11,251
You brought my brother home.
l am always grateful to you.

1134
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,012
Well, you're welcome.

1135
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:16,413
Well, we're...

1136
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:20,319
drinking some really bad Vodka.
Will you join us?

1137
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:22,954
-Sure.
-Alright! Come, go!

1138
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,565
Come in, come in, come in.

1139
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,196
Paul, make yourself at home.

1140
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,767
Please,
have a seat on the couch.

1141
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:40,775
Paul? lt has been a long...

1142
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:43,450
discussion in my family...

1143
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:49,256
whether ''Aristocrat's Choice''
or lighter fluid...

1144
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:50,881
is easier to swallow.

1145
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:56,322
And lighter fluid lost,
but not by much.

1146
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:05,203
Cheers.

1147
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:30,057
How long has it been
since you talked to your brother?

1148
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:32,032
Yes...

1149
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:37,628
Really, it'd been a long time.

1150
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:40,972
You don't have a telephone?

1151
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:42,038
No.

1152
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:43,669
Not any more.

1153
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:46,409
How do you communicate
from here?

1154
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:51,044
There is one pay phone
adjoining the gas station.

1155
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,013
But l get no calls.

1156
01:34:53,387 --> 01:34:54,786
Except from Henry.

1157
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:58,449
Paul... Paul?

1158
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:02,061
What have you been doing
all this time?

1159
01:35:02,797 --> 01:35:06,563
What do you think l've been doing?
l've been trying to learn some...

1160
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:09,502
stuff about Hassan.

1161
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:11,334
l'll help you.

1162
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:15,175
Anything l can tell you.
Anything l know.

1163
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,503
Okay, well...

1164
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:21,437
who'd wanna kill him?

1165
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:23,972
No one.

1166
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:25,744
No one?

1167
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:33,049
No, if anyone knew Hassan,
had met Hassan...

1168
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:36,829
they would wish him no harm.

1169
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:40,526
Poor fellow had no possessions.

1170
01:35:40,868 --> 01:35:42,028
Nothing to eat...

1171
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:43,728
nothing to steal...

1172
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:46,705
He took a hollow point forty-four
right straight to the chest.

1173
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:49,975
And that
doesn't exactly sound like...

1174
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:52,575
a case of mistaken identity.

1175
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:56,673
-Paul, can l talk to you for a second?
-Look, if you...

1176
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,112
you need to give me something.

1177
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,010
lf you want me to help you...

1178
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:04,586
we can't play
this little game of riddles...

1179
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,085
okay?

1180
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:11,521
What was he making
with the Borax?

1181
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:14,593
Borax?

1182
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:19,465
Money!

1183
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,274
He was trying
to make money to eat.

1184
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:25,138
Okay, well that, good!

1185
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:28,247
l can understand that.
He was trying to turn a profit so...

1186
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:31,948
l'm gonna need to know
the source...

1187
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,147
and l'll need to know
the buyers.

1188
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,855
When the old factory shut down...

1189
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:39,726
l was able to borrow a truck.

1190
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:44,856
And l loaded it
with many boxes of borax.

1191
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:47,792
Remind you,
l did not have permission...

1192
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:50,894
Go on!

1193
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,173
And Hassan...

1194
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:57,769
he...

1195
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:03,778
he found a company
in Los Angeles to keep it.

1196
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:07,150
And he would try to sell it...

1197
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:13,757
to other businesses and the company
would get some free boxes.

1198
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,318
Free boxes to do what?

1199
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:22,696
To clean their carpets.
They imported these carpets.

1200
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,170
So...

1201
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:35,539
how was he...

1202
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:38,752
what was he... to get...

1203
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:44,052
expecting from the other companies
that he sold to?

1204
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:45,358
l don't know.

1205
01:37:48,262 --> 01:37:51,197
Whoever would give him
a few goddamn dollars.

1206
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:55,897
lt's easier than selling cans.

1207
01:37:59,907 --> 01:38:01,067
What is that?

1208
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:05,374
lt's just a photo of Hassan.

1209
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,447
Excuse me, please!

1210
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:15,546
Hassan.

1211
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:19,256
Will you please tell me
what's happening?

1212
01:38:19,827 --> 01:38:21,021
l don't know.

1213
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:27,199
l'm just... l'm not...

1214
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:30,436
l can't follow the right leads.

1215
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,107
You're okay?

1216
01:38:42,116 --> 01:38:45,347
l can't control it all, anymore.

1217
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,317
My things, these things that...

1218
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:49,882
You don't have to.

1219
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:16,540
Thanks.

1220
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:34,999
Yeah.

1221
01:39:35,569 --> 01:39:36,467
Go ahead?

1222
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:38,505
Go ahead.

1223
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:40,865
<i>It's not what we thought.</i>

1224
01:39:44,144 --> 01:39:45,202
<i>Did you copy?</i>

1225
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:47,907
Yeah, l heard you.

1226
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:51,451
<i>It was kids,</i>
<i>I just confirmed it.</i>

1227
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,252
Completely non-related.

1228
01:39:54,021 --> 01:39:55,318
<i>What do you mean, kids?</i>

1229
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:58,750
Zucker said
they got a legit confession.

1230
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,324
Some random act.

1231
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:02,292
<i>A coupIe of white kids.</i>

1232
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:05,094
A couple of white kids?

1233
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:07,063
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1234
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:13,768
Where did they get the Hummer?

1235
01:40:14,108 --> 01:40:15,234
<i>Parents.</i>

1236
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:18,039
They also got a match
on the gun...

1237
01:40:18,746 --> 01:40:21,806
and Zucker said they tested
positive for Crystal Meth.

1238
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,174
And one of them for Crack.

1239
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,817
<i>Just bad kids, on drugs.</i>

1240
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:32,255
<i>What shouId I do now?</i>

1241
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:37,390
Listen. l got to...

1242
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,227
l'm working on something.

1243
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:44,830
l'll contact you later.

1244
01:40:45,105 --> 01:40:45,935
<i>Yeah.</i>

1245
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,000
<i>Okay.</i>

1246
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:51,108
Good work, Jimmy.

1247
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:52,738
<i>Thanks, PauI...</i>

1248
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,304
<i>Serge.</i>

1249
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:17,857
l can't believe the situation here.

1250
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:23,300
Paul.

1251
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,034
My God, Uncle Paul!

1252
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:28,700
Come here! Are you okay?

1253
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:30,174
Just, minor injuries.

1254
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:35,278
-l'll take a butterfly stitch.
-l'm getting you a wash cloth.

1255
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:40,018
Leave the quack in the tent.

1256
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:44,119
He couldn't stitch a baseball.

1257
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:48,083
Shit!

1258
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:55,625
That is...
it's probably the worst day...

1259
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:32,906
We're hot!

1260
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:35,969
We got hit on the left!

1261
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:38,974
Left side! Left side!

1262
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:41,640
-Uncle Paul!
-Pull it up, pull it up.

1263
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:44,912
Little John! Pull it!
Pull it up, little John!

1264
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:46,612
Pull it up!

1265
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:49,021
We're gonna fucking dive!

1266
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:52,454
You wanna mess with me?
Okay, let's go!

1267
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:55,518
Let's go, you fucking...
You fucking gooks! Let's go!

1268
01:43:55,796 --> 01:43:58,094
Come on,
you fucking little gooks!

1269
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:03,665
No, my God, we got flamed!
We got flamed in the bird. What?

1270
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:06,196
We're in deep shit!
ln deep shit!

1271
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:08,465
Rip the belt! No!

1272
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:11,070
God!

1273
01:44:16,717 --> 01:44:18,014
Don't! No, don't.

1274
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:21,052
We're jumping.

1275
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:26,952
Please, don't, don't, don't.

1276
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:32,162
<i>HeIp us, God!</i>

1277
01:44:32,566 --> 01:44:36,559
<i>HeIp us!</i>
<i>HeIp us in our heIpIessness.</i>

1278
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:40,538
<i>HeIp my uncIe</i>

1279
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:42,503
<i>Grant him peace!</i>

1280
01:45:36,196 --> 01:45:37,185
<i>''Dear PauI.</i>

1281
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,762
<i>If for nothing eIse, I hope</i>
<i>you can forgive me for this Ietter.</i>

1282
01:45:41,802 --> 01:45:45,704
<i>I have found myseIf in an African</i>
<i>hospitaI, away from my home...</i>

1283
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:48,366
<i>and aII attempts to reach you</i>
<i>have been unsuccessfuI.</i>

1284
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:52,276
<i>The doctors here teII me that I am dying</i>
<i>and I beIieve they are right.</i>

1285
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:55,110
<i>We each have our Iast day on this earth</i>
<i>and I have aIways been okay with that...</i>

1286
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:57,616
<i>but of course,</i>
<i>I wish I had more time.</i>

1287
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:59,977
<i>Enough, at Ieast,</i>
<i>to come find you.</i>

1288
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:04,188
<i>Since that doesn't seem possibIe,</i>
<i>I am giving this Ietter to Lana.</i>

1289
01:46:04,658 --> 01:46:07,855
<i>She has grown into a beautifuI</i>
<i>human being and reminds me of Mom...</i>

1290
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:09,555
<i>more and more each day.</i>

1291
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:12,490
<i>She seems to have gotten</i>
<i>the best parts from aII of us and...</i>

1292
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:14,629
<i>hopefuIIy none of the bad.</i>

1293
01:46:15,235 --> 01:46:18,466
<i>Aside from her father,</i>
<i>you'II soon be her onIy Iiving reIative.</i>

1294
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:23,673
<i>So when she brings you this,</i>
<i>there is one thing I ask of you...''</i>

1295
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:30,408
You had a horrible dream
last night.

1296
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:35,721
lt really scared me.

1297
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:40,290
l'm sorry.

1298
01:46:43,363 --> 01:46:44,853
You said that you were falling.

1299
01:46:49,102 --> 01:46:50,126
Do you remember?

1300
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:57,906
That was the Huey l went down in.

1301
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:04,177
We all fell.

1302
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:10,587
Only two soldiers walked away.
l was one of 'em.

1303
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:15,453
lt's a gift.

1304
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:17,195
A gift?

1305
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:21,157
l'm not so sure about that.

1306
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:26,967
lt is to me.

1307
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:40,978
That dream went away
for a long time.

1308
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:49,018
And then,
when that plane hit the tower...

1309
01:47:51,097 --> 01:47:52,394
and then a second one...

1310
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:56,393
but they were still there.

1311
01:47:59,206 --> 01:48:03,040
l was watching that shot
of the New York Skyline...

1312
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:04,508
with those beautiful towers.

1313
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:10,710
They were burning inside...

1314
01:48:13,086 --> 01:48:15,782
but they just kept holding on.

1315
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:18,219
Right there.

1316
01:48:22,062 --> 01:48:23,859
l knew it was bad.

1317
01:48:27,701 --> 01:48:29,896
Over two thousand gallons
of fuel...

1318
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:33,799
two seven-sixty-sevens...

1319
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:40,036
but l thought
they could handle it.

1320
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:50,454
They took the blow
and they were standing strong...

1321
01:48:52,993 --> 01:48:53,925
and l thought...

1322
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:58,695
''They're refusing to fall!

1323
01:49:00,734 --> 01:49:02,031
They're too proud''.

1324
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:06,963
But then...

1325
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:14,642
that dream
just started coming back.

1326
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:24,288
l was so far away
that it was night time...

1327
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:27,215
when the towers fell.

1328
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:32,655
And at first, l didn't...

1329
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:37,032
l didn't know what was going on.
l just heard people...

1330
01:49:39,306 --> 01:49:40,432
cheering.

1331
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:42,975
Cheering?

1332
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:49,910
There was a crowd gathered out
in the street. Close to where we lived.

1333
01:49:52,152 --> 01:49:53,176
Terrorists?

1334
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:56,220
No.

1335
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:02,528
No, l think that that's the part
that hurts the most.

1336
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:03,722
They weren't...
they were just...

1337
01:50:07,233 --> 01:50:09,326
just ordinary people.

1338
01:50:11,905 --> 01:50:13,805
Well, why in the hell
were they cheering?

1339
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:18,343
Because they hate us.

1340
01:50:21,381 --> 01:50:23,349
And because they hate America.

1341
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:29,712
And it came from such
an honest place...

1342
01:50:30,924 --> 01:50:34,792
and from so many people that...

1343
01:50:35,595 --> 01:50:37,995
l just, l knew that something
had gone wrong...

1344
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:38,792
and...

1345
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,167
and that's...

1346
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:44,965
that's become my nightmare.

1347
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:51,874
Over three thousand civilians
were killed on that day...

1348
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:54,407
they were innocent people!

1349
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:58,383
Yeah. And...

1350
01:50:59,285 --> 01:51:01,776
and it's their voices
that l need to hear.

1351
01:51:04,658 --> 01:51:08,253
'Cause l really don't think they'd want
any more people killed in their name.

1352
01:51:51,805 --> 01:51:55,263
<i>Aside from her father,</i>
<i>you'II soon be her onIy Iiving reIative.</i>

1353
01:51:55,508 --> 01:51:58,238
<i>So when she brings you this,</i>
<i>there is one thing I ask of you.</i>

1354
01:51:58,845 --> 01:52:01,643
<i>Something I fear her father</i>
<i>wiII not be abIe to provide.</i>

1355
01:52:02,415 --> 01:52:04,975
<i>She is as courageous</i>
<i>as a woman her age can be.</i>

1356
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:08,086
<i>But you and I both know</i>
<i>Iife has a way of changing that.</i>

1357
01:52:08,788 --> 01:52:09,777
<i>You, more than anyone...</i>

1358
01:52:09,856 --> 01:52:12,984
<i>know how everything can turn</i>
<i>upside down in a singIe moment.</i>

1359
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:16,227
<i>I worry about the times</i>
<i>we Iive in...</i>

1360
01:52:16,296 --> 01:52:18,924
<i>and the worId Lana wiII face</i>
<i>when she'II be our age.</i>

1361
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:22,157
<i>One day, I know,</i>
<i>she wiII need reaI courage...</i>

1362
01:52:22,635 --> 01:52:25,866
<i>the kind of courage and strength</i>
<i>that onIy you may be abIe to teach her.</i>

1363
01:52:26,206 --> 01:52:28,936
<i>I'm so sorry I Iet our petty differences</i>
<i>come between us.</i>

1364
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:31,337
<i>OnIy now do I reaIize</i>
<i>how absurd I've been.</i>

1365
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:33,809
<i>I Iove you</i>
<i>and I've aIways Ioved you, PauI.</i>

1366
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:37,680
<i>And when the day comes that I see you</i>
<i>again, I wiII beg for your forgiveness.</i>

1367
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:42,478
<i>UntiI then, pIease watch over your niece.</i>
<i>I'II be watching over both of you.</i>

1368
01:52:43,056 --> 01:52:45,786
<i>My deepest Iove,</i>
<i>your sister Virginia''.</i>

1369
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,570
You seem disappointed.

1370
01:53:44,384 --> 01:53:45,749
l thought it'd be different.

1371
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:48,845
Like what?

1372
01:53:50,423 --> 01:53:51,720
Something more!

1373
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:55,628
l don't know...

1374
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:57,458
not just a construction site.

1375
01:53:59,032 --> 01:54:00,829
Let's just be quiet!

1376
01:54:05,672 --> 01:54:07,537
Let's just try and listen...
