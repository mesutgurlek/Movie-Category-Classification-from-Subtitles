1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,240
The year 1647
was a strange year.

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,320
Various signs
on earth and in the sky

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,760
foretold disasters
and events of great magnitude.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,560
Clouds gathered
over the mighty Commonwealth:

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,640
Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine
united under the rule of Wladislaw IV

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,280
Polish nobles and magnates
enjoyed limitless privileges

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,960
to the growing discontent of the
Cossack community, the Sietch.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,800
Meanwhile the Crimean Tartars
started to threaten Europe...

9
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,320
Dead?

10
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,800
Alive, lieutenant.

11
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,240
It's someone important.

12
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,200
Beautiful horse. It's ours?

13
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,960
- Rzêdzian!
- It's a trophy.

14
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,400
Water!

15
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,040
Set me free. I'll pay.

16
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,400
Thank God we were nearby.

17
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,840
- The rogues pretended
to be Tartars. - Of course.

18
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,360
- You know him?
- My neighbor's servant.

19
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,280
Thank you...

20
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,440
for saving me.

21
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,960
Am I dealing with a nobleman?

22
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,640
Yes. I'm Zenobius Abdank,

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,520
a colonel in the Cossack
regiment of prince Zas³awski.

24
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,960
John Skrzetuski, lieutenant

25
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
- at Prince Jeremy's service.
- He's a famous warrior.

26
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,640
Thank you.

27
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,200
What's the rush?

28
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,040
Duty calls.
I'm carrying orders.

29
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,440
It's a small world.

30
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,200
Perhaps...

31
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,080
I'll be able
to return this favor.

32
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,520
Do you know
whom you really saved?

33
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm Bohdan Zenobius Chmielnicki.

34
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,920
WITH FIRE AND SWORD

35

To the memory of Walentyna,
my wife

47
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,840
Czapliñski will get Chmielnicki.

48
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,640
- He won't.
- He will.

49
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,600
- I'll bet a ducat.
- Two!

50
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,480
He'll get him and hang him.

51
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Chmielnicki... Chmiel is hop.
Hop's good for beer.

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,840
And the beer here is cat's piss.

53
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,640
Pretty lass, fill my glass,

54
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
and while at this,
give me a big kiss!

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
And your best mead!

56
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,760
If it weren't for me, Chmielnicki
be slain by bandits.

57
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,320
Don't you know
about the arrest warrant

58
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,240
issued by the authorities?

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,920
- I've just come back from the
- Where did you see him?

60
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,160
- On the other bank of the Dnepr
- Jesus, he went to the Sietch.

61
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,200
Like many others.

62
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,040
He stole the King's letters

63
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,160
urging the Cossacks
to revolt against noblemen.

64
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,280
That might set Ukraine on fire.

65
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,880
- You think there'll be a rebell
- I'm sure of it.

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,200
You're Ruthenian, colonel.

67
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,480
The Cossacks respect you.
Go to the Sietch.

68
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,320
Half of my men run off
with Chmielnicki.

69
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,520
If it weren't for colonel Bohun,
they'd all have deserted.

70
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,720
Death awaits me...
not a hetman's baton.

71
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,840
Greetings to you!

72
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,280
Czapliñski, a rowdy wrangler,
Chmielnicki's greatest foe.

73
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,560
Do you have any news
of Chmielnicki?

74
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,240
They've hanged him, and if not,
they will do it soon.

75
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,880
Don't spill the wine.

76
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
- Will you get him?
- My men are waiting for him

77
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,760
in the steppe.

78
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,840
Don't spill the wine.

79
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,240
He avoided your pursuit
and went to the Sietch .

80
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,680
Impossible!

81
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,040
Sir John here saved him,
and slaughtered your bandits.

82
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,640
In spite of the warrant?

83
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,440
He hasn't heard of it.

84
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,640
I'll have you arrested

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,840
- and set in stocks!
- Smell this.

86
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,640
Guards!

87
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,840
Gentlemen!

88
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
He is leaving!

89
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,040
I could dress your wounds,
I'm an expert.

90
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
Silence!

91
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,000
Vivat Skrzetuski!

92
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,200
Thank you, gentlemen!

93
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
Let me offer you my services.

94
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm Zag³oba,
bearer of the "Forehead" crest.

95
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,000
An infidel Turkish dog
shot me in the head,

96
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,280
when I went to the Holy Land.

97
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,520
You told me someone hit you
with a tankard.

98
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,520
A Turk shot me!
You're confusing two stories.

99
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,400
Your health!

100
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,080
Introduce me, please,
to the lieutenant.

101
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,200
All right!

102
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,720
This here is

103
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,440
- Sir Long Anus...
- Longinus!

104
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,200
- "Trouser Snatcher".
- "Hoodsnatcher"!

105
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,680
- From Doggyguts.
- Mouseyguts.

106
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,120
Whatever.

107
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,360
I wouldn't live
in anybody's guts.

108
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,960
It's a disgrace to stay there
and a shame to leave.

109
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
He's been buying me wine
for a week.

110
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
Weighty sword, heavy purse,
featherweight brain.

111
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,480
Here you go again, phooey!

112
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,000
Is it an executioner's sword?

113
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,600
No, a Teutonic one.

114
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
My ancestor's battle trophy.

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,080
You lift it with both hands?

116
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,360
With both, or with one...

117
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
May I?

118
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,920
- Who'll do it?
- We've tried!

119
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Your turn.

120
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
I'll be damned!
A fine soldier for the Prince.

121
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,440
- You think he'd take me?
- He'd be happy to!

122
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,840
Two new skewers for his kitchen:
you and your sword!

123
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,000
My family
crest is "Hoodsnatcher".

124
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,520
In 1410, one of my ancestors
cut off three hooded

125
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,040
Teutonic heads with one blow.

126
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,440
- The King granted him the crest
- Strength runs in the family.

127
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,960
What good it is to me?
I promised St. Mary to remain chaste

128
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,920
until I, too,
cut off three heads

129
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,600
with one blow.

130
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,440
- But you haven't?
- No. Tough luck.

131
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,680
Two heads, quite often,
but never three.

132
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,600
I'm no Hoodsnatcher,

133
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,040
and Mr. Zag³oba is right to mock
I offer my grief to Jesus.

134
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,880
- And have you remained chaste?
- God sees my sorrow.

135
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,240
I'm in my prime, I'm wealthy,
and I'm still waiting for the ...

136
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
- And blood runs hot...
- If you need blood-letting...

137
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,920
Rzêdzian!

138
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,720
I'm an expert.

139
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,680
Chevaliers!

140
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,720
Help us, poor women.
My sons will arrive

141
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,960
after dusk,
and there are graves around.

142
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,800
You pledged chastity,
so carry the old one.

143
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,160
Oh, brother...

144
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,400
Thank you.

145
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,280
I'd go through fire
to hear such thanks.

146
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,160
Through fire?

147
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,920
Yesterday I wouldn't have
believed that.

148
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,880
How can I believe today?

149
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,640
God bless you. We're from Roz³og
I'm prince Kurcewicz's widow.

150
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,240
It's an honor
to help you and your daughter.

151
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
She's not mine,
but my late brother's-in-law.

152
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,080
Our house isn't far.
You won't refuse an invitation?

153
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,280
Go ahead, my precious!

154
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,000
Accept my services.

155
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,720
You're asking for misfortune.

156
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,360
God's will.

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,360
- Mother, the carts are coming.
- Those gentlemen helped us.

158
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
Meet my four sons
and their companion,

159
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,040
Bohun, a Cossack colonel.

160
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Sons, prepare the house.

161
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,520
Let's go.

162
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,400
Greetings, mother.

163
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,880
How's the Princess?

164
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,720
I'm glad to see you.
You'll play the lute for us.

165
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,560
You've saddened.

166
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,960
Smile, please.

167
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,120
He's a terrible man.

168
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,440
I don't fear any Cossacks
or their entire Sietch.

169
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
Get away, Pole!

170
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,400
Bohun! Off you go!

171
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,680
He's a madman.

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,040
A wild thing he is,
but we love him dearly.

173
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
ROZ£OGI
The Kurcewicz family site

174
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,040
- Welcome to our humble abode.
- Make yourselves at home.

175
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,160
Welcome!

176
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,280
- Come in!
- If you please.

177
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,560
Welcome.

178
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,200
Boys...

179
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,240
You're looking for a fight
with that young nobleman?

180
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,040
If he touches her,
he'll see my sword!

181
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,320
Do you want to ruin us?

182
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,480
The Prince will avenge him,
banish us, take Helena.

183
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Do you want to be slain?
He came, he'll leave.

184
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,000
As you wish.

185
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,600
Though my soul groans,
I'll be sweet as honey.

186
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,760
Feed the servants!

187
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,080
- To the war against the infidels
- A toast!

188
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,920
We'll roam in the Crimea.

189
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,600
You're still hungry for fame?

190
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,240
Bigger war, greater glory.

191
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,760
Sing us about the Cossack glory.

192
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Whose horse is standing there,

193
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,760
Shaking its coal-black mane?

194
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,160
I am pining away

195
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,480
I am pining away

196
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,600
for a girl like a dream.

197
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,240
Stop tormenting the soul...
Musicians, play!

198
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
I've made a vow to the Virgin

199
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,800
that until
I cut off three heads...

200
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,280
You haven't vowed chastity?

201
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,760
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

202
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,480
Virgin of Virgins,

203
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,680
Let me be Sir John's wife.

204
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,080
Let him be my husband,
and save me from Bohun. Amen.

205
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,680
The girl stopped me
on my way here.

206
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,040
- Which girl was that?
- The Princess.

207
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,760
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?
- Jesus! You didn't ask.

208
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,520
Listen, you swain...

209
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Don't call me that.
I'm of noble blood, though poor.

210
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
- I have my dignity.
- What did she say?

211
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
Who?

212
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,000
She asked
if your word was of any worth.

213
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,960
And?

214
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,920
I put it this way...

215
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,560
"If my master
promised me a horse,

216
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,120
I'd have no doubt it was mine".

217
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,280
Take the horse.

218
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,240
I heard rumors

219
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,920
they plan to give Helena
to Bohun.

220
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,120
What?

221
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,760
She owns Roz³ogi
and if Bohun marries her,

222
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,920
- he'll let the family stay here
- You've found out a lot.

223
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,920
If I found out A, without
finding out B, you'd say,

224
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,160
"No saddle for you".
Who needs a bare-backed horse?

225
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,280
Rzêdzian!

226
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,440
You cunning devil...
The horse and saddle are yours.

227
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,800
I humbly thank you, Sir.

228
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,280
Thank you for your hospitality.

229
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,800
- You're always most welcome.
- Always!

230
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,640
I'd like a word with you all...
in private.

231
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,240
In private? Go in.

232
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,040
Forgive me for acting
against the old custom.

233
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,720
But I have no choice.

234
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm asking you
to let me marry Helena.

235
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,720
You and Helena?

236
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,920
Yes.

237
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,280
I beg your pardon,
but I've already promised her

238
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,480
- to another.
- To Bohun?

239
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,480
So that he lets you stay here?

240
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,240
- That's nothing to you.
- You want to rob her!

241
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,920
The Prince will burn the place
and you'll rot in the dungeon.

242
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,160
I'll let you stay in Roz³ogi
and won't ask for rent.

243
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,040
Don't give away
what's not yours.

244
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,960
If you give me the girl
I'll appease the Prince's wrath.

245
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,920
You have my word of honor.

246
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,640
What say you, my sons,
to this officer's

247
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,520
humble request?

248
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
Tell us if we shall
kill or agree.

249
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
Bohun will seek revenge.

250
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,520
Make your choice.

251
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,160
- Secrecy is imperative.
- She's mine?

252
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,160
She is.

253
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,960
- You won't betray me?
- If we only could...

254
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,440
You didn't even bother
to ask her what she thinks.

255
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,400
Then let us ask her.

256
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,240
If it be your will,

257
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,280
here is your betrothed.

258
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,120
- Is that true?
- Like God in heaven.

259
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,240
£UBNIE
Prince Jeremy's family site

260
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,080
John!

261
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,960
I have missed you...

262
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
- so much!
- Likewise, Michael.

263
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,840
- The Prince kept asking about
- Rzêdzian! My outfit!

264
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,920
This is Sir Longinus,
alias the Hoodsnatcher,

265
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,720
whose strength has no match.

266
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,280
And that's Michael Wo³odyjowski,
swordsman extraordinaire.

267
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,080
- I still have scars from that
- Fewer than I.

268
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,520
What did you two fight for?

269
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,000
- A girl. All the ladies pine for
- Oh dear...

270
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,800
They'll have to pine for
another. I've fallen in love.

271
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,720
And I've proposed!

272
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,920
I'm glad you want to marry her.

273
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,080
She comes
from an old and noble family,

274
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,520
her father was a patriot.

275
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,080
You did well in the Crimea,
but now it all seems in vain.

276
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,640
There'll be no war with Turkey!

277
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,800
The King may dream about it,

278
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,240
but the Senators
won't let him have his will.

279
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,760
Expect a rebellion.

280
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,880
Chmielnicki's gone to the
Sietch ? I've seen him in combat.

281
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,680
It's been years since the
Cossacks have had such a leader.

282
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,960
I must send a spy there.

283
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,720
- When shall I leave?
- You've just arrived.

284
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,320
I'm ready to go.

285
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,000
- And visit the Princess on your
- Yes, Excellency.

286
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,040
Well...

287
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,800
You saved Chmielnicki's life.

288
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,080
Go. I'll give you letters

289
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,040
to some of the atamans. Find out
if Chmielnicki is allying with.

290
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,280
I'll be back in a month.

291
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,520
Don't you fret.

292
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,880
- A priest awaits us in £ubnie.
- I'm worried about you.

293
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,560
An envoy is untouchable.

294
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Goodness me, master...
I've never seen so much water!

295
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,280
The Dneper.

296
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
What's wrong?

297
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,040
So much soil going to waste.

298
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,800
And my parents went to trial
for a pear-tree on the balk.

299
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,000
It all started 50 years ago.
Let's say this is the balk...

300
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,600
Why aren't there any boats?
I don't see any fishermen.

301
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,800
Must have run off
to the Sietch.

302
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,880
Hoist the sail!

303
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,680
Turn back!

304
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,400
Rzêdzian, go back to Roz³ogi.

305
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,200
- I won't leave you.
- That's an order.

306
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,520
Even if you killed me...

307
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,640
Go.

308
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,080
- Take a horse.
- Which horse?

309
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,280
You can take mine.
I'll give you letters.

310
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,200
Helena's family must go to
£ubnie, there's going to be war.

311
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,360
Goodness me!
Then I have to go.

312
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,440
I'll write the letters.

313
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,360
Watch out!

314
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,440
- Who are you?
- And you?

315
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,720
Answer or I'll shoot!

316
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,720
An envoy from Prince Jeremy
to the chief ataman.

317
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,200
- Where's the envoy?
- Here.

318
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,480
We'll escort you. Tied up.

319
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,160
THE COSSACK SIETCH
April 1648

320
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,560
A letter from Prince Jeremy

321
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,640
asking the chief ataman
to betray me.

322
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,640
And two letters instructing
Tatarchuk and Barabas

323
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,400
to meet the envoy's needs.

324
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,720
What do you say, gentlemen?

325
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,120
Could the chief ataman
hide the letters?

326
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,440
He could.

327
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,120
He could... but he didn't?

328
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,200
- So he's been loyal?
- Yes!

329
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,600
- And I trust him.
- Thank you, Bohdan.

330
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,240
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Go and announce

331
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,120
that he's beyond suspicion.

332
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,760
The chief ataman
is no traitor!

333
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,000
If he hadn't betrayed us,

334
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,960
then who is the traitor?

335
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,680
Why did they write you?

336
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,720
I'm innocent!
Did I receive the letters? No!

337
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,280
And even if I had,

338
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,440
I'd take them to the scribe,
as I cannot read or write!

339
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,320
We were together in the Crimea,
I shed my blood for you...

340
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,440
Why does the Hetman
suspect me?

341
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,120
Tatarchuk's our brother!

342
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,360
Yes, our brother.

343
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,080
And a brother's betrayal
saddens my heart.

344
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,560
Why do the Poles write you?

345
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,440
Why do they tell you

346
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,640
to meet all the envoy's wishes?

347
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,560
The envoy will wish to know
if we're ready to rebel

348
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,640
and if the Tartars
are on our side.

349
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,280
Tatarchuk and Barabas
are traitors. Kill them.

350
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,640
Kill them!

351
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,600
Judas!

352
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,160
I know this Pole,
he was in the Crimea.

353
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,000
Who are you?

354
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm an envoy to you, Ataman.

355
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,040
My men were slaughtered.

356
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,880
- Prince Jeremy will be enraged.
- Kill him!

357
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,960
Kill!

358
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,600
Death to him! Kill!

359
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
Silence!

360
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,280
Let us have him!

361
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,280
And kill!

362
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,640
Wait!

363
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,240
Quiet!

364
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,080
He's an envoy.
Understand? An envoy!

365
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,360
- A spy!
- Kill him!

366
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,080
Let us... or we'll take him.

367
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,120
Prince Jeremy will pay in gold.

368
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,880
Give him to us!

369
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,320
Away!

370
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,160
Infidel dogs!

371
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,160
Out of my sight!

372
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,520
You want to take my prisoner?

373
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,800
Never! You pig-eaters!
Go away!

374
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,760
Tuhay-bey is angry!

375
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,040
The Pole!

376
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,960
Quiet!

377
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,800
Tuhay-bey is angry!

378
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,600
He's angry!

379
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,560
He's very angry!

380
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,160
Hey, hey, Tuhay-bey...

381
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,840
How much ransom
are you expecting to get?

382
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,080
He's an important person.

383
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,720
The terrible Prince
loves his people. 2000 thalers.

384
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,360
I can pay you 2000.

385
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,400
- You will pay 3000.
- Why?

386
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,840
Because you want him.

387
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,800
He saved my life.

388
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,080
Then you'll give 4000.

389
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,440
I'll pay 4000.

390
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,920
I don't want his pity.

391
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,080
You don't know my plans for you.

392
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,080
When the war breaks,
money will be scarce. I can pay

393
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,720
here and now.

394
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,040
- 4000.
- It's a deal!

395
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,960
I'm sleepy.

396
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,120
- Show him to his chamber.
- Let's go.

397
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,200
We're even now. You're free
if you promise not to tell

398
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,760
what you've seen here.

399
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,680
I cannot.

400
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,760
Then I shall not let you go,
until I'm ready for war.

401
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,680
All this because some Pole
seduced your wife?

402
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,800
Silence!

403
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,640
Czapliñski killed my son.

404
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,040
Would people follow me,

405
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,960
if I only sought private revenge
Look at today's Ukraine.

406
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,120
Who's happy here?

407
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,040
A few magnates and noblemen.

408
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,280
Theirs is the land,
theirs is the freedom.

409
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,440
All the others? They're scum.

410
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,800
Have the Cossack army
been shown any gratitude

411
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,320
for fighting on Poland's side?
Where are our privileges?

412
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,560
The nobles want to turn
free Cossacks into serfs.

413
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,480
I declare war against them,
not against the King.

414
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
The King is our father,
and Poland is our mother.

415
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,400
Whom you sell to the Tartars.

416
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,200
Should we let ourselves
get butchered

417
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,400
like the rebels of the past?

418
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,760
The magnates
are killing our mother.

419
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,560
It's because of them Ukraine

420
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,560
won't join your alliance against
the Turks, Tartars, Muscovy.

421
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,520
Who gave you the right to be
our judge and executioner?

422
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,120
Let God judge and punish.

423
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,960
When we complained to the King,
he asked,

424
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,680
"Haven't you any guns
and sabers?"

425
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,360
The King of Kings would say,
"Forgive your foes, as I forgave."

426
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,560
I don't want war with Poland.

427
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,640
If she gives us back our rights,
I'll send the Tartars away.

428
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,160
The Poles are marching
against us!

429
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,160
War.

430
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,000
Pour us some good wine

431
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,160
into crystal goblets,

432
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,320
so that enemy bullets
so that enemy swords

433
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,880
don't pierce our hearts.

434
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,440
So that Ukraine

435
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,720
stops shedding bitter tears,

436
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,640
so that our glory,
so that Cossack fame,

437
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,600
lasts forever and ever.

438
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,840
They're preparing for a battle.

439
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,680
The Hetman orders you
to move forward.

440
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,120
YELLOW WATERS
April 29, 1648

441
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,560
Crooked Nose,

442
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,360
in the name of God.

443
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,600
Halt!

444
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,480
Brother Cossacks,
aim the guns!

445
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,960
Fire!

446
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,760
Lances forward!

447
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,160
Fire!

448
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,400
Where's my loot, my prisoners,
my victory?

449
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,920
Over there.

450
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,680
Your infidel dogs
don't want to fight.

451
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,040
- You've ruined the Khan's army!
- Calm down.

452
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,800
Tomorrow, after the rain,

453
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,560
- the hussars will drown in mud.
- You promised

454
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,760
victory, not defeat.

455
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,720
We've captured some dragoons.

456
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,920
They're yours.

457
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,280
I'll have them

458
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,680
impaled!

459
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,560
They'll draw the others
to our side.

460
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,960
Beat the drums.

461
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,040
Feign attack

462
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,040
and withdraw,
the whole night long.

463
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,840
Halt!

464
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,400
Fall back!

465
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,520
Fall back!

466
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,560
Rain for the Poles,
the sun for us.

467
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,120
It's time.

468
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,520
Don't despair, Bohun.

469
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,880
The magnates
have stifled the rebellion,

470
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,240
there'll be peace.
I'll give you my crest,

471
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,080
and the princes
will give you their sister.

472
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,560
We usually
take prisoners to the commander.

473
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,840
- But he's asleep.
- This guy's going to £ubnie.

474
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,960
- To £ubnie?
- Yes, Colonel.

475
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,920
Let him go.

476
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,240
Rzêdzian?

477
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,760
That's
John Skrzetuski's servant.

478
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,240
- Is your master well?
- Yes, he sends his regards.

479
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,520
I know him, too.

480
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,040
We met... in Roz³ogi.

481
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,440
Where?

482
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,120
- In Roz³ogi.
- At the Kurcewiczs'.

483
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,160
- Who?
- You've gone deaf?

484
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,160
I'm very sleepy...
Good bye.

485
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,040
Wait. You'll get your sleep.

486
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,240
- Search him!
- That's illegal!

487
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,160
Let him be.

488
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,280
Let him be.

489
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,800
"To the honorable...
princess Kurcewicz in Roz³ogi".

490
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,520
So, you're going to £ubnie?

491
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,840
You don't know where Roz³ogi is?

492
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,240
"To Helena Kurcewicz..."

493
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,240
- That's an offence.
- I have orders

494
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,760
to inspect the mail.

495
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,160
"My sweetest, beloved Helena...

496
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,680
Queen of my heart..."

497
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,680
Skrzetuski is your rival?

498
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,880
You're wooing the same girl?

499
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,640
Cheer up.

500
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,320
- Once, I...
- Silence!

501
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,320
Jesus...

502
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,360
A medic! Bohun!

503
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,440
I'll live.

504
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,880
Maxim!

505
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,360
Lower the bridge!

506
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,400
Wait for a shot.

507
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:54,960
Who's there?

508
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,400
Don't you recognize?

509
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,360
It's you... thank God!

510
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,040
Let us in.

511
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,240
Bohun, be reasonable,

512
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,000
your life is at stake.

513
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,280
To hell with my life!

514
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,400
Who could that be?

515
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,440
Bohun?

516
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,640
- You? Here?
- Aren't you glad to see me?

517
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,080
Very glad... and surprised.
You're supposed to be in Czehryñ

518
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,880
And who is your companion?

519
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,680
Mr. Zag³oba,

520
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,080
a noble

521
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,360
and my friend.

522
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,680
Please, sit. Eat and drink.

523
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,440
Thank you

524
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,800
for paying us a visit.

525
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,680
Is Helena well?

526
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,800
She is.

527
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,480
- I'd like to see her.
- She's gone to bed.

528
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Pity. I won't be staying long.
I wanted to see you

529
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,520
before going to war.

530
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,280
It's hard to fight one's own.

531
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,640
But there's no choice.
I might not come back.

532
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,680
But I want you to assure me
that Helena

533
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,160
will be mine.

534
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,640
A nobleman's word obliges.

535
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,520
And you're nobility.

536
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,400
You're princes.

537
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,440
So...

538
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,760
Promise?

539
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,120
We have to ask her.

540
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,280
Let everyone speak
for themselves.

541
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,720
Promise?

542
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,960
We do.

543
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,200
We do.

544
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,520
We do.

545
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,720
Zag³oba...

546
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,800
Ask them, too.

547
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,880
They may give her to you.

548
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,720
Are you drunk?

549
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,960
Sir John Skrzetuski
sends you letters.

550
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,840
To arms!

551
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,640
Peace!

552
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,080
Back off!

553
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,560
Back!

554
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,760
Princess...

555
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,760
Surround the house.
Don't let anyone in...

556
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,400
I'll kill whoever enters!

557
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,840
Put him in bed!

558
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,200
I'll dress his wounds!

559
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,840
He needs to rest!
Off with you!

560
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,280
The cellar is yours.
But leave something for me.

561
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,640
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

562
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,640
pray for us sinners, now

563
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,840
and at the hour of our death.

564
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,600
Christ! Keep quiet!

565
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,440
Stop!

566
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,760
Sir John sends me.

567
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,480
- Why should I believe you?
- Have you a better choice?

568
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,720
Give me some mead!

569
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,040
- Do you see that?
- I'll be damned...

570
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,960
Not bad.

571
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,920
Too good
for your peasant throats.

572
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,920
Why don't you
share some with the guards?

573
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,680
Relieve them!

574
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,040
- Let them drink, too!
- Thank you, kind Sir.

575
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,800
Hey, you,

576
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,120
- is it far to £ubnie?
- Very far.

577
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,160
- Can I get there by dawn?
- No way!

578
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,760
By noon?

579
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,440
That's more like it.

580
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,080
Go ahead, boys!
Help yourselves!

581
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,360
Don't be shy!

582
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,640
The ataman's asleep!
Let him rest!

583
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,280
I'll keep watch over him.

584
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,960
And you all, drink his health!

585
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,480
To his health!

586
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,680
Feel better?

587
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,800
You can't talk?

588
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That's even better.
You won't protest,

589
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,440
when I take Helena

590
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,320
to £ubnie.

591
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,800
I'll ask the Prince to send you
a doctor... or a hangman.

592
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,720
I can assure you
we two will never drink again.

593
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,360
Soldiers!

594
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,640
Quiet!

595
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,640
Quiet.

596
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,200
Get well.

597
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,360
Pity, I can't stab you.
We might meet again,

598
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,640
but I won't pray for that.

599
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:48,080
I'd sooner let myself get
stuffed and hung on the wall.

600
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,520
Slow down.

601
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,080
- This isn't the road to £ubnie.
- Tuck your hair in.

602
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,240
They think we went to £ubnie,
and we're heading for Czehryñ.

603
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,920
Son of a bitch!
That damned Pole!

604
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,440
I'll rip his throat open!

605
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,680
- He asked for the road to £ubnie
- To £ubnie!

606
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,800
- Take the goods!
- And if Jeremy comes?

607
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,280
Put the blame on Bohun!

608
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,280
Hide!

609
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,320
Ride off!

610
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,200
- Czehryñ fell!
- My God...

611
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,520
The serfs are butchering
the nobles! It's Judgment Day!

612
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,120
Don't go to Roz³ogi!

613
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,080
Chmielnicki before us,
Bohun behind us.

614
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,280
God will save us again.

615
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,360
There's a fortress called Bar.

616
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,960
But far from here.

617
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,800
Very far.

618
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,720
- I've seen nobody.
- Nobody?

619
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:07,760
No.

620
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,040
Go ahead.

621
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,920
I saw

622
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,960
Zag³oba and a lad...

623
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,320
- Where?
- Halfway to Czehryñ...

624
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,160
at a pond.

625
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,600
- You warned them?
- I did.

626
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,680
Hang him.

627
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,360
Let's go!

628
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,480
Might the dogs eat you!

629
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Might they skin you! Might
the Jews wear you as collars!

630
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,040
- What wrong?
- No horses!

631
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,320
God be praised!

632
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,320
Now and ever after.

633
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,120
- Who's there?
- Christians.

634
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,600
- Where are you coming from?
- From Chmielnicki.

635
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,160
Have you seen him?

636
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,640
I'm...

637
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,960
I'm blind, Sir.

638
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,760
- And the boy?
- He saw him.

639
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,400
But he's deaf.

640
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,560
I'm the only one
who understands him.

641
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,080
You dirty spies!

642
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,360
You incite the serfs to revolt?

643
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,080
Strip them naked, soldiers!
And hang them!

644
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,640
Strip!

645
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,000
Give me that! Quick!

646
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,200
Or I'll kill you!

647
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,800
Sons of bitches! Drunkards!

648
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,760
Trousers, quick!

649
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,760
You're as good as dead.

650
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,640
Take them!

651
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,800
My God! Jeremy's soldiers!

652
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,840
That's the Prince!

653
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,520
Get them!

654
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,480
Go!

655
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,480
They'll kill us!

656
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,720
Fire!

657
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,400
Kill!

658
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,440
Viper!

659
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,320
Princess...

660
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,240
Hands off!

661
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,640
Give me a quart of vodka.

662
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,040
A doctor!

663
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,760
A doctor!

664
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,040
He was a Jew,

665
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,520
so they hanged him.
But I'm an expert.

666
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,040
Bohun!

667
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,160
Bar!

668
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,480
God be praised!
We're here, my little one!

669
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,920
And where did you come from?

670
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,520
- Why are you here?
- Me? I'm doctoring you.

671
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,840
You've lost much blood.

672
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,720
You were with me all the time?

673
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,640
No one else knows the cures.

674
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,240
You're Skrzetuski's servant.

675
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,720
I'm nobody's servant anymore.
I joined the Cossacks.

676
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,440
I'll make you well.

677
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,120
And as for that...

678
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,800
no hard feelings.
I know you're hot-tempered.

679
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,120
You witch...

680
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,200
how come you're here?

681
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,080
I saw you needed help.

682
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,960
Get up, war!

683
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,520
You're his doctor?

684
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,600
Good. Get out!

685
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,040
Leave.

686
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,680
Your girl

687
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,880
is in the castle

688
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,760
on the white rock

689
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,920
- over the water.
- You're sure?

690
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,360
I saw her.

691
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,120
KORSUÑ, May 26, 1648 the second
defeat of the Polish troops

692
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,400
Glory, brother Cossacks!

693
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,760
You'll be escorted by Tartars,
as the Prince likes impaling cossacks

694
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,080
- You're free.
- No!

695
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,800
I'm letting you go,
though you'll fight against us.

696
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,120
If God gives me the strength.

697
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,440
To our fame and good luck!

698
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,840
Away with misery!

699
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,520
Kiss my hand!

700
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,800
Why?

701
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,720
Because I'm His Excellency!

702
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,320
His Highness!

703
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,280
Call me "magnate"!

704
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,800
Because I'm drinking
from a magnate's goblet!

705
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,880
- What?
- That is

706
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,720
a chamber pot, you moron!

707
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,640
For drinking

708
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,880
- in a chamber?
- It was used

709
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,280
for pissing

710
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,160
and shitting!

711
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,360
- That's a lie!
- I never lie!

712
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,160
Even dogs shit outside!

713
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,320
Quiet! It's our Hetman!

714
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,480
Brother Atamans,
I bring sorrowful news.

715
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,200
Our protector and benefactor
King Wladislav IV

716
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,080
is dead.

717
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:57,120
Let's decide, if we shall wait,
until we gather our forces, or..

718
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,920
Let's attack Jeremy!

719
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,680
He's our enemy!

720
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,680
Let's fight!

721
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,760
- Kill Jeremy!
- Impale him!

722
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,360
Tuhay-bey has gone
to the Crimea.

723
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,800
He'll be back in a month. Should
we go without the Tartars?

724
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,720
To kill Jeremy!

725
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:26,720
Let's write we do not want war,
but respect for our rights.

726
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,880
A letter!

727
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:35,360
Quiet!
And who will deliver it?

728
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,280
Who's the bravest?

729
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:43,080
Who shouted,
"Let's fight Jeremy"?

730
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,600
I'll go.

731
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,160
What shall we write him?

732
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,080
- "You son of a bitch"!
- "You devil's offspring"!

733
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,000
- "You tyrant".
- That's good.

734
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,920
Very good.

735
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,920
But we shall write him this.

736
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:19,520
"Your Enlightened Excellency,
Prince and Governor".

737
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,920
"Therefore I'm asking you
to forgive us for what we did

738
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:29,840
with the commanders
who attacked our forces.

739
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,720
Bohdan Chmielnicki,
the Cossack Hetman".

740
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,560
Arrest them.

741
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,200
We're the Hetman's envoys!

742
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,560
The rebel's envoys.

743
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,920
- We're envoys!
- It's an outrage!

744
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,440
Remember that Chmielnicki

745
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,360
let Skrzetuski go.

746
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:10,920
Skrzetuski was my envoy.
You're comparing me to a rebel?

747
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,760
Let them feel they're dying.

748
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,880
What do you make of that letter?

749
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,880
He's a sly fox, Your Excellency.

750
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,320
He's waiting for the Tartars
to return from the Crimea.

751
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,120
- We should move.
- And such is my will.

752
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,760
But we mustn't
underestimate Chmielnicki.

753
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,280
Potocki wanted
to strife the rebellion.

754
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,680
They killed his son
and took him prisoner.

755
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,800
We're alone.
No one will help us.

756
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,560
Chaos reigns after
the King's death. Bychowiec!

757
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,280
- Yes, Sir!
- Take 300 dragoons.

758
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,920
Escort my wife, the nobles
and the Jews to Zamoæ.

759
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,240
And hurry back.

760
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,080
Where to?

761
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,800
You'll find us. We shall
make ourselves known in Ukraine.

762
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,200
I, Jeremy Winiowiecki,

763
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,280
Ruthenian Governor,
Prince of £ubnie and Winiowiec,

764
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,040
do solemnly pledge,
before you, God in Trinity,

765
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,160
and before you, Virgin Mary,

766
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,160
that having raised my sword
against the roguery, I shall not

767
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,080
until I pacify all of Ukraine,

768
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,520
and drown all peasant rebellions
in blood.

769
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,760
So help me God.

770
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,560
Amen.

771
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,040
Curse...

772
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,080
on you...

773
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,280
Poles...

774
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,680
God in Heaven...

775
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,280
Skrzetuski!

776
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,360
John?

777
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,960
Do you recognize me?

778
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,120
John!

779
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:49,840
Christ...

780
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,600
he's gone insane.

781
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,600
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

782
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,680
hallowed be Thy name,
Thy Kingdom come,

783
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,560
Thy will be done...

784
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,920
Thy will be done...

785
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,480
Thy will be done...

786
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,760
on earth...
as it is in Heaven.

787
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,720
Sir Michael!

788
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,640
Take him on a scout.

789
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,200
Let the wind
blow his woe away.

790
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,120
Search the village.
If you find stolen goods,

791
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,200
chase away the women and children
burn the house... and thank the

792
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,440
peasants...

793
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,160
- Marauders ahead of us.
- Let's go.

794
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,280
I'm a nobleman!

795
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,440
Stop!

796
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,880
Sons of bitches!

797
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,920
Don't you dare!

798
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,600
Zag³oba?

799
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,600
Lord be praised!

800
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,800
Mr. Zag³oba! He's alive!
Our dearest friend!

801
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,760
Let go!

802
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,240
Don't break my bones! So much
muscle and so little brain!

803
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,720
Here you go again. Phooey!

804
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,240
I'm thirsty.

805
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,000
Why are you here?

806
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,880
God's will.
The Princess asked me

807
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,680
- to find him.
- Who?

808
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,440
The Princess.

809
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,040
What?

810
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,440
She's alive?

811
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,880
She is, but let go

812
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,920
before you shake my soul out.

813
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:14,560
- Is she all right?
- A dry throat can't be choosy.

814
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,720
I'm talking about Helena!

815
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,320
She's safe in Bar.
It's a mighty fortress.

816
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,680
Thank you... with all my heart.
