THE COAST GUARD

17
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,635
The Korean peninsula is
the only divided country on earth

18
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:29,512
After the Korean War, South Korea's
coastline have been surrounded
by barbed wire fences to block any attack

19
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:38,115
Even now, whoever enters the coast after sunset,
can be considered a spy and be killed

20
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,322
- Five minutes until roll call!
- Five minutes until roll call!

21
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,223
Get your asses moving now!

22
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,258
- Quickly!
- Yes, sir.

23
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,248
1st Private Kim.

24
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,014
Put it on my eyes.

25
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,931
Please stop.
I'm sick of it.

26
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,763
We'll see.
Whether I catch one or not.

27
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,337
We'll see what, you moron?
Think a spy will come to you?

28
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,308
Hurry it up!

29
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,778
- Take center!
- Taking center!

30
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,063
- Count to the right!
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

31
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,402
- Salute.
- Salute.

32
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,078
Coast Guard platoon,
23 reporting and one on duty.

33
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,905
All 23 ready for night watch, sir!

34
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,478
- At ease.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,048
At ease!

36
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,181
Our country faces the sea at three sides,
and all coasts are restricted.

37
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,887
This zone especially was intruded
by spies three times since the war.

38
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,028
Never let your guards down here.

39
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,227
You'll be commemorated for killing a spy,
and be specially discharged.

40
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,766
You'll be honored
for the rest of your life.

41
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,967
But if you miss one,

42
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,578
you'll bring disgrace
to your life forever.

43
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,547
Spies are unlike before.
They'll avoid being seen,

44
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,887
and either shoot a poisoned dart
or slice your neck off.

45
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,759
Hey, idiot.
Are you with special forces?

46
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,599
Get training from them?!

47
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,227
If you'd like, I can do it, sir.

48
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,600
Want a bullet through your head?
Where's your helmet?

49
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,509
Before a spy shoots,
I'll shoot first, sir.

50
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,170
Sure. We'll see about that.
That is all.

51
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,685
About-face!

52
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,194
Raise your arms.

53
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,661
- March.
- March.

54
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,128
Coffee's here, honey.

55
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,100
- It's a card game.
- Get over here.

56
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,970
- Who's winning?
- He is.

57
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,368
The pot's mine now.

58
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,671
- I won!
- Shit!

59
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,715
Are you two cheating?
Get away from my sister.

60
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,358
- What are you looking at?
- Who's looking?

61
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:16,001
- Who cares if he does. Honey, look at me, too.
- Yeah, army bastards never get laid.

62
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:21,264
- You low-life punks.
- Go. Forget about them.

63
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,604
Spies don't exist anymore, damn it.

64
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:29,706
All you pigs do is play,
and freeload off our taxes.

65
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,014
Cowards can't even shoot an empty gun.

66
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,350
Empty gun?

67
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,915
I see.

68
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,221
If you're brave, come and find out.

69
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,788
Fuck, you'll be in pieces.
After my grenade tears you apart.

70
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,094
You asshole!

71
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,530
You fucking assholes!

72
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,862
Don't!

73
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,309
- Dammit.
- None your bussiness

74
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,604
Stop it! Stop it!

75
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,804
Fucking assholes!

76
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,447
I dare you to come
to the coast at night.

77
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,253
I'll shoot you all
even if you're not a spy.

78
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,353
Just go.

79
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,663
Think that bastard could shoot
a spy for real?

80
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,098
If you test him out,
I'll give you my sister.

81
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,766
Really?
Do it Young-gil.

82
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,102
- He'll give you Mee-young.
- Only if you come out alive.

83
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,468
- Duk-bae, heard that?
- Sure did.

84
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,410
You're crazy. He said he'll definitely
shoot. Don't kid around.

85
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,807
- Saw her worry about me, right?
- Did you two already screw behind my back?!

86
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,487
Shit!

87
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,728
Bunch of punks who didn't even serve.

88
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,162
Forget about it.
They're always like that.

89
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,265
Fucking assholes.
They better not cross my path.

90
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,637
Guard post 26.
All is clear.

91
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,943
Check a strange object at 500 meters
ten o'clock. I don't see anything.

92
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,084
It's a fishing tube, over.

93
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,168
Think we'll see a spy
before we get discharged?

94
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,904
Do we really have to catch one?

95
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,900
Then why are we here?

96
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,240
I just hope nothing happens
before I get discharged.

97
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,508
I'll lie in ambush over there.
A spy might come in there.

98
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,584
Platoon leader will get pissed.

99
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,521
Platoon.

100
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,046
- Night.
- Tent.

101
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,558
- Tailor.
- Raft.

102
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,958
- Target.
- Town.

103
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,825
- Name.
- Eh...

104
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,691
You screwed up!

105
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,090
Hey. Pass it right.

106
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,226
Start over again.

107
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,729
You wanna die?

108
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,499
Hurry and go get it.

109
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,297
Damn turtle legs.

110
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,334
My kick's no good today.

111
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,481
You're dead already.

112
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,318
- What are you doing here?
- Can't you see? Training for a surprise attack.

113
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,486
Next!

114
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,761
Come here 2nd Private Cho.

115
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,339
Get up, you bastard.

116
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,286
- I'll hit for real.
- Then do it!

117
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,451
- Don't regret it.
- Hit me, idiot!

118
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,631
I told you not to fight.
Please stop.

119
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,075
Are you okay, sir?

120
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,870
Fight me!
Fight me, you bastard!

121
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,049
You're next.
Fight!

122
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,749
Mount your beds and turn in.

123
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,545
Turning in, sir.

124
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,354
Kang Han-chul, load your song.

125
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,700
1st Private Kang Han-chul.
Loading song!

126
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,293
Fire!

127
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:20,351
*Music* If that happy day could return
Tracing back to that fading memory *Music*

128
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:38,834
*Music* If only I could express
My feelings now *Music*

129
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:51,255
*Music* No matter how much I regret
The past has already gone *Music*

130
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,950
Shit, you two stop it.

131
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,126
Stop it!

132
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:04,262
Come on, she's gonna be my girl soon.
Have a drink.

133
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,505
Anyway, no way.
Got it?

134
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,543
Put your arm down now.

135
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,913
- Let's go.
- Go where?

136
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,821
Just follow me if you like me.

137
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:35,190
WARNING

138
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,131
Bastards can't even shoot a fish.

139
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:44,406
Okay. I'm a spy, so shoot.
Shoot, you bastards.

140
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,812
Mee-young.

141
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:54,348
Why do you look so pretty today?
Let's hug, and stop teasing me.

142
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,119
- Do you love me?
- Of course.

143
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,918
What are you doing?
Get out of there. Come over here.

144
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,724
If you do, I'll hug you.

145
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,531
Are you crazy? Stop kidding around,
and come out.

146
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,297
Remember the old lady
who got shot last year?

147
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,531
Bastards got commended
and went on leave.

148
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,503
So you don't love me?

149
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,677
Are you crazy? Stop playing,
and come out now.

150
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,317
They shoot at night no matter what.

151
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,096
- Scared you might get shot?
- Aren't you scared?

152
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,733
I heard they shoot to get discharged.
Now you're all mine.

153
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,321
It feels great.

154
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,017
Is it a spy?

155
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,329
Young-gil...

156
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,113
Over here!

157
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,959
- What is it?
- Check!

158
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,901
Don't touch it!
I caught that spy!

159
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,566
Hurry and check now!

160
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,773
- Don't come any closer!
- Bastard.

161
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,173
Looks like one of those punks.

162
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,757
- This is the killed civilian, sir.
- Who's the soldier that did it?

163
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,790
1st Private Kang Han-chul
sitting over there.

164
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,703
My Young-gil!
Get out of my way!

165
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,110
- Didn't he look drunk to you?
- I don't know.

166
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:55,515
- Weren't you scared?
- I don't know.

167
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,089
Mee-young, are you okay? Why'd you
get drunk and go in there?

168
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,227
Take a rest.
Good work.

169
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,594
Why'd you go in knowing
you could get shot?

170
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,426
She seems a bit strange.

171
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,348
Who killed my son?
You murderer.

172
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:29,683
Is it you? You murderer!
Bring my son back!

173
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,723
Bring my son back!

174
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,049
Bring my son back.

175
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,624
- You rotten bastard. You rotten bastard.
- Take her away!

176
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,461
Bring my son back.

177
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,661
Hey shithead! Is Young-gil a spy?
Can a soldier shoot anyone?

178
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,232
Move back and be quiet.

179
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,438
How can I be quiet after a civilian
was killed? You murderers!

180
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,615
I told you not
to come in here.
This is a military zone.

181
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,948
Cut the crap,
and give me that murderer!

182
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,653
Think I can't kill someone
without a gun?

183
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,151
The soldier did nothing wrong.
He just carried out his duty!

184
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,460
And if he was a spy, who response to that

185
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,027
You son of a bitch!
Take them out!

186
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,182
Hands-up.Don't move

187
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:39,919
Hurry up!

188
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,259
If you make a trouble

189
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,366
- Salute.
- Salute.

190
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,198
prize!

191
00:22:55,807 --> 00:23:00,073
While 1st Private Kang Han-chul
was on duty at 3am,

192
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,945
he used proper measures to stop an infiltrator.
So we commemorate him for his loyal duty.

193
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,348
Recognized by 2459 Battalion Commander

194
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,116
- We grant you a special leave of seven days.
- Salute.

195
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,531
Stop it. Sleep.

196
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,316
How dare you?

197
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,685
How could you smash a boy's toy?
You son of a bitch.

198
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,722
Call yourself a soldier? Do you?

199
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,428
Stop looking at the ocean. It won't
make Young-gil come back.

200
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,263
Rotten army bastards. Damn it.

201
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,751
What the hell are you doing?
I have to sell those. Damn it.

202
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,362
Mee-young.
Mee-young!

203
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,543
What the hell's wrong with you?

204
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,256
- Cheers!
- Congratulations.

205
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,931
Is it a special or regular leave?
What are you on leave for?

206
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:17,002
What's wrong with you? On leave,
you always talked all night about soldier stories.

207
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,077
- That's my drink.
- Drink a little.

208
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,146
Hey, did you catch a spy?

209
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,553
Or kill a drunk civilian
who crossed the line?

210
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,981
Heard they give you a break if you do.

211
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,131
What's wrong with you?

212
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:10,719
Hey! Why'd you act that way?
Something happen at the base?

213
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,727
Your hand.
What's wrong with you?

214
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:55,338
Was it true what Hyung-shik said?
What's wrong with you?

215
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,942
Please say something.

216
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,757
Give me the ball.

217
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,731
Hurry and give it.

218
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,839
Your call cannot be connected.

219
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,729
Why are you doing this?

220
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,131
I'm sorry.

221
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,632
Talk to me!

222
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,635
Let go of me!

223
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,702
It was my duty!

224
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,376
Hey !

225
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,749
- Talk to me!
- Stop it.

226
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,451
Sun-hwa!

227
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,547
Hey. Why'd you go in there?

228
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,760
Come out quickly.

229
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,391
Come out quickly!

230
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,733
Young-gil.

231
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,067
Young-gil.

232
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,542
Bastard, get up! What are you gonna do?
You murdering son of a bitch!

233
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,954
What are you gonna do
about my crazy sister?

234
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,427
Come here, you bastard.

235
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,118
Young-gil.
No. No.

236
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,408
Are you alright?
It must hurt a lot.

237
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,512
Rotten bastards went too far.
Are you okay?

238
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:59,502
Hurry it up. Work faster by the fence.
Hurry it up!

239
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,414
Private Kang, sir.
How did it feel at that time?

240
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:22,022
You know, when you shot that drunk guy.

241
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,128
Besides a war, when could
you ever shoot someone?

242
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,203
Did you pull the trigger right
as you saw him?

243
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,932
But you emptied a whole magazine.
If it were me, I couldn't have fired.

244
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,043
I heard soldiers who went to Vietnam
liked it later.

245
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,581
They shot at whatever they wanted.

246
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,288
- What's with you, Private Kang?
- Let go!

247
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm sorry, Private Cho.

248
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:25,682
Stop doing that, you're making me nervous.
Something happen with Sun-hwa on break?

249
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,452
Where are you going?

250
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,195
- Seoul.
- What? Hey, Private Kang!

251
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,174
Who is it?

252
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,442
Who is it? You bastard.

253
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,452
Hurry up! Go!

254
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:22,002
Hey! Private Kang! Pull over!

255
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:40,959
Are you crazy? Know what you're doing now?
Want to ruin your life?

256
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,878
His mental state is unstable,
so he looks unfit for duty.

257
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:02,819
- Platoon leader.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,481
- Don't give him a gun.
- I understand, sir.

259
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,724
- Salute.
- Salute.

260
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,033
Reporting, sir.

261
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,609
1st Private Kang Han-chul here to report
that I am unfit for duty,

262
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,407
so on June 15, 2002, I am hereby ordered
to be discharged from my service.

263
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,414
Salute.

264
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,350
Take care, Private Kang.

265
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,676
Salute!

266
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,786
- It's so pretty.
- I'm glad we came here.

267
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,919
- It's so pretty.
- Let's go in here.

268
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,489
- Hey, we're not supposed to go in there.
- Who cares? Let's just take one picture.

269
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,694
- You're uncontrollable.
- Be careful.

270
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,969
- I told you to wear pants.
- Who cares?

271
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,475
- It's glass.
- What is this?

272
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:15,474
Be careful.

273
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,547
I'll take it.

274
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:27,413
I'm taking it.
Smile. One, two, three.

275
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,888
Miss, you can't take pictures here.

276
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:37,132
- I know, but the scenery is so pretty.
- And we came all the way from Seoul.

277
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,395
- Then take just one picture.
- Take it with both of us.

278
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,100
Here I go.

279
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,436
- Smile. One, two...
- Wait.

280
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,415
I'm taking it. One, Two...

281
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,855
- Anyway, who put that glass there?
- It's for the spies.

282
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,581
- But I got cut.
- Glass shouldn't be there.

283
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,128
- Private Kim!
- Sir, everything is clear!

284
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,460
Clear? Who told these girls to come
in here and take pictures?

285
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,534
Ladies, this is a restricted zone.
No pictures here.

286
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,901
We're not spies.
What are you doing?

287
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:20,603
- We have other pictures, you know.
- Be grateful we're not arresting you.

288
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:28,542
You careless bastard. Wanna go to detention?
Do your duty right!

289
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,755
Stop coming back here.
Get out of there.

290
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,356
Give me the gun!

291
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,694
Young-gil.

292
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,103
Young-gil.

293
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,058
Young-gil.

294
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,835
What the hell?

295
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,252
You go back in first.
I'll go take her home.

296
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:38,619
She's that crazy fish vendor's sister.
He'll kill you.

297
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,522
Don't worry, idiot.
Just give me the ball.

298
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,256
Hurry and go.
Here.

299
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:15,684
Where'd you get that?

300
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:58,998
Who's there?

301
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:05,031
Miss. What are you doing here?
It's dangerous, so go.

302
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,645
Give it back.
Hey! Hey!

303
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,240
What?

304
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:45,911
What is that?

305
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,681
Hey. Why do you have this?

306
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,611
Private Kim. Want to hear a fun story?

307
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,784
While carrying
the infantry's password back,

308
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:29,789
- that fish vendor's crazy sister kept smiling at me.
- So what?

309
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,092
No, just that she smiled.

310
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:39,992
- Is that all she did?
- Stop asking, it's embarrassing.

311
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:45,037
- Rainbow!
- It's me.

312
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,009
Hey, Private Kim.

313
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:54,712
Private Kang. What are you doing here
in your uniform? You scared me.

314
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,252
- I came here on a weird intuition.
- What intuition?

315
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,058
- Give me your gun.
- Don't give it to him.

316
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,330
Give it back,
or else we go to detention.

317
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,140
If Platoon Leader finds out, we're dead.
Hurry and go back.

318
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,710
To where?

319
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:27,274
What?

320
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:37,151
- You can't enter.
- It's me, Private Kang. Remember?

321
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:40,492
Please stop doing this.
You were discharged a while ago.

322
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,765
- Who was discharged?
- Don't do this, and go back home.

323
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:47,270
I haven't finished my service yet.
I have a year left.

324
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,198
What's going on?

325
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:52,671
Sir, he keeps saying he's here for duty.

326
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:53,704
Salute.

327
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:58,078
- 1st Private Kang Han-chul here for duty.
- Kang Han-chul, wake up!

328
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,283
Platoon Leader, I'm fine.

329
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,280
- We'll get into trouble, so never let him in.
- I understand, sir.

330
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:12,687
Open it. Open it, Private Kim!
Open it!

331
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,239
- Salute.
- Salute.

332
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,071
Coast Guard Platoon.
22 soldiers reporting and one on duty.

333
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,108
All 22 prepared for night watch, sir!

334
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:31,206
Dispatch to duties.

335
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,140
About-face.

336
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:37,519
Raise your arms.
