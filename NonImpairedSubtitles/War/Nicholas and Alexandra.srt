1
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,151
A son?

2
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:25,125
I have a son?

3
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,108
Eight pounds.

4
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,093
And Sunny? Is she all right?

5
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,959
Shall I make the announcement?

6
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,776
It's incredible.

7
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,607
I have a son.

8
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,982
He's not the first boy
ever born, you know.

9
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,478
Does he have to be Alexis?
Can't we call him something else?

10
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,905
Alexis was a gentle czar.

11
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:17,347
Perhaps the only one.

12
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:19,136
Not counting you.

13
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:22,405
I thought we'd go on
having girls forever.

14
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,836
I still can't believe...
Oh, you're dribbling.

15
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:26,940
Let me.

16
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,589
I prayed so hard.

17
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:32,989
I'm sure that's how it happened.

18
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,494
You heard him cry.

19
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,826
Not much.
I'll pinch him, shall I?

20
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:40,063
He's going to be enormous.

21
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:42,532
Even bigger than your father was.

22
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:46,143
We couldn't call him Alexander,
could we?

23
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:49,602
He's asleep.
Undoubtedly, we've bored him.

24
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,509
Do you want him for a minute?

25
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,272
Not particularly.

26
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,131
I've had a son.

27
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:07,037
For years, I've daydreamed
how I'd feel.

28
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,661
And all that time,
I never dreamed...

29
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,469
I'm filled with...
I don't know.

30
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:17,827
It isn't joy or anything like that.
It's more.

31
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,911
It's terribly important.

32
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,046
And I don't know why you're smiling.

33
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,516
<i>Du bist ein Dummkopf.</i>

34
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,501
<i>Du auch.</i>

35
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:34,818
Tegleva, if he wakes up hungry,
bring him back.

36
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,575
Yes, Majesty.

37
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,964
At once, no matter what the time is.

38
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,008
The dispatches from Port Arthur.
They've been in for hours.

39
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:45,116
Can't that wait?

40
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,781
I wish it could.

41
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,341
The boy will bring us luck.

42
00:05:49,543 --> 00:05:53,024
We'll smash the Japanese
and drive them from Korea.

43
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,652
I have a son to fight for now.

44
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,150
We have a son.

45
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,931
If you don't get some rest,
he'll starve.

46
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:03,460
Have I made you happy?

47
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,848
No, not much.

48
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,348
I think I like your gentle czar.

49
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,491
Let's call him Alexis.

50
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:25,084
I don't like entertaining
with a war on.

51
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,628
Not right somehow.

52
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:29,506
So we've kept it small.
Just family.

53
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,364
I can't wait.

54
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:32,581
Good girl!

55
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,853
You'll make a partygoer yet.

56
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,218
See you in
Saint Petersburg tonight.

57
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,510
Come on now, Nicky.

58
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,205
All right, Uncle.

59
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:44,709
Who's the sober-Iooking fellow?

60
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,042
Gilliard, the new French tutor.

61
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,416
Can't you stay?

62
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,339
- We're seeing Witte.
- That man!

63
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,423
- He's a brilliant prime minister.
- I never liked him.

64
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,470
I'm the one he bellows at.

65
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,972
You shouldn't let him.

66
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,982
He's your servant.
Everyone's your servant.

67
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,860
You're too gentle.

68
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:03,845
You should slam your fist down
as your father always did.

69
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,169
It's no use.

70
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:08,801
Frowning helps.

71
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,032
It's baby.

72
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:16,576
Did he have a good night?
Did he miss me?

73
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:18,245
Come look.

74
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,479
I haven't seen him
since last night.

75
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,402
I think he's aged.

76
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,639
What's this?

77
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,214
Nothing.

78
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,863
Pull out or I'll
not answer for it!

79
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,359
You must show me
how you do that.

80
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:44,128
Have I Your Majesty's permission
to review the facts again?

81
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:46,048
If Port Arthur falls...

82
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:47,938
No fact begins with "if."

83
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:53,791
Port Arthur has been
under siege for six months.

84
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,194
It has cost us 30,000 dead.

85
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:01,474
A student stopped me
in the street the other day.

86
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:04,705
"Excuse me, sir, but why
are we at war?"

87
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:06,725
"Because, my boy, we want Korea...

88
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,894
...but the Japanese will
insist on fighting us for it."

89
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:12,030
"Thank you, sir. But what does
Russia need Korea for?"

90
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:16,225
"Because, my boy, we have
no ice-free port on the Pacific."

91
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:18,725
"I see. In that case, sir,
it isn't good enough."

92
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,294
He's right, sir.

93
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:22,341
It's not good enough at all.

94
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,410
Imagine, sire.

95
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,959
Imagine that you
are a factory worker.

96
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,941
You're really poor.
Your belly is never full.

97
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:34,142
You freeze eight months
of the year.

98
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:37,376
Your children have
no school, no doctor.

99
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,484
Your country taxes you...

100
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,110
...and sends your sons
a continent away...

101
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:46,238
...to die on a piece of land
on the Pacific.

102
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:50,400
Now, sir, Japan is
a third-rate power.

103
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,839
If she defeats us...

104
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:56,287
...if Port Arthur falls...

105
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,878
...we shall be disgraced
in the eyes of the world...

106
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,501
...and here at home we'll have
an insurrection.

107
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:03,591
My people love me,
Sergei Julievitch.

108
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:06,307
They want a constitution...

109
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:09,732
...and the right to vote
for an elected <i>Duma.</i>

110
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,295
They're angry...

111
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:12,902
...and they're serious.

112
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:14,916
Are you advising me to
give my rights away?

113
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,399
I am advising you to
stop a hopeless war.

114
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:21,667
Is it so hopeless, Nikolasha?

115
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:23,390
Well, Nicky...

116
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,414
...let me put it this way.

117
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,990
Here's a bullet, a bullet
made in St. Petersburg.

118
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,879
I send it off to war.

119
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,420
How does it get there?

120
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,557
On a single spur of track...

121
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,767
...4000 miles long.

122
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,974
And in the middle,
no track at all.

123
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:44,002
God help it, it spends
three days packed on sleds.

124
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:48,315
And every boot, shell or
pound of tea we send.

125
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:51,041
Get out now, Nicky...

126
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,442
...while there's time.

127
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,388
The Russia my father
gave me never lost a war.

128
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,966
What shall I say to my son
when the time comes?

129
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,690
That I had no pride?

130
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:04,294
That I was weak?

131
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,620
I've always thought...

132
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,207
...God meant me to rule.

133
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,286
He put me here.

134
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,942
He chose me, and whatever
happens is His will.

135
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:18,942
We shall fight on to victory.

136
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,550
There will be no victory.

137
00:10:20,743 --> 00:10:22,685
Only strikes and riots.

138
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:27,427
You must give your people
a little of what they want, sir.

139
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:28,894
Not all...

140
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,565
...just a taste.

141
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,417
The English have a parliament.

142
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:35,102
Our British cousins
gave their rights away.

143
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,375
The Hapsburgs and
the Hohenzollerns too.

144
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:39,265
The Romanovs will not.

145
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,635
What I was given...

146
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:43,686
...I will give my son.

147
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:50,526
These comrades want a larger movement
that will embrace...

148
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:54,688
...all politically-minded people
who can subscribe to a wider dogma.

149
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,349
They wish to join hands...

150
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,664
Excuse me.

151
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:03,936
May I?

152
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,050
This is my first conference.

153
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,428
- I've been in Siberia.
- So was I.

154
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:25,894
How long?

155
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,225
- I was sentenced to three years.
- So was I.

156
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:30,943
I only stayed for a month.
I made a run for it.

157
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,174
He wants to introduce himself.

158
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:37,087
Stalin.

159
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:39,906
I've inquired about you.

160
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,297
Trotsky.

161
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:50,465
You've been avoiding me.

162
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:52,736
How are you going to vote?

163
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,359
- Against your motion.
- You're a fool!

164
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,541
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:59,204
I can't always do what you tell me.

166
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:04,035
The Romanovs are crowing over
their new heir and the Party's a mess.

167
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,659
- I'll win in spite of you.
- You'll split the Party.

168
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:07,967
I intend to.

169
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,789
It needs it.

170
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,742
Martov, will you vote for me?

171
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:15,106
No, against.

172
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,185
Come on, Martov.

173
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:23,329
He doesn't realize what you're doing.
I'm sure you're right.

174
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:25,792
Good.

175
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:28,325
So you're going to vote for me?

176
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:32,323
I would, but I'm not a delegate.
I can't vote.

177
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:37,987
Mr. Lenin.

178
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,937
Excuse me, Mr. Lenin.
I'm from the "Socialist Worker."

179
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:47,134
What do you think of
the Socialist movement in England?

180
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:51,263
The English cut their meat wrong.
Their tea is terrible.

181
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:54,430
And the weather was better
in Siberia.

182
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:57,020
But you keep your policemen
under control.

183
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,149
The vote will now be taken.

184
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:02,788
Pay attention.

185
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:05,759
You're about to see
the birth of the Bolshevik Party.

186
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,486
How do you spell that?

187
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,410
I'm going to vote.

188
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,429
Come on, Pankratov.

189
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,490
B-O-L-S...

190
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,245
Good night, Papa.

191
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,267
Good night, Mama.

192
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:28,924
Good night, darlings.

193
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,791
I wish we didn't have to go.

194
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:36,991
- It's Mama's birthday.
- Can't we say I have a headache?

195
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,005
You're just shy.
You're too old for that now.

196
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:23,807
You enjoy yourself at parties.

197
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,476
I get headaches.

198
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:30,852
If you sat there knowing everyone
disliked you, feeling like a foreigner...

199
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:33,283
- No one dislikes you.
- Yes, they do.

200
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:36,543
You never see unpleasant things.

201
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,336
You drift away.

202
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:41,253
I wonder if you
hear me half the time.

203
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,902
Just now I find you
all too audible.

204
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,478
Guess what?

205
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,013
You've got your headache.

206
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,038
Mother, dear.

207
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:22,302
Not even London on a Sunday is as boring
as a room full of Romanovs.

208
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:24,357
We see them rarely, Mama.

209
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,941
You see everyone rarely.

210
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,761
We'd see more of you
if you traveled less.

211
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,504
Witte had tea with me today.

212
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,197
He talked about the war,
like everyone else.

213
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:48,220
He ate all my sturgeon, but he
never stopped talking, clever man!

214
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,790
- He thinks...
- I know what he thinks.

215
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,551
He thinks we can't afford wars.

216
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,961
It's too ambitious.

217
00:15:53,158 --> 00:15:56,955
We're an 18th century country
in a 20th century world.

218
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:59,973
We need all our strength and money
to look after Russia.

219
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,982
Don't waste it on those little
yellow Buddhists, or whatever they are.

220
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:07,809
It's a great mistake to get involved
in all these strikes and wars.

221
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,533
You only encourage them
by taking them seriously.

222
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:13,345
- Your father always said...
- Thank you for your kind advice.

223
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:14,972
I haven't finished yet, Nicky.

224
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:19,108
I know I'm not as clever as I
pretend to be, but I'm sure of this:

225
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:21,343
Get out of Korea
and forget about Japan.

226
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:22,721
I'm 36.

227
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:24,989
You must let me
look after this war.

228
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,300
I'm going to see
if Sunny is all right.

229
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:36,251
And I suppose everyone
will be expecting me to dance.

230
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,494
Well, I mustrt disappoint them.

231
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,870
I hope it's not too cold for you.

232
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,968
Can I get you some champagne?

233
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,476
Thank you.

234
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,220
Look. There's this fantastic
holy fellow just arrived.

235
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,005
You must meet him.

236
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,694
He's a live, authentic <i>starets,</i>
straight from the fields.

237
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,604
Cures diseases by
the laying on of hands.

238
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,213
I've seen him do it.

239
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:08,831
Saw this fellow wheeled in...

240
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,169
...legs like pretzels.

241
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:12,381
Then the <i>starets...</i>

242
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:15,389
...Gregory Rasputin is his name...

243
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,660
...gave him a deep look...

244
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:18,941
...touched him...

245
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:20,703
...prayed a bit...

246
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:24,868
...and up the pretzel popped
and skipped about the room.

247
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:27,462
A bit grotesquely, I admit...

248
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:29,629
...but you could tell
he was skipping.

249
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,413
I'll send for him.

250
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,679
Must you?

251
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,759
<i>Batushka Tsar.</i>

252
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:04,451
<i>Matushka.</i>

253
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:08,125
Why are you afraid?

254
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:10,790
Why am I what?

255
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,547
I think you're frightened.

256
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,268
Strangers frighten you.

257
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,598
I knew a woman in Prokorvskoe...

258
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:26,046
...that's my home,
a little village in Siberia.

259
00:18:26,502 --> 00:18:27,779
And this woman...

260
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,211
...she was so afraid of strangers...

261
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:33,505
...that she bought herself
a pinewood box and lived in it.

262
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,000
Then one day...

263
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:38,365
...her husband nailed the lid on...

264
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:39,842
...dug a hole...

265
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,413
...and dropped her into it.

266
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,548
"Ivan, don't!" she cried.

267
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:46,692
"But I only want to
make you happy," he said.

268
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:50,978
"I know. But Heavers
full of strangers. Let me out!"

269
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:11,909
Damned barn of a place.

270
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:13,728
Like an icehouse.

271
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,547
Never could stand marble.

272
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,365
It gives you rheumatism.

273
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:20,672
Have a drink.

274
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,037
Quite right.

275
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,725
Have some of this vodka.

276
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,662
Keep you warm.

277
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:34,653
You know, I want to sell
this place or give it away.

278
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:37,189
But no one will be
fool enough to take it.

279
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,342
God bless.

280
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,966
I started late to be a <i>starets.</i>

281
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:50,214
I was 20 when
this vision came.

282
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,574
We peasants get
them all the time.

283
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:55,810
The Virgin comes and tells them...

284
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:58,341
...when to sell their sheep
if they want to make a profit.

285
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,442
She told me to become a pilgrim.

286
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,229
So I started to walk.

287
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:07,294
I waited for her to tell me
when to stop, but she didn't.

288
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:09,789
I walked 2000 miles...

289
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:11,740
...and when I got to Greece...

290
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,731
...I couldn't walk any further.
So I stopped.

291
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:17,500
I spent two years
in a monastery...

292
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:19,361
...and then I walked home again.

293
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,828
Sometimes people say to me...

294
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:24,763
..."What do I need
to become a <i>starets</i>?"

295
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,592
And I say, "Good feet."

296
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:31,808
Father Gregory...

297
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,668
...do you have visions?

298
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:35,839
Sometimes.

299
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:38,366
Why does God send them to you?

300
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:40,767
God knows. I don't.

301
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:43,010
I used to be a Lutheran.

302
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,897
They take God very seriously.

303
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:47,036
I take Him as
He comes, <i>Matushka.</i>

304
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:48,896
When it pleases Him, He uses me.

305
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,551
You mean He actually appears?

306
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,612
You see Him?

307
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,530
What's a vision like?

308
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,151
Sometimes it's voices.

309
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:00,192
Other times, I'm not sure
what I see.

310
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,659
I know exactly what you mean.

311
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,872
It happens to me sometimes
when I pray...

312
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:10,149
...especially late at night.

313
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:13,574
The candles flicker
and it's dark...

314
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:17,789
...and out of the corner
of my eye, I think I see...

315
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,545
I don't know what.

316
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,134
And when I turn
to look, it's gone.

317
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:31,905
You missed the ballet.
It was lovely.

318
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:34,080
We can leave now, if you like.

319
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:35,456
Already?

320
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,212
But we haven't danced yet.

321
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,341
May I say something intimate?

322
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:08,320
In public?

323
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:09,696
I'll whisper it.

324
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,809
Well, if you must.

325
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,717
I adore you.

326
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,956
I had such a lovely time.

327
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:37,029
And Father Gregory, I thought
he was delightful, didn't you?

328
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,978
An interesting fellow, I suppose.

329
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,630
They tell me in Siberia
the woods are full of them.

330
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,988
The Tsarevitch's bruise
worried me.

331
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,783
I made some tests.

332
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,406
I wasn't sure.
I'm not a specialist.

333
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,061
But I'm afraid
these gentleman concur.

334
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:22,913
There is no doubt of it?

335
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:25,788
No doubt of any kind?

336
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,743
It is unquestionably hemophilia.

337
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,404
I see.

338
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:35,589
Excuse me, but it
takes a moment to absorb.

339
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,355
And what's the treatment?

340
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:40,994
Nothing, sire.

341
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,678
That's not possible.
There must be medicines.

342
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,012
There are no medicines.

343
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,153
Nothing at all?

344
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,226
I see.

345
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:53,504
The female is the carrier.

346
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:55,393
The mother gives
it to the son.

347
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,695
Your mother got it
from her mother, Queen Victoria...

348
00:23:58,054 --> 00:23:59,679
...and passed it on to you.

349
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:02,591
It strikes some males
and misses others.

350
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,863
Of Victoria's four sons,
just one had hemophilia.

351
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,170
And just one of mine.

352
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:09,180
Some hemophiliacs grow up to lead...

353
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,971
...quite long and normal lives.

354
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:12,222
And some do not.

355
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:14,949
The chemical that makes
the blood clot is missing.

356
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:17,444
When he cuts himself,
he bleeds extensively.

357
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:19,842
Then we'll see to it that Alexis
does not cut himself.

358
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:21,826
It's more than that.
A surface wound...

359
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:23,037
Let me.

360
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:27,584
They tell me cuts
don't matter much.

361
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,326
They tell me if Alexis cuts
his hand, they tie it very tight...

362
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:33,860
...and after a little while
the bleeding stops.

363
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:35,134
It's when he bleeds inside...

364
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:36,130
Inside?

365
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,660
They tell me any bump
can make him bleed inside.

366
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:39,803
One never knows.

367
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:42,082
An awful blow may
do no harm at all...

368
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:44,667
...and then again,
a tiny tap and it begins.

369
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,543
They tell me the blood seeps slowly,
sometimes going on for days.

370
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:51,775
They tell me the area begins to swell,
fills up like a balloon...

371
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:54,523
...until the pressure is
so great the bleeding stops.

372
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,344
Then, while the swelling lasts,
the blood attacks the bone...

373
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,030
It can leave a limb
all bent and twisted.

374
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:02,661
While this is going on,
there's nothing they can do.

375
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,862
That's what they tell me.

376
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,106
Tell them...

377
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:11,970
Tell them they are mistaken.

378
00:25:12,998 --> 00:25:15,387
Tell them we shall
go to other doctors.

379
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,274
Tell them to get out.

380
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,405
My son is perfect.

381
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,908
He will have a long life...

382
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:26,338
...and grow up
to be a great Tsar...

383
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:27,875
...like his father.

384
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,347
More troops! He's going to
send more men to die!

385
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:37,728
Port Arthur falls and
Nicholas is sending more men!

386
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:40,322
I say we students...

387
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:41,987
...lead the way!

388
00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:45,955
I say we give him
a Port Arthur here!

389
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:47,875
I say we mobilize...

390
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,789
They're coming for us!

391
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,905
Now, do we run or do we fight?

392
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:53,407
We fight!

393
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:08,449
This way, Father! Hurry!

394
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:22,239
It's all over, Petya.

395
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:23,676
She's dead.

396
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,734
She lived her life
here in this place.

397
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,125
She got married.

398
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:43,196
I was born. Father died.

399
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:45,884
My eldest son is playing...

400
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:47,653
...here in this place...

401
00:26:48,198 --> 00:26:49,856
...and they go on working.

402
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:51,741
Why not? They have to live.

403
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,339
I work when they die.

404
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,261
Let me hold him.

405
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,398
I want to kill somebody.

406
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,804
They come here sometimes...

407
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:14,369
...the other factory workers...

408
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,546
...and they tell us...

409
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:19,269
...that we should
burn things down.

410
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:21,505
Make bombs.

411
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:26,213
Well, I want to fight back...

412
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:27,424
...once!

413
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:31,715
All violence begets is violence.
They'll beat you.

414
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,982
There's a better way.

415
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:36,444
We are going to see the Tsar.

416
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:38,885
You know what they say, Father:

417
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:41,823
God is too high
and the Tsar's too far away.

418
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:44,708
The Tsar is here in Petersburg
to bless the troops.

419
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:46,720
He's staying at the Winter Palace.

420
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:49,500
Thousands of us will march
there on Sunday morning.

421
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:51,964
I'll go to him on the balcony...

422
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,300
...and read this:

423
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,651
"Sire...

424
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:58,461
...we working men and
inabitants of St. Petersburg...

425
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:00,348
...come to you, sire,
to seek...

426
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,361
...for truth, justice
and protection.

427
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,147
Only you can
hear our prayers.

428
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:07,843
And if you do not...

429
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:09,213
...we shall die...

430
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:11,685
...here on this square...

431
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,827
...before your palace."

432
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:30,306
God is with you.

433
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,606
St. George will guard you.

434
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:43,523
St. George will guard you.

435
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:44,772
<i>Batushka Tsar.</i>

436
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:49,602
Come on, my friend.

437
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,005
Stand up.

438
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:04,863
It's beautiful to watch them.

439
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:05,984
Bless you.

440
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:20,096
We must get back
to Tsarkoe Selo.

441
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:24,895
I've ordered the train already
and I'll cancel all the engagements.

442
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:26,182
Vladimir, what is it?

443
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:28,927
A message from Botkin.

444
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,420
The Tsarevitch is bleeding.

445
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:32,741
Oh, my God!

446
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:38,077
How long before
our train comes?

447
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:39,806
I don't know.

448
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,218
Perhaps half an hour.

449
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:42,562
I want to go.

450
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:44,290
We will. We will.

451
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:46,140
Now! Nicky, take me home.

452
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:47,931
The trairs the fastest way.
We must wait.

453
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:50,945
I can't! My baby's bleeding.
I'm in Petersburg.

454
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,796
He needs me. Half an hour!

455
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:54,398
God, save my little boy!

456
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:55,685
Sunny, stop!

457
00:29:56,037 --> 00:29:58,372
Take me away.
I want my baby. Let me go!

458
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,095
You bless them.

459
00:30:00,454 --> 00:30:02,461
Think of the soldiers.
Think of the war, the weather.

460
00:30:02,822 --> 00:30:04,316
Think of anything,
but not baby.

461
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,822
I can't!

462
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,130
Do it.

463
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:14,782
God is good.

464
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:18,275
Believe in His mercy.

465
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:20,929
He will not punish
the pure in heart.

466
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,563
Believe in His mercy.

467
00:32:00,006 --> 00:32:00,954
Well...

468
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,330
What if the bleeding
doesn't stop?

469
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:05,277
It must.

470
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,095
Botkin doesn't
think Alexis will...

471
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:11,137
Die.

472
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:12,477
Thank God.

473
00:32:12,838 --> 00:32:14,082
It isn't much to
thank Him for.

474
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:15,103
Botkin said...

475
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:17,851
What do doctors know?
They're useless.

476
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:20,675
It's in God's hands.

477
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,135
Submit, submit!

478
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:24,671
You should have been a monk.

479
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,979
Won't you ever fight?

480
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:27,324
I can't fight you.

481
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:28,926
My baby's dying.

482
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,448
There are no medicines.
Christ Jesus!

483
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:35,484
Don't come near me.

484
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,335
<i>Matushka.</i>

485
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:09,151
I can't seem to
get them right.

486
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:12,160
<i>Matushka,</i> tell me what it is.

487
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:15,679
I keep thinking
the arrangement matters.

488
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,459
I can't even remember
which saints they are.

489
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:21,189
It doesn't matter.
They know you.

490
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:23,749
I knew all their names once.

491
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:25,090
I had to.

492
00:33:26,021 --> 00:33:28,672
To marry Nicky,
I had to change my faith.

493
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,939
That was a great sin,
don't you think?

494
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,545
God thinks so.

495
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,494
He won't hear me when I pray.

496
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:35,650
I've sinned...

497
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,347
...and he won't listen.

498
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:39,556
All saints were sinners once.

499
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,797
God loves sinners.

500
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:45,089
Then why is he killing my baby?

501
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:48,766
We had a man in Prokorvskoe.

502
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,980
He didn't wash or work.

503
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:54,562
He lied, stole, cheated, drank...

504
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:56,292
...chased all the women.

505
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:57,987
He was a sinner.

506
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:01,440
Why, out of all men,
did the Virgin come to him?

507
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:04,860
Perhaps he lied.

508
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:06,716
You said he was a liar.

509
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:09,444
She came.

510
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:11,459
I saw her.

511
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,786
I know all there is
to know about sin.

512
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,691
Pray with me, <i>Matushka.</i>

513
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,620
God is here.

514
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:24,002
I can't.

515
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:26,789
That's my punishment.

516
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,300
I shouldn't have sent for you.

517
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,352
I don't know you at all.

518
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:34,907
If baby wakes, he'll need me.

519
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,195
Goodbye.

520
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:40,414
The child will die...

521
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:44,259
...if you don't get down on
your knees and beg for his life...

522
00:34:44,613 --> 00:34:47,810
...like a peasant begging
for crusts at your door.

523
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:50,529
You will be taken
back to St. Petersburg.

524
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:51,933
Wait outside.

525
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:54,268
I knew you were
going to send for me.

526
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,728
I knew the child was sick.
I know what's the matter with him.

527
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:00,954
You can't!

528
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:04,067
I see blood when
I shut my eyes.

529
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:06,269
A lot of blood.

530
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:09,285
I saw blood once before...

531
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:11,296
...when I was in Jerusalem.

532
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,693
And then my father died.

533
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:18,849
In Kazan, there's an
ivory Christ, and the wounds bleed.

534
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:23,871
Someone told me there's a Madonna
in Kharkov that sheds real tears.

535
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:26,783
<i>Matushka.</i>

536
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:28,606
I see things.

537
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,466
I have power!

538
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,961
I cure the sick.

539
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:37,184
Holy men kneel to me
and kiss my hands.

540
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,517
I am a vessel of the Lord.

541
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:42,460
I have spoken with God.

542
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:44,452
It must be so.

543
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:46,661
How else can I
do these things?

544
00:35:47,013 --> 00:35:49,217
I save souls and bring peace.

545
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,484
God leads me.

546
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,120
He brought me here.

547
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:55,004
He speaks through me.

548
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,438
I am the voice of God.

549
00:35:57,798 --> 00:35:59,140
It is His will.

550
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:02,559
<i>I have been sent</i>
<i>to do great things.</i>

551
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:17,156
Your Majesty.

552
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:18,621
Baby's better.

553
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:20,126
Go back!

554
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:21,889
Stop!

555
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:24,482
We come in peace!

556
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:26,940
We come to see our Tsar!

557
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:30,049
We come in peace!

558
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:32,030
Go back!

559
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:35,553
We come to see our father!
Peace! Peace!

560
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:39,428
High angle!

561
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:43,420
Fire!

562
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,087
Slaughtered like cattle!

563
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,587
He didn't come.

564
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:26,719
He never came.

565
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:31,076
Nicholas, the murderer.

566
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:35,236
The bloody, bloody murderer.

567
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:46,595
Mama!

568
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:03,808
- Why wasn't I told?
- Your Majesty.

569
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,275
Who gave the order?
How did it happen?

570
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:08,225
- Why wasn't I told?
- As I understand it...

571
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:09,730
How many dead?
Who ordered the shooting?

572
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:13,085
Hundreds of bodies.
Nobody ordered it.

573
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,746
Someone's responsible.
You run this government.

574
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:19,772
This came last night.

575
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:21,825
It reads:

576
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:23,515
"Sire, we working men..."

577
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:26,271
Answer me!
How many were killed?

578
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:28,542
I don't know yet,
certainly hundreds.

579
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,203
Why wasn't I told
they were marching?

580
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:33,182
- Would you have met them?
- How could I?

581
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:34,875
Would you have
given them a Duma?

582
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:36,222
Elections? Schools?

583
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,653
Why bother to inform you?
You wouldn't have done anything!

584
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:41,117
- I want a good life for my people.
- On your terms.

585
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:43,204
I know what will
make them happy.

586
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:46,496
They're children and they need a Tsar.
They need tradition, not this.

587
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,826
They're the victims of agitators.

588
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,096
A Duma would make them
bewildered and discontented.

589
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:54,208
And don't tell me
about London and Berlin!

590
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:55,550
God save us from
the mess they're in.

591
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:57,218
I see.

592
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:00,993
So, they talk, pray, march, plead...

593
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:05,117
...petition and what do they get?
Cossacks, prison, flogging, police!

594
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:07,422
And now, after today,
they will be shot!

595
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:09,377
Is this God's will?

596
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:11,324
Are these His methods?

597
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,274
Make war on
your own people.

598
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:16,379
How long do you think they'll
stand and let you shoot them?

599
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:18,817
You ask me who's responsible!

600
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,736
You ask!

601
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:24,098
Russia will explode!
A massacre in Petersburg!

602
00:41:24,517 --> 00:41:27,168
Now the Japanese have forced Nicholas
to accept peace on their terms.

603
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:29,018
He's lost the war!

604
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:31,740
Thousands of soldiers killed,
and all for nothing.

605
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:34,494
This time Nicholas
has destroyed himself.

606
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,417
I'm going to Petersburg!

607
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:39,395
But you'll need bombs
and explosives and ammunition.

608
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:40,767
They can be smuggled in, Leon.

609
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,820
For God's sake, don't
discuss that with her!

610
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:45,217
She probably thinks you can
wheel machine guns...

611
00:41:45,413 --> 00:41:47,421
...across the frontier
in a baby carriage.

612
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,020
Who wrote this
extraordinary rubbish?

613
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,092
You're not going to print it?

614
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,717
I was going to speak
to you about it first.

615
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,925
This must be some of
your nonsense, Trotsky.

616
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,203
"Lenirs theory comes to this:

617
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,252
The Party decides
what the people think.

618
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:03,332
An elite decides
what the Party thinks.

619
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:05,565
The Central Committee decides
what the elite thinks.

620
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,410
And Lenin decides
what they all think."

621
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:11,042
You will print it?

622
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:12,444
I can't.

623
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:14,912
The style's atrocious.

624
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,337
I'll never understand you.

625
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:20,420
You hate anyone who's not your
kind of Bolshevik...

626
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:21,823
...more than you hate the Tsar.

627
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:23,930
No wonder they
call you Robespierre.

628
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,337
Everybody's got to think
like you or they're out.

629
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:29,850
He thinks freedom is something you
write on a wall but don't practice.

630
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:30,947
That's not true.

631
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,532
Of course I agree you're
free to say what you like.

632
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:37,024
You must agree I'm free
to shoot you for saying it.

633
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:39,422
Murder, arson, terror.

634
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:42,430
I'll agree to anything
that gives us power.

635
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:43,709
Power!

636
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,946
And we can't have power
if we compromise.

637
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:48,671
Even though it takes years.

638
00:42:49,093 --> 00:42:51,198
Terror and power!

639
00:43:33,669 --> 00:43:34,596
Be careful!

640
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,033
Are you all right, Alexei?

641
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:39,166
Alexei, Alexei, mustrt run
and mustrt play!

642
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:40,641
Mustrt jump and mustrt climb.

643
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:42,331
Must be careful all the time.

644
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:47,521
You must try to understand.

645
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:49,595
Your mother worries.

646
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:51,204
We both do.

647
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:54,497
Alexei, Alexei, mustrt run...

648
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:56,671
...and mustrt play!
Mustrt jump and mustrt climb.

649
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:58,462
Must be careful all the time.

650
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:00,063
I found some mushrooms.

651
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:03,577
Father wouldn't let me pick them.
He said they were poisonous.

652
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:06,623
They were green.
I'm hungry.

653
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:10,653
All you ever serve
is bread and butter.

654
00:44:10,853 --> 00:44:12,030
It's tradition.

655
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:14,240
I'll do better in the kitchen.

656
00:44:14,437 --> 00:44:17,371
Nagorny, don't let him
run too fast!

657
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:20,353
He's always happy here at Livadia.

658
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:21,793
The Crimea's good for him.

659
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,266
It's good for all of us.

660
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,534
- Some tea?
- One cup.

661
00:44:26,244 --> 00:44:28,928
Before Stolypin comes,
I'd like to play a little tennis.

662
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,619
We have so few days here.

663
00:44:30,821 --> 00:44:32,544
Can't your ministers
leave us alone?

664
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:33,668
You used to like him.

665
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:35,775
For my sake, be as
gracious as you can.

666
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:38,370
He's not a good man.
He's against us.

667
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,695
Nonsense.
He's a great prime minister.

668
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,475
I sent Father Gregory
to see him.

669
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,510
You sent Rasputin?

670
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:50,524
What in God's name for?

671
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:53,469
Our friend reads
people's hearts.

672
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:56,090
He knows who loves us
and who doesn't.

673
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,089
He can tell.

674
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:59,679
Stolypin is a bad man.

675
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,751
In future, may I ask you, please...

676
00:45:04,357 --> 00:45:06,975
I don't care if he
talks to God or not...

677
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,350
...Rasputin is a peasant!

678
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:11,776
Is my judgment so inadequate?

679
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,524
Am I too dense to tell
a statesman when I see one?

680
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:15,619
What on earth...

681
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:27,585
Stolypin, you look terrible.
Here's what we'll do.

682
00:45:38,597 --> 00:45:39,972
Peter Arkadiavitch!

683
00:45:40,229 --> 00:45:42,465
Only you could wear a briefcase
with a bathing suit.

684
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:45,029
I think I'd feel
naked without it.

685
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,555
Besides, I must have
somewhere to put my lifebelt.

686
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,715
What you've done for Russia since
Witte's retirement is a miracle.

687
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:06,876
Or a mirage.
Russia's too large.

688
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,932
It's impossible to govern.

689
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,747
I'm not what holds it
all together.

690
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:11,996
You are.

691
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:15,231
Which is why the Tercentenary
next month is so important to us.

692
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,660
Final schedule is pending
your approval.

693
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:20,419
I'm afraid the tour
is long and taxing.

694
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,336
But it's critical
that people...

695
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,769
...feel the dynasty is
permanent and strong.

696
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:27,552
Three hundred years of Romanovs.

697
00:46:28,164 --> 00:46:29,790
That fact is vital to us.

698
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:32,035
- It implies, first of all...
- Come on, Peter.

699
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:33,505
Out with it.

700
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:35,963
We leave for Petersburg tomorrow.

701
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:38,783
What's so urgent that it
brings you all this way?

702
00:46:40,709 --> 00:46:42,651
One finds these everywhere.

703
00:46:43,461 --> 00:46:45,217
All over Petersburg.

704
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:47,514
The printing is poor...

705
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,091
...but the thought is clear.

706
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:52,574
What's wrong with the Okrana?

707
00:46:52,932 --> 00:46:56,281
Can't 10,000 secret agents
find a printing press?

708
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:58,910
They can't find all of them.

709
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:00,606
I want it stopped.

710
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:03,139
It's too late. They plan to
debate it in the <i>Duma.</i>

711
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,542
Damn the <i>Duma</i>!

712
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:05,821
Witte's work.

713
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,809
He made me give it
to the people.

714
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:10,239
Close it. Shut it down.

715
00:47:10,437 --> 00:47:12,673
I don't like the <i>Duma</i>
any more than you do.

716
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:16,096
But I'd rather they talk
than riot, strike and march.

717
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,180
Better to give them
more power than face that.

718
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:19,234
I am the Tsar.

719
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:22,366
And I would never accept that.

720
00:47:25,253 --> 00:47:26,715
Police reports...

721
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:29,250
...on Gregory Efimovitch Rasputin.

722
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:30,975
Drunk half the time.

723
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:32,733
Whores, generals' wives...

724
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,656
He's generous with himself.
I'll say that.

725
00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:36,800
That's his only Christian virtue.

726
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:40,095
He'll sleep with anyone.
It's no secret, everybody knows it.

727
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:42,523
He came to see me.

728
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:44,350
Apparently with
Her Majesty's blessing.

729
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:46,432
He even tried to hypnotize me.

730
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:48,222
Why is such a man
admitted to the palace?

731
00:47:48,421 --> 00:47:50,460
- You know why.
- Your people don't.

732
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,090
I'll tell them, shall I?

733
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:56,067
Citizens, your Tsarevitch could
get a bloody nose and die from it.

734
00:47:56,357 --> 00:47:58,211
You must send him
away from Petersburg.

735
00:47:58,404 --> 00:47:59,298
How can I?

736
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:01,216
People think he violates
your daughters and wife!

737
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:04,771
Get him out! I can't control
the situation if you don't.

738
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,307
And if I do?

739
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,296
What happens if...

740
00:48:33,284 --> 00:48:34,364
Your Highness!

741
00:48:34,565 --> 00:48:36,420
It's all right, Nagorny.

742
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,137
You'll always save me.

743
00:48:46,149 --> 00:48:48,124
It's all Nagorny's fault.

744
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:51,008
Botkin warned us Alexis
would behave like this.

745
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:53,659
It's a typical reaction.
It's even got a name.

746
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,355
I don't care.

747
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:57,859
A sailor for a nurse.

748
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,838
It's an absurd idea.

749
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,311
It's mine.

750
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:14,978
I still say Alexei needs a nurse.

751
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:16,831
He needs the company of men.

752
00:49:17,028 --> 00:49:17,956
Does he?

753
00:49:18,148 --> 00:49:21,312
He's with you all day long.
You hardly ever come to meals.

754
00:49:22,405 --> 00:49:23,965
I never seem to see you anymore.

755
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:28,058
My place is where I'm needed most.

756
00:49:28,773 --> 00:49:31,740
It must be hard to have
so many people need you.

757
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:33,634
I'll be patient.

758
00:49:34,501 --> 00:49:35,679
If I wait, my turn will come.

759
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:42,339
What a mess I make of things.

760
00:49:43,493 --> 00:49:45,598
I meant to look so nice for you.

761
00:49:46,117 --> 00:49:48,932
I meant our last night in Livadia
to be beautiful.

762
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,699
Sometimes I wonder
how you live with me.

763
00:50:05,988 --> 00:50:07,549
I wonder too.

764
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:10,528
Only I know I could never
live without you.

765
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,475
My decision stands.

766
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,479
I've seen you out of courtesy.

767
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:32,317
- Lf you've come here to plead...
- I came to say goodbye.

768
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:34,076
I'm going home.

769
00:50:36,037 --> 00:50:38,208
I don't like St. Petersburg.

770
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:40,799
It makes me drink too much.

771
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:42,623
And when I drink...

772
00:50:43,813 --> 00:50:45,220
...the women come.

773
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,730
The women here are worse
than the peasants in my village.

774
00:50:50,085 --> 00:50:51,841
They've no restraint.

775
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,158
Is <i>Matushka</i> angry with me?

776
00:50:57,444 --> 00:51:00,444
She won't admit you even
take a drink, much less...

777
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:02,497
No.

778
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:05,120
She believes in you completely.

779
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:06,745
She is a saint.

780
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:09,854
<i>Matushka...</i>

781
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,869
...if you need me
while I am gone...

782
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,760
...pretend I'm with you.

783
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:17,305
Say the things that trouble you,
as you always do, and it will help.

784
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:20,000
I only sit and listen anyway.

785
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:23,266
The voice of God is in you...

786
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:25,659
...and no harm will come.

787
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:41,466
It was necessary.

788
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:42,882
Why?

789
00:51:43,524 --> 00:51:44,899
Stolypin recommended it.

790
00:51:45,092 --> 00:51:46,816
Our friend warned me he was bad.

791
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:50,176
Rasputin drinks, takes bribes.
He is an adulterer.

792
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:51,387
He is a saint.

793
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:52,766
Little men always abuse them.

794
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,306
I can show you
the police reports.

795
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:55,329
More little men.

796
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:56,953
People say he sleeps with you.

797
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,465
What do I care
what people think?

798
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,838
I have to care!

799
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:01,345
I want him.

800
00:52:01,573 --> 00:52:02,882
- Bring him back.
- I can't.

801
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,735
- Can't you do anything?
- I am.

802
00:52:04,932 --> 00:52:06,820
I'm standing up to you for once.

803
00:52:07,012 --> 00:52:08,441
Who's going to save Alexei?

804
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:09,593
We have doctors.

805
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:11,258
Damn your doctors!
What about my son?

806
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,835
I've other important things
to answer for.

807
00:52:13,028 --> 00:52:15,101
I don't.
Give me Rasputin back!

808
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:16,480
No, I will not.

809
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:17,917
If baby dies, you murdered him!

810
00:52:18,276 --> 00:52:19,356
I didn't give him hemophilia.

811
00:52:19,717 --> 00:52:20,764
Murderer!

812
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,711
- I'll never forgive you.
- You gave it to him! It was you!

813
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:26,207
Don't you think I know it?

814
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:33,123
When I see him bleed...

815
00:52:34,373 --> 00:52:35,900
...I think I did it...

816
00:52:36,676 --> 00:52:38,815
...as if I'd put a knife in him.

817
00:52:40,229 --> 00:52:42,334
I've tried to make up for it.

818
00:52:43,652 --> 00:52:47,482
I've seen so many specialists
and doctors and surgeons.

819
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,075
Sometimes I did not tell you.

820
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:53,279
I know most of them
were quacks...

821
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,347
...but I still tried.

822
00:52:58,404 --> 00:53:01,023
I have spent nights
on my knees...

823
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:02,243
...praying.

824
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:06,367
And Rasputirs the only one...

825
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:09,245
...who has helped me
bear my punishment.

826
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:15,293
That's why I cling to this
common peasant from Siberia.

827
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:19,965
They laugh at me
in the streets.

828
00:53:20,484 --> 00:53:22,721
You have turned against me.

829
00:53:24,389 --> 00:53:26,243
But I cannot help it.

830
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:28,221
It's me.

831
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,582
Whatever happens, I deserve it.

832
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:33,792
It's my punishment.

833
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:35,870
It's mine.

834
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,967
Stalirs been sentenced
to Siberia again.

835
00:53:44,228 --> 00:53:45,156
What else?

836
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:49,788
The Okrana's infiltrated
our cells in Moscow.

837
00:53:51,748 --> 00:53:54,431
They found all our
explosives in Minsk.

838
00:53:54,628 --> 00:53:55,872
Perhaps I should
go back to Petersburg.

839
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:58,141
You didn't do
much good last time.

840
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:00,322
What else is happening?

841
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:03,964
Not much. Not since Rasputin
went back to Siberia.

842
00:54:04,164 --> 00:54:05,211
Yes, it's a pity.

843
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,103
He can't cause
much trouble there.

844
00:54:07,428 --> 00:54:10,690
He was won'th more than an army
of Bolsheviks in Petersburg.

845
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:14,110
They've arrested
Sverdilov in Kiev.

846
00:54:16,037 --> 00:54:17,498
Spies everywhere.

847
00:54:18,276 --> 00:54:19,902
No one trusts anyone.

848
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:25,502
Some of our party leaders
work for the Okrana.

849
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,585
I see you were in the Minsk group
when it was raided.

850
00:54:35,812 --> 00:54:36,957
You got away?

851
00:54:37,828 --> 00:54:39,257
I managed to hide.

852
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:41,313
And all the others
were caught?

853
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,729
You got somewhere to live?

854
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:47,808
Not five minutes away from here.

855
00:54:49,092 --> 00:54:50,019
Good.

856
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:52,218
Thank you for bringing the message.

857
00:54:52,644 --> 00:54:54,335
Come and see us again soon.

858
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:55,803
And don't drink.

859
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,557
Too many of our men
take to drink in Paris.

860
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,004
If Sverdilov's been arrested...

861
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:05,371
He's a double agent.

862
00:55:05,988 --> 00:55:07,199
He works for the Okrana.

863
00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:13,922
Go home.

864
00:55:14,116 --> 00:55:15,643
I don't feel like
talking tonight.

865
00:55:15,844 --> 00:55:17,306
I've got nothing to say.

866
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:29,592
We've got old.

867
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:31,963
They've gone?

868
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,667
I'll get your supper.

869
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,129
That's all right.
There's no hurry.

870
00:55:37,444 --> 00:55:40,062
In the last ten years,
I've spent...

871
00:55:41,348 --> 00:55:42,974
...three months in Russia.

872
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:48,058
I'm out of fashion.

873
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,388
No one's wearing me this year.

874
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:53,627
I talk...

875
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:56,121
...and no one listens.
I write...

876
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:58,174
...and no one reads.

877
00:56:00,452 --> 00:56:03,322
Think what we'll be like
in 10 or 15 years.

878
00:56:04,388 --> 00:56:07,039
Emigrs go off their heads
in the end, you know.

879
00:56:09,988 --> 00:56:13,370
Mad, old cranks with no money,
no country...

880
00:56:13,572 --> 00:56:15,743
...always worrying
about the laundry...

881
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,241
...complaining when
the mail's late.

882
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:21,499
Being ill in charity hospitals
and buried with the paupers.

883
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,260
No, Ilyich.

884
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:25,403
It won't be like that.

885
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:27,840
Three hundred years
of Romanovs?

886
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,965
Why not 300 more?

887
00:56:55,876 --> 00:56:58,265
Long live the Romanovs!

888
00:57:01,828 --> 00:57:04,283
Three hundred years!

889
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,343
Come on! Come on!

890
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:47,744
I didn't want to come on this
Tercentenary tour, Peter Arkadiavitch.

891
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,289
But, God help me, I do love it
when they stand and wave.

892
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:47,488
He's shot!

893
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,747
Guards! Guards!
For God's sake, hurry!

894
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:16,833
What's to be done?

895
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,492
Is he dead?

896
00:59:22,756 --> 00:59:23,552
No.

897
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:26,267
There's a lot of blood, pain.

898
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:28,733
The doctors are with him.

899
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:30,520
Good.

900
00:59:33,252 --> 00:59:34,496
He's a good man.

901
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:38,111
They always kill the good men.

902
00:59:38,756 --> 00:59:40,665
The ones who help them most.

903
00:59:41,924 --> 00:59:43,680
They killed my grandfather.

904
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:46,083
He freed the serfs, you know.

905
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:48,961
He helped them.
So they threw a bomb.

906
00:59:51,236 --> 00:59:52,829
Stolypirs a good man.

907
00:59:56,612 --> 00:59:57,986
I can't find a match.

908
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,210
They've got the man
who shot him.

909
01:00:01,412 --> 01:00:02,360
The man?

910
01:00:03,108 --> 01:00:05,115
Some kind of revolutionary.

911
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,027
Damn them all.

912
01:00:10,212 --> 01:00:12,449
You help them and they
kill you for it.

913
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,391
Give them <i>Dumas</i>
and they give you bombs.

914
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,005
I want them paid in kind.

915
01:00:20,068 --> 01:00:21,475
You understand me?

916
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:23,677
I want something done!

917
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:28,604
You bastard!

918
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,496
This is our home!

919
01:00:30,691 --> 01:00:31,585
Not anymore!

920
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,609
We live here!

921
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,918
Arrest him.

922
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:55,421
Tell the Tsar that
he can close this building...

923
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,075
...but the <i>Duma</i> won't be closed.

924
01:01:02,948 --> 01:01:04,377
That's enough, Mr. Kerensky.

925
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,969
No, it's not, Mr. Prime Minister.

926
01:01:07,171 --> 01:01:10,783
You cannot repress this body
and you cannot repress the people.

927
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,347
That's the road to revolution.

928
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:16,414
We're not revolutionaries here.

929
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,802
Most of us want a system
like the British.

930
01:01:20,003 --> 01:01:21,629
Let there be a Tsar...

931
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:24,827
...but let there be a parliament
with rights and powers.

932
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:27,002
We won't be denied,
Mr. Kokovtsov.

933
01:01:27,204 --> 01:01:30,237
This government deplores
brutality and violence.

934
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,224
But when dissent
gets out of hand...

935
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,842
...when opposition ceases
to be peaceful...

936
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:37,761
...law and order
must and will be kept.

937
01:01:37,988 --> 01:01:40,127
Not at this price!

938
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,689
The <i>Duma</i> is not a street corner.

939
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,988
There is no violence here.

940
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,131
But even we are not free to speak.

941
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:48,794
Where is the Tsar?

942
01:01:49,476 --> 01:01:51,516
The Tsar is at the
hunting lodge in Poland.

943
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:54,978
I don't care if he's
in Scotland shooting grouse!

944
01:01:55,364 --> 01:01:58,593
Find him and tell him he's
bringing ruin on his head!

945
01:01:58,788 --> 01:02:00,675
Tell him while there's
still a Tsar to tell!

946
01:02:14,852 --> 01:02:16,128
You all right?

947
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,351
Alexei, Alexei, mustrt run
and mustrt play!

948
01:02:20,772 --> 01:02:23,041
Mustrt jump and mustrt climb.

949
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,264
- You must be more careful.
- It was nothing.

950
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:30,237
I will run away and
be an actress when I grow up.

951
01:02:30,436 --> 01:02:31,484
It's my destiny.

952
01:02:31,844 --> 01:02:35,390
Once you've felt the call
of the stage, you know.

953
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:36,930
It's in your blood.

954
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:42,816
A princess can't be an actress.

955
01:02:43,012 --> 01:02:45,216
You may well say
you want to be a trollop.

956
01:02:45,412 --> 01:02:47,005
What's a trollop?

957
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:49,217
Trollop.
Yes, that sounds nice.

958
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:51,168
Perhaps I'll be a trollop instead.

959
01:02:51,363 --> 01:02:54,146
Monsieur Gilliard,
what's French for trollop?

960
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,257
I'll marry a prince
and have eight children.

961
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:02,361
Ten, if he's really nice.

962
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:04,607
How many will you have, Olga?

963
01:03:04,803 --> 01:03:06,429
What's the use in daydreaming?

964
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,202
I should like to be a teacher
when I grow up.

965
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:13,251
Teaching is such a noble profession.

966
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:16,671
That's Monsieur Gilliard!

967
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,707
Do you think I've caught his eyes?

968
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:21,249
Monsieur Gilliard...

969
01:03:21,604 --> 01:03:25,466
...how do you say smouldering
in French?

970
01:03:29,444 --> 01:03:30,938
You silly, stupid child!

971
01:03:48,772 --> 01:03:49,786
Think of it.

972
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:53,627
Russian princesses performing
an English play in French...

973
01:03:53,828 --> 01:03:55,770
...for an audience
of Polish nobles.

974
01:03:56,452 --> 01:03:58,394
I hope somebody understands it.

975
01:03:59,684 --> 01:04:01,571
At least we have
the day to ourselves.

976
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:02,849
Mother...

977
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,384
...I'm bleeding.

978
01:04:04,836 --> 01:04:05,948
Dear God!

979
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:10,681
How far is it back to Spala?

980
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:11,939
Two or three miles.

981
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,335
As fast as you can go!

982
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,481
Well?

983
01:04:45,892 --> 01:04:48,259
It's a most severe attack.

984
01:04:48,644 --> 01:04:50,880
The hemorrhaging
may last for days.

985
01:04:51,652 --> 01:04:54,019
I cabled the specialists
in Petersburg.

986
01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:56,066
They won't reach here
until tomorrow night.

987
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,437
And the pain?

988
01:04:57,635 --> 01:04:59,228
It comes in waves.

989
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,973
His fever's high.
There may be complications.

990
01:05:05,092 --> 01:05:06,979
All we can do
is watch and wait.

991
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:11,007
He will recover, won't he?

992
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,434
He's a strong boy.

993
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,707
He really is, you know.

994
01:05:20,259 --> 01:05:21,786
The swelling...

995
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:23,585
Did you see?

996
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:26,521
I hate this house.

997
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:29,119
Of all the godforsaken places.

998
01:05:32,483 --> 01:05:34,109
Our guests.

999
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:36,543
What shall I say?

1000
01:05:37,443 --> 01:05:39,298
God. I'd forgotten.

1001
01:05:46,531 --> 01:05:48,441
I'm not sure I can manage.

1002
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,024
As long as we are here,
no one will ever know about Alexis.

1003
01:06:44,356 --> 01:06:46,014
I think it's best to wait.

1004
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,792
But if you wait, he may die.

1005
01:06:51,203 --> 01:06:53,210
This is the heir
to all the Russias.

1006
01:06:53,731 --> 01:06:56,481
Would you want his body
on your operating table?

1007
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,001
You could not have chosen
a worse time.

1008
01:07:03,204 --> 01:07:05,243
My son, as we sit here,
is with the doctors.

1009
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:07,997
I didn't choose it, sire.
It was forced on me.

1010
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:10,584
I beg Your Majesty
to understand.

1011
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:12,921
Get on with it.

1012
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:15,774
There must, in my opinion,
be a change in policy.

1013
01:07:16,131 --> 01:07:18,587
Two hundred strikers
have been shot at Lena.

1014
01:07:18,788 --> 01:07:21,821
At this rate, we'll soon
have a million workers on strike.

1015
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,645
We can't shoot them all.

1016
01:07:24,132 --> 01:07:26,652
The <i>Duma</i> must be reconvened.

1017
01:07:26,852 --> 01:07:29,437
Just leave your papers.
I'll read them when I can.

1018
01:07:29,636 --> 01:07:31,261
I need some answers now.

1019
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,605
I haven't any now.

1020
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:33,948
Your Majesty, I must insist!

1021
01:07:34,148 --> 01:07:35,457
Stay here, go back to Petersburg.

1022
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,146
I don't care what you do!

1023
01:07:38,115 --> 01:07:40,319
They want their <i>Duma...</i>

1024
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,489
...give it back to them!

1025
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,600
I hope to God they rot in it!

1026
01:07:44,804 --> 01:07:45,632
As for...

1027
01:07:58,948 --> 01:08:00,671
They think it best to wait.

1028
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:02,908
That's all?

1029
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:05,819
What for?

1030
01:08:06,724 --> 01:08:07,836
What are they waiting for?

1031
01:08:09,123 --> 01:08:10,017
Developments.

1032
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:12,128
I see.

1033
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:15,806
And how long will the wait be?

1034
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,529
I want our friend.

1035
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,783
The prime minister's been here.

1036
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:58,238
He says they've shot more strikers.

1037
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:01,152
I can't even remember
how many this time.

1038
01:09:02,212 --> 01:09:04,350
We decided something important.

1039
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:07,004
Oh, yes.

1040
01:09:07,747 --> 01:09:08,729
The <i>Duma.</i>

1041
01:09:10,115 --> 01:09:12,286
I want this message sent now.

1042
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:14,368
I want Father Gregory.

1043
01:09:14,596 --> 01:09:16,735
I was too young
when Father died.

1044
01:09:18,307 --> 01:09:19,900
You were 26.

1045
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:27,324
I want our friend.

1046
01:09:29,348 --> 01:09:32,512
If he's at home and starts tonight,
the trip will take a week.

1047
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:34,082
It's senseless.

1048
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,583
Send it.

1049
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:37,888
A funny thing.

1050
01:09:38,627 --> 01:09:40,056
My son is dying...

1051
01:09:41,251 --> 01:09:43,161
...and I can't cry.

1052
01:09:45,156 --> 01:09:46,912
When your father died...

1053
01:09:47,555 --> 01:09:49,530
...you wept for days.

1054
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,344
You never knew.

1055
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:56,156
I never said...

1056
01:09:56,803 --> 01:09:59,356
...how I felt listening
to you sobbing...

1057
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:03,292
...telling everyone
how afraid you were.

1058
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:06,786
Most men are men at 21.

1059
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,040
You made me so ashamed.

1060
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:13,882
All right.

1061
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:27,192
In the name of the Father...

1062
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:29,112
...and of the Son...

1063
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:31,866
...and of the Holy Ghost...

1064
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,339
...amen.

1065
01:10:40,163 --> 01:10:42,465
"The Tsarevitch has been taken ill.

1066
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:46,653
The heir's condition
is considered to be grave.

1067
01:10:46,852 --> 01:10:49,754
His response to treatment
so far..."

1068
01:10:50,883 --> 01:10:53,731
This one for midday
to announce...

1069
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:55,069
...a severe relapse.

1070
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:56,828
And one...

1071
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,969
...for tomorrow night.

1072
01:10:59,363 --> 01:11:01,436
The final bulletin.

1073
01:11:02,116 --> 01:11:03,163
I see.

1074
01:11:04,836 --> 01:11:06,112
As to the funeral plans...

1075
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,776
For God's sake, Vladimir!

1076
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:10,396
But you need to know.

1077
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,940
The funeral train...

1078
01:11:15,363 --> 01:11:17,599
...will consist of 11...

1079
01:11:17,891 --> 01:11:18,720
...cars.

1080
01:11:20,356 --> 01:11:22,112
You should try to sleep.

1081
01:11:22,307 --> 01:11:23,103
No.

1082
01:11:24,227 --> 01:11:25,918
Some tea, at least.

1083
01:11:28,323 --> 01:11:29,305
It's come!

1084
01:11:29,507 --> 01:11:30,652
He's answered.

1085
01:11:31,043 --> 01:11:31,839
Listen.

1086
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:35,490
"God has seen your tears
and heard your prayers.

1087
01:11:35,683 --> 01:11:36,698
Do not grieve.

1088
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:38,590
The little one will not die.

1089
01:11:39,363 --> 01:11:40,639
Do not let the doctors
bother him.

1090
01:11:41,187 --> 01:11:42,234
Be at peace.

1091
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:45,883
I am leaving immediately
and will be at your side soon."

1092
01:11:47,043 --> 01:11:48,472
He's not to be disturbed.

1093
01:11:48,675 --> 01:11:49,603
I want your promise.

1094
01:11:49,795 --> 01:11:50,591
But, Your Majesty...

1095
01:11:50,787 --> 01:11:52,314
No more doctors.

1096
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:54,616
I can bar the door if need be.

1097
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,133
I can sleep now.

1098
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:08,447
All is well, my darling.

1099
01:12:18,308 --> 01:12:20,697
Will it make any difference
if Alexis is left alone?

1100
01:12:22,403 --> 01:12:23,864
No, I suppose not.

1101
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:48,962
Alexei likes me best in rubies.

1102
01:12:49,155 --> 01:12:51,065
Come. We'll see him now.

1103
01:13:05,635 --> 01:13:07,010
Good morning, my darling.

1104
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,986
Good morning, Mother.

1105
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:42,334
Good day, and the Lord be with you.

1106
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,867
And the Lord be with you!

1107
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:02,400
It's all right, baby.
We're here. It's all right.

1108
01:15:02,595 --> 01:15:04,929
- Blood!
- Why do you have such nasty dreams?

1109
01:15:05,123 --> 01:15:07,457
I heard a gun.
There was blood everywhere.

1110
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:12,125
You were dreaming about
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

1111
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,392
It was nothing.
I had a dream.

1112
01:15:16,643 --> 01:15:19,872
If you had a dream,
let's talk about it.

1113
01:15:24,195 --> 01:15:26,334
Are you all right now, Alexei?

1114
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:31,645
Franz Ferdinand's assassination
is bad for Austria and the Serbs...

1115
01:15:32,003 --> 01:15:34,556
...and for the assassin
and his family.

1116
01:15:34,819 --> 01:15:37,186
But politics is like that
in the Balkans.

1117
01:15:37,475 --> 01:15:40,345
The English vote
and the Serbs assassinate.

1118
01:15:41,091 --> 01:15:42,913
You see, Serbia wants its freedom.

1119
01:15:43,107 --> 01:15:45,528
Austria won't give it to them
and so this happens.

1120
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:47,257
It has happened here.

1121
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:49,793
- They threw a bomb...
- Nicky, it's so late.

1122
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:51,938
They're not children anymore.

1123
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,335
They must accept these things.

1124
01:15:55,139 --> 01:15:58,521
Grandfather was killed by a bomb.
So was Uncle Sergei.

1125
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:01,214
But Serbia is a long way off.

1126
01:16:02,147 --> 01:16:05,343
And we don't need
to have bad dreams about Archdukes.

1127
01:16:05,731 --> 01:16:07,705
The diplomats will send
some angry notes.

1128
01:16:07,907 --> 01:16:12,249
A few generals will go on exercises
and everyone will be sensible again.

1129
01:16:13,123 --> 01:16:16,952
All over Europe, kings and queens
are sleeping safely in their beds.

1130
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,097
And that's what we're going to do.

1131
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:35,613
Your Majesty must not.

1132
01:16:35,811 --> 01:16:38,047
This is only a partial mobilization.

1133
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:40,632
It is against Austria,
not Germany, nor anyone else.

1134
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:44,129
If Russia mobilizes,
there will be a war.

1135
01:16:44,323 --> 01:16:45,916
The Austrians are shelling Belgrade.

1136
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:47,708
We must be ready to defend ourselves.

1137
01:16:48,419 --> 01:16:51,005
I'm ordering prayers for peace
to be said in all the churches.

1138
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:53,952
But now I must see my ministers
for armaments and recruitment.

1139
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:55,838
It is in our hands, not God's.

1140
01:16:56,515 --> 01:16:58,075
He gave us minds to reason.

1141
01:16:58,435 --> 01:17:01,217
We can talk sanity to lunatics.
We can calm mad dogs.

1142
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,832
God help us if we
have to start praying!

1143
01:17:04,035 --> 01:17:05,977
We can pray when we bury the dead!

1144
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:24,190
Here is some wonderful news.
A telegram from the Kaiser.

1145
01:17:24,387 --> 01:17:25,664
Just what we wanted.

1146
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:28,314
Offering to mediate
between us and Austria.

1147
01:17:28,515 --> 01:17:30,424
I knew I could count on Willy.

1148
01:17:31,331 --> 01:17:32,279
You see?

1149
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:36,193
He's signed it, "Your sincere and
devoted friend and cousin, Willy."

1150
01:17:37,123 --> 01:17:39,545
With due respect
to your cousin, sire...

1151
01:17:39,747 --> 01:17:41,689
...the Kaiser is a deceitful...

1152
01:17:42,211 --> 01:17:43,487
...megalomaniac.

1153
01:17:43,683 --> 01:17:45,374
If he is offering to help...

1154
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,458
...then it is time to pray.

1155
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:48,957
They won't last a week.

1156
01:17:49,155 --> 01:17:51,676
We'll bury the German army and
that pansy of a Kaiser...

1157
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,436
...and be home for Christmas.

1158
01:17:56,035 --> 01:17:57,278
Colonel Volkov.

1159
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:00,962
Inform the staff that the situation
has improved greatly.

1160
01:18:01,155 --> 01:18:02,497
I'll brief them fully
in half an hour.

1161
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:05,757
But shall we continue to prepare
for the general mobilization?

1162
01:18:05,955 --> 01:18:07,329
In case?

1163
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,590
I'll brief you fully
in half an hour.

1164
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,569
We can't run a modern war, sir.

1165
01:18:13,891 --> 01:18:16,258
We're not fighting
Napoleon this time.

1166
01:18:16,451 --> 01:18:19,450
Germany has ten miles
of railway to every one of ours.

1167
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:21,920
They have 100 factories
to every one of ours.

1168
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:23,740
All we have is men.

1169
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:25,794
They'll be slaughtered like flies.

1170
01:18:26,242 --> 01:18:29,090
We have 11/2 million
men in uniform.

1171
01:18:29,507 --> 01:18:32,638
Next week we'll have
41/2 million men in uniform.

1172
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:36,445
At a casualty rate of 20%
wounded and 10% killed...

1173
01:18:36,643 --> 01:18:38,683
...we can maintain an army
of five million men.

1174
01:18:38,883 --> 01:18:40,573
The Kaiser can't beat that.

1175
01:18:40,867 --> 01:18:42,939
Austria wants to humiliate us.

1176
01:18:43,139 --> 01:18:45,113
We must show her we'll be firm.

1177
01:18:45,411 --> 01:18:48,411
We need the mobilization or your
government will be outmaneuvered.

1178
01:18:49,059 --> 01:18:52,255
But if we mobilize,
the Kaiser will have to.

1179
01:18:52,451 --> 01:18:54,360
And France, and England.

1180
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,024
Nobody will be able to stop.

1181
01:18:59,427 --> 01:19:02,427
Send a telegram to the Kaiser
with a message from me.

1182
01:19:02,626 --> 01:19:05,823
Say that though we've both mobilized,
it doesn't mean we'll fight.

1183
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:07,490
And nothing will break
our old friendship.

1184
01:19:07,682 --> 01:19:08,926
Sign it "Nicky."

1185
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:16,576
Order the general mobilization.

1186
01:19:19,139 --> 01:19:20,252
Madness.

1187
01:19:26,147 --> 01:19:29,147
This one can't get to the colors
soon enough, can you?

1188
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:36,888
I'm old, sir.

1189
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:39,995
I've seen so many wars.

1190
01:19:40,835 --> 01:19:43,769
They all seemed so
important at the time.

1191
01:19:44,514 --> 01:19:45,408
Now...

1192
01:19:46,211 --> 01:19:48,731
...I don't even remember
what they were called.

1193
01:19:49,635 --> 01:19:50,780
Millions...

1194
01:19:51,234 --> 01:19:52,641
...of dead men.

1195
01:19:54,595 --> 01:19:56,188
I don't know why.

1196
01:19:56,642 --> 01:19:57,886
Nobody knows.

1197
01:20:03,267 --> 01:20:05,885
You could so easily
stop this war, sir.

1198
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:08,572
All you have to do
is to get up...

1199
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,916
...now...

1200
01:20:10,211 --> 01:20:11,291
...quietly...

1201
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,279
...go home to your family.

1202
01:20:15,075 --> 01:20:18,109
You'd be the greatest
of all the Tsars.

1203
01:20:27,043 --> 01:20:29,760
Your Majesty's foreign minister,
Mr. Sazanov...

1204
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:32,508
...has received a note
from the German Ambassador.

1205
01:20:35,811 --> 01:20:36,793
Your Majesty...

1206
01:20:36,995 --> 01:20:39,067
...at ten minutes past seven
this evening...

1207
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,056
...Germany declared war on Russia.

1208
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:01,371
Gentlemen...

1209
01:21:02,882 --> 01:21:04,987
...Germany has declared war on Russia.

1210
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,381
God save Russia!

1211
01:21:09,795 --> 01:21:11,802
God save the Tsar.

1212
01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:14,237
God save the Tsar!

1213
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:40,737
None of you will be here...

1214
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,621
...when this war ends.

1215
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:45,885
Everything we fought for
will be lost.

1216
01:21:46,082 --> 01:21:49,246
Everything we loved
will be broken.

1217
01:21:49,699 --> 01:21:53,474
The victors will be as cursed
as the defeated.

1218
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:56,154
The world will grow old.

1219
01:21:56,355 --> 01:21:59,104
And men will wander about,
lost in the ruins...

1220
01:21:59,299 --> 01:22:00,706
...and go mad.

1221
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,334
Tradition.

1222
01:22:02,754 --> 01:22:03,998
Virtue.

1223
01:22:04,418 --> 01:22:05,695
Restraint.

1224
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,228
They all go!

1225
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:10,690
I'm not mourning for myself,
but for the people who come after me.

1226
01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:13,271
They will live without hope.

1227
01:22:14,178 --> 01:22:15,640
And all they will have...

1228
01:22:15,842 --> 01:22:17,249
...will be guilt...

1229
01:22:17,443 --> 01:22:18,719
...revenge...

1230
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:20,318
...and terror.

1231
01:22:21,154 --> 01:22:24,602
And the world will
be full of fanatics...

1232
01:22:24,867 --> 01:22:27,649
...and trivial fools.

1233
01:22:30,019 --> 01:22:32,440
Set all differences aside!

1234
01:22:32,803 --> 01:22:34,810
We are Russians first of all!

1235
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:37,280
And until the day of victory dawns...

1236
01:22:37,474 --> 01:22:39,165
...we stand united...

1237
01:22:39,363 --> 01:22:41,403
...in the defense of Holy Russia!

1238
01:23:44,162 --> 01:23:45,918
God save the Tsar!

1239
01:29:00,354 --> 01:29:02,296
There's no transport.
Can they walk?

1240
01:29:03,394 --> 01:29:06,427
They're needed at the front tonight.
See to it.

1241
01:29:09,026 --> 01:29:10,433
Right face!

1242
01:29:11,682 --> 01:29:13,373
Forward march!

1243
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:20,669
Bitch! German bitch!

1244
01:30:21,026 --> 01:30:22,074
Shut up!

1245
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,995
Have you seen them?
What happened?

1246
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:37,601
Would you like some tea?

1247
01:30:38,818 --> 01:30:42,114
I've always hated this time of year.
It gets dark so early.

1248
01:30:43,106 --> 01:30:44,317
You gave in again.

1249
01:30:44,514 --> 01:30:45,758
You look so tired.

1250
01:30:45,954 --> 01:30:47,612
Did you even see the ministers?

1251
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,436
You want the minutes
of the meeting?

1252
01:30:49,635 --> 01:30:50,976
Just the gist of it.

1253
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:53,853
I told them I proposed replacing
Nikolasha with myself...

1254
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:56,254
...and was leaving for headquarters
to take command.

1255
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:57,879
Go on. They said...?

1256
01:30:58,082 --> 01:31:00,503
Nothing much.
They said they'd all resign.

1257
01:31:00,866 --> 01:31:03,037
They said the government would fall,
that it was madness.

1258
01:31:03,234 --> 01:31:04,030
And you took it?

1259
01:31:04,387 --> 01:31:05,815
- You gave in?
- They're my advisors.

1260
01:31:06,178 --> 01:31:07,007
You're their Tsar.

1261
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:10,658
But what if they're right?
They might be. How can I be sure?

1262
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:11,963
You must go.

1263
01:31:12,322 --> 01:31:15,485
Nikolasha is a bad man.
Father Gregory has said so.

1264
01:31:16,098 --> 01:31:17,920
I'm sick to death of Father Gregory.

1265
01:31:19,042 --> 01:31:20,154
All my life...

1266
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:23,131
...my whole life, I've
done what you want.

1267
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:24,312
I gave Mother up.

1268
01:31:24,514 --> 01:31:26,783
You hated her, so we don't
see her anymore.

1269
01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:28,538
I gave my friends up.

1270
01:31:28,866 --> 01:31:30,655
Do you know I haven't a single friend?

1271
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:32,857
I've got my family.

1272
01:31:33,346 --> 01:31:35,200
Four girls, one sick boy...

1273
01:31:36,546 --> 01:31:37,626
...and you.

1274
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:39,582
I ask...

1275
01:31:39,906 --> 01:31:43,649
...before I eat or sleep
or change my clothes:

1276
01:31:43,906 --> 01:31:45,280
"Is this what Sunny wants?"

1277
01:31:45,986 --> 01:31:47,164
And it never is.

1278
01:31:47,362 --> 01:31:48,769
There's always more!

1279
01:31:49,314 --> 01:31:50,939
Sweet Jesus! How much
do you want of me?

1280
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:52,959
I want this.

1281
01:31:53,154 --> 01:31:54,266
Don't you know I want to go?

1282
01:31:54,882 --> 01:31:56,954
For months there's
been no ammunition.

1283
01:31:57,634 --> 01:32:00,089
In Galicia, they ration bullets.
Three a day.

1284
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:03,323
My soldiers get three shots a day!
What can I do?

1285
01:32:03,522 --> 01:32:05,115
I can't make shells.

1286
01:32:05,314 --> 01:32:06,394
I fire ministers...

1287
01:32:06,594 --> 01:32:08,863
...I hire ministers,
and nothing happens.

1288
01:32:09,058 --> 01:32:11,360
I'm no use here.
I belong at Stavka with my men!

1289
01:32:11,554 --> 01:32:14,303
Don't tell me.
Tell your ministers.

1290
01:32:16,546 --> 01:32:18,106
You know people want me
to divorce you?

1291
01:32:19,874 --> 01:32:21,303
Father Gregory warned me of that.

1292
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,631
If I thought it would help,
I would go away.

1293
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:26,363
But it would be disastrous.

1294
01:32:27,906 --> 01:32:30,110
Has Father Gregory told you that too?

1295
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:34,232
I don't need anyone to tell me about us.

1296
01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:40,280
This is the beginning
of the glory of your reign.

1297
01:32:40,482 --> 01:32:42,043
Our friend told me so.

1298
01:32:42,338 --> 01:32:44,672
It will be the greatest page
in Russian history...

1299
01:32:44,866 --> 01:32:47,255
...the story of these weeks and days.

1300
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:48,636
And when you go...

1301
01:32:48,834 --> 01:32:51,551
...don't worry over what
you've left behind. I'm here.

1302
01:32:52,162 --> 01:32:53,471
Lean on me.

1303
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:54,810
Use me.

1304
01:32:56,066 --> 01:32:58,455
I'm not wise or strong...

1305
01:32:58,754 --> 01:33:00,859
...but God will show me what to do.

1306
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:04,312
With our armies in retreat,
you must not take command.

1307
01:33:04,514 --> 01:33:07,165
You could not have chosen
a more unfortunate time.

1308
01:33:07,362 --> 01:33:08,442
Faith in Your Majesty...

1309
01:33:08,642 --> 01:33:11,195
...is the one thing that keeps
the whole country together.

1310
01:33:13,506 --> 01:33:14,848
Have I heard it all?

1311
01:33:15,042 --> 01:33:18,555
One thing. The headquarters
at Stavka is 500 miles from here.

1312
01:33:18,946 --> 01:33:20,025
Go on.

1313
01:33:20,226 --> 01:33:22,365
While you're away,
who will run the government?

1314
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:25,339
When the Tsar is with the Army,
the Tsaritza takes his place.

1315
01:33:26,274 --> 01:33:27,102
Sire!

1316
01:33:27,714 --> 01:33:30,976
With all respects, the Tsaritza's
lack of experience...

1317
01:33:31,169 --> 01:33:34,748
...and limited understanding of the
Russian people, gracious though she...

1318
01:33:34,946 --> 01:33:36,702
I shall continue to make
the decisions...

1319
01:33:36,898 --> 01:33:39,003
...but you'll have to make
your reports to her.

1320
01:33:42,562 --> 01:33:44,798
Thank you for your advice, gentlemen.

1321
01:33:45,602 --> 01:33:47,391
I have thought about this.

1322
01:33:48,418 --> 01:33:50,622
And I know that God is with me.

1323
01:33:51,681 --> 01:33:53,853
I leave for Stavka in the morning.

1324
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:00,730
<i>My very own darling...</i>

1325
01:34:01,058 --> 01:34:03,644
<i>... remember last night</i>
<i>when we were together.</i>

1326
01:34:04,034 --> 01:34:06,205
<i>I yearn for your caresses.</i>

1327
01:34:06,402 --> 01:34:08,442
<i>I can never have enough of them.</i>

1328
01:34:09,058 --> 01:34:10,651
<i>I kiss you, caress you...</i>

1329
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:13,151
<i>... Iove you, long for you...</i>

1330
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:15,070
<i>... can't sleep without you.</i>

1331
01:34:15,266 --> 01:34:16,543
<i>Bless you...</i>

1332
01:34:16,994 --> 01:34:17,888
<i>... Sunny.</i>

1333
01:34:34,626 --> 01:34:36,120
Get up. We're moving out.

1334
01:34:37,282 --> 01:34:38,842
I said get up!

1335
01:35:14,402 --> 01:35:15,579
Your Majesty.

1336
01:35:27,298 --> 01:35:29,153
You can't be glad to see me.

1337
01:35:30,242 --> 01:35:32,031
You understand my reasons?

1338
01:35:33,697 --> 01:35:35,006
You think I'm wrong.

1339
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:37,148
The Tsar comes second after God.

1340
01:35:37,346 --> 01:35:38,840
I would die for him.

1341
01:35:39,042 --> 01:35:40,187
I'm sorry, Nikolasha.

1342
01:35:40,386 --> 01:35:43,168
Don't be.
It's a great relief.

1343
01:35:43,746 --> 01:35:46,168
Can't get away
from here soon enough.

1344
01:35:47,522 --> 01:35:49,693
I've appointed General Alexeiev
Chief of Staff.

1345
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:51,962
Good man, first class.

1346
01:35:52,162 --> 01:35:53,689
Listen to him.
Let him run things.

1347
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:55,068
I intend to.

1348
01:35:55,777 --> 01:35:57,632
Can't do worse than I did.

1349
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,264
You know...

1350
01:36:04,354 --> 01:36:07,321
...I've got a million corpses
on my hands.

1351
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:12,825
I weep too easily these days.
Getting old.

1352
01:36:13,378 --> 01:36:15,931
It's bitter, Nicky. Bitter.

1353
01:36:18,209 --> 01:36:20,032
I don't envy you.

1354
01:36:21,634 --> 01:36:23,008
What do you think I should do?

1355
01:36:23,202 --> 01:36:26,049
Retreat. Preserve the Army.
That's the only thing.

1356
01:36:26,241 --> 01:36:27,386
And what else?

1357
01:36:27,586 --> 01:36:29,309
Wear socks to bed.

1358
01:36:29,506 --> 01:36:30,815
Floors freeze in the winter.

1359
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,017
I'll ask Sunny to knit me some.

1360
01:36:33,217 --> 01:36:35,006
She sends her love.

1361
01:36:35,202 --> 01:36:36,958
The devil she does!

1362
01:36:37,506 --> 01:36:40,735
I could have won this war if
I were only fighting on one front.

1363
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,905
But I had two enemies at my back:

1364
01:36:43,106 --> 01:36:45,277
Your Sunny and her monk!

1365
01:36:45,762 --> 01:36:47,038
Not long ago he wrote to me...

1366
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,405
...could he come
and bless the troops?

1367
01:36:49,602 --> 01:36:51,641
I told him if he came, I'd hang him.

1368
01:36:51,842 --> 01:36:53,369
Should have let him come.

1369
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:55,512
Hung the bastard when he got here.

1370
01:37:10,146 --> 01:37:11,739
God help you, Nicky.

1371
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:19,392
God save the Tsar!

1372
01:37:19,746 --> 01:37:22,266
God save the Tsar!

1373
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:27,359
So, you'd like to be an opera singer?

1374
01:37:27,554 --> 01:37:29,594
Yes, you have the chest for it.

1375
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:36,286
Have you ever sung in public before?

1376
01:37:39,298 --> 01:37:40,858
Go to the Imperial Theater...

1377
01:37:41,058 --> 01:37:41,985
...give them this.

1378
01:37:42,178 --> 01:37:43,455
It's an introduction.

1379
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:46,137
I have them printed up
now to save time.

1380
01:37:48,034 --> 01:37:49,310
Father Gregory.

1381
01:37:52,353 --> 01:37:55,801
There's a gentleman arrived,
says he's the Minister of something.

1382
01:37:56,033 --> 01:37:57,528
Foreign Minister.

1383
01:37:58,338 --> 01:37:59,647
He's early.

1384
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:01,561
Send him in.

1385
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,222
He might enjoy this.

1386
01:38:05,537 --> 01:38:07,993
Now let's hear you sing a little.

1387
01:38:08,961 --> 01:38:10,171
Don't worry.

1388
01:38:10,529 --> 01:38:11,838
I'm no judge.

1389
01:38:13,154 --> 01:38:15,194
Father Gregory says come in.

1390
01:38:19,138 --> 01:38:22,749
Has the Empress now made him
responsible for the arts?

1391
01:38:26,338 --> 01:38:27,964
My dear man!

1392
01:38:28,321 --> 01:38:30,209
Isn't she delightful?

1393
01:38:35,297 --> 01:38:37,021
Absolutely charming.

1394
01:38:37,665 --> 01:38:39,869
I had no idea you had
asked me here for a recital.

1395
01:38:40,066 --> 01:38:41,440
She wants to sing.

1396
01:38:41,698 --> 01:38:43,487
I like to help people.

1397
01:38:44,545 --> 01:38:45,560
You don't mind?

1398
01:38:45,761 --> 01:38:48,958
You've placed 3 men in my Ministry
who can neither read nor write.

1399
01:38:49,154 --> 01:38:50,976
Why should I mind?

1400
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:54,110
I don't hate anyone...

1401
01:38:54,401 --> 01:38:56,605
...and yet so many enemies.

1402
01:38:57,121 --> 01:38:58,266
I'm not rich.

1403
01:38:58,466 --> 01:39:00,288
What I get, I give away.

1404
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:04,217
I take no vengeance on the men
I've removed from office.

1405
01:39:04,418 --> 01:39:07,287
When you fall, I won't abuse you.

1406
01:39:07,554 --> 01:39:09,659
We are appointed and
dismissed by the Tsar.

1407
01:39:09,857 --> 01:39:11,319
You're his enemy!

1408
01:39:11,714 --> 01:39:15,009
You and all the other ministers.
You're all against him.

1409
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:18,998
Can it be your dream to
have us all removed from office?

1410
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:20,286
Every one.

1411
01:39:22,306 --> 01:39:24,673
You are destroying Russia!

1412
01:39:24,865 --> 01:39:26,240
Don't you know it?

1413
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:27,327
What's your price?

1414
01:39:27,522 --> 01:39:29,245
Do you want to be
made a pope or...

1415
01:39:29,442 --> 01:39:31,897
Grishka! How are
the miracles going today?

1416
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:33,784
My God!

1417
01:39:34,369 --> 01:39:36,508
They're elevating
Grishka to the Cabinet.

1418
01:39:36,706 --> 01:39:39,193
Grand Duke Dmitry.
Prince Yussoupov.

1419
01:39:39,394 --> 01:39:40,288
Pray excuse me.

1420
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:42,848
He tells me
I'm destroying Russia.

1421
01:39:43,778 --> 01:39:45,152
What, single-handed?

1422
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:48,641
If you're friends of his, take him away.
Get him out of Petersburg.

1423
01:39:49,282 --> 01:39:51,616
Take your girls, or your boys.

1424
01:39:51,874 --> 01:39:53,150
Frolic in the provinces...

1425
01:39:53,346 --> 01:39:54,720
...but get him out of here!

1426
01:39:54,914 --> 01:39:57,118
Your Excellency sounds hysterical.

1427
01:39:57,314 --> 01:39:58,939
Your Highness ought to be.

1428
01:39:59,138 --> 01:40:00,567
Whatever happens, I'll survive.

1429
01:40:00,770 --> 01:40:03,159
There's always room
for one more bureaucrat.

1430
01:40:03,361 --> 01:40:04,768
I'll survive...

1431
01:40:05,281 --> 01:40:06,939
...but will you princes?

1432
01:40:07,138 --> 01:40:08,086
No.

1433
01:40:09,058 --> 01:40:11,098
We're going to be
torn to pieces.

1434
01:40:11,489 --> 01:40:13,147
You politicians think
you're in control...

1435
01:40:13,346 --> 01:40:15,288
...but you'll be swept away
like the rest of us.

1436
01:40:15,489 --> 01:40:16,951
Rome, Athens...

1437
01:40:17,153 --> 01:40:18,844
...Petersburg.
You can't stop it.

1438
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:21,694
In the meantime,
I shall enjoy myself.

1439
01:40:23,265 --> 01:40:25,054
Come to my place on Thursday.

1440
01:40:25,889 --> 01:40:27,799
I'm having a special little party.

1441
01:40:28,642 --> 01:40:29,438
Look.

1442
01:40:31,201 --> 01:40:32,859
This beautiful scarf.

1443
01:40:34,593 --> 01:40:35,521
Have it.

1444
01:40:40,289 --> 01:40:42,045
I can't stop the revolution.

1445
01:40:42,625 --> 01:40:45,146
But until it comes,
let's have some fun.

1446
01:40:45,953 --> 01:40:47,295
Even if it's only
for a few more days.

1447
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:48,472
For God's sake!

1448
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:51,486
Look, if I brought you money...

1449
01:40:51,682 --> 01:40:54,070
...if it were enough,
would you leave Petersburg?

1450
01:40:54,274 --> 01:40:55,867
I can't leave.

1451
01:40:56,865 --> 01:40:59,899
I want to serve
<i>Batushka</i> and <i>Matushka.</i>

1452
01:41:00,097 --> 01:41:01,210
I want peace...

1453
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:03,895
...and food for
peasants everywhere.

1454
01:41:04,353 --> 01:41:06,109
I want that girl you saw...

1455
01:41:06,306 --> 01:41:08,411
...and all the girls
I haven't seen.

1456
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:10,038
I want to sleep...

1457
01:41:10,242 --> 01:41:12,511
...but can't sleep
unless I'm drunk.

1458
01:41:12,706 --> 01:41:14,680
I want to die and go to Heaven.

1459
01:41:14,882 --> 01:41:15,962
I want music.

1460
01:41:16,161 --> 01:41:19,423
I want God to love me
and I want to see you dance!

1461
01:41:34,305 --> 01:41:35,418
Hello, Mama.

1462
01:41:40,514 --> 01:41:43,231
This is my Commander in Chief,
General Alexeiev.

1463
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:49,533
How are Sunny and the children?

1464
01:41:50,529 --> 01:41:53,115
This is the first Christmas
I've spent away from the family.

1465
01:41:53,346 --> 01:41:54,491
You look well.

1466
01:41:55,329 --> 01:41:57,500
I came to congratulate you, Nicky.

1467
01:41:57,697 --> 01:41:58,712
What for?

1468
01:41:59,137 --> 01:42:02,269
For finding from all Russia's
countless cretins...

1469
01:42:02,465 --> 01:42:03,992
...idiots and incompetents...

1470
01:42:04,194 --> 01:42:07,641
...the men least qualified
to run your government.

1471
01:42:12,353 --> 01:42:15,004
- Would you like some tea?
- I've taken tea.

1472
01:42:18,529 --> 01:42:21,399
I've tried to understand you,
but I can't.

1473
01:42:21,986 --> 01:42:23,742
I sometimes fail to judge men well.

1474
01:42:23,937 --> 01:42:26,785
Sometimes? How can one man
make so many mistakes?

1475
01:42:27,265 --> 01:42:29,338
Why did you stop
our Austrian campaign?

1476
01:42:29,537 --> 01:42:30,584
Our casualties were terrible.

1477
01:42:30,786 --> 01:42:32,728
You knew they would be
before you started.

1478
01:42:32,929 --> 01:42:34,555
Theirs were larger.

1479
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:37,048
Mother, what do you
know about strategy?

1480
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,395
What do you?

1481
01:42:38,881 --> 01:42:40,375
What are you
doing here, anyway?

1482
01:42:40,578 --> 01:42:42,334
There isn't a battlefield
within 500 miles.

1483
01:42:42,529 --> 01:42:44,384
It's important that I'm here.

1484
01:42:44,578 --> 01:42:45,985
Your place is in Petersburg.

1485
01:42:46,177 --> 01:42:49,789
Don't you know about the riots
and scandals and starvation?

1486
01:42:50,625 --> 01:42:53,789
They hate your wife.
They think she's a German spy.

1487
01:42:53,985 --> 01:42:56,505
How can you let that
foolish woman ruin your country?

1488
01:42:56,706 --> 01:42:57,818
Leave Sunny out of this.

1489
01:42:58,818 --> 01:43:00,989
Someone has to make you
see sense about her.

1490
01:43:01,185 --> 01:43:02,527
Can't you think of anyone else?

1491
01:43:02,721 --> 01:43:04,576
Can't you think of
the rest of your family?

1492
01:43:05,025 --> 01:43:06,651
Can't you think of Russia?

1493
01:43:07,489 --> 01:43:08,733
I wish your father were alive.

1494
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:10,042
Don't throw him at me!

1495
01:43:10,242 --> 01:43:11,256
He knew how to be a Tsar.

1496
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:14,043
He'd have burnt Vienna down,
stamped on the Germans...

1497
01:43:14,241 --> 01:43:15,670
...and shot the strikers.

1498
01:43:16,289 --> 01:43:18,231
Anything to give Russia peace.

1499
01:43:18,945 --> 01:43:22,076
And he'd certainly have known
how to deal with Rasputin.

1500
01:43:22,274 --> 01:43:23,288
He is a man of God.

1501
01:43:24,001 --> 01:43:25,114
Do you believe that?

1502
01:43:25,313 --> 01:43:27,680
He works miracles.
He keeps my son alive.

1503
01:43:28,130 --> 01:43:29,755
Do you believe that, Nicky?

1504
01:43:30,369 --> 01:43:32,092
Sunny does. She needs him.

1505
01:43:32,322 --> 01:43:33,566
Hang him!

1506
01:43:33,761 --> 01:43:35,354
I don't wish any man harm...

1507
01:43:35,554 --> 01:43:38,271
...but so many Russians
will die if you don't.

1508
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:39,457
I can't.

1509
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:41,438
At least send him to Siberia.

1510
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:42,494
I can't!

1511
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:44,860
He's going to destroy us.

1512
01:43:45,058 --> 01:43:49,498
Millions will suffer. And all because
you can't say no to your wife.

1513
01:43:50,337 --> 01:43:51,133
It's in God's hands.

1514
01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:52,856
That's no answer!

1515
01:43:53,377 --> 01:43:54,522
I see what's happening!

1516
01:43:54,721 --> 01:43:55,615
Then act!

1517
01:43:55,874 --> 01:43:57,303
Come back home.

1518
01:43:57,505 --> 01:44:00,025
Hang this man,
send Alexandra to Livadia...

1519
01:44:00,225 --> 01:44:01,501
...and deal with the real problems.

1520
01:44:01,857 --> 01:44:02,653
I can't!

1521
01:44:03,681 --> 01:44:05,950
In Heavers name, Nicholas,
what can you do?

1522
01:44:06,434 --> 01:44:08,539
Just what I'm doing, Mama.

1523
01:44:09,154 --> 01:44:10,747
There's nothing else
that can be done.

1524
01:44:53,089 --> 01:44:55,544
I hope you are not
on a diet, Father Gregory.

1525
01:45:07,905 --> 01:45:09,880
To <i>Batushka</i> and <i>Matushka.</i>

1526
01:45:18,721 --> 01:45:19,965
I'll die soon, my friends.

1527
01:45:21,985 --> 01:45:23,545
I've made my will.

1528
01:45:24,769 --> 01:45:26,874
I won't live to see the New Year.

1529
01:45:27,074 --> 01:45:28,481
And it makes me angry.

1530
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:32,864
It's good to enjoy yourself
with your friends.

1531
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:36,154
I don't want to die.

1532
01:45:43,233 --> 01:45:44,313
Russia!

1533
01:45:50,593 --> 01:45:51,608
Father Gregory...

1534
01:45:52,353 --> 01:45:53,368
...needs a woman...

1535
01:45:54,273 --> 01:45:55,767
...to cheer him up!

1536
01:47:24,737 --> 01:47:26,428
I've been poisoned.

1537
01:47:27,617 --> 01:47:29,406
You've tried to kill me.

1538
01:47:31,809 --> 01:47:33,216
You all have.

1539
01:47:40,033 --> 01:47:41,375
You silly fools.

1540
01:47:41,569 --> 01:47:43,479
I thought I could trust you.

1541
01:47:43,937 --> 01:47:45,595
You silly little fools.

1542
01:47:45,825 --> 01:47:48,312
You can't even kill properly.

1543
01:47:49,121 --> 01:47:51,455
You're too small to destroy me.

1544
01:47:54,657 --> 01:47:55,486
Look.

1545
01:48:00,769 --> 01:48:02,144
Cyanide!

1546
01:48:07,713 --> 01:48:09,568
Now get up, Prince!
Get up!

1547
01:48:09,761 --> 01:48:10,623
Try!

1548
01:48:10,849 --> 01:48:12,758
Let's see you try to kill me.

1549
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:14,335
Cyanide!

1550
01:48:15,521 --> 01:48:17,561
I begged <i>Batushka</i> not
to start this war.

1551
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,003
I know who dies.

1552
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:20,925
You don't die.
The people die.

1553
01:48:21,121 --> 01:48:22,812
The wise old men,
the generals, the ministers...

1554
01:48:23,009 --> 01:48:24,503
...the ones who say,
"Do this, go there!"

1555
01:48:24,705 --> 01:48:28,000
No mud on their boots!
No bullets in their brains!

1556
01:48:29,313 --> 01:48:31,223
Where's your rifle, Prince?

1557
01:48:31,617 --> 01:48:33,689
Why aren't you at the front,
where the blood is?

1558
01:48:33,889 --> 01:48:35,383
I'm not a German!

1559
01:48:36,129 --> 01:48:37,787
I come from the Russian soil...

1560
01:48:37,985 --> 01:48:39,894
...and you fools
will never destroy me!

1561
01:48:41,153 --> 01:48:42,397
Thank God...

1562
01:48:42,625 --> 01:48:44,829
...Russia has sons like me...

1563
01:48:45,057 --> 01:48:48,253
...and isn't at the mercy
of scums like you!

1564
01:49:08,257 --> 01:49:09,719
Let's have the other side.

1565
01:49:14,497 --> 01:49:16,319
We must get rid of his body.

1566
01:50:44,193 --> 01:50:46,582
God bless the Tsar.

1567
01:51:05,281 --> 01:51:06,525
Your Majesty...

1568
01:51:06,785 --> 01:51:09,119
...the Cabinet has been
waiting for over an hour.

1569
01:51:09,313 --> 01:51:10,328
I can't see them today.

1570
01:51:10,529 --> 01:51:12,863
But we need you
to sign the decrees.

1571
01:51:13,057 --> 01:51:14,169
Petersburg is starving!

1572
01:51:14,369 --> 01:51:15,547
I can't.

1573
01:51:16,033 --> 01:51:18,269
You're glad he's dead!
You wanted him to die.

1574
01:51:20,801 --> 01:51:24,249
Please tell the ministers
my mother cannot see them today.

1575
01:51:24,769 --> 01:51:27,224
They will be informed of
a convenient time to come again.

1576
01:51:31,233 --> 01:51:34,102
Have Grand Duke Dmitry
and Prince Yussoupov arrested.

1577
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:38,845
Only the Tsar can order the arrest
of one of his own family.

1578
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:41,375
It's his monarchical privilege.

1579
01:51:49,056 --> 01:51:50,104
Please try.

1580
01:51:50,976 --> 01:51:52,187
His will.

1581
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:57,309
"I feel that I shall leave life
before January the first.

1582
01:52:00,545 --> 01:52:03,840
If any of your relatives
have wrought my death...

1583
01:52:04,385 --> 01:52:06,327
...then no one of your family...

1584
01:52:06,849 --> 01:52:10,591
...none of your children
or relatives will remain alive.

1585
01:52:10,977 --> 01:52:13,082
They will be killed
by the Russian people.

1586
01:52:14,241 --> 01:52:15,834
Brother will kill brother...

1587
01:52:17,504 --> 01:52:20,254
...and there will be
no nobles left in the country."

1588
01:52:27,329 --> 01:52:29,369
The beast is dead!

1589
01:52:29,921 --> 01:52:31,896
His killers are heroes!

1590
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,171
Russia is saved!

1591
01:52:35,553 --> 01:52:36,894
Mr. President.

1592
01:52:38,113 --> 01:52:39,258
Mr. President!

1593
01:52:40,353 --> 01:52:41,946
Mr. President!

1594
01:52:42,145 --> 01:52:44,185
I have the floor,
Mr. Kerensky.

1595
01:52:44,384 --> 01:52:48,061
One madman has been murdered
and you are celebrating.

1596
01:52:48,257 --> 01:52:50,591
There is no food, no fuel.

1597
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,011
A third of our army
is still unarmed...

1598
01:52:54,209 --> 01:52:57,275
...and they are surrendering
in tens of thousands.

1599
01:52:57,472 --> 01:52:59,545
Nothing is changed.

1600
01:52:59,744 --> 01:53:02,973
The German Tsaritza is
still running the country.

1601
01:53:03,169 --> 01:53:05,406
The Tsar must stop hiding
with his soldiers...

1602
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,510
...and come back to Petersburg!

1603
01:53:07,809 --> 01:53:09,467
Chaos is coming to Russia...

1604
01:53:09,665 --> 01:53:11,934
...and he should be
here to deal with it!

1605
01:54:22,977 --> 01:54:24,122
Your Majesty?

1606
01:54:26,465 --> 01:54:27,926
What is it, Alexeiev?

1607
01:54:28,129 --> 01:54:30,649
There is a general strike
in St. Petersburg.

1608
01:54:31,104 --> 01:54:32,893
The city is in chaos.

1609
01:54:33,153 --> 01:54:34,527
It can't be.

1610
01:54:35,329 --> 01:54:36,311
We're at war.

1611
01:54:36,512 --> 01:54:38,879
There are demonstrations
in the streets.

1612
01:54:39,297 --> 01:54:42,231
The Army refuses to fire on them.

1613
01:54:46,497 --> 01:54:48,799
Telegraph this to the
Military Governor:

1614
01:54:50,048 --> 01:54:52,798
All riots are to be
stopped at once.

1615
01:54:53,697 --> 01:54:55,519
The <i>Duma</i> is to be dissolved.

1616
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:58,678
I return immediately
to Petersburg.

1617
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,055
And sign it Nicholas.

1618
01:55:01,824 --> 01:55:05,753
Sire, I hope there is someone
in Petersburg to take our orders.

1619
01:55:20,225 --> 01:55:22,428
Madame, his fever is still the same.

1620
01:55:23,904 --> 01:55:25,497
If only it would break.

1621
01:55:26,593 --> 01:55:29,048
Why did they have to
go and get measles now?

1622
01:55:32,865 --> 01:55:34,141
Lie down, darling.

1623
01:55:34,529 --> 01:55:35,576
I heard it again.

1624
01:55:35,776 --> 01:55:37,599
It's nothing.
You must keep warm.

1625
01:55:40,801 --> 01:55:42,623
When you've finished,
get some rest.

1626
01:55:49,505 --> 01:55:50,999
Still no news from the Tsar.

1627
01:55:51,201 --> 01:55:52,989
They don't answer our telegrams.

1628
01:55:53,185 --> 01:55:54,679
We must reach him.

1629
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,571
He must come back.

1630
01:55:57,504 --> 01:55:59,327
God knows what'll happen.

1631
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,050
I heard some more firing.

1632
01:56:35,713 --> 01:56:38,363
We're cut off. Soldiers on
the track ahead, Your Majesty.

1633
01:56:38,561 --> 01:56:39,455
They've got artillery.

1634
01:56:39,648 --> 01:56:42,169
I must get through to Tsarkoe Selo.
My family's there.

1635
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,197
We can't.

1636
01:56:43,393 --> 01:56:46,459
There's open track to Moscow
or to northern headquarters at Pskov.

1637
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,702
I see.

1638
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,608
Where should we go?

1639
01:56:51,808 --> 01:56:53,597
They're rioting in Moscow.

1640
01:56:57,313 --> 01:56:59,418
Well, then. To Pskov.

1641
01:57:23,712 --> 01:57:25,600
Thank God you're here.
Prepare an order...

1642
01:57:25,793 --> 01:57:27,931
Your Majesty, I'm afraid
it's too late.

1643
01:57:28,577 --> 01:57:31,773
The <i>Duma</i> has appointed
a provisional government.

1644
01:57:32,384 --> 01:57:34,839
And all your ministers
have been arrested.

1645
01:57:37,377 --> 01:57:39,165
Order your troops...

1646
01:57:39,937 --> 01:57:40,919
...to march...

1647
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,389
At this moment, Your Majesty...

1648
01:57:43,585 --> 01:57:45,821
...if my troops knew
the Tsar was here...

1649
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,740
...there's every chance
they would turn on you.

1650
01:57:47,937 --> 01:57:49,628
Whole garrisons are going over.

1651
01:57:51,425 --> 01:57:54,524
Sire, the <i>Duma</i> also insists...

1652
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,146
...on your abdication.

1653
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:24,506
Surely my generals
stand with me?

1654
01:58:24,705 --> 01:58:26,166
I have already...

1655
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:28,894
...been in touch
with the Commanders.

1656
01:58:29,761 --> 01:58:31,222
General Kornilov:

1657
01:58:32,385 --> 01:58:35,384
"I cannot order
an attack on Petersburg."

1658
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:39,068
Admiral of the Baltic Fleet...

1659
01:58:39,328 --> 01:58:40,222
...Nepenin:

1660
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:43,639
"It is with greatest difficulty...

1661
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:46,175
...I keep my troops
and the fleet in check.

1662
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,310
I urge the Tsar to abdicate."

1663
01:58:51,328 --> 01:58:52,376
General Ruzsky:

1664
01:58:53,313 --> 01:58:55,484
"I cannot answer for my troops.

1665
01:58:56,033 --> 01:58:57,626
I implore His Majesty...

1666
01:58:57,888 --> 01:58:58,870
...to abdicate."

1667
01:58:59,681 --> 01:59:01,437
His Imperial Highness,
General Nicolaievich...

1668
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:03,291
What does Nikolasha say?

1669
01:59:04,033 --> 01:59:05,342
"On my knees...

1670
01:59:06,145 --> 01:59:08,119
...I beg you to abdicate...

1671
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,366
...and save the dynasty."

1672
02:00:23,105 --> 02:00:25,014
Nicky, please come home.

1673
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:27,929
Tell me, Dr. Federov.

1674
02:00:28,128 --> 02:00:29,143
If my son...

1675
02:00:29,344 --> 02:00:30,838
...as the future Tsar...

1676
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:33,887
...would remain behind
to be educated in Russia...

1677
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:36,284
...while I and my family
went abroad...

1678
02:00:38,496 --> 02:00:40,918
...how long would he
be likely to live?

1679
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,934
Deprived of your love and care...

1680
02:00:43,136 --> 02:00:46,300
...and what I call "customary
surroundings," it's hard to say.

1681
02:00:46,497 --> 02:00:48,864
It's a matter of
luck and chance, Your Majesty.

1682
02:00:49,056 --> 02:00:50,431
There are no real statistics.

1683
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:54,012
One would hope that he could
live a normal span of life, but...

1684
02:00:54,208 --> 02:00:55,070
Well...

1685
02:00:55,968 --> 02:00:56,950
...twenty...

1686
02:00:57,216 --> 02:00:58,645
...would be a good age.

1687
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:13,689
"Accordingly, in agreement
with the Imperial <i>Duma...</i>

1688
02:01:13,888 --> 02:01:16,605
...we have thought it right to
abdicate from the Russian throne...

1689
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,840
...and to lay down
the supreme power.

1690
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:19,836
Therefore..."

1691
02:01:20,032 --> 02:01:21,527
It seems in order.

1692
02:01:21,824 --> 02:01:22,718
May I?

1693
02:01:24,289 --> 02:01:26,678
- "Therefore, in the name..."
- I won't tear it up.

1694
02:01:29,504 --> 02:01:31,064
Shall I sign it in your lap?

1695
02:01:40,353 --> 02:01:42,327
I wish to add one thing more.

1696
02:01:42,944 --> 02:01:44,919
I shall abdicate for myself...

1697
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:46,713
...and also for my son.

1698
02:01:47,937 --> 02:01:49,660
But, Your Majesty...

1699
02:01:49,984 --> 02:01:51,391
...the <i>Duma</i> thought that...

1700
02:01:52,352 --> 02:01:54,392
Everyone expected
that your son would...

1701
02:01:54,592 --> 02:01:56,119
May I know the reasons?

1702
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:58,678
My reasons are personal.

1703
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,269
In that case, I shall
add the appropriate clause.

1704
02:02:05,569 --> 02:02:07,903
It will be spring soon at Livadia.

1705
02:02:09,696 --> 02:02:10,907
Is that where you'll send us?

1706
02:02:12,641 --> 02:02:14,429
Yes, if you like.

1707
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:16,926
We've had no time
to plan ahead.

1708
02:02:17,888 --> 02:02:20,572
I've often thought I'd
like to be a country gentleman.

1709
02:02:21,185 --> 02:02:23,389
I've always liked
to watch things grow.

1710
02:02:24,032 --> 02:02:25,242
It's lovely there.

1711
02:02:26,496 --> 02:02:27,957
The sun is warm.

1712
02:02:29,217 --> 02:02:31,289
And they say the soil
is very good.

1713
02:02:32,288 --> 02:02:34,907
Much of the happiness
I've known I've had there.

1714
02:02:35,264 --> 02:02:36,508
It's now in order.

1715
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:54,005
March...

1716
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,828
...the 15th...

1717
02:02:57,024 --> 02:02:59,129
...1917.

1718
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,801
The Ides of March.

1719
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,619
If only you had acted sooner, sir.

1720
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,648
You think this
could have been avoided?

1721
02:03:49,792 --> 02:03:50,621
Who is there?

1722
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,793
Nicholas Romanov.

1723
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:54,454
Let him pass.

1724
02:05:53,952 --> 02:05:54,935
I'm sorry.

1725
02:05:56,288 --> 02:05:57,433
Please...

1726
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:58,940
...don't...

1727
02:06:00,096 --> 02:06:01,819
Please!

1728
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,796
Please!

1729
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:10,555
I didn't mean to.

1730
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:12,695
Please!

1731
02:06:14,304 --> 02:06:15,865
I'm so ashamed.

1732
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:19,992
I didn't mean to do it.

1733
02:06:20,832 --> 02:06:22,393
Please don't!

1734
02:06:23,104 --> 02:06:25,406
Please don't!

1735
02:06:25,728 --> 02:06:27,190
Please!

1736
02:06:45,568 --> 02:06:47,772
Graduated at Kazan University...

1737
02:06:47,967 --> 02:06:49,593
...with a degree in law.

1738
02:06:50,912 --> 02:06:51,708
Brother...

1739
02:06:52,288 --> 02:06:55,452
...hanged for terrorism
in 1887...

1740
02:06:56,128 --> 02:06:58,430
...by the present Tsar's father.

1741
02:06:59,839 --> 02:07:00,733
Married.

1742
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,160
No children.

1743
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,210
Doesrt smoke.

1744
02:07:07,072 --> 02:07:09,144
And won't let his comrades...

1745
02:07:09,632 --> 02:07:10,581
...smoke.

1746
02:07:13,216 --> 02:07:15,005
Grandson of a serf.

1747
02:07:16,384 --> 02:07:17,878
Well-traveled, I see.

1748
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:20,501
The Tsar should have had
your secret police.

1749
02:07:20,736 --> 02:07:23,103
My party will make
a study of your methods.

1750
02:07:23,744 --> 02:07:26,013
They fail to mention
your sense of humor.

1751
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:27,615
It gets even funnier.

1752
02:07:27,808 --> 02:07:31,004
I want to get to Petersburg.
You want to get to Paris.

1753
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:32,793
It's outrageous.

1754
02:07:32,992 --> 02:07:35,130
We are here in Zurich,
and if I understand you...

1755
02:07:35,328 --> 02:07:38,557
...you want the German government,
which is at war with Russia...

1756
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:41,053
...to take you across
Germany to Sweden...

1757
02:07:41,248 --> 02:07:43,157
...because you can get
to Russia from there.

1758
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,178
I'm offering to stop the war.

1759
02:07:47,072 --> 02:07:49,211
I didn't know you had
so much authority.

1760
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:51,868
If we had a Bolshevik government...

1761
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:54,104
...we'd immediately
make peace with Germany.

1762
02:07:54,304 --> 02:07:57,206
Then how many German divisions could
you transfer to the western front?

1763
02:07:57,664 --> 02:08:01,242
And now you are asking me
for classified information.

1764
02:08:01,535 --> 02:08:05,398
Do you know my government locked up
more Bolsheviks than anyone else?

1765
02:08:05,696 --> 02:08:07,387
How can you expect us...

1766
02:08:07,584 --> 02:08:09,373
...to help you make a revolution?

1767
02:08:09,567 --> 02:08:11,094
You have no sense of proportion.

1768
02:08:11,296 --> 02:08:13,751
All I'm interested in
is power in Russia.

1769
02:08:13,952 --> 02:08:16,407
It's lying on the streets
waiting to be picked up.

1770
02:08:16,832 --> 02:08:19,003
Kerensky won't last.
He's still fighting the war...

1771
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,655
...and the people are
desperate for peace.

1772
02:08:21,888 --> 02:08:23,481
I shall offer them peace.

1773
02:08:24,192 --> 02:08:26,712
Then you'll see
the real revolution.

1774
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,822
I see your jokes
are very subtle.

1775
02:08:30,016 --> 02:08:32,918
A Marxist wants to use the Kaiser.

1776
02:08:34,144 --> 02:08:36,565
And perhaps the Kaiser...

1777
02:08:36,768 --> 02:08:38,840
...can use a Marxist.

1778
02:08:54,239 --> 02:08:55,167
There.

1779
02:08:56,736 --> 02:08:58,743
In a few months,
these will be turnips.

1780
02:08:59,328 --> 02:09:00,605
They're carrots.

1781
02:09:01,311 --> 02:09:02,621
And when they grow...

1782
02:09:02,816 --> 02:09:04,889
...will we still be here to eat them?

1783
02:09:06,207 --> 02:09:07,702
Nicholas Romanov!

1784
02:09:38,432 --> 02:09:40,155
My name is Kerensky.

1785
02:09:41,312 --> 02:09:44,279
I always used to offer
sherry in this room.

1786
02:09:45,024 --> 02:09:46,333
There's none left.

1787
02:09:46,527 --> 02:09:48,731
I haven't much time.
We must talk.

1788
02:09:48,928 --> 02:09:50,684
What's happening to the war?

1789
02:09:50,879 --> 02:09:52,985
We hear the soldiers talking.
One hears of...

1790
02:09:53,184 --> 02:09:54,744
...terrible defeats.

1791
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:56,253
Will we fight on?

1792
02:09:56,448 --> 02:09:57,560
Certainly.

1793
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,996
The future of my government
depends on it.

1794
02:10:00,192 --> 02:10:02,461
We stand pledged to victory.

1795
02:10:02,655 --> 02:10:06,267
What all of us have been through
has some meaning after all.

1796
02:10:07,776 --> 02:10:09,718
Will we be staying
here much longer?

1797
02:10:09,919 --> 02:10:12,156
You will be leaving here
in a few days.

1798
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:15,607
All we do is dream of England.

1799
02:10:16,064 --> 02:10:17,919
We've been very happy there.

1800
02:10:18,592 --> 02:10:20,697
- May I sit down?
- I'm sorry.

1801
02:10:22,976 --> 02:10:24,470
England won't accept you.

1802
02:10:27,007 --> 02:10:28,284
Won't accept?

1803
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,813
King George is my cousin.

1804
02:10:31,008 --> 02:10:32,917
He doesn't seem to want you, either.

1805
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,352
He has to think of his own position.

1806
02:10:35,647 --> 02:10:36,924
Of course.

1807
02:10:37,792 --> 02:10:40,345
I must not make difficulties for...

1808
02:10:40,928 --> 02:10:42,521
Nor will the French.

1809
02:10:42,848 --> 02:10:45,182
None of our allies want to risk it.

1810
02:10:45,792 --> 02:10:47,548
They are at war to save democracy...

1811
02:10:47,744 --> 02:10:48,889
...and you were a tyrant.

1812
02:10:49,343 --> 02:10:50,521
I'm a prisoner.

1813
02:10:51,488 --> 02:10:53,343
Damn them, I'm a father
with a family!

1814
02:10:53,535 --> 02:10:54,681
You will be safe.

1815
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:56,407
I'll see to that.

1816
02:10:56,607 --> 02:11:00,055
There's blood enough on everybody's
hands. I won't have yours on mine.

1817
02:11:00,544 --> 02:11:01,788
Just as soon as possible...

1818
02:11:01,984 --> 02:11:03,391
...you'll be leaving for Siberia...

1819
02:11:03,583 --> 02:11:04,892
...to a village near Tobolsk.

1820
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:06,037
Siberia?

1821
02:11:06,432 --> 02:11:08,057
You will be staying there
for a week or so...

1822
02:11:08,256 --> 02:11:11,125
...until I can organize some way
for you to leave the country.

1823
02:11:11,328 --> 02:11:12,538
From there on...

1824
02:11:12,735 --> 02:11:14,524
...I wash my hands of you.

1825
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:18,843
Why not send us out to Finland?

1826
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:20,533
It's just 30 miles away.

1827
02:11:20,736 --> 02:11:22,940
I'd never get you through
St. Petersburg alive.

1828
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:26,454
Do you realize I'm all that stands
between you and the block?

1829
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:28,381
No munitions.

1830
02:11:29,184 --> 02:11:30,591
No supplies.

1831
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,727
I don't know where the Army stands.

1832
02:11:34,752 --> 02:11:36,378
Treasury is bankrupt.

1833
02:11:36,608 --> 02:11:38,331
The students riot.

1834
02:11:38,911 --> 02:11:40,734
Workers carry arms.

1835
02:11:40,927 --> 02:11:43,294
The Socialists want this.
The Menshiviks want that.

1836
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:46,423
The radicals, the centrists,
the cadets.

1837
02:11:46,848 --> 02:11:48,189
The Bolsheviks.

1838
02:11:49,184 --> 02:11:51,671
I can't arrest them
even if I wanted to.

1839
02:11:51,968 --> 02:11:54,172
We have rights and laws now.

1840
02:11:54,688 --> 02:11:56,957
You had power and no laws.

1841
02:11:57,151 --> 02:11:59,093
I have laws and no power.

1842
02:12:00,544 --> 02:12:01,820
I wish I could help you.

1843
02:12:02,528 --> 02:12:04,284
You had your chances.

1844
02:12:05,087 --> 02:12:06,298
I wish I had mine.

1845
02:13:05,888 --> 02:13:07,262
Revolution!

1846
02:13:10,176 --> 02:13:12,347
Revolution, now!

1847
02:13:14,432 --> 02:13:15,447
Land!

1848
02:13:16,223 --> 02:13:17,172
Peace!

1849
02:13:18,751 --> 02:13:19,995
All power...

1850
02:13:20,319 --> 02:13:21,912
...to the Soviets!

1851
02:13:28,191 --> 02:13:31,966
Not quite like your Parliament.
We haven't English manners yet.

1852
02:13:32,224 --> 02:13:35,606
My government is more concerned
with content than style.

1853
02:13:35,967 --> 02:13:38,749
One detects a sentiment for peace.
That worries us.

1854
02:13:39,103 --> 02:13:40,347
It's mostly the Bolsheviks.

1855
02:13:40,544 --> 02:13:42,300
Nobody pays any attention to them.

1856
02:13:42,495 --> 02:13:44,284
They only have 6 members
in the <i>Duma.</i>

1857
02:13:44,575 --> 02:13:47,423
In your position, I'd put
this Lenin quietly in jail.

1858
02:13:47,616 --> 02:13:48,509
On what pretext?

1859
02:13:48,703 --> 02:13:50,743
I've read his speeches.
Surely you have too.

1860
02:13:50,975 --> 02:13:54,041
I cannot put a man in jail
for what he thinks.

1861
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:55,320
It's in your Bill of Rights.

1862
02:13:55,519 --> 02:13:57,428
He wants to overthrow
the government by force.

1863
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:59,159
We Americans call that treason.

1864
02:13:59,359 --> 02:14:00,733
In Russia, it's always been...

1865
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:04,153
...too easy to lock a man up
because he disagrees with you.

1866
02:14:04,448 --> 02:14:05,877
It's a bad habit.

1867
02:14:06,176 --> 02:14:07,158
If the people want Lenin...

1868
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,658
...they can vote him into power
in December.

1869
02:14:09,856 --> 02:14:11,230
Until that time...

1870
02:14:11,839 --> 02:14:14,228
Rodzianko has finished.
I must speak now.

1871
02:14:14,431 --> 02:14:17,213
I trust I've made my government's
position clear.

1872
02:14:17,407 --> 02:14:19,993
America wants Russia in the war.

1873
02:14:20,191 --> 02:14:21,620
The British government is equally...

1874
02:14:21,951 --> 02:14:23,544
...worried about the
peace demonstrations.

1875
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:25,053
No more than France.

1876
02:14:25,247 --> 02:14:27,997
Russia's contribution is vital
to the Allied cause.

1877
02:14:28,192 --> 02:14:29,501
Let me be blunt, Mr. Kerensky.

1878
02:14:29,856 --> 02:14:33,271
We're offering you 300
million dollars if you fight.

1879
02:14:33,696 --> 02:14:34,939
No war, no loan.

1880
02:14:35,455 --> 02:14:37,560
You cannot buy Russia.

1881
02:14:38,431 --> 02:14:39,675
We will fight...

1882
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:42,425
...because we've already
sacrificed too much.

1883
02:14:42,783 --> 02:14:45,172
We owe it to the dead!

1884
02:14:45,376 --> 02:14:47,743
They must count for something!

1885
02:14:48,096 --> 02:14:49,339
Victory!

1886
02:14:49,664 --> 02:14:51,769
Nothing less than victory!

1887
02:15:08,607 --> 02:15:09,590
Look! Look!

1888
02:15:10,144 --> 02:15:11,835
I've found Tobolsk on the map.

1889
02:15:12,031 --> 02:15:13,406
It's further away than London.

1890
02:15:13,759 --> 02:15:15,254
Yes, <i>ma chre.</i>

1891
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:19,003
Now remember, you are princesses.

1892
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:21,748
If I hear of any misbehavior...

1893
02:15:22,431 --> 02:15:24,668
...I shall be very angry.

1894
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:26,329
We'll be good.

1895
02:15:28,928 --> 02:15:31,131
You're all so big now.

1896
02:15:34,047 --> 02:15:35,869
Help Mama and Papa.

1897
02:15:36,543 --> 02:15:37,972
Yes, we will.

1898
02:15:43,072 --> 02:15:44,566
Goodbye, Alexis.

1899
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,965
I'm glad we're going.

1900
02:15:51,391 --> 02:15:52,504
I hate this place.

1901
02:15:57,247 --> 02:15:58,873
Let me come with you.

1902
02:16:01,151 --> 02:16:03,191
You're too old for Siberia.

1903
02:16:03,519 --> 02:16:04,730
You'll be all right.

1904
02:16:04,927 --> 02:16:06,487
But who will look after you?

1905
02:16:06,687 --> 02:16:09,556
You've never been
anywhere without me.

1906
02:16:18,111 --> 02:16:19,605
Take care of yourself.

1907
02:16:23,743 --> 02:16:25,150
The train is ready.

1908
02:16:25,343 --> 02:16:26,805
This is Colonel Kobylinsky.

1909
02:16:27,007 --> 02:16:29,822
You will be under his command
until you leave the country.

1910
02:16:30,016 --> 02:16:32,405
His orders carry my authority
at all times.

1911
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:34,811
Nicholas, I want my things.

1912
02:16:36,319 --> 02:16:38,261
I want my pictures and scrapbooks.
I want...

1913
02:16:38,464 --> 02:16:39,805
<i>Frau</i> Romanov.

1914
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:41,752
You have kept your head.

1915
02:16:41,952 --> 02:16:43,413
You should be grateful.

1916
02:16:46,911 --> 02:16:48,820
Come along. It doesn't matter.

1917
02:16:49,279 --> 02:16:52,661
No, Vladimir. One goodbye
was enough, please.

1918
02:16:55,455 --> 02:16:56,633
Things.

1919
02:16:57,343 --> 02:16:59,034
Things one can do without.

1920
02:16:59,232 --> 02:17:01,304
They break, get lost.

1921
02:17:02,112 --> 02:17:03,672
One buys and sells them.

1922
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:07,188
The main thing is we are together.

1923
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:05,245
Power stations.

1924
02:18:05,727 --> 02:18:07,254
All railway stations.

1925
02:18:07,647 --> 02:18:08,857
State bank.

1926
02:18:09,567 --> 02:18:10,811
Central telephone exchange.

1927
02:18:23,743 --> 02:18:26,743
The Bolsheviks have taken over
the station...

1928
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:28,285
...the telegraphs...

1929
02:18:28,703 --> 02:18:29,914
...the banks.

1930
02:18:31,295 --> 02:18:33,400
How strong are they?

1931
02:18:33,919 --> 02:18:36,024
If we had loyal troops...

1932
02:18:36,223 --> 02:18:38,328
...how many would it take
to dislodge them?

1933
02:18:38,527 --> 02:18:40,698
One regiment would be enough.

1934
02:18:42,143 --> 02:18:43,867
But I haven't got a regiment.

1935
02:18:44,383 --> 02:18:45,365
Not one I can trust.

1936
02:18:47,039 --> 02:18:50,335
Yes, but there's only
a handful of them, surely!

1937
02:18:50,783 --> 02:18:53,751
We could smash them
if we acted now!

1938
02:18:54,432 --> 02:18:57,082
We told the people
to go on with the war.

1939
02:18:57,279 --> 02:18:58,970
Lenin offered peace.

1940
02:18:59,263 --> 02:19:01,336
That's where we went wrong.

1941
02:19:02,112 --> 02:19:03,388
Look at this.

1942
02:19:07,711 --> 02:19:09,238
The cruiser <i>Aurora.</i>

1943
02:19:10,335 --> 02:19:12,637
And every gun is trained on us.

1944
02:19:18,784 --> 02:19:20,377
The government has fallen.

1945
02:19:34,335 --> 02:19:36,702
We shall now begin to construct...

1946
02:19:36,895 --> 02:19:38,105
...the Socialist order.

1947
02:20:10,943 --> 02:20:12,187
What's it say?

1948
02:20:12,927 --> 02:20:14,389
It's twenty-one below.

1949
02:20:15,007 --> 02:20:16,284
It feels like it.

1950
02:20:17,471 --> 02:20:19,544
How can you go out
in this weather?

1951
02:20:19,743 --> 02:20:21,085
Gilliard's waiting.

1952
02:20:21,311 --> 02:20:23,678
And besides, I quite enjoy it.

1953
02:20:32,959 --> 02:20:35,293
That's the second time
this morning.

1954
02:20:35,743 --> 02:20:38,645
There's so little else to do.
I keep forgetting.

1955
02:20:38,975 --> 02:20:40,600
Arert you bored, Madame?

1956
02:20:42,367 --> 02:20:44,189
At times, I actually like it.

1957
02:20:44,383 --> 02:20:47,830
Mending clothes and teaching class
and quiet afternoons.

1958
02:20:48,255 --> 02:20:51,419
I doze and daydream
and I think about my life.

1959
02:20:53,663 --> 02:20:55,638
I don't know what I did wrong.

1960
02:20:57,247 --> 02:20:58,971
I'd feel better if I did.

1961
02:21:01,247 --> 02:21:02,938
Here, take it if it helps.

1962
02:21:21,663 --> 02:21:22,940
Christ!

1963
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:25,813
I can't trust my own men.

1964
02:21:26,015 --> 02:21:27,705
Anything could set them off.

1965
02:21:28,191 --> 02:21:31,224
I don't give orders anymore.
I make suggestions.

1966
02:21:31,455 --> 02:21:33,016
They go and vote.

1967
02:21:33,983 --> 02:21:36,372
Tomorrow they could vote to hang me.

1968
02:21:36,767 --> 02:21:38,076
It's absurd.

1969
02:21:38,975 --> 02:21:39,903
They're decent boys.

1970
02:21:40,095 --> 02:21:41,917
They were once, but they're
Ionely now.

1971
02:21:42,111 --> 02:21:44,445
Cold and scared to death.

1972
02:21:46,527 --> 02:21:47,901
Have you got any money?

1973
02:21:48,223 --> 02:21:49,238
Not much.

1974
02:21:49,631 --> 02:21:50,492
Why?

1975
02:21:50,847 --> 02:21:53,629
Has it crossed your mind I represent
a nonexistent government?

1976
02:21:53,823 --> 02:21:55,710
Who put me in this post,
gave me authority?

1977
02:21:55,903 --> 02:21:58,554
Whose money pays the troops?
Kerensky's gone.

1978
02:21:58,783 --> 02:22:00,888
The money's gone.
I haven't paid them in a month.

1979
02:22:01,087 --> 02:22:02,843
You think I should pay them?

1980
02:22:03,391 --> 02:22:05,366
The prisoners keep the guard.

1981
02:22:05,727 --> 02:22:07,898
I wish I'd had you
for my finance minister.

1982
02:22:08,095 --> 02:22:09,622
You'd have revolutionized
the penal system.

1983
02:22:09,823 --> 02:22:10,837
Don't laugh.

1984
02:22:11,039 --> 02:22:12,632
Shall I take the collection?

1985
02:22:13,055 --> 02:22:15,422
In Tobolsk, there
are rumors of civil war.

1986
02:22:15,615 --> 02:22:17,720
God only knows what's going on!

1987
02:22:18,527 --> 02:22:21,112
Out here, exposed like this.

1988
02:22:23,455 --> 02:22:25,659
That's not to keep you in here.

1989
02:22:25,983 --> 02:22:28,023
It's to keep them out.

1990
02:22:28,447 --> 02:22:29,243
Them?

1991
02:22:30,047 --> 02:22:32,468
- Who are you expecting?
- I don't know.

1992
02:22:33,631 --> 02:22:35,835
I hate this damned assignment!

1993
02:22:37,887 --> 02:22:39,829
I can't answer for your safety.

1994
02:22:40,415 --> 02:22:42,171
I can't do my job.

1995
02:22:44,031 --> 02:22:46,332
You care what happens to us,
don't you?

1996
02:22:47,775 --> 02:22:49,269
It's my job to.

1997
02:22:52,991 --> 02:22:54,485
What was that about?

1998
02:22:55,711 --> 02:22:57,685
Apparently there's a civil war.

1999
02:22:59,647 --> 02:23:01,173
I'm not surprised.

2000
02:23:01,951 --> 02:23:04,472
Too many people had too much to lose.

2001
02:23:04,863 --> 02:23:05,943
He's worried.

2002
02:23:06,847 --> 02:23:07,992
We all are.

2003
02:23:57,215 --> 02:23:58,491
Put it down, Vollinski.

2004
02:23:58,815 --> 02:23:59,763
Go to hell!

2005
02:24:01,215 --> 02:24:02,044
I'll shoot.

2006
02:24:08,895 --> 02:24:11,197
Monsieur Gilliard wants you
for your history lesson.

2007
02:24:11,391 --> 02:24:13,016
Don't keep him waiting.

2008
02:24:16,831 --> 02:24:18,293
You too, young man.

2009
02:24:18,751 --> 02:24:20,507
I'm fine. I'm fine.

2010
02:24:23,871 --> 02:24:25,277
- You're cut.
- Hands off!

2011
02:24:25,471 --> 02:24:26,616
You'd better see the doctor.

2012
02:24:26,815 --> 02:24:28,276
I said, hands off!

2013
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:30,617
Dr. Botkin hasn't had a thing
to do for weeks.

2014
02:24:30,815 --> 02:24:32,538
It's making him difficult
to live with.

2015
02:24:32,735 --> 02:24:34,361
You'd be doing us all a favor.

2016
02:24:35,486 --> 02:24:36,435
You dizzy?

2017
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:38,166
I'm all right.

2018
02:24:38,366 --> 02:24:39,676
Come on, then.

2019
02:24:39,871 --> 02:24:41,300
My wife's a nurse.

2020
02:24:41,887 --> 02:24:43,676
They'll fix you up between them.

2021
02:25:15,007 --> 02:25:16,533
So that's how it's done.

2022
02:25:16,735 --> 02:25:18,677
I've never celebrated Easter
with real eggs.

2023
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:21,563
When they dry, rub them with bacon fat
to make them shine.

2024
02:25:21,759 --> 02:25:24,093
- I want to do the next one.
- I used to dread Easter.

2025
02:25:24,287 --> 02:25:28,084
I had to kiss the whole court
three times. Sixteen hundred people!

2026
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:31,548
They used to line up to be kissed.
It puts you off kissing.

2027
02:25:33,887 --> 02:25:35,164
Christ has risen.

2028
02:25:35,358 --> 02:25:36,471
Christ has risen.

2029
02:25:41,471 --> 02:25:42,748
They've started to dance.

2030
02:25:42,942 --> 02:25:44,535
Can we see? Please!

2031
02:25:44,735 --> 02:25:45,880
- Come on.
- Let's!

2032
02:25:47,038 --> 02:25:48,413
Open the door.

2033
02:25:54,367 --> 02:25:56,090
They look so happy.

2034
02:25:56,351 --> 02:25:57,976
Let's go out to them.

2035
02:25:58,239 --> 02:25:59,449
I don't think we should.

2036
02:25:59,647 --> 02:26:00,792
Mother, please! Let's!

2037
02:26:43,518 --> 02:26:45,144
Go and join your sisters.

2038
02:26:46,367 --> 02:26:47,260
No.

2039
02:27:11,231 --> 02:27:14,460
- And authorizing transfer
of command to me.

2040
02:27:14,943 --> 02:27:17,212
By order of the Central
Committee in Moscow.

2041
02:27:17,791 --> 02:27:19,416
It seems in order, Commissar.

2042
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:22,685
Are you at liberty to say
what Moscow wants them for?

2043
02:27:22,878 --> 02:27:24,439
No, Colonel, I can't tell you.

2044
02:27:24,798 --> 02:27:26,107
I don't know.

2045
02:27:27,039 --> 02:27:29,242
How soon can transport
for the prisoners be organized?

2046
02:27:29,439 --> 02:27:31,446
- What kind of transport?
- Anything that moves.

2047
02:27:31,647 --> 02:27:34,102
- Tomorrow sometime.
- Good. We leave tomorrow night.

2048
02:27:34,302 --> 02:27:35,513
May I know why?

2049
02:27:37,375 --> 02:27:39,033
The civil war.

2050
02:27:39,487 --> 02:27:41,275
The Whites, they call themselves.

2051
02:27:41,471 --> 02:27:44,089
Conservatives and Monarchists
and Tsarist generals.

2052
02:27:44,287 --> 02:27:45,497
All our enemies.

2053
02:27:45,855 --> 02:27:47,677
They're moving towards Siberia.

2054
02:27:48,254 --> 02:27:49,564
They're powerful.

2055
02:27:49,758 --> 02:27:51,580
Our troops have yielded
half the Ukraine.

2056
02:27:51,775 --> 02:27:53,979
On all fronts, the revolution
is in danger.

2057
02:27:54,175 --> 02:27:55,636
And out here...

2058
02:27:55,934 --> 02:27:57,757
...it's open season
on your Romanovs.

2059
02:27:58,687 --> 02:27:59,931
I'll see them now.

2060
02:28:02,271 --> 02:28:04,158
Can't your government
protect us here?

2061
02:28:04,351 --> 02:28:05,813
We're so out of touch.

2062
02:28:06,015 --> 02:28:07,870
Has your government lost it...?

2063
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:19,639
Has your government lost
its authority too?

2064
02:28:19,838 --> 02:28:22,937
My government is 3000 miles away.

2065
02:28:23,614 --> 02:28:25,949
Out here, they listen when they like.
When they don't...

2066
02:28:26,142 --> 02:28:27,353
...the lines go dead.

2067
02:28:28,478 --> 02:28:31,293
The Ural Soviet has ordered
your arrest.

2068
02:28:31,487 --> 02:28:34,902
They have a prison, just for you,
in Ekaterinburg.

2069
02:28:35,103 --> 02:28:36,925
You're less than
popular out here.

2070
02:28:37,375 --> 02:28:40,058
Am I beloved in Moscow?

2071
02:28:40,607 --> 02:28:43,476
Do they want me for a
public trial? Is that it?

2072
02:28:44,126 --> 02:28:46,614
And when they find me
guilty, what then?

2073
02:28:47,070 --> 02:28:49,972
They can roast you on a spit
for all I care.

2074
02:28:50,783 --> 02:28:53,500
My duty is to
get you there intact.

2075
02:28:54,142 --> 02:28:56,150
From now on, strict security
will be observed.

2076
02:28:56,351 --> 02:28:58,238
You're confined to this house
until we leave.

2077
02:28:58,463 --> 02:28:59,957
I'll have him first.

2078
02:29:21,695 --> 02:29:22,840
I'm sorry.

2079
02:29:23,742 --> 02:29:25,881
He's an educated man,
at any rate.

2080
02:29:26,366 --> 02:29:28,439
They could have sent an executioner.

2081
02:29:28,767 --> 02:29:29,628
Father?

2082
02:29:30,495 --> 02:29:32,055
There's no hope, is there?

2083
02:29:35,103 --> 02:29:35,932
Nonsense.

2084
02:29:36,734 --> 02:29:38,076
None at all.

2085
02:29:42,719 --> 02:29:43,515
Sit.

2086
02:29:44,127 --> 02:29:45,621
May I ask why?

2087
02:29:46,815 --> 02:29:48,506
Surely my features are familiar?

2088
02:29:48,735 --> 02:29:50,557
Front face and profile.

2089
02:29:51,423 --> 02:29:52,601
Sit down!

2090
02:30:01,598 --> 02:30:03,005
Look at me! It's just awful.

2091
02:30:03,198 --> 02:30:04,278
You look like a thief.

2092
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:05,722
You look like a trollop.

2093
02:30:05,919 --> 02:30:08,090
I don't. What's a trollop?

2094
02:30:08,766 --> 02:30:10,555
Dear Lord, so she does!

2095
02:30:11,007 --> 02:30:12,763
- I don't find that amusing.
- Just look.

2096
02:30:12,958 --> 02:30:14,584
It's not amusing at all.

2097
02:31:10,110 --> 02:31:11,801
The girls won't stop crying.

2098
02:31:11,999 --> 02:31:13,046
How is he?

2099
02:31:14,206 --> 02:31:15,384
I don't know.

2100
02:31:15,999 --> 02:31:17,308
It's not as bad as some.

2101
02:31:17,503 --> 02:31:19,674
The knee will go on swelling
for a bit.

2102
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:22,358
It may be weeks before
he walks again.

2103
02:31:22,846 --> 02:31:24,024
But he'll mend.

2104
02:31:24,895 --> 02:31:25,942
Mend!

2105
02:31:31,455 --> 02:31:32,862
I'm all right, Father.

2106
02:31:33,535 --> 02:31:36,634
- Botkin tells me you'll be fine.
- I tripped.

2107
02:31:36,926 --> 02:31:38,748
I don't believe you.

2108
02:31:39,487 --> 02:31:42,334
I ought to sleep.
They told me to get some rest.

2109
02:31:42,527 --> 02:31:45,461
We are going God knows why
to God knows where...

2110
02:31:45,663 --> 02:31:47,070
...and you do this!

2111
02:31:47,263 --> 02:31:49,270
I have a family to protect.

2112
02:31:51,263 --> 02:31:52,921
What are you doing for them?

2113
02:31:53,150 --> 02:31:54,808
What did you ever do?

2114
02:31:55,455 --> 02:31:58,302
You abdicated, you gave in!
I thought Tsars had to die!

2115
02:31:58,526 --> 02:31:59,388
I did it for you.

2116
02:31:59,582 --> 02:32:01,306
- You could have fought.
- For you?

2117
02:32:01,598 --> 02:32:02,743
I'm so ashamed of you.

2118
02:32:03,551 --> 02:32:06,366
Look at us!
Look where you've put us.

2119
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:09,947
Thinking back...

2120
02:32:12,318 --> 02:32:15,352
When I think back, I can see
them so clearly now...

2121
02:32:15,998 --> 02:32:18,038
...corners that I didn't turn.

2122
02:32:20,063 --> 02:32:21,753
You've had no life.

2123
02:32:22,974 --> 02:32:25,146
The girls have had no life.

2124
02:32:26,142 --> 02:32:27,636
I wasted you.

2125
02:32:28,447 --> 02:32:31,164
I had your future in my hands
and spent it.

2126
02:32:32,574 --> 02:32:33,981
Look at you.

2127
02:32:34,815 --> 02:32:36,603
You're all I see.

2128
02:32:36,798 --> 02:32:38,042
Your faces.

2129
02:32:38,815 --> 02:32:41,270
Why did you abdicate for me?

2130
02:32:41,470 --> 02:32:44,154
Why?
You didn't even ask.

2131
02:32:44,542 --> 02:32:46,103
I didn't want you to pay
for my mistakes.

2132
02:32:46,654 --> 02:32:48,541
Am I not paying for them now?

2133
02:32:48,734 --> 02:32:50,141
Arert all of us?

2134
02:32:51,135 --> 02:32:53,338
I should have had a chance...

2135
02:32:53,534 --> 02:32:57,364
...the right to live my own life,
make my own decisions.

2136
02:32:57,886 --> 02:32:59,741
I could have tried to help Russia...

2137
02:33:00,414 --> 02:33:03,611
...help Mother and my sisters,
and perhaps, even you.

2138
02:33:04,383 --> 02:33:06,619
I could have been a Romanov...

2139
02:33:06,814 --> 02:33:07,894
...a Tsar.

2140
02:33:09,214 --> 02:33:11,189
It all went wrong.

2141
02:33:12,318 --> 02:33:14,457
I hardly know why or how.

2142
02:33:15,999 --> 02:33:18,071
Instead, I just bleed.

2143
02:33:18,590 --> 02:33:20,019
It's my fate.

2144
02:33:20,222 --> 02:33:21,302
I bleed.

2145
02:33:23,262 --> 02:33:24,669
I love you.

2146
02:33:26,174 --> 02:33:27,963
Please understand.

2147
02:33:29,726 --> 02:33:31,352
I do, Father.

2148
02:33:33,214 --> 02:33:35,069
But does it really matter?

2149
02:33:41,182 --> 02:33:42,164
Goodbye.

2150
02:33:43,391 --> 02:33:44,820
What will you do now?

2151
02:33:45,407 --> 02:33:46,584
What can I do?

2152
02:33:46,782 --> 02:33:49,116
Whatever side I join,
I kill Russians.

2153
02:33:49,758 --> 02:33:51,318
I don't know what
to do anymore.

2154
02:33:51,519 --> 02:33:52,599
We're ready.

2155
02:33:56,542 --> 02:33:58,429
What a world this is.

2156
02:33:59,742 --> 02:34:00,538
God bless you.

2157
02:34:01,662 --> 02:34:03,157
It's too late for that.

2158
02:34:04,959 --> 02:34:05,886
But thank you.

2159
02:34:21,118 --> 02:34:23,061
Are you all right?
Does it hurt?

2160
02:34:23,262 --> 02:34:24,123
Would you like it to?

2161
02:34:24,318 --> 02:34:25,266
Not at all.

2162
02:34:25,471 --> 02:34:27,380
Why are you moving a sick boy?
It's inuman.

2163
02:34:27,582 --> 02:34:29,590
I am just taking you to Moscow,
that's all.

2164
02:34:29,790 --> 02:34:31,099
And what happens to us there?

2165
02:34:31,294 --> 02:34:32,090
Get in.

2166
02:34:32,286 --> 02:34:35,069
And pray that when we get out of here,
there'll be a train.

2167
02:35:35,807 --> 02:35:37,432
How long till Moscow?

2168
02:35:37,727 --> 02:35:39,133
Five or six days.

2169
02:35:41,246 --> 02:35:42,555
What are our chances?

2170
02:35:42,750 --> 02:35:43,546
Of what?

2171
02:35:44,062 --> 02:35:45,589
Living till Christmas?

2172
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:47,481
I haven't thought about it.

2173
02:35:48,606 --> 02:35:49,980
You puzzle me.

2174
02:35:50,622 --> 02:35:53,437
You'd be happy to see us dead,
and yet you help us get away.

2175
02:35:53,630 --> 02:35:55,965
I haven't your taste for murder,
Bloody Nicholas.

2176
02:35:56,158 --> 02:35:58,100
I've never had a chance
to get used to it.

2177
02:35:58,686 --> 02:36:02,003
How many men have you killed?
Have you the least idea?

2178
02:36:02,878 --> 02:36:05,213
God knows how many peasants died!

2179
02:36:05,886 --> 02:36:07,828
Nobody counted children.

2180
02:36:08,382 --> 02:36:12,179
You only know the number of soldiers
because somebody counted them for you.

2181
02:36:12,446 --> 02:36:14,202
Seven million!

2182
02:36:15,838 --> 02:36:18,653
Six quarts a man
times seven million.

2183
02:36:19,518 --> 02:36:20,925
It's an ocean.

2184
02:36:23,422 --> 02:36:25,309
You ever seen a battle?

2185
02:36:27,998 --> 02:36:30,420
I'm wrong. You're not
Bloody Nicholas.

2186
02:36:31,582 --> 02:36:34,070
You're a man of no imagination.

2187
02:36:46,974 --> 02:36:48,501
Fit for a king.

2188
02:37:06,366 --> 02:37:08,308
Comrade Commissar!

2189
02:37:08,926 --> 02:37:10,934
Comrade Commissar!

2190
02:37:25,726 --> 02:37:29,272
Greetings from the Ural Soviet
at Ekaterinburg, comrade.

2191
02:37:29,470 --> 02:37:32,786
I have an order authorizing me
to take charge of your prisoners.

2192
02:37:34,398 --> 02:37:35,325
From the Ural Soviet.

2193
02:37:35,838 --> 02:37:38,140
My orders come from
the Central Committee in Moscow.

2194
02:37:38,334 --> 02:37:40,309
I'm not in your jurisdiction.
Move your train.

2195
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:43,321
I want the Romanovs.
I have a legal order for them.

2196
02:37:43,518 --> 02:37:46,518
There's only one legal government
in Soviet Russia.

2197
02:37:46,718 --> 02:37:48,693
One government? Where is it?

2198
02:37:49,438 --> 02:37:50,845
What's it doing?

2199
02:37:51,262 --> 02:37:53,051
They're losing to the Whites!

2200
02:37:53,374 --> 02:37:54,935
They've taken Omsk.

2201
02:37:55,134 --> 02:37:57,239
And they're coming here
to save your Tsar!

2202
02:37:57,438 --> 02:37:59,161
Can your Central Committee
stop them?

2203
02:37:59,358 --> 02:38:01,659
He's not my Tsar.
He's my responsibility.

2204
02:38:01,950 --> 02:38:04,371
I'm not saving him,
I'm taking him to trial.

2205
02:38:04,574 --> 02:38:07,192
We must stay inside the law!
We're not the Okrana.

2206
02:38:07,391 --> 02:38:09,779
That's why we had
a revolution, comrade.

2207
02:38:11,294 --> 02:38:12,439
We're going through.

2208
02:38:12,990 --> 02:38:13,786
Try.

2209
02:38:15,742 --> 02:38:17,302
I'll shoot you.

2210
02:38:19,006 --> 02:38:20,981
And I'll get a medal for it.

2211
02:38:30,142 --> 02:38:31,964
Mine or Moscow's, Commissar?

2212
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:35,194
Whose legal orders do you take?

2213
02:39:49,246 --> 02:39:50,261
Get away!

2214
02:39:59,198 --> 02:40:00,092
Get in!

2215
02:40:05,534 --> 02:40:06,614
What are you doing?

2216
02:40:06,814 --> 02:40:08,919
Only Russians in the truck.
You're Swiss neutrals.

2217
02:40:09,118 --> 02:40:11,092
- They're with us.
- I've got my orders.

2218
02:40:11,294 --> 02:40:12,341
Get in!

2219
02:40:13,086 --> 02:40:14,363
<i>Monsieur</i> Gilliard!

2220
02:40:14,558 --> 02:40:15,638
I'll write!

2221
02:40:15,998 --> 02:40:18,169
I'll try to see you!

2222
02:40:21,502 --> 02:40:22,396
Come on.

2223
02:40:23,230 --> 02:40:24,539
Get out! Come on!

2224
02:40:26,270 --> 02:40:27,764
Hurry up! Come on!

2225
02:40:41,726 --> 02:40:43,253
You must be very tired.

2226
02:40:43,517 --> 02:40:44,892
Come inside...

2227
02:40:45,437 --> 02:40:46,844
...and get dry.

2228
02:41:31,038 --> 02:41:32,598
Is today your birthday?

2229
02:41:34,014 --> 02:41:35,607
That was weeks ago.

2230
02:41:36,254 --> 02:41:37,661
Of course it was.

2231
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:39,517
And mine too.

2232
02:41:40,094 --> 02:41:41,141
I was 46.

2233
02:41:41,662 --> 02:41:42,840
Imagine that.

2234
02:41:43,390 --> 02:41:44,318
Breakfast?

2235
02:41:45,086 --> 02:41:47,355
I'm not hungry. You eat it.

2236
02:41:47,934 --> 02:41:48,916
Nor am I.

2237
02:41:50,462 --> 02:41:51,837
What's the day like?

2238
02:41:52,126 --> 02:41:53,533
I don't know now.

2239
02:41:55,134 --> 02:41:56,595
It doesn't matter.

2240
02:41:57,790 --> 02:41:59,284
It goes on and on.

2241
02:42:01,246 --> 02:42:02,806
I don't know anymore.

2242
02:42:04,350 --> 02:42:06,521
What can God have in mind for us?

2243
02:42:08,542 --> 02:42:09,752
They've left a crack!

2244
02:42:09,950 --> 02:42:10,932
What difference does it make?

2245
02:42:11,133 --> 02:42:13,981
- Look. Something might happen.
- What?

2246
02:42:14,174 --> 02:42:15,700
Something might.

2247
02:42:24,062 --> 02:42:25,524
Go away!

2248
02:42:27,966 --> 02:42:29,492
What do you want?

2249
02:42:31,326 --> 02:42:32,919
Do you want to see me?

2250
02:42:34,142 --> 02:42:35,287
Is that it?

2251
02:42:48,829 --> 02:42:52,986
I'm 21 and I'm pretty.
Everyone says I'm pretty.

2252
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:56,659
- That's the only man who's seen me!
- I know, it's all right.

2253
02:42:56,861 --> 02:42:58,684
He's gone, he's gone.

2254
02:43:00,349 --> 02:43:01,910
You know what's funny?

2255
02:43:03,390 --> 02:43:05,364
I wanted to ask him in.

2256
02:43:07,390 --> 02:43:08,884
Just once...

2257
02:43:10,430 --> 02:43:12,372
...I wanted somebody.

2258
02:43:28,445 --> 02:43:30,867
What is the Ural Soviet up to?

2259
02:43:31,102 --> 02:43:33,469
The Whites are three days away.

2260
02:43:33,662 --> 02:43:36,182
- Can't you make up your minds?
- All right, comrade.

2261
02:43:36,382 --> 02:43:38,651
We've had fresh instructions
from the Kremlin.

2262
02:43:38,845 --> 02:43:42,162
They express confidence in our
ability to handle this difficult...

2263
02:43:42,366 --> 02:43:44,787
What exactly did they say?

2264
02:43:44,990 --> 02:43:46,102
Let me see.

2265
02:43:46,558 --> 02:43:47,802
I've committed it to memory.

2266
02:43:47,997 --> 02:43:51,096
The cable read: "We leave
the matter in your hands."

2267
02:43:51,422 --> 02:43:53,942
Well, that's taking a position,
isn't it?

2268
02:43:54,750 --> 02:43:56,473
Now, what are my orders?

2269
02:43:56,670 --> 02:44:00,412
It's my duty as a member of the
Ural Presidium to act as an observer...

2270
02:44:00,606 --> 02:44:02,362
Observer? Of what?

2271
02:44:02,558 --> 02:44:03,451
The execution.

2272
02:44:03,646 --> 02:44:05,020
That's already decided.

2273
02:44:05,214 --> 02:44:06,708
The question now is, how many?

2274
02:44:06,910 --> 02:44:08,819
You're having a debate on it?

2275
02:44:09,021 --> 02:44:11,160
Everything must be above reproach.

2276
02:44:11,358 --> 02:44:13,332
We hope to bring it
to a vote this afternoon.

2277
02:44:13,534 --> 02:44:17,079
There's a division of opinion about
the children. But as for the Tsar...

2278
02:44:21,245 --> 02:44:23,034
Was it necessary to remove the view?

2279
02:44:23,230 --> 02:44:24,310
Security.

2280
02:44:27,646 --> 02:44:28,661
Good day.

2281
02:44:28,894 --> 02:44:29,821
Good day.

2282
02:44:46,557 --> 02:44:47,964
No sun today?

2283
02:44:49,085 --> 02:44:50,362
What a shame.

2284
02:44:51,101 --> 02:44:53,174
I suppose you're not well enough.

2285
02:44:53,981 --> 02:44:55,737
What's it like being ill?

2286
02:44:57,310 --> 02:44:59,449
What's it like having gray eyes?

2287
02:45:00,030 --> 02:45:01,306
It can't be nice...

2288
02:45:01,694 --> 02:45:04,182
...being an invalid at your age.

2289
02:45:04,510 --> 02:45:07,412
And they can't do anything
to help one.

2290
02:45:07,837 --> 02:45:09,528
What a pity.

2291
02:46:07,965 --> 02:46:08,761
It's gold!

2292
02:46:08,957 --> 02:46:10,299
Let it go!

2293
02:46:35,614 --> 02:46:36,562
You're dead!

2294
02:46:37,053 --> 02:46:38,580
That's all you know about.

2295
02:46:38,781 --> 02:46:39,992
You murder everything!

2296
02:46:40,189 --> 02:46:41,880
You hurt him, and by God...

2297
02:46:42,910 --> 02:46:44,252
You struck the Tsar!

2298
02:46:55,582 --> 02:46:56,989
Bring him outside!

2299
02:46:58,525 --> 02:47:00,435
First thing each morning...

2300
02:47:00,734 --> 02:47:01,879
...put Alexis' brace on.

2301
02:47:02,077 --> 02:47:03,288
I won't let them hurt you!

2302
02:47:03,485 --> 02:47:05,012
Strap it on tight,
Your Majesty.

2303
02:47:05,213 --> 02:47:08,247
He doesn't like it,
but it's good for him.

2304
02:47:08,637 --> 02:47:09,782
Dear God!

2305
02:47:13,918 --> 02:47:15,325
I won't let them.

2306
02:47:37,757 --> 02:47:39,284
You can save him.

2307
02:47:39,709 --> 02:47:40,756
You can stop it.

2308
02:47:41,117 --> 02:47:42,044
Certainly.

2309
02:47:42,270 --> 02:47:45,085
Your man started it.
He should be punished.

2310
02:47:45,277 --> 02:47:46,325
He will be.

2311
02:47:46,525 --> 02:47:47,540
And Nagorny?

2312
02:47:49,469 --> 02:47:51,062
Taking someone's life.

2313
02:47:52,062 --> 02:47:53,338
No man should have that power.

2314
02:47:54,109 --> 02:47:55,451
You had it.

2315
02:47:55,710 --> 02:47:56,538
Yes.

2316
02:47:58,461 --> 02:48:02,106
And I have learned that a strong man
has no need of power.

2317
02:48:02,301 --> 02:48:04,636
And a weak man is destroyed by it.

2318
02:48:05,885 --> 02:48:08,536
I am being punished
for what I have done.

2319
02:48:09,181 --> 02:48:11,036
Nagorny is innocent.

2320
02:48:11,230 --> 02:48:12,604
He's like a child.

2321
02:48:12,894 --> 02:48:14,901
You don't shoot children, do you?

2322
02:48:15,166 --> 02:48:17,654
In your new world,
are there penalties for innocence?

2323
02:48:18,013 --> 02:48:19,093
Sometimes.

2324
02:48:22,142 --> 02:48:25,241
It takes a wise judge
to know who is innocent...

2325
02:48:26,014 --> 02:48:27,475
...and who is guilty.

2326
02:48:28,798 --> 02:48:30,324
I wish I knew.

2327
02:48:33,694 --> 02:48:35,100
I'll do what I can.

2328
02:48:36,349 --> 02:48:37,178
Thank you.

2329
02:48:44,062 --> 02:48:46,167
I'd like to kill him.

2330
02:48:46,942 --> 02:48:48,349
Wait and see.

2331
02:48:49,374 --> 02:48:50,519
He'll do what's right.

2332
02:48:50,782 --> 02:48:52,123
I know him. He's a murderer.

2333
02:48:52,317 --> 02:48:53,626
He's a thoughtful man.

2334
02:48:53,822 --> 02:48:55,578
He'll send Nagorny back to us.

2335
02:48:55,773 --> 02:48:57,050
He's not a monster.

2336
02:48:58,206 --> 02:49:00,923
I've never known a heart
without some murder in it.

2337
02:49:02,302 --> 02:49:03,828
I made these men.

2338
02:49:04,701 --> 02:49:06,457
They are our Russians.

2339
02:49:06,846 --> 02:49:08,918
I am responsible for what they are.

2340
02:49:09,374 --> 02:49:10,781
I let them starve.

2341
02:49:11,038 --> 02:49:13,493
I put them in prisons
and I shot them.

2342
02:49:14,590 --> 02:49:16,346
If there's hatred in them now...

2343
02:49:16,541 --> 02:49:18,167
...I put it there.

2344
02:49:19,613 --> 02:49:22,515
But they are filled with love.

2345
02:49:22,941 --> 02:49:24,348
And with mercy too.

2346
02:49:25,213 --> 02:49:26,740
You must remember that.

2347
02:49:26,941 --> 02:49:29,113
They are all murderers.

2348
02:49:34,813 --> 02:49:37,082
I'd like to kill them all.

2349
02:49:47,582 --> 02:49:49,305
Acid? Gasoline?

2350
02:49:49,565 --> 02:49:51,605
Can't you just throw them
down the mineshaft?

2351
02:49:51,805 --> 02:49:54,074
You don't approve of this, comrade?

2352
02:49:54,269 --> 02:49:55,960
No, I quite approve...

2353
02:49:56,158 --> 02:49:59,419
...of terror, arson, murder.
Any tool that serves the revolution.

2354
02:49:59,613 --> 02:50:03,323
As a member of the Ural Presidium,
it's my duty to see that...

2355
02:50:21,821 --> 02:50:23,545
They must hurt very much.

2356
02:50:24,158 --> 02:50:25,270
My fingers.

2357
02:50:26,557 --> 02:50:28,564
They work well enough for this.

2358
02:50:29,406 --> 02:50:31,129
I couldn't play the piano now.

2359
02:50:31,965 --> 02:50:34,267
I used to hear you practicing
when I was in my office.

2360
02:50:34,462 --> 02:50:35,323
Did you?

2361
02:50:36,542 --> 02:50:38,330
Schumann and Schubert.

2362
02:50:39,229 --> 02:50:41,018
I never thought much
of your voice.

2363
02:50:41,245 --> 02:50:42,227
Didrt you?

2364
02:50:44,157 --> 02:50:45,946
Never told me that before.

2365
02:50:46,781 --> 02:50:49,334
I suddenly thought of
the yacht this morning.

2366
02:50:49,982 --> 02:50:52,535
Remember how the band
used to play all the time?

2367
02:50:53,533 --> 02:50:54,962
And out of tune.

2368
02:50:55,453 --> 02:50:56,730
Do you think they drank?

2369
02:50:56,925 --> 02:50:58,486
How did that waltz go?

2370
02:51:06,173 --> 02:51:07,962
You're no better than the band.

2371
02:51:36,414 --> 02:51:37,974
Your beautiful hands.

2372
02:51:42,205 --> 02:51:43,350
The girls.

2373
02:51:44,893 --> 02:51:46,300
They won't come in.

2374
02:51:46,941 --> 02:51:48,021
We're alone.

2375
02:51:49,661 --> 02:51:51,352
I still want you so much.

2376
02:51:53,181 --> 02:51:54,937
Nothing can change that, Sunny.

2377
02:51:56,381 --> 02:51:57,657
I do love you.

2378
02:52:13,725 --> 02:52:15,383
I'm sure it's getting nearer.

2379
02:52:15,581 --> 02:52:16,726
How far now?

2380
02:52:18,781 --> 02:52:20,308
It's hard to tell.

2381
02:52:21,821 --> 02:52:23,250
Perhaps thirty miles.

2382
02:52:24,062 --> 02:52:25,305
Thirty miles.

2383
02:52:32,125 --> 02:52:34,035
They've been here all morning.

2384
02:52:34,429 --> 02:52:35,923
Why don't they go away?

2385
02:52:49,949 --> 02:52:51,575
Can't they make up their minds?

2386
02:52:53,214 --> 02:52:54,740
I'm sure it's getting nearer.

2387
02:52:57,054 --> 02:52:58,395
I'm going to phone again.

2388
02:53:08,669 --> 02:53:09,465
Go on.

2389
02:53:17,277 --> 02:53:18,105
It's all of them.

2390
02:53:18,461 --> 02:53:20,185
I could have told you that.

2391
02:53:21,341 --> 02:53:22,585
It's about time.

2392
02:53:24,894 --> 02:53:26,323
I kept their mail.

2393
02:53:26,525 --> 02:53:28,859
I didn't know whether
they ought to have it.

2394
02:53:29,085 --> 02:53:30,940
Shall I give it to them now?

2395
02:53:31,133 --> 02:53:32,922
Would it be cruel...

2396
02:53:33,309 --> 02:53:35,000
...or kind?

2397
02:53:35,229 --> 02:53:37,979
I don't know how to judge
these things.

2398
02:53:38,813 --> 02:53:40,952
I don't think anyone knows.

2399
02:53:47,613 --> 02:53:48,541
Listen.

2400
02:53:48,733 --> 02:53:50,042
Nikolasha writes:

2401
02:53:50,237 --> 02:53:52,692
"Saw Vladimir walking in
the Nevsky Prospokt.

2402
02:53:52,893 --> 02:53:55,959
Old fool, all dressed up
in his Imperial gold uniform.

2403
02:53:56,573 --> 02:53:58,134
Nobody seems to mind."

2404
02:53:59,710 --> 02:54:01,051
Listen to Grandmama:

2405
02:54:01,245 --> 02:54:02,652
"Remember to dress for dinner.

2406
02:54:02,845 --> 02:54:06,260
It keeps up one's dignity
and impresses the people."

2407
02:54:06,461 --> 02:54:07,868
Dress for dinner?

2408
02:54:08,061 --> 02:54:10,549
Nikolasha says he'll
join her soon in the Crimea.

2409
02:54:10,749 --> 02:54:11,698
Vladimir.

2410
02:54:11,901 --> 02:54:14,268
He says:
"<i>Ma chre</i>, I've seen this Lenin.

2411
02:54:14,462 --> 02:54:16,371
His suit is wrinkled
and he wears a worker's cap.

2412
02:54:16,573 --> 02:54:18,428
The man will never make a Tsar."

2413
02:54:18,845 --> 02:54:20,667
<i>Monsieur</i> Gilliard's still
in Ekaterinburg.

2414
02:54:20,861 --> 02:54:22,519
He's trying to come and see us.

2415
02:54:22,717 --> 02:54:25,205
Mama's off to England
in a month or so.

2416
02:54:25,565 --> 02:54:27,507
She says the spring
was late this year...

2417
02:54:27,837 --> 02:54:29,081
...but very beautiful.

2418
02:54:31,741 --> 02:54:33,880
Lord, but it's good to be alive!

2419
02:54:36,029 --> 02:54:38,485
The world is like a field in summer...

2420
02:54:38,685 --> 02:54:40,507
...bursting with good things.

2421
02:54:40,861 --> 02:54:41,657
One day...

2422
02:54:42,621 --> 02:54:44,443
...when all the wars are over...

2423
02:54:45,053 --> 02:54:47,475
...someone young will
lead us to the harvest.

2424
02:54:48,541 --> 02:54:50,167
As long as there are children...

2425
02:54:50,429 --> 02:54:52,317
...anything is possible.

2426
02:55:21,597 --> 02:55:22,458
What's happened?

2427
02:55:22,685 --> 02:55:24,725
Get your family dressed.

2428
02:55:24,925 --> 02:55:26,551
- Why?
- We're leaving.

2429
02:55:32,029 --> 02:55:33,109
Don't be afraid.

2430
02:55:33,309 --> 02:55:35,480
The White Army
must have broken through.

2431
02:55:35,677 --> 02:55:37,106
Help Anastasia.

2432
02:56:31,965 --> 02:56:33,525
Wait in here, please.
