1
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:33,794
An Isle of Man signpost
outside a French town?

2
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,621
That's odd.

3
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:38,407
But we've started this tale
at the wrong moment.

4
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:39,993
It really began much earlier.

5
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:46,284
It's the story of a very strange
little character named Bridie Quilty.

6
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,290
The village of Ballygarry...

7
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,287
Deep in the west of Ireland...

8
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:18,462
...in the year 1937.

9
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,032
"Surrender!..."

10
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:23,329
A shot rang out...

11
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,194
"Surrender!"

12
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:29,728
We knew then, Eoghan was caught.

13
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,425
The English were on the floor below
in countless hosts.

14
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,868
Myself and Michael O'Callaghan...

15
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:44,836
...to keep the fair and sacred
name of Ireland unbesmirched.

16
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,792
Ah...it was a shockin' moment
right enough.

17
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,734
For we didn't stall...

18
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:52,865
I looks at Mick...

19
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,373
...and Mick looks at me...

20
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:58,492
There was a strange stillness
on the day.

21
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,264
We crept behind the back of them,
and waited.

22
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:05,390
Then I heard the boards on the stairs
begin to creak.

23
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,055
And the head of the first Englishman
come round the door.

24
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,422
Ping!

25
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:13,765
With me first bullet, I put a partin' in his hair
that his mother could be proud of!

26
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:15,404
Then they were on us.

27
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:18,213
Up the stairs
like rats up a waterspout.

28
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,906
The fight was on!

29
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:23,782
Ah...it was a grand bit of a fight,
right enough.

30
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:28,126
I remember one time...
I turns around and looks at Mick.

31
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,870
Now, I'll never be sure
what he was thinking just then...

32
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:35,241
I know there was only one thought
in MY mind...

33
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:38,265
I was thinkin' about Cromwell!

34
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:41,204
Oliver-Mister-Cromwell!...

35
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:46,358
...caused the death and destruction,
the poverty and persecution...

36
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:49,377
The suffering and starvation that he brought...

37
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:52,683
...on the sacred soil of holy Ireland.

38
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:56,027
We fought like a dozen men,
so we did.

39
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,048
Myself and Mick.

40
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,609
'Til our last bullet was gone.

41
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:01,846
They took us then.

42
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:04,901
And dragged us into the street
to join the others.

43
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,576
There we were...
just a handful of us.

44
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,744
Worn, torn and bedraggled.

45
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,560
Marching down O'Connor Street...

46
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,999
The city we loved, burning around us...

47
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,624
The crowd silent and sad...

48
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:23,646
And then it was...

49
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:27,384
Like as if heaven itself
would bring hope to us, and justice.

50
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,873
A miracle happened.

51
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:32,661
A little black-haired angel of a girleen...

52
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:34,918
...pushed through the line
of English bayonets.

53
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:38,566
She caught a hold of Michael's hand
and started to sing.

54
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:41,094
A simple little song it was only...

55
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:52,302
Down O'Connor Street it swept...

56
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,349
...like a forest fire.

57
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,870
The Revolution was born again...

58
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,322
They would not die in vain.

59
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,831
Night after night, Bridie listened
to that same old tale.

60
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:36,005
That same old song of the Revolution.

61
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:42,468
With her father's death, she grew up
with a bitter hatred of everything British.

62
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:47,126
Until, in the spring of 1944,
she came of age.

63
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:56,656
Bridie, why do you suddenly have to confront us
with a terrible thing, the like of this?

64
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:58,944
Don't you dare bang the table at me,
Terence Delaney...

65
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,661
I've told you so, I have...
'til I'm nearly dumb with talk.

66
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:04,760
The day I'm 21 I said,
and I come in the inheritance...

67
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,179
I'll take the 10.42 from Glenderry Station,
I said, to travel to Dublin.

68
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,598
And that's exactly what I'm doing.

69
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:11,138
I'm not asking you
what you're doing...

70
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm asking you why
you're doing it.

71
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,038
Why child, do you have to choose
a sinful place, the like of Dublin.

72
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:20,048
Uncle Timothy I'm surprised at you
asking a question like that...

73
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,717
...of Danny Quilty's daughter.

74
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:26,279
Timothy Hogan...are you going to sit there
and let a skirt of a girl defy you?

75
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,484
I'm 21...I'm my own mistress.

76
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:32,466
That's an occupation that could
change hands overnight!

77
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:33,280
Can it indeed?

78
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,671
I'm well able to look after myself...

79
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:38,550
...be it in Dublin or Ballygarry...
as Terence here will tell you.

80
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,583
...say nothing at all of Mr McGee there.

81
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:45,096
And Mr Clougherty.

82
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:47,799
Well HE knows I can take care of myself.

83
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:50,461
And while we're on the subject...

84
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:52,957
I fancy we're all being
rather overanxious.

85
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:55,256
After all, Bridie has a mind of her own.

86
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,855
She appears to have made it up.

87
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,123
Thank you, Mr Ransome.

88
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:01,947
Now that's all settled
to nobody's satisfaction but my own...

89
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:02,935
...I'll be getting my things together.

90
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,400
I just want to say how grateful I am
to you all, for your kindness...

91
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:11,072
One of these days you'll be as proud of me
as you were of my father.

92
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,983
Uncle Timothy...are you taking me
to the station?

93
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,561
I'd better go and harness the mare,
I suppose.

94
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,819
Let ME take you, Bridie...

95
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,851
No..no..no..nobody's to come to the station...
Only Uncle Timothy.

96
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:26,173
I don't want my 21st birthday celebrations
interrupted.

97
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,860
You know it is my belief...

98
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,950
...that it was her father who put
all that nonsense into her head.

99
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:40,894
Maybe...he had a power of words
and a very far-reaching imagination.

100
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:44,077
What are you hinting at, Maggie?

101
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,651
I'm hinting at nothing.

102
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,246
Only I'm told, that
of all the men of Ireland...

103
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,564
...that are supposed to have fought in the Rise
and did fight...

104
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:54,929
...the General Post Office and all the buildings of Dublin
put together, wouldn't hold them.

105
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,476
Not that I'm saying a word
against Danny, mind you.

106
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:00,025
Indeed, I should hope not!

107
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,358
Anyone in Ballygarry can tell you
that he set out on his bicycle for Dublin.

108
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:07,594
He set out, alright.

109
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:10,902
But there's a terrible lot of pubs
between here and Dublin.

110
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:15,843
Goodbye, Terence!

111
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:35,169
Quickly...the train's here!

112
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:43,102
Hurry now...we'll miss it.

113
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,535
Goodbye Uncle Timothy!

114
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,368
Take care of yourself, Bridie!

115
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:30,095
His hair is going grey.

116
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:33,263
But it looks very nice,
the way he has it brushed.

117
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:37,405
He has a faraway look in his eyes.

118
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,040
A poet, maybe.

119
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:43,957
No...he's much too clean.

120
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:48,474
And he puts his trousers under the mattress,
like Terence Delaney!

121
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,394
Hasn't he the lovely nails!

122
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,534
He's a gentleman, I think.

123
00:10:56,556 --> 00:11:00,460
I don't like being alone with a strange man,
at this time of night.

124
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,830
He doesn't look that sort of man,
of course, but...

125
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,158
How can you tell?

126
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:09,658
Mr McGee didn't look
that sort of man.

127
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:13,680
And Mr Clougherty
was a terrible shock to me.

128
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,412
He's a traveller from abroad.

129
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:24,482
"Miller"...that can't be an Irish name.

130
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,256
He's English!

131
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:31,497
Of all the compartments in this train,
I have to get into one with an Englishman!

132
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:33,904
Now I might have known it...
will you look at him...

133
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:35,654
Will you look at the cruel set
of his jaw!

134
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,478
You could mistake him for Cromwell!

135
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,139
If he speaks to me,
I shall lose my temper.

136
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:42,516
I shall tell him he looks like Cromwell.

137
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,995
If he speaks to me.

138
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,667
Business...that's all the English
ever think about.

139
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:06,839
You say?

140
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,090
Oh, I was saying nothing at all...

141
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,491
It was just my thoughts
expressing themselves in private.

142
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,141
I beg your pardon.

143
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,750
I feel I should add...there are
other things we think about.

144
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,815
I'd rather not discuss the matter further,
if you don't mind.

145
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,149
You should visit England one day...
It may change your mind.

146
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,339
There's no need...I have an aunt there,
who's told me all about it.

147
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,660
She says the upper classes
are cringing...

148
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,636
...and always moaning
about their troubles.

149
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:37,344
And the lower classes are arrogant...
and think they own the earth.

150
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:38,772
I thought it was the other way round!

151
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:41,489
My aunt runs a servants registry office.

152
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,390
Aha!...

153
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,319
There's no "ah" about it...

154
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,486
She hates the whole lot of them,
and so do I.

155
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,207
My father fought for Ireland
against the English, in 1916...

156
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,316
And if I ever get the chance,
I'll do the same.

157
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,268
For the subject of a neutral country...
aren't you being a little belligerent?

158
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:56,776
There's nothing belligerent about it.

159
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,639
It's entirely a question
of which side I'm neutral on.

160
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,563
Now, if it's all the same to you,
I'll be getting on with my sandwiches.

161
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:27,778
- Is this Dublin?
- That's right!

162
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:30,740
About time for it, too...
I've a terrible crick in the back of my neck.

163
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:39,278
Hey! Where are you going with that?

164
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,502
I'll see you to a cab.

165
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:42,880
Out of the way there, please...
out of the way!

166
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:55,979
Where to, Sir?

167
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:57,350
It's the young lady...

168
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,655
224 Beechwood Ave, is it?

169
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:03,290
I'll give my own instructions,
if you don't mind, thank you.

170
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:03,856
Sorry.

171
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:06,542
Don't mention  it...it's very kind of you...
Goodbye!

172
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:10,434
Would you take me to the
Redmond Porters Gallery, please?

173
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,149
Very good, Miss.

174
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:52,599
I won't be long...will you wait please?

175
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:09,792
Me name is Bridie Quilty and I want to see 
the Deputy Director, Mr Michael Callaghan, please.

176
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:12,934
Mr Callaghan doesn't usually see people 
without an appointment, Miss.

177
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,281
What would your business be?

178
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,041
If you'll just tell him it's 
Danny Quilty's daughter...that's all.

179
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,869
Danny Quilty's daughter...

180
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,622
Liam, keep your eye on the till...
I'm going to see Mr Callaghan.

181
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,912
Can I go inside?

182
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,949
Lastly...a portrait of James Joyce...

183
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:32,863
Painted by that well-known Irish artist, 
Jack Yeats.

184
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,011
This way...keep close to me now.

185
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:39,060
In you come, me loves, 
me doves, me darlin's.

186
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,111
In you come...where are we now?

187
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:44,117
Ah yes...the Gallery of the Famous...

188
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,246
Well, let's see if we can find out 
who they are.

189
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,086
Here's our old friend 
Sir Roger Casement...

190
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:53,513
A lovely man!

191
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:58,518
Knighted by the British for his fight 
against Belgian tyranny over thee in Africa.

192
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:02,630
Hung by the British, for his fight 
against British tyranny here in Ireland.

193
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,165
It's a mad world, me darlin's...
a mad world!

194
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,769
And this is Pádraic Pearse...

195
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:13,098
Commandant and chief of the Republican forces 
during the insurrection of 1916.

196
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:17,474
And this is James Connolly...
one of the founders of the Citizen Army.

197
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:22,202
And here we have Michael Callaghan, 
another leader of the insurrection.

198
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:25,960
Mr Callaghan is now Deputy Director 
of these galleries.

199
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,168
Pass along, please.

200
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:30,406
And here are three famous 
Irish dramatists...

201
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,994
J.M. Synge, Sean O'Casey 
and George Bernard Shaw.

202
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,738
The first being dead, 
and the other 2 living in England.

203
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,852
You asked to see me, young lady.

204
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:44,536
Is it Mr Callaghan?

205
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,559
It is.

206
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,199
Oh, me heart's beatin' like a drum!

207
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,397
To think it's really you I'm looking at 
face to face, after all these years.

208
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:58,947
Didn't the man tell you...?
I'm Danny Quilty's daughter, Bridie.

209
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:01,929
Danny Quilty's daughter Bridie?

210
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,378
But surely you can't have...

211
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:06,989
Oh...now isn't that stupid of me...

212
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:07,883
How could you know me...?

213
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:10,358
I wasn't even born when 
you and father were together.

214
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:12,133
That's what was puzzling me 
for the moment...

215
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:15,370
Would you like to come into my office?

216
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,256
Thank you!

217
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:23,013
Won't you sit down?

218
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:24,329
Thank you.

219
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,068
You know, Mr Callaghan,
the way father used to talk about you...

220
00:17:28,068 --> 00:17:30,301
I feel as if I'd known you all me life.

221
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,196
I can just see you both now, 
waiting behind the back counter.

222
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:37,013
The back counter?

223
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,341
He told me that story 
hundreds of times.

224
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,154
And every time, he made it live!...

225
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:44,323
He was a remarkable story teller, me father.

226
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:45,714
Remarkable.

227
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:49,205
What suddenly gave you the idea 
of coming to see me like this.

228
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:55,559
We're not likely to be interrupted, 
are we?

229
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,975
I don't think so.

230
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,030
Why?

231
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,087
Because, what I'm going to tell you,
I've never told a living soul.

232
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:05,195
I've been storing it up inside me 
until I saw you.

233
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:10,097
I want you to get me into 
the Irish Republican Army.

234
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:12,947
I beg your pardon?!

235
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,882
I want to join the IRA, please...

236
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:18,261
I want to fight against the English...
the way yourself and father did.

237
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:21,336
But my dear child...we're not 
at war with Britain.

238
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:23,952
I know they've a separate war on 
with somebody else...

239
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:24,840
...and we're neutral...

240
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,830
But that's no reason why we shouldn't 
carry on our own private war... 

241
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,116
...that's been going on 
for the last 700 years.

242
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:33,739
But in 1921, Ireland signed 
a treaty with England.

243
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:36,121
Well, what has a treaty 
to do with it?

244
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,951
Well, we got a good deal 
of what we wanted, by it.

245
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,324
Not everything, mind.

246
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:41,997
Ireland is still partitioned.

247
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:45,414
I'm aware of that.

248
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:47,884
But I believe that if England and Ireland 
come together... 

249
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,518
...and discuss it 
on a friendly basis...

250
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,208
...partition won't last very long.

251
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,301
"A friendly basis"?

252
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:58,270
It can't be you, saying these things, 
Mr Callaghan.

253
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,152
Not after the way 
father said you talked.

254
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:04,033
After the fight, yourself and himself 
put up.

255
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:07,001
After all the English have done to Ireland, 
since Cromwell.

256
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,778
Child of grace!...
Cromwell's been dead 300 years.

257
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,017
So? Not in Ballygarry.

258
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,538
No, I'd forgotten that.

259
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:15,464
You seem to have forgotten a great deal, 
if I may say so.

260
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:17,683
Perhaps I'm more in contact 
with reality.

261
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:20,183
Life is real enough in Ballygarry.

262
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,523
It's also very romantic, 
and very remote.

263
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:25,514
We have the papers and 
we can listen in to Raidió Éireann.

264
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:28,857
Young lady...I'm going to give you 
a piece of advice.

265
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:31,331
Times have changed.

266
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:35,134
And believe me, things are best done 
nowadays by constitutional means.

267
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:38,499
So, forget this wild notion, will you?

268
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:39,876
And go home.

269
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,226
You're not going to help me?

270
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,330
No.

271
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,193
But I've come all this way.

272
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,187
I've dreamed of it for years.

273
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:55,233
I'm really very sorry.

274
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,774
So that's all you've got to say!

275
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,581
You're sorry, and do it 
by constitutional means.

276
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:08,512
You've grown old and soft and comfortable 
sitting here, Mr Callaghan!

277
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:11,781
Go out in that gallery... 
and look at the pictures there.

278
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:15,251
Look at your own picture and ask yourself 
if you're the same man.

279
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:17,251
Maybe I'm not.

280
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,749
We all lose something 
as we grow older.

281
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:24,638
But if we're very lucky, we gain 
a little wisdom on the way.

282
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:28,933
All I'm asking you is to think over 
what I've said.

283
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:31,834
Goodbye.

284
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:14,666
There's nothing like books 
for collecting dust.

285
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,261
Yes, they seem to be well-stocked here.

286
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:20,718
I've been looking for a 'Life of Curzon' 
for years.

287
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,989
We were afraid 
you wouldn't be here on time.

288
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:27,737
I was told on Wednesday, in Lisbon...
caught the first plane.

289
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,695
You've got your papers for England, 
I take it?

290
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,854
Yes...I've an Argentine passport...

291
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:38,112
I could have thought of happier excuses...
I don't like bulls.

292
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:40,362
Bulls will be the easiest part 
of your business.

293
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:43,348
Dis you ever meet Oscar Pryce?

294
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:46,003
Yes, in Leipzig, last autumn.

295
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:47,799
Did you know that he was in England?

296
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,699
No.

297
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:51,853
At the moment he's awaiting trial 
in a military prison...

298
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:54,837
...in a little place called Wynbridge Vale, 
in the west country.

299
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:56,422
Bad luck.

300
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:57,600
Well?

301
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:01,226
Pryce has vital information...
we HAVE to know what it is.

302
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,417
How?

303
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,463
We must get him 
out of that prison.

304
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,879
I see what you mean about the bulls.

305
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,600
If we lost 20 lives over this matter, 
it would be worth it.

306
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,463
Was anyone else arrested?

307
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:13,287
I don't know.

308
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:16,862
Then they may be suspect, 
in which case I don't use them.

309
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:19,515
I'll have to get an entirely 
new team together.

310
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,887
Do we know when Pryce will be tried?

311
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:23,768
No.

312
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:24,691
Or where?

313
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:25,783
No.

314
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:29,113
Know anything that's likely 
to help us in any way?

315
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:30,187
Nothing I'm afraid...

316
00:23:30,187 --> 00:23:33,043
Except that I found this little guide book 
to Wynbridge Vale.

317
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:35,336
It'll show you the lie of the land.

318
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:36,342
Thank you.

319
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:40,054
I must call on the town clerk...
I'm sure he'll be delighted to lend us a hand.

320
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:41,714
Good luck.

321
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,440
Goodbye.

322
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,869
Are these all the German books 
you've got?

323
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,745
I'm afraid we haven't many 
at the moment, Miss.

324
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:54,138
How about this?

325
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:56,140
"German Without a Master, in 3 Months".

326
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,123
You haven't got one 
that'll do it in less?

327
00:23:58,123 --> 00:23:58,878
I'm afraid not.

328
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:01,321
Well, maybe I can skip some of it.
How much?

329
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:02,274
Three and sixpence.

330
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:05,651
Thank you.

331
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:15,559
- Are you taking that book, Sir?

332
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,297
 What? ...Oh yes.

333
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:19,841
'Guides to Wynbridge Bay'...
2 shillings, Sir, please.

334
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:23,448
But you'll want some change, Sir.

335
00:25:09,415 --> 00:25:12,124
300 years he's stood there, 
with nobody taking any interest in him.

336
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:13,698
Except the seagulls.

337
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,018
That ain't seagulls.

338
00:25:15,018 --> 00:25:17,771
There wasn't any paint on him 
when the pubs turned out last night.

339
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:19,962
It's after they turn out 
that things happen.

340
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:45,295
Well i reckon, whoever did it 
must've been plastered.

341
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,159
Nobody left here, plastered, last night.

342
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,046
One or two were giving 
a passable imitation.

343
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:51,914
Hello, Bridie...had your picture taken yet?

344
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:54,782
Get away with you!...
I'm not competing with Betty Grable!

345
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:58,254
Reggie's got a pinup of Betty, 
behind his bed.

346
00:25:58,254 --> 00:26:00,617
Hasn't looked at it 
since Bridie came here.

347
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:03,260
You'd be surprised the difference 
she's made to Grandfather.

348
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:05,622
He hasn't been on his feet for years...

349
00:26:05,622 --> 00:26:07,916
The other day, he went
right round his room, 4 times.

350
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,158
Did he catch her?

351
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,215
But they're a nice bunch of boys, 
Granddad...

352
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:15,535
You're too young to have 
anything to do with soldiers.

353
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,361
Well, I only talk to them.

354
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:20,250
You went out with that Sgt Harris 
on your last half-day.

355
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,673
Well, where's the harm in that...
he's very shy.

356
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:24,706
They're the worst.

357
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:26,163
Are you there, Bridie?

358
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:28,189
I'll be with you right away, 
Mrs Edwards.

359
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,909
I can let you have the room in the front 
until Saturday...

360
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:34,515
But I may have to change you then.

361
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:35,216
That's alright.

362
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:37,608
Now...the registration form please.

363
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,674
Dry spell of weather we're having.

364
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:44,544
Very.

365
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:46,778
River's low, they tell me.

366
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:47,692
Is it?

367
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:49,537
Bad for the salmon, I understand.

368
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:51,183
Yes, I suppose so.

369
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:53,329
I thought perhaps you were here
 for the fishing.

370
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:54,632
Very few people come 
for anything else.

371
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:56,864
Really? It seems to be 
quite a pleasant little town.

372
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:59,378
Close to the sea...lovely country.

373
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:03,958
In fact everything that goes 
to make a holiday.

374
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,848
Bridie...show this gentleman 
up to No. 16...would you?

375
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:08,127
Yes, Mrs Edwards.

376
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:10,879
This way, Sir.

377
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,901
Thank you.

378
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,543
Nice young man!

379
00:27:18,423 --> 00:27:19,635
I'll have another, Mrs Edwards.

380
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:39,760
Will you watch your head now.

381
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:44,196
I forgot to tell you about the step.
This will be your room.

382
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,632
Irish...mm?

383
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:48,321
I've got an Irish grandmother 
on my father's side.

384
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:49,960
At least, half-Irish.

385
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,201
Indeed!?

386
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,335
Quaint old place, this.

387
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:54,526
How far's the sea?

388
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:55,506
About a mile and a half.

389
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,444
Will there be anything else 
you require, please...?

390
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:58,574
It's me half-day.

391
00:27:58,574 --> 00:28:00,017
No, I don't think so, thank you.

392
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:00,726
Thank you.

393
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,687
I suppose you wouldn't know anyone...

394
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:05,297
...who could show me round the town 
this afternoon by any chance?

395
00:28:05,297 --> 00:28:06,663
I would not.

396
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,372
No...I only wondered.

397
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:10,109
You're awful quick, aren't you?

398
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:13,416
Sorry...I've been working very closely 
with the American army.

399
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:17,479
The cheek of him!

400
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,410
Sgt Harris is here, Bridie.

401
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,234
Oh...I'll be with him in a minute.

402
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:27,151
She's just coming.

403
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,546
You're early...she's not off 
'til 1 o'clock, you know.

404
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:33,441
You're not going to interfere 
with love's young dream, are you?

405
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:35,794
Nightmare, you mean...
that half of it.

406
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:37,101
You'd like to be in my shoes.

407
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:39,508
As long as I don't have to 
get behind that moustache.

408
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,805
I'm ready, Harry.

409
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,794
She's ready, Harry...
Have a good time, Sarge!

410
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,705
And don't forget that girl you left behind in Luton.

411
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:51,750
Good luck, Sarge!

412
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:53,621
Hello!

413
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,989
May I have another, Mrs Edwards?

414
00:28:58,989 --> 00:28:59,763
Of course.

415
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:01,795
I suppose you wouldn't have such a thing 
as a small Scotch.

416
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:02,648
Certainly.

417
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:04,566
Well, this IS an historic town, alright!

418
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,866
I see someone's been 
touching up old Cromwell.

419
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:08,619
- Have they found the culprit?
- I don't think so.

420
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,695
Well, whoever it was, they never came 
from this place.

421
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,876
Most of my customers last night 
were military, from the prison.

422
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:14,757
Winmore Prison?

423
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:16,465
That's right.

424
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:18,426
Out on the old Roman road, isn't it?

425
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:21,463
I couldn't say...
Like you, I'm only a visitor.

426
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:24,506
I thought nobody visited Wynbridge, 
except for fishing.

427
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:27,761
Mr Miller's a cattle-breeder 
over from The Argentine to buy bulls.

428
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:30,387
Seems a long way to travel 
for a thing like that.

429
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:32,276
Long way for bulls, too.

430
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:33,072
What time's dinner?

431
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,206
- Supper's at 7.30.
- Thank you.

432
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,285
...over from the RAF...
So naturally it wasn't in very good condition.

433
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:03,117
We were about 10 miles past Burnham 
when it broke down.

434
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:05,176
It was the transport officer's 
responsibility really...

435
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:07,796
But he was away sick...
So I said to Corporal Groves...

436
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:09,679
That's the ginger-haired fellow 
I was telling you about...

437
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,000
...to take a look at the carburettor...

438
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,622
It's getting very late, Harry.

439
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:14,767
You don't have to 
go in yet, do you?

440
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:16,417
I'm supposed to be in  by 10.30.

441
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:17,777
Oh, but you can wait a little.

442
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,728
I haven't said half the things 
I wanted to say.

443
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:24,997
And I've been talking "Army shop" 
to you for the last 3 hours.

444
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,028
I shall kick myself for that 
when I get back.

445
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:30,071
It's been very interesting Harry,
 it has indeed...

446
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,331
But I simply must go in.
Mrs Edwards will be mad at me.

447
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:35,550
Goodbye now.

448
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,251
I'm extremely sorry I'm so late, 
Mrs Edwards...

449
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:00,882
I'd have given you the key, 
if I'd known.

450
00:31:00,882 --> 00:31:02,186
I should have told you.

451
00:31:02,186 --> 00:31:03,079
I apologise.

452
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:08,127
Can't think where you can find to go 
at this time of night.

453
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:09,653
A place like Wynbridge.

454
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:13,097
I had an appointment with a farmer out at Matchcombe...
I missed the last bus.

455
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:14,817
Goodnight...and thank you.

456
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:16,130
Goodnight.

457
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:28,838
- I'm here.
- Quiet!

458
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:36,442
Well...?

459
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:40,154
They're taking Pryce to London 
on the 9.15 on Tuesday evening.

460
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,269
Tuesday?

461
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,389
They allow half an hour 
from the prison to the station...

462
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:45,676
...arriving 20 minutes before the train.

463
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:46,967
He wasn't suspicious?

464
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:47,805
No. 

465
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,069
Asked me what evening I could get off...
Said he couldn't manage Tuesday...

466
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,285
...and then told me the rest.

467
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,336
A  bit here...and a bit there.

468
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:56,388
You did better than I expected.

469
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:58,915
I don't feel as if 
I'd done anything at all.

470
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,631
It was all so simple.

471
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:03,920
You showed that young man in No.16 
up  to his room...

472
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,809
I did.

473
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:05,544
What do you make of him?

474
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:08,481
He's far too sure of himself, 
all together.

475
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:12,248
You mean he's the over-confident type?
So much the better. 

476
00:32:12,248 --> 00:32:13,699
Why? Who is he?

477
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,853
An intelligence officer.

478
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:19,705
I expected one to materialise, 
before they transferred a prisoner like Pryce.

479
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:20,953
The usual precaution.

480
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:23,014
What makes you think he's that.

481
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:25,681
He booked here 'til Tuesday...
knew where the prisoner was...

482
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:26,896
...and then went to the police station.

483
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:29,580
He's an army officer...
and he's not interested in fishing.

484
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,173
Other than conversationally.

485
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:33,789
I'd never have thought of all that.

486
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,428
Do you think he'll find out anything?

487
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:37,387
He'd be safer out of the way.

488
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:40,533
You're not going to bump him off?!

489
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:42,557
My dear girl!

490
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,786
No...I shall fall back 
on a very simple formula.

491
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:47,292
The beautiful decoy.

492
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:49,397
The oldest of the arts of war.

493
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:51,505
Almost the only feature 
that hasn't been mechanised.

494
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:55,391
Arrange your next half day for Tuesday... 
and persuade him to take you into the country.

495
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,237
Me!?

496
00:32:57,237 --> 00:33:00,199
Keep him away from the town for a few hours...
that will be quite enough.

497
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,448
How can I possibly keep him away, 
if he knows he has to get back?

498
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:06,916
He's young and impressionable.

499
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,338
But I don't like him.

500
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:11,190
It matters little my dear, 
what you like or don't like.

501
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,934
You really mean you want me 
to throw myself at him...

502
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,350
...like a...

503
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:19,838
I might have known this'd happen!

504
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:21,422
I've half a mind to refuse...

505
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,141
I'd never bargained 
for anything like this.

506
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,273
Let's sit here.

507
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,399
Bessy...come here!

508
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,565
How far are we from Wynbridge?

509
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,024
Oh, I don't know...
Not far, I'm sure.

510
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,729
We seem to have been walking for hours.

511
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:48,952
What's the time?

512
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:49,988
My watch is bust.

513
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,361
It's...5.30.

514
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:53,028
You must be slow.

515
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,503
No...I put it right, by the radio.

516
00:33:54,503 --> 00:33:58,075
Tell me...what on earth gave you the idea 
of spending your leave here?

517
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,453
Well...I was at Cambridge 
when the war broke out...

518
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:02,785
...cutting short a brilliant scholastic career.

519
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:06,409
Now I'm trying to pick up the threads...
writing a thesis for my degree, in my spare time.

520
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:08,321
At Wynbridge?

521
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:09,993
It's about Cromwell.

522
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:10,901
Cromwell?!

523
00:34:10,901 --> 00:34:12,776
Wynbridge has one of the ruins 
he knocked about a bit.

524
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:15,856
And you think he's a nice subject 
to spend your time on?

525
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:17,680
Cromwell's a very neglected character.

526
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,970
Not in Ireland!

527
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:20,337
Ah...Ireland!

528
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:23,753
Don't say "ah...Ireland" like that...
Do you know what he did to us?

529
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,587
I know he was an underrated general.

530
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,020
He was a wicked murdering blackguard!

531
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,507
I'm only considering him 
from a military point of view.

532
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:31,126
Who cares about 
"a military point of view"?

533
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:31,684
Me.

534
00:34:31,684 --> 00:34:32,994
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

535
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:36,056
My father's great-great grandfather
knew him well.

536
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:38,364
It's getting a bit remote, isn't it?

537
00:34:38,364 --> 00:34:39,995
There's nothing remote about it!

538
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,195
If you go to my country,
you can see what he did to us.

539
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:44,779
And you sit there and make 
stupid jokes about him.

540
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:46,521
I'm only writing a thesis!

541
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:48,770
I don't care what it is...
And I don't care what lies you tell me...

542
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,009
As long as you don't pretend 
you came here... 

543
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:52,482
...to write a lot of nonsense about
 a black soul like him.

544
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:55,637
We don't seem to be getting along very well, 
do we?

545
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,693
Perhaps we better go back.

546
00:34:57,693 --> 00:35:01,162
No...not yet...it's very early.

547
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:01,819
What?

548
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:04,233
I'm sorry I lost me temper like that...

549
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,274
It's just that...

550
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,898
Couldn't we forget it...maybe?

551
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,239
You know...you're very difficult 
to understand.

552
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,553
Are you sure you're 
quite straightforward yourself?

553
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,001
I suppose it wasn't you who slapped the paint 
on Cromwell's statue the other night?

554
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:20,603
Now why would I do 
a terrible thing like that?

555
00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:22,914
Where would I get the paint?

556
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:26,509
If you smiled at me like that, 
and I was the local paint merchant...

557
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:28,617
...I'd give you the run of the shop

558
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm sitting on a thistle.

559
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:49,659
I thought I was going to land 
an Intelligence job like yours, once...

560
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,688
...but it never worked out.

561
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:51,549
It depends where you are, of course.

562
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:53,656
Til last month , I was stuck in north Scotland.

563
00:35:53,656 --> 00:35:55,207
Absolute dead end.

564
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:56,627
It couldn't be worse than it is here.

565
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:58,242
Lucky, I managed to wag a transfer.

566
00:35:58,242 --> 00:35:59,995
There's much more scope 
where I am now...

567
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:01,561
I mean...take a little job like this...

568
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:03,803
There's nothing to it, is there?
But who knows?...

569
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,472
It's not what you're doing in the army 
that counts...

570
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:08,359
It's what you're noticed doing.

571
00:36:23,956 --> 00:36:25,575
Good evening, Sergeant...

572
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:27,048
Yes, the body-receipt 
for your signature, Sir.

573
00:36:27,048 --> 00:36:28,499
Thank you.

574
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:34,757
I don't know why they always have to 
fix these jobs at night.

575
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,664
Same thought occurred to me, Sir.

576
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:41,007
Not exactly a prepossessing figure 
for an ace spy...is he?

577
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:43,531
I don 't know about that, Sir...
He's a nasty piece of work.

578
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:44,955
I'll be glad to see the last of him.

579
00:36:46,762 --> 00:36:48,687
- All correct Sergeant?
- All correct Sir.

580
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:50,469
- Goodnight to you, Sergeant.
- Goodnight, Sir.

581
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,438
Wheel him into the RTO's office, Sergeant.

582
00:36:52,438 --> 00:36:54,053
Fall in, the new escort.

583
00:36:58,374 --> 00:36:58,374
Right turn.

584
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:29,959
Late, aren't you, Sergeant?

585
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,274
Yes, Sir...we were held up 
by some haycart, Sir...

586
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:33,769
Thought at first it might be dirty-work.

587
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:35,708
Can I see your identity card, Sir?

588
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:37,953
What was it?

589
00:37:37,953 --> 00:37:41,084
Just some fool trying to get too big a cart 
through too small a gate.

590
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:55,076
Ah...here he is.

591
00:38:00,352 --> 00:38:00,946
Good evening.

592
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,215
This is not Pryce!

593
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:09,893
You just collected him from the van.

594
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:14,315
Call the prison at once, Sergeant...
Find out what's happened.

595
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:15,844
- You hold the van.
- I think it's left.

596
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:16,626
I heard the engine running.

597
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:19,870
New escort...take them off.

598
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,237
Right turn.

599
00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:25,389
Quick march.

600
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,224
That was Pryce in that car, 
beside the driver.

601
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:41,840
Of course I'm sure!
Is another car about?

602
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,662
The RTO's...there.

603
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:43,526
Start it up right away.

604
00:38:43,526 --> 00:38:46,567
Get on to HQ...tell them Pryce has escaped 
with another man in a Rover14.

605
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:48,652
Get them to throw a cordon 
around the entire district.

606
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:49,515
Now move, man!

607
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:15,289
It's just struck 9...
Your watch must be slow.

608
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:17,704
You can't have counted right.

609
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:19,282
I counted 9.

610
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:23,098
So it made 9 or 10...
What does it matter?

611
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:25,883
What do you mean, 
what does it matter?

612
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:27,476
Well, does it?

613
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:29,124
Doesn't it?

614
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:31,438
My dear, I could stay here forever.

615
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:34,984
You haven't anything else to do?

616
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:36,100
Not a thing.

617
00:39:36,692 --> 00:39:39,414
Apart from checking up on a gentleman 
who's not mentioned around here.

618
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:41,759
Are you telling me the truth?

619
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,622
Of course, darling...why?

620
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:48,273
You've got me here 
under false pretences!

621
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:48,944
What?

622
00:39:48,944 --> 00:39:50,790
Oh, what a fool I've been!

623
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,562
Of all the low, mean tricks!

624
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:54,632
This is terrible...
I'm going home!

625
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:55,978
What the devil's the matter?

626
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:56,886
What is it?

627
00:39:56,886 --> 00:39:58,589
Bridie...come back!

628
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:03,268
Here, wait a minute!

629
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:16,170
Well...how long 
do you think we've got?

630
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,296
Until 3 in the morning... 
when they get Freddy to London.

631
00:40:19,346 --> 00:40:21,724
The only man who might have tumbled 
was an Intelligence officer...

632
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:23,054
...but I drew him off with a woman.

633
00:40:23,897 --> 00:40:26,043
How they pick these fellows 
is beyond me.

634
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:35,134
I checked up on the town too...
I didn't smell a thing.

635
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:37,267
I suppose I should have been outside 
when the van arrived.

636
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:38,985
That's what I was thinking.

637
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:41,105
You won't be the only one.

638
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:46,584
Yes, I had the whole thing sewn up, 
when they caught me.

639
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:48,423
And I still have, too...
if we can get at it.

640
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:51,064
Do you know what to do?

641
00:40:51,064 --> 00:40:53,796
No, but they wouldn't have sent for ME, 
if it wasn't pretty big.

642
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:54,897
It's big, right enough.

643
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:59,315
Can't you go any faster?

644
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,894
The engine's governed...
she won't do more than 40mph.

645
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,714
Won't catch up with them then?

646
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:05,843
No.

647
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,915
We turn left here, somewhere...

648
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:14,818
That must be it.

649
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:28,571
Hullo!...What's happening there?

650
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:34,779
It's an army truck...can't turn here.

651
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:52,610
Hullo...who is it...who's there?

652
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,070
There's someone there on the right.

653
00:41:58,541 --> 00:41:59,703
That looks like the car, Sir.

654
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:04,426
Yes, it's them alright...Rover14.

655
00:42:06,182 --> 00:42:07,531
Halt or I'll fire!

656
00:42:14,476 --> 00:42:15,845
Did they get you?

657
00:42:30,242 --> 00:42:31,460
I think I'm out of this.

658
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:38,148
Everything is in a notebook 
in the Isle of Man.

659
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,821
Get out!

660
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,027
I could have understood it, 
if you'd gone off the deep end.

661
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,498
But carrying-on in this way...

662
00:43:18,468 --> 00:43:19,910
You might at least give me a clue.

663
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:22,976
Say something!

664
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,436
I don't care what it is.

665
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,064
Anything! But something!

666
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,731
It's all very well striding along 
like a sulky duchess...

667
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,587
But I consider I'm the injured party.

668
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:33,040
You can't go on like this...
there are limits.

669
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,837
I never expect women to behave properly...
but this is fantastic!

670
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:41,967
Absolutely...utterly...fantastic!

671
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:48,520
What are YOU doing here?

672
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:50,055
Has he gone?

673
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:54,507
Yes, he's gone.

674
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,747
But he's not an Intelligence man at all.

675
00:43:57,747 --> 00:44:00,728
He's an ordinary English officer 
on sick leave.

676
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:02,855
I've never been so humiliated 
in my life.

677
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:04,262
It was a terrible mistake...

678
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:08,462
I've been shot.

679
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:10,906
Give me a cigarette.

680
00:44:12,832 --> 00:44:14,112
I'll fetch a doctor.

681
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,560
Give me a cigarette 
and keep your voice down.

682
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:25,956
Nothing can save me... 
short of an operation...I know that.

683
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:28,407
There's a bullet inside me.

684
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:29,549
How do you know?

685
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:31,074
Because it didn't come out.

686
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:33,472
Give me a light.

687
00:44:34,669 --> 00:44:37,562
Apart from which, they'd never get me
 on the table in time.

688
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:40,311
Your hand's trembling...

689
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:43,260
Please try to control yourself...
I've got a lot to tell you.

690
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,691
And there isn't time to say it.

691
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,082
Sit down and concentrate.

692
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,685
I dislike giving orders like these 
to a girl of your age...

693
00:44:56,685 --> 00:44:57,900
...but I've no choice.

694
00:44:58,706 --> 00:44:59,664
Neither have you.

695
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:00,994
You understand me?

696
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:03,394
Now listen carefully.

697
00:45:04,765 --> 00:45:05,864
Something went wrong.

698
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:09,025
Pryce is now either dead 
or in custody.

699
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:11,811
He passed everything on to me.

700
00:45:13,558 --> 00:45:17,452
He was originally arrested in the visitors' gallery 
of the Tynwald Court in the Isle of Man.

701
00:45:18,234 --> 00:45:22,492
He managed to hide the notebook with the information 
in the seating at the end of the second row, on the right.

702
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,524
Remember that...
Second row on the right.

703
00:45:26,715 --> 00:45:29,099
You want ME to go 
to the Isle of Man?

704
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:34,639
No...you'll take my place and meet someone on the train 
which leaves Wynbridge at 7.45 tomorrow morning.

705
00:45:35,895 --> 00:45:37,427
And pass on what I've told you.

706
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:39,183
And how will I know him?

707
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:43,276
He'll be in the 1st class non-smoker 
of the northern section.

708
00:45:43,276 --> 00:45:46,457
1st class non-smoker 
of the northern section.

709
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:48,127
There's only one such compartment.

710
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:50,120
Well, how will he be dressed?

711
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,607
I don't know...he's the next link 
in the chain.

712
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:55,358
You'll ask to have the window 
halfway down...

713
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:57,328
And whoever it is...it may be a woman...

714
00:45:57,328 --> 00:46:02,427
...will reply they have no objection, for 10 minutes, 
because the carriage is stuffy.

715
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,755
You'll both get out 
at the next station.

716
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:08,082
I ask to have the window halfway down...

717
00:46:08,082 --> 00:46:10,385
He'll reply it'll be alright 
for 10 minutes.

718
00:46:12,162 --> 00:46:13,343
Pick up my coat.

719
00:46:18,586 --> 00:46:21,944
In the wallet you'll find 
3 blank identity cards...

720
00:46:22,495 --> 00:46:23,360
You may need them.

721
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:27,664
There's also some money 
and a photograph.

722
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:35,154
If you get a chance after the war...
you might get in touch with the lady.

723
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:39,460
Madame Astanov, at the Hotel Splendide,
Bucharest.

724
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:42,692
Tell her I died for Germany.

725
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:45,207
It'll amuse her.

726
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,515
I've left the worst 'til last.

727
00:46:50,846 --> 00:46:51,441
The worst?

728
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,452
I'm afraid it's a trifle gruesome...

729
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,925
But you see, if my body 
were found here...

730
00:46:57,925 --> 00:47:00,357
...everyone would be under suspicion.

731
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:02,619
You'd be arrested.

732
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:03,656
Perhaps shot.

733
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:07,723
What can I do?

734
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,237
Dispose of me.

735
00:47:13,976 --> 00:47:14,896
Cigarette's gone out.

736
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:42,607
What is it now?

737
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:44,100
What's happened to Bridie?

738
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,891
I been waiting here for me airing
since 7 o'clock.

739
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:48,798
Well, it's her half day off...
You know that.

740
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:51,310
Nobody considers ME!

741
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,822
I promised to play old Brockway
a game of backgammon at 9.

742
00:47:54,822 --> 00:47:56,930
Well, you'll just have to wait, 
that's all.

743
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,668
The bar's bung-full of Home Guards... 
and I'm run off my feet.

744
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,064
Bridie...Just a moment!

745
00:48:39,007 --> 00:48:39,847
Will you leave me alone!?

746
00:48:39,847 --> 00:48:40,793
I want a word with you.

747
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,897
In the ordinary run of things, 
I'm an easygoing type...

748
00:48:42,897 --> 00:48:44,230
I said, will you leave me alone!?

749
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,928
No...I won't.

750
00:48:44,928 --> 00:48:47,146
You're not going to get away with this, 
you know.

751
00:48:47,146 --> 00:48:50,198
If nothing else, I owe it to all the other mugs 
that come after me.

752
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,347
Look, will you leave me, if I promise 
to see you when I get back?

753
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,635
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

754
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:56,523
I'll wait for you in the lounge...
How long will you be?

755
00:48:56,523 --> 00:48:57,304
I don't know.

756
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:02,459
Well, I shouldn't take the old boy far, 
on a night like this.

757
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:20,602
I'll never do it...
I know I won't.

758
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:24,093
It's another half mile before I get out of the town...
someone's bound to see me.

759
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:26,759
What then? It's very dark.

760
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:32,263
I might...I might!

761
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:07,376
Hello sweetheart!

762
00:50:07,376 --> 00:50:09,354
Taking the old 'n out 
for his constitutional?

763
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,723
You're from "The George" aren't you?

764
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:13,103
It's nothing to do with you!

765
00:50:13,103 --> 00:50:14,843
Thought you might fancy 
the benefit of the company...

766
00:50:14,843 --> 00:50:15,923
I'm going your way.

767
00:50:15,923 --> 00:50:16,847
I don't want your company.

768
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,584
- Oh...come on...
- Go away, will you!

769
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:20,438
Listen, sweetheart... 
you got me all wrong!

770
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:23,219
I'm not that sort of fellow. 
I never take no for an answer.

771
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:27,268
Goodnight, Miss.

772
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:28,457
I thought he was annoying you.

773
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:30,453
He was.

774
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:32,551
How's Mr Edwards, tonight.

775
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:33,568
He's fallen asleep.

776
00:50:33,568 --> 00:50:38,938
Between you and me, 
he's been looking a bit seedy lately.

777
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:41,719
I don't think he'll be with us 
much longer.

778
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,217
Taking him down the cliff road 
for a bit of sea air?

779
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:47,789
Want to cross over?

780
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:49,856
Yes, I do please.

781
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,540
OK...just a minute.

782
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:00,377
Goodnight, Miss.

783
00:51:13,463 --> 00:51:16,679
Hullo!...What's happened to Bridie?

784
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,763
Hasn't she come back yet?

785
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:22,940
I shall have to take you out myself, 
I suppose.

786
00:51:30,649 --> 00:51:31,547
Is that you, Bridie?

787
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,322
Yes.

788
00:51:34,322 --> 00:51:35,962
Come here a minute, will you. 
I want you.

789
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:44,896
So you've condescended 
to come back at last!

790
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:48,187
I've been waiting here for you 
since half past seven.

791
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:51,704
I promised old Brockway a game of...
Here! Here! Where are you going?

792
00:51:51,704 --> 00:51:53,979
Help me clear these things away...
there's a good girl.

793
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:56,017
Ada's rushed off again, as usual.

794
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:58,280
And then take Grandad out...
He's getting grouchy.

795
00:51:59,012 --> 00:51:59,893
He's been out.

796
00:52:00,754 --> 00:52:02,490
He was complaining just now.

797
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,989
I don't know what's come over him lately.

798
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,153
He forgets everything.
I took him out half an hour ago.

799
00:52:07,153 --> 00:52:08,833
Well, I don't know...really!

800
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,425
This is too much!

801
00:52:10,425 --> 00:52:12,565
Come on, let's get these things 
out of te way.

802
00:52:15,036 --> 00:52:16,602
I think we'll leave the rest 
'til the morning.

803
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:18,600
My feet are killing me.

804
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,589
I'm going to bed, too.

805
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:28,898
That's right...don't mind me!
Clean up the bar...powder your face!

806
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:29,714
Just a minute, Bridie!

807
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:32,049
Darn a few stockings...I can wait.

808
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:34,233
Don't be silly, Grandad...
she's going to bed.

809
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:35,778
About the morning...

810
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,907
Lieutenant Baynes is leaving first thing...
He's catching the 8 o'clock.

811
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:40,385
Eh...what's that?
Going to bed?

812
00:52:40,385 --> 00:52:42,433
What about my airing?

813
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:45,474
But she's taken you out, Grandad...
You know that very well.

814
00:52:45,474 --> 00:52:47,349
What are you talking about?

815
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:49,526
I haven't moved from this chair.

816
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:51,717
I've been waiting here 
hour after hour...

817
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:53,997
...While she's been out...
gadding about.

818
00:52:54,748 --> 00:52:56,109
What's all the shrugging?

819
00:52:57,365 --> 00:52:59,310
What are you two up to!

820
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,150
We're not up to anything.

821
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,244
She's taken you out 
half an hour ago.

822
00:53:03,244 --> 00:53:05,056
What's the matter with you?

823
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:08,135
There's nothing the matter with me!

824
00:53:08,736 --> 00:53:10,917
I ought to know whether 
I've been out or not.

825
00:53:11,423 --> 00:53:13,788
Didn't I call you 
half an hour ago, Ethel?

826
00:53:13,788 --> 00:53:15,367
And again, just now?

827
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:16,564
Yes, that's true.

828
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:20,871
You can't have forgotten...
I pushed you down Cross St and back.

829
00:53:22,694 --> 00:53:23,669
Cross Street?

830
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:30,455
Did I ever check with old Smart the butcher 
about backing a horse in The Derby, next week?

831
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:32,444
Yeah...something like that.

832
00:53:32,444 --> 00:53:35,508
I didn't then, see...
The Derby was run last week... 

833
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:37,955
And old Smart's in bed 
with pneumonia.

834
00:53:37,955 --> 00:53:39,304
Caught you out, haven't I?

835
00:53:39,304 --> 00:53:42,500
Well it must have been somebody else...
I wasn't paying much attention.

836
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,183
She's lying!
She didn't take me out!

837
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:46,481
She hasn't been near me!

838
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:49,248
I may be an old fool...
but I'm not that bad.

839
00:53:49,248 --> 00:53:52,852
I tell you, she's got some reason 
for lying like this.

840
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:58,126
Have you ever seen Bessie asleep, 
when she hasn't been out for a walk?

841
00:54:00,763 --> 00:54:04,421
Grandad...I simply don't know 
what's come over you.

842
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:07,719
You'd better call Lieut. Baynes at 7.

843
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:09,148
-Goodnight, dear.
-Goodnight.

844
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:21,435
I can't talk to you...I'm sorry.

845
00:54:21,435 --> 00:54:22,804
You've something on your mind, 
haven't you?

846
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:24,821
Will you let me go to bed, please!?

847
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:27,545
Bridie...You came back 
with an empty chair.

848
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:32,680
I took Grandfather out...
You saw me.

849
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,112
He got out of the chair 
and walked in a minute before...

850
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:35,926
Does that satisfy you?

851
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:37,828
- Whatever the answer is...
- I've given it to you!

852
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:42,513
Blast it!

853
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:03,003
A first-class non-smoker 
of the northern section.

854
00:58:04,016 --> 00:58:05,164
This is it, girl!

855
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:10,154
Is that seat taken, please?

856
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,261
No.

857
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:24,938
Would you like a sandwich?

858
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:26,612
They're not Spam!

859
00:58:26,612 --> 00:58:27,280
No, thanks.

860
00:58:39,446 --> 00:58:41,000
What was I saying then?

861
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,679
About that Miss Butlin and the nice young man 
in the Sun Insurance.

862
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:48,950
Yes...of course they've known each other 
for years...

863
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,140
...bought a house in Kingston...

864
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,994
Then he went off and joined the RAF...

865
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:54,224
..and she went into the ADN and now...

866
00:58:54,224 --> 00:58:55,798
...he's marrying a girl from Rhodesia..

867
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,492
..and she's going out with a married man.

868
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,154
from the Ministry of Home Security...

869
00:58:58,154 --> 00:59:01,367
Oh, it's dreadful the things war 
does to people.

870
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,226
They would have made 
such a nice couple, too.

871
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:07,323
The man she's going with
is twice her age.

872
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:08,900
Awful shame!

873
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,012
Of course, her mother's dreadfully cut up.

874
00:59:12,012 --> 00:59:13,798
I was talking to her about it 
last Sunday...

875
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:15,762
...At church.  Her brother 
won't speak to her.

876
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:18,999
Home Security he's in...
fat lot of home security about him!

877
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:21,193
He's a pretty blunt sort, the brother...

878
00:59:21,193 --> 00:59:22,958
It's a pity he couldn't knock 
some sense into her.

879
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,419
Bit late now of course 
after the damage is done.

880
00:59:24,419 --> 00:59:25,635
I wonder...would you mind if I...

881
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:37,360
Now how can I ask to have the window 
halfway down, like Mr Miller said...

882
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,940
...when it's halfway up already.

883
00:59:43,696 --> 00:59:45,789
Could I have the window up, please?

884
00:59:58,156 --> 00:59:59,366
Where was I, dear?

885
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:01,663
About that man from the 
Ministry of Home Security.

886
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:05,265
Of course, normally, one should get a divorce.

887
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:07,089
Of course, I don't think 
he's the type, dear.

888
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:08,674
Too fond of himself.

889
01:00:08,674 --> 01:00:09,570
You know what I mean.

890
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,905
Most men are like that.

891
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:12,279
I've been thinking it over...

892
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:17,445
Would you mind if we had the window 
halfway down, after all, please.

893
01:00:18,478 --> 01:00:19,043
Would you mind?

894
01:00:19,043 --> 01:00:22,224
Not at all, young lady, not at all.

895
01:00:30,577 --> 01:00:31,260
Thank you.

896
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:44,652
Isn't anybody going 
to say anything at all?

897
01:00:45,736 --> 01:00:49,525
Is nobody going to say they have no objection 
to the window being down for 10 minutes?

898
01:00:50,664 --> 01:00:53,148
Oh, come on somebody...
speak will you!

899
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:54,851
Have you no sense at all?

900
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:58,712
Haven't I done everything 
Mr Miller told me...I have!

901
01:00:58,712 --> 01:01:01,065
What am I going to do now?

902
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:44,172
I'm very sorry...we must ask you 
to get out at this station, please.

903
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:47,299
I don't think an explanation 
will be necessary.

904
01:01:47,299 --> 01:01:48,782
You know who we are.

905
01:01:48,782 --> 01:01:50,448
Come along now.

906
01:01:51,481 --> 01:01:54,156
I haven't any idea 
what you're talking about.

907
01:01:54,156 --> 01:01:56,000
Still, if you insist.

908
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,261
My bag's on the rack there.

909
01:01:59,121 --> 01:02:01,544
Be careful please...
there are some eggs in it.

910
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:51,649
I thought I'd give you a shock.

911
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,029
I just made it at Wynbridge.

912
01:02:54,029 --> 01:02:56,533
Scrambled on at the last minute 
and came up against a locked door.

913
01:02:57,446 --> 01:02:58,585
Actually I wasn't going to leave today...

914
01:02:58,585 --> 01:03:00,933
But when I saw you skipping off, 
from my bedroom window...

915
01:03:00,933 --> 01:03:02,631
I wondered what the devil 
was the matter.

916
01:03:03,585 --> 01:03:04,271
Couldn't figure it out at all...

917
01:03:04,271 --> 01:03:06,582
And of course after last night...
anything might happen... 

918
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,886
I remember hearing 
the most extraordinary clatter...

919
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:10,148
I've never heard anything like it...

920
01:03:10,148 --> 01:03:12,587
That old lady was the one 
I had to meet!

921
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:15,442
She must have known 
those men were detectives...

922
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:17,022
...and going to arrest her.

923
01:03:17,022 --> 01:03:18,621
Oh, it's horrible.

924
01:03:20,162 --> 01:03:22,711
If only I could keep me knees still... 
and think!

925
01:03:23,822 --> 01:03:28,134
I know about something on the Isle of Man... 
and not a living soul to tell it to.

926
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,209
Mr Miller's dead.

927
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:35,384
Even if he weren't, it's very hard to see 
how I'm helping the cause of Ireland at all.

928
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:38,375
I shall go home out of harm's way...

929
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:39,563
..and nobody will ever...

930
01:03:39,563 --> 01:03:41,042
You were wheeling a body out, 
to bury it.

931
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:46,632
What did you say?

932
01:03:47,379 --> 01:03:49,898
I simply said I don't know what 
you were pushing out in that wheelchair. 

933
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,979
Might have been a bunch of paint cans...

934
01:03:51,979 --> 01:03:53,888
...or a boyfriend who'd committed suicide...

935
01:03:53,888 --> 01:03:55,689
...in understandable desperation!

936
01:03:55,689 --> 01:03:58,047
And you were wheeling his body out,
to bury it.

937
01:04:02,545 --> 01:04:03,561
I see.

938
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:19,811
Do you WANT to get off 
at this station?

939
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:20,591
Not particularly.

940
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:21,913
Any station suits me.

941
01:04:21,913 --> 01:04:25,310
Well get back on the train will you please, 
I'm only changing here for Holyhead.

942
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:26,421
Give me that case.

943
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:48,628
You're going to Ireland, then.

944
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:50,175
Got your exit permit?

945
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,652
Oh, no...I never thought of that.

946
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:54,394
You can get one in Liverpool.
What are you having...coffee?

947
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:56,677
How long will it take 
to get a permit?

948
01:04:56,677 --> 01:04:58,403
Oh...a couple of days or so.

949
01:04:58,403 --> 01:04:59,785
Two coffees, please.

950
01:04:59,785 --> 01:05:00,846
Do you want anything to eat?

951
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:01,822
No thanks.

952
01:05:03,263 --> 01:05:05,092
You know...you're a very aggravating man...

953
01:05:05,092 --> 01:05:06,773
I don't understand you at all.

954
01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:08,698
There are quite a few things about YOU 
that don't make sense.

955
01:05:09,307 --> 01:05:10,786
I know we've been over it all before.

956
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,535
But I think you've got yourself 
into a mess of some sort...

957
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:14,506
And I'd like to help you.

958
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:16,842
I know it's nothing to do with ME.

959
01:05:16,842 --> 01:05:18,551
You can choke me off if you want to.

960
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:21,676
But you must have a reason for leaving Wynbridge 
in such a hurry this morning.

961
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,872
It may not have been 
anything serious.

962
01:05:23,872 --> 01:05:24,641
Probably wasn't.

963
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:26,660
But if there's anything 
I can do to help...

964
01:05:27,778 --> 01:05:28,932
Hang on...What is it now?

965
01:05:28,932 --> 01:05:32,058
That train goes to Manchester...
I can change there for Liverpool.

966
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,034
You can get one direct.

967
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:34,441
Let's catch this one please.

968
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:36,252
If I'm included, I'll catch anything.

969
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,975
You've tries every other hotel 
in Liverpool, I suppose.

970
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:47,404
I may have missed one or two.

971
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:49,639
They always come here 
as a last resort.

972
01:05:50,734 --> 01:05:52,518
That's 22...23.

973
01:05:52,518 --> 01:05:56,896
No porter...no hot water...
Breakfast at 8 sharp.

974
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,409
Fish-cakes.

975
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:02,701
Goodnight.

976
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:22,021
I can't think why 
you're wasting your leave...

977
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:23,447
...trailing around Liverpool 
with me.

978
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:24,265
Now, it'll be round here.

979
01:06:24,265 --> 01:06:26,038
Why are you doing it?

980
01:06:26,038 --> 01:06:27,719
I suppose you've forgotten 
what you said to me yesterday...

981
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:28,663
...out on that hill.

982
01:06:28,663 --> 01:06:30,491
Whatever I said...
I never meant it seriously.

983
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:31,945
I might have taken it seriously.

984
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:34,242
You think it's a proper time 
to talk about things like that?

985
01:06:34,242 --> 01:06:37,800
Walking along a dirty hotel corridor 
looking at numbers on bedroom doors.

986
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,585
Perhaps not...here we are...22.

987
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:40,899
Unless you'd prefer 23?

988
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:42,530
It's a mater of indifference to me.

989
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:45,490
Goodnight.

990
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,382
See you at fish-cakes.

991
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:20,664
"A person's believed to be 
concerned in the escape".

992
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:28,636
That's me!

993
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,813
I don't like this place.

994
01:07:40,813 --> 01:07:46,478
It's the sort of room where murders 
are committed by commercial men.

995
01:07:46,478 --> 01:07:47,820
They shall have another murder, 
I reckon...

996
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:48,830
I can feel it coming on.

997
01:07:49,455 --> 01:07:51,633
It's a comfort to know 
the lad is next door.

998
01:07:52,366 --> 01:07:56,359
He's English...but he's nice and solid... 
and behaves like a gentleman.

999
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:58,932
I did lock the door, didn't I?

1000
01:08:00,616 --> 01:08:02,018
He's talking nonsense of course...

1001
01:08:02,018 --> 01:08:03,660
When he says he might 
be serious about me.

1002
01:08:05,221 --> 01:08:06,454
But why shouldn't he be?

1003
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:08,557
Terence Delaney was...

1004
01:08:09,977 --> 01:08:14,622
Why shouldn't he be deeply 
and beautifully in love with me?

1005
01:08:15,751 --> 01:08:17,178
What would your father say... 

1006
01:08:17,178 --> 01:08:19,707
...if he could listen in to the awful thoughts 
you're entertaining.

1007
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:23,547
Tomorrow morning you'll go 
straight to the passport office...

1008
01:08:23,547 --> 01:08:26,042
...and get that permit...

1009
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:40,686
"In view of large-scale troop movements...

1010
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:43,649
...dangerous spies in Eire.

1011
01:08:46,186 --> 01:08:48,664
Dangerous spies in Eire!

1012
01:08:48,664 --> 01:08:52,037
Could I get a job there?
No, I had to come to England.

1013
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:54,267
Isn't that just like the English?

1014
01:08:54,267 --> 01:08:55,955
Always looking next door 
for something wrong...

1015
01:08:55,955 --> 01:08:57,550
..and never looking in their own back parlour.

1016
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,156
So they're going to stop me returning 
to my native land, are they?

1017
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:03,213
Alright...alright...

1018
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:05,198
I'll go to the Isle of Man, so I will...

1019
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,625
And I'll find out what's there...

1020
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:10,085
And I'll smuggle myself back to Ireland 
and I'll take it to the German minister.

1021
01:09:10,085 --> 01:09:12,258
I'll do something with it.

1022
01:09:14,187 --> 01:09:16,108
Now calm yourself and go to sleep.

1023
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:19,744
How can I go to sleep, 
when I'm in the state I'm in?

1024
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:22,879
I'll count sheep going over a stile.

1025
01:09:25,158 --> 01:09:28,355
1-2-3...

1026
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:31,312
Aah...they've all got 
the face of him next door.

1027
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:33,054
I'll turn them into goats.

1028
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:36,269
1..2...

1029
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:39,442
Oh, I'm in no mood 
to be counting animals!

1030
01:09:41,404 --> 01:09:42,523
What's that?

1031
01:09:51,548 --> 01:09:52,682
Who's there?!

1032
01:09:54,388 --> 01:09:55,616
I said...
Who's there?

1033
01:10:08,009 --> 01:10:08,838
What's happening?

1034
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,035
Oh, David!

1035
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:11,694
Bridie...What on earth's the matter?

1036
01:10:11,694 --> 01:10:12,800
What is it?...
You're trembling all over.

1037
01:10:13,244 --> 01:10:14,178
Put that light out!

1038
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:16,857
What was it, Bridie?

1039
01:10:16,857 --> 01:10:18,500
It's nothing...nothing at all.

1040
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,781
Now, pull yourself together, darling.

1041
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:22,650
I am together...
What are you doing here, anyway?

1042
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:23,557
- You screamed.
- I did not!

1043
01:10:23,557 --> 01:10:24,281
I heard you.

1044
01:10:24,281 --> 01:10:26,721
it must have been somebody else.
Don't stand there gaping at me like that!

1045
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:27,310
Tell me the truth.

1046
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:28,995
There's nothing to tell you...
I'm alright!

1047
01:10:38,732 --> 01:10:39,780
Good morning.

1048
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,683
Can you tell me please where 
I catch the boat to the Isle of Man?

1049
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:46,341
You get the train to Preston, love...
and you change there for Fleetwood.

1050
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:47,756
Do you want your bill?

1051
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:50,287
Oh, yes please.

1052
01:10:56,547 --> 01:10:58,571
Looks like the track of a wheelchair to me.

1053
01:10:58,571 --> 01:11:00,607
Simple enough to trace, if it is.

1054
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,877
Can't be many wheelchairs in Wynbridge.

1055
01:11:03,546 --> 01:11:04,993
Not like Bournemouth.

1056
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,897
Red, blue and green dress...

1057
01:11:11,521 --> 01:11:12,479
And fawn coat.

1058
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,671
Thanks very much.

1059
01:11:17,282 --> 01:11:18,589
Have you got the girl's description?

1060
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:19,117
Yes I have, Sir.

1061
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:21,464
She apparently spent the night before last 
in a hotel in Liverpool.

1062
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:24,151
Left at 6 the following day to catch a boat 
to the Isle of Man.

1063
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,464
Isle of Man? 
Get onto Investigation, there.

1064
01:11:26,464 --> 01:11:28,870
She'd be easy enough to run to the ground 
on a small island like that.

1065
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:29,433
Yes, Sir.

1066
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,580
Give me the Investigation Officer, 
Isle of Man, will you.

1067
01:11:34,543 --> 01:11:36,022
Capt. Goodhusband, isn't it?

1068
01:11:36,022 --> 01:11:37,064
It is.

1069
01:11:38,951 --> 01:11:40,629
Good thing it's a small island.

1070
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:47,536
No sense in starting before then...
you know what these things are.

1071
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,951
Everything's laid on, old man...
all you have to do is report here.

1072
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:53,779
It usually takes about an hour 
before things get going.

1073
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:55,974
That turning on the left, 
off Strand St...

1074
01:11:55,974 --> 01:11:58,670
It's difficult to make a snap decision 
on a question like that...

1075
01:11:58,670 --> 01:11:59,861
I'll ask Spanswick.

1076
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:03,153
Spanswick...Marjorie's on the line 
about the dance tonight...

1077
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:03,931
Hold on a minute.

1078
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:06,991
She wants to know whether to wear 
the backless blue or the frontless white.

1079
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:08,100
Really, old man!

1080
01:12:08,869 --> 01:12:09,971
The blue.

1081
01:12:09,971 --> 01:12:12,833
Say Lt. Spanswick of Home Investigations sent you.

1082
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,375
Spanswick favours the blue.

1083
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:16,112
Then bring the bottle straight back here.

1084
01:12:23,274 --> 01:12:25,461
Colonel Dennington's on the blower 
from Whitehall.

1085
01:12:25,461 --> 01:12:26,530
The devil he is!

1086
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:28,362
Well put him through at once... 
and bring your notebook in.

1087
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:31,117
Goodbye dear...must ring off now...
business you know!

1088
01:12:32,843 --> 01:12:35,136
I say...I wonder what 
that young upstart wants.

1089
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:36,837
Some flap or other, I'll bet.

1090
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:40,238
Last time he got in touch with us 
was when we were at Lerwick...

1091
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:42,854
To carry on about that submarine crew 
that had escaped.

1092
01:12:42,854 --> 01:12:44,339
Behaved most unreasonably, I thought.

1093
01:12:44,524 --> 01:12:45,513
We caught the cook!

1094
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:49,122
Well whoever was to blame, old man, 
we've done nothing since we've been here.

1095
01:12:49,759 --> 01:12:50,842
Might be that, of course.

1096
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:55,172
Hello, Sir!

1097
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,912
Goodhusband here!

1098
01:12:56,912 --> 01:12:59,588
I want you to arrest a girl 
of the name of Quilty.

1099
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:00,600
Bridie Quilty.

1100
01:13:01,142 --> 01:13:03,652
She landed on the island from Fleetwood, 
yesterday afternoon.

1101
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,274
I'll give you her description.

1102
01:13:05,274 --> 01:13:09,899
Age 21...height 5'4"...

1103
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:11,272
Hair dark brown...

1104
01:13:11,272 --> 01:13:14,010
Eyes blue...

1105
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,835
Fresh complexion.

1106
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,286
Irish accent.

1107
01:13:19,564 --> 01:13:20,229
Fawn coat...

1108
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,553
Red, green or blue dress...

1109
01:13:23,267 --> 01:13:24,257
Got that, darling?

1110
01:13:24,257 --> 01:13:24,782
Corporal?

1111
01:13:24,782 --> 01:13:25,728
Roughly.

1112
01:13:26,761 --> 01:13:28,441
Oh, it may take a little longer 
than that, Sir.

1113
01:13:28,441 --> 01:13:30,798
You can be quite sure 
we'll do out best.

1114
01:13:34,412 --> 01:13:35,480
Right, Sir.

1115
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,449
I'll ring you back at once.

1116
01:13:38,688 --> 01:13:39,304
Goodbye, Sir.

1117
01:13:41,776 --> 01:13:43,605
Curious man, Colonel Dennington.

1118
01:13:44,116 --> 01:13:46,774
Difficult to see how we can do better 
than our best.

1119
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:52,480
He expects us to pick up the girl 
in a matter of hours.

1120
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,850
Your experience should count, old man.

1121
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:57,916
it's all very well sitting up there in Whitehall, 
jabbering a lot of instructions.

1122
01:13:58,266 --> 01:14:00,101
They don't have to face the problems.

1123
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:03,672
I suppose, the best thing to do is check up 
all the hotels and boarding houses.

1124
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:06,945
It would take weeks old man...
especially from a vague description like this.

1125
01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:08,834
There are packets of girls
on this island...

1126
01:14:08,834 --> 01:14:10,967
...looking like that 
and talking with an Irish accent.

1127
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:14,170
Not even a squint or a birthmark 
to jolly things along.

1128
01:14:15,544 --> 01:14:18,514
Look down there for instance...
crossing the road to the Tynwald Court...

1129
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:20,573
She could easily fit the description.

1130
01:14:20,573 --> 01:14:23,504
Right height, fawn coat, brown hair...

1131
01:14:23,504 --> 01:14:24,822
...typically Irish.

1132
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:26,767
You meet them at every turn, old man.

1133
01:14:29,587 --> 01:14:32,092
This is where the laws of the 
Isle of man are made, my dear.

1134
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:34,156
It's the oldest parliament 
in the world.

1135
01:14:35,132 --> 01:14:39,494
Old Johnny here's taking a photo 
for the post-war guidebook.

1136
01:14:40,908 --> 01:14:42,229
You might be in it if you're lucky.

1137
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:45,086
We don't get many young people 
here these days.

1138
01:14:45,086 --> 01:14:47,162
They seem to prefer the pictures.

1139
01:14:47,162 --> 01:14:52,339
Old Tim Kelly there...he was a great one 
for the pictures, until they started talking.

1140
01:14:52,339 --> 01:14:54,278
So now he comes here for his nap.

1141
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:56,430
I hope you enjoy yourself.

1142
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,716
There's plenty of room 
in the front row, Miss.

1143
01:14:58,716 --> 01:15:00,280
This is fine, thank you.

1144
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:35,478
You know, Miss...that seat you're sitting in 
has a story attached to it.

1145
01:15:35,478 --> 01:15:38,605
They caught a spy in it 
a few weeks back.

1146
01:15:38,605 --> 01:15:40,898
Hasn't been such a rumpus 
in the House... 

1147
01:15:40,898 --> 01:15:44,599
...since they put the income tax up 
from two bob to half a crown.

1148
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:49,633
Tim...time you were getting back 
to the office.

1149
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:50,931
Oh, thanks.

1150
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:14,647
Don't move! Stay where you are!

1151
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,440
Thank you!

1152
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:20,294
Thank you!

1153
01:16:58,798 --> 01:17:01,348
"20 yards on left Rue de la Gare."

1154
01:17:02,658 --> 01:17:04,965
"Down steps, Cafe Antoine."

1155
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:08,287
What would they be doing 
with a French town on the Isle of Man?

1156
01:17:09,435 --> 01:17:11,686
Sure it doesn't make 
any sense at all.

1157
01:17:13,445 --> 01:17:16,011
"4 miles north of Ramsey."

1158
01:17:34,418 --> 01:17:49,209
Now what in the world would 
the explanation of it be?

1159
01:17:55,819 --> 01:17:59,219
It's behind barbed wire 
and packed with the British army...

1160
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:02,324
But the book says a French town.

1161
01:18:03,129 --> 01:18:03,945
Why?

1162
01:18:06,046 --> 01:18:07,128
The invasion!

1163
01:18:07,128 --> 01:18:09,218
The invasion!

1164
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:14,431
Now what would they be doing here 
if they weren't getting ready for the invasion?

1165
01:18:14,431 --> 01:18:17,659
And where would they 
be getting ready?

1166
01:18:18,209 --> 01:18:21,228
Supposing...aye, it would all fit in... 

1167
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:27,235
Supposing they'd made up a town 
like some town on the French coast.

1168
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:30,549
And these notes of Mr Pryce's... 

1169
01:18:32,094 --> 01:18:33,538
The advertisement on the wall...

1170
01:18:33,538 --> 01:18:38,088
The Rue de la Gare and the steps...

1171
01:18:40,437 --> 01:18:42,192
Down to the Cafe Antoine.

1172
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:47,701
If the Germans had these notes, 
they could tell which town this was.

1173
01:18:47,701 --> 01:18:51,627
And when the invasion happened...

1174
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,494
...the Germans would be ready for them.

1175
01:18:54,494 --> 01:18:57,571
Waiting with all their guns, 
to mow them down.

1176
01:19:05,731 --> 01:19:07,764
What desperate thing 
are you getting into?

1177
01:19:07,764 --> 01:19:11,231
You're holding thousands of lives 
in your hands.

1178
01:19:11,231 --> 01:19:12,565
British lives.

1179
01:19:13,819 --> 01:19:15,120
Irish lives.

1180
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:20,762
It's the Book of Fate itself 
you're carrying.

1181
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,406
You'll find the register 
quite in order, I'm sure...

1182
01:19:32,406 --> 01:19:33,275
I'm most strict.

1183
01:19:33,275 --> 01:19:34,650
May we cast an eye on it?

1184
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:38,242
Yesterday's arrivals...
Just a routine enquiry, you know.

1185
01:19:38,242 --> 01:19:39,414
I don't recollect the name.

1186
01:19:39,785 --> 01:19:40,846
From there down.

1187
01:19:41,338 --> 01:19:43,345
Any single women amongst them?

1188
01:19:49,059 --> 01:19:51,991
18, 64 and 33.

1189
01:19:51,991 --> 01:19:55,652
Miss Bagget says 15 and 77 count two.

1190
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:59,588
I hope this doesn't mean that someone 
has escaped from the internment camp... 

1191
01:19:59,588 --> 01:20:00,884
...and is staying in the hotel.

1192
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:03,351
If the food I had here 
is anything to go by...

1193
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:05,310
...they've been more likely 
to have escaped from the hotel...

1194
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:06,731
...and beat it for the internment camp.

1195
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,466
I say, Goodhusband...

1196
01:20:12,655 --> 01:20:15,955
That's the girl we saw crossing the road 
to the Tynwald Court.

1197
01:20:17,789 --> 01:20:18,815
When did she arrive?

1198
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:20,051
Yesterday afternoon.

1199
01:20:20,051 --> 01:20:21,175
What's her name?

1200
01:20:21,175 --> 01:20:22,862
Baynes.

1201
01:20:22,862 --> 01:20:24,738
Mrs David Baynes.

1202
01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:26,577
From Kings Square, South Westmead.

1203
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,781
Mmm...married...pity!

1204
01:20:30,753 --> 01:20:31,941
I wonder.

1205
01:20:55,011 --> 01:20:57,661
There won't be a fire in the room...
I shall have to start one.

1206
01:20:58,343 --> 01:20:59,775
How long will it take to burn?

1207
01:20:59,775 --> 01:21:02,017
5 minutes...more?

1208
01:21:02,017 --> 01:21:03,525
Oh, hurry, lift! Hurry!...

1209
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,794
I've all the troubles of the world 
on me shoulders.

1210
01:22:26,422 --> 01:22:28,129
Good evening...may we come in a moment?

1211
01:22:28,316 --> 01:22:29,702
I say, I hope we're not frightening you.

1212
01:22:29,702 --> 01:22:32,843
Just a little routine check on identity cards...
a mere formality.

1213
01:22:32,843 --> 01:22:34,215
Do you mind?

1214
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:36,325
No...of course not.

1215
01:22:46,345 --> 01:22:47,644
Sorry to bother you and all that.

1216
01:22:51,192 --> 01:22:51,986
On holiday?

1217
01:22:51,986 --> 01:22:53,311
Yes.

1218
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:54,578
Lovely weather for it.

1219
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:57,832
Red tape, you know.

1220
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:00,327
Very pleasant hotel, this.

1221
01:23:00,327 --> 01:23:01,653
Lovely view.

1222
01:23:01,653 --> 01:23:03,865
Terrible grub.

1223
01:23:03,865 --> 01:23:04,914
Mind if I smoke?

1224
01:23:04,914 --> 01:23:06,401
No.

1225
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,379
There's a dance here tonight.

1226
01:23:17,379 --> 01:23:18,511
Is there?

1227
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:20,236
Yes...jolly affairs as a rule.

1228
01:23:20,236 --> 01:23:22,195
May look in myself later on.

1229
01:23:24,074 --> 01:23:25,279
Are you finished with that?

1230
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:27,590
Staying long, Mrs Baynes?

1231
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:29,737
A few days...
Will that be all?

1232
01:23:29,737 --> 01:23:30,803
Yes, that's all, thank you.

1233
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,714
Hello, darling...holding a reception?

1234
01:23:35,714 --> 01:23:37,026
Good evening...

1235
01:23:37,026 --> 01:23:37,772
You're...

1236
01:23:38,754 --> 01:23:39,764
Her husband.

1237
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:42,137
Just a routine enquiry, you know.

1238
01:23:42,137 --> 01:23:43,516
Check on identity cards.

1239
01:23:43,516 --> 01:23:44,142
Really?

1240
01:23:44,142 --> 01:23:45,865
I think that's all, isn't it Spanswick?

1241
01:23:46,195 --> 01:23:46,696
Yes.

1242
01:23:46,696 --> 01:23:47,794
Well, goodnight, Mrs Baynes.

1243
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:55,427
How did you know?

1244
01:23:55,427 --> 01:23:56,835
Hotel register.

1245
01:24:01,128 --> 01:24:02,128
Where did you get this?

1246
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,521
Do you realise you can go to prison 
for forging an identity card?

1247
01:24:07,615 --> 01:24:08,617
What made you do it?

1248
01:24:08,617 --> 01:24:10,301
It's nothing to do with you...
It's my business.

1249
01:24:11,782 --> 01:24:12,835
It's my name.

1250
01:24:12,835 --> 01:24:14,365
A small point perhaps.

1251
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:16,907
Isn't like an Englishman... 
to niggle about a thing like that?!

1252
01:24:16,907 --> 01:24:18,961
Bridie...it's no use behaving 
like a child.

1253
01:24:18,961 --> 01:24:21,087
You've committed 
a very serious offence...

1254
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:22,317
...and I think I should know 
what it's all about.

1255
01:24:22,317 --> 01:24:23,051
Oh, you do?

1256
01:24:23,578 --> 01:24:26,490
So, you think if you stand there 
and insult me long enough, I'll tell you...

1257
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:28,589
Well, I won't...so there's no sense 
in your staying any longer.

1258
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:29,179
Is there?

1259
01:24:30,214 --> 01:24:30,921
Do you hear me?

1260
01:24:30,921 --> 01:24:32,447
I'm asking you to go...please.

1261
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:37,224
Do you want me to ring the bell 
and have you thrown out?

1262
01:24:37,224 --> 01:24:39,037
They're very short-staffed these days.

1263
01:24:43,768 --> 01:24:45,831
Oh, why are you behaving like this?

1264
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:48,247
Can't you see 
I'm miserable enough already?

1265
01:24:48,889 --> 01:24:50,814
I don't know why 
you came here at all.

1266
01:24:54,074 --> 01:24:55,831
I touched on the reason, 
the other evening.

1267
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:57,657
What reason?

1268
01:24:58,448 --> 01:25:00,632
Something you said, that I might 
have taken seriously.

1269
01:25:02,145 --> 01:25:03,414
Oh...that!

1270
01:25:03,414 --> 01:25:04,868
Well, I have.

1271
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:06,822
Rubbish!

1272
01:25:06,822 --> 01:25:11,642
All you've ever take seriously is yourself, 
and your high-falutin brotherly instincts.

1273
01:25:11,642 --> 01:25:13,645
They're not brotherly...
I've examined them very carefully.

1274
01:25:14,957 --> 01:25:15,857
I'm in love with you.

1275
01:25:19,638 --> 01:25:21,508
Do you know what you're saying?

1276
01:25:21,508 --> 01:25:22,962
It's very simple.

1277
01:25:24,974 --> 01:25:26,805
Do you know who I am?

1278
01:25:26,805 --> 01:25:28,339
Eh?

1279
01:25:32,232 --> 01:25:34,128
I'm a retired spy.

1280
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,370
I knew that would shock you.

1281
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:42,486
i came here to get something 
for the Germans...

1282
01:25:42,486 --> 01:25:43,858
But I've changed me mind...

1283
01:25:43,858 --> 01:25:45,747
Oh, I haven't done any harm...really.

1284
01:25:45,747 --> 01:25:46,957
I've destroyed everything...

1285
01:25:46,957 --> 01:25:49,753
It's there in the fireplace in ashes...
It was something in a notebook.

1286
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:53,509
It just isn't possible!

1287
01:25:53,509 --> 01:25:57,551
Oh, yes it is...it's more than possible..
It just is.

1288
01:25:58,021 --> 01:26:00,508
Well, don't worry...
It's all over and done with now...

1289
01:26:00,508 --> 01:26:02,167
I've finished with it forever.

1290
01:26:03,654 --> 01:26:04,329
Haven't I?

1291
01:26:04,329 --> 01:26:07,644
But Bridie!... 
Don't you realise the implications?

1292
01:26:07,644 --> 01:26:10,684
Of course...and I was very worried 
about them...I can tell...

1293
01:26:12,628 --> 01:26:14,103
What implications?

1294
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:16,079
Well, I'm an army officer...

1295
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:18,018
If this is true, I'll have to report it.

1296
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:22,415
Can I turn down the bed, now?

1297
01:26:22,415 --> 01:26:23,956
Thank heavens you're not cheesy...

1298
01:26:23,956 --> 01:26:25,661
It's always the same on dance nights...

1299
01:26:25,661 --> 01:26:28,322
I've got enough to do in this job,
without being kept hovering...

1300
01:26:28,322 --> 01:26:31,198
I'll be glad when the war's over 
and I can go over to Canada...

1301
01:26:32,055 --> 01:26:33,774
...that's if he doesn't change his mind.

1302
01:26:33,774 --> 01:26:36,831
He was still on in his last letter...

1303
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:36,831
Everything's labour-saving, there...

1304
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:39,670
Well, don't forget your black-out later...
goodnight!

1305
01:26:42,246 --> 01:26:43,625
What was in that notebook?

1306
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:46,622
A description of a French town 
they've built here.

1307
01:26:46,622 --> 01:26:48,510
Something to do with the invasion, I think.

1308
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:49,846
- You read it?
- Some of it.

1309
01:26:49,846 --> 01:26:51,639
But I've burnt it now.

1310
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:54,969
I haven't really done any harm, David...
and what I did, I've undone..

1311
01:26:54,969 --> 01:26:56,170
Haven't I?

1312
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:57,644
Supposing the Germans got hold of you?

1313
01:26:57,644 --> 01:26:59,020
How could they?

1314
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,693
Someone was in your room in Liverpool.

1315
01:27:00,693 --> 01:27:02,063
They'll find you.

1316
01:27:02,992 --> 01:27:04,500
Do you think I'd tell them?

1317
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,728
They'd get it out of you.

1318
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,920
They wouldn't...
I swear they wouldn't.

1319
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,636
That's what YOU think...

1320
01:27:11,695 --> 01:27:13,597
If this is what it sounds like, 
it's dynamite!

1321
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:17,030
So long as you're running round, 
the whole thing may be in danger...

1322
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:18,436
You must see that!

1323
01:27:18,436 --> 01:27:20,468
If I hand you over, I'm practically 
signing your death warrant...

1324
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,407
But what else...what alternative is there?

1325
01:27:22,407 --> 01:27:24,397
If only you'd told me earlier...
I might have...

1326
01:27:25,116 --> 01:27:27,716
What's the good of talking about it now...
it's gone too far.

1327
01:27:28,605 --> 01:27:30,186
Why the devil couldn't you...

1328
01:27:49,751 --> 01:27:50,901
Will you buy a raffle ticket?

1329
01:27:58,821 --> 01:28:00,924
Hello my dear...I wondered if I'd see you.

1330
01:28:00,924 --> 01:28:02,175
A bit crowded isn't it?

1331
01:28:02,559 --> 01:28:03,491
I say...where's your husband?

1332
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:04,827
He's not my husband.

1333
01:28:04,827 --> 01:28:06,656
Not!?...Oh dear...

1334
01:28:07,288 --> 01:28:08,544
Would your friend like one too, Sir?

1335
01:28:08,544 --> 01:28:09,752
Yes...thank you.

1336
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:12,254
The boy's up to some new stunt 
for raising the wind.

1337
01:28:17,114 --> 01:28:18,147
I wanted to see you...

1338
01:28:18,147 --> 01:28:19,956
Yes, I quite understand 
how these things are...

1339
01:28:19,956 --> 01:28:23,253
211...adds up to 4...my lucky number...
come on...let's dance.

1340
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:25,705
Please, there's something...

1341
01:28:25,705 --> 01:28:27,602
Something on your mind, dear?
There's something on mine, too!

1342
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:28,080
Let's forget it...

1343
01:28:28,824 --> 01:28:32,360
Let's forget dull care and dance the flaming hours away
with flying feet!

1344
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,946
Not that mine are exactly flying, you know.

1345
01:28:42,198 --> 01:28:44,041
Would you like a ticket for the raffle?

1346
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,257
Had a devil of a day.

1347
01:28:54,257 --> 01:28:57,222
Duty's all very well, 
but it can be carried too far.

1348
01:28:57,222 --> 01:28:59,414
A man must have some relaxation.

1349
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:02,322
I want to talk to you...
There's something I must tell you!

1350
01:29:02,322 --> 01:29:04,555
I can't very well tell you here...

1351
01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:05,507
Can't hear a word you're saying!

1352
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,648
You're wonderfully light 
on your feet, my dear.

1353
01:29:07,648 --> 01:29:10,163
Gossamer...that's what it is!

1354
01:29:10,163 --> 01:29:13,294
Please listen to me...
It's terribly important.

1355
01:29:14,427 --> 01:29:16,563
I'm the girl you're looking for.

1356
01:29:20,185 --> 01:29:20,967
Marjorie!...

1357
01:29:25,019 --> 01:29:26,670
Bad show, that...friend of mine.

1358
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,538
Asked her to meet me here 
and forgot all about it.

1359
01:29:28,538 --> 01:29:31,101
Thoughtless of me too...
works in a wine store.

1360
01:29:31,101 --> 01:29:33,153
Oh, please...
I can't go on like this!

1361
01:29:33,685 --> 01:29:35,731
I've come down here to see you
because I want to tell you...

1362
01:29:45,218 --> 01:29:46,321
Warm here, tonight...

1363
01:29:48,387 --> 01:29:49,613
What happened to Miller?

1364
01:29:55,374 --> 01:29:56,171
Hello, old man...

1365
01:29:56,171 --> 01:29:58,496
I say, you remember that girl 
in room 47...

1366
01:29:58,496 --> 01:29:59,402
Is she here now?

1367
01:29:59,402 --> 01:30:01,381
Yeah...rather! 
I've just been dancing with her.

1368
01:30:03,888 --> 01:30:05,942
That identity card's a fake, old man.

1369
01:30:08,065 --> 01:30:11,087
I don't think that remark terribly amusing,
Lieutenant Spanswick!

1370
01:30:11,087 --> 01:30:13,854
There's no such person 
as Mrs David Baynes.

1371
01:30:14,969 --> 01:30:15,949
How do you know?

1372
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:17,130
I've just checked up.

1373
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:19,738
No such number...
No such address.

1374
01:30:19,738 --> 01:30:22,658
She travelled on the right boat 
and answered the right description...

1375
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:24,695
It's a million to one 
she's the right girl.

1376
01:30:24,695 --> 01:30:26,104
Where is she now?

1377
01:30:26,104 --> 01:30:27,888
Oh...dancing with some type.

1378
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,139
A lovely girl like that.

1379
01:30:32,665 --> 01:30:33,811
What are we going to do?

1380
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:36,323
Grab her when she comes 
off the floor, of course.

1381
01:30:41,795 --> 01:30:46,628
Ladies and gentlemen...here are the winning numbers 
of the Army Comforts raffle.

1382
01:30:46,628 --> 01:30:48,796
Now will everybody gather round please.

1383
01:30:50,474 --> 01:30:52,478
We'll have to wait 
'til this breaks up.

1384
01:30:53,965 --> 01:30:56,766
No. 211 wins the first prize...

1385
01:30:56,766 --> 01:30:58,899
No. 211.

1386
01:30:59,749 --> 01:31:01,435
Your unlucky day, old man.

1387
01:31:01,435 --> 01:31:03,565
Just missed the prize by one!

1388
01:31:03,565 --> 01:31:07,362
Yes, I bought her a ticket, too.

1389
01:31:07,362 --> 01:31:08,832
What number?

1390
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:11,221
211.

1391
01:31:11,855 --> 01:31:12,708
She's won, then.

1392
01:31:13,922 --> 01:31:15,035
Curious situation.

1393
01:31:15,035 --> 01:31:19,747
Will No.211 please come up 
and receive the 1st prize...

1394
01:31:19,747 --> 01:31:21,880
...of 10 War Saving Certificates.

1395
01:31:25,935 --> 01:31:27,149
I don't like the look of this.

1396
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:28,330
Have you got men posted?

1397
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:30,512
Hennessy and James are in the lounge.

1398
01:31:30,512 --> 01:31:31,879
What the devil's the use of that?

1399
01:31:31,879 --> 01:31:33,602
Haven't you got any common sense?

1400
01:31:33,602 --> 01:31:35,676
Are you accusing me of incompetence?

1401
01:31:35,676 --> 01:31:37,307
My dear fellow,
I'm accusing you of nothing.

1402
01:31:37,307 --> 01:31:38,128
If the cap fits...

1403
01:31:38,128 --> 01:31:40,728
In your case, old man, 
it looks like being a bowler hat!

1404
01:31:42,523 --> 01:31:46,016
Will the owner of ticket 211 
please raise their hand!

1405
01:31:46,546 --> 01:31:47,588
2-1-1!

1406
01:31:48,718 --> 01:31:51,738
Has anybody got 211?...
Up there at the bar, perhaps.

1407
01:32:47,314 --> 01:32:50,350
Now just for a change...let's have the truth.

1408
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:56,187
Listen Steve, the kid's not talking...that's obvious..
But he may with a little persuasion.

1409
01:32:56,187 --> 01:32:57,358
If he knows anything.

1410
01:32:57,358 --> 01:32:58,296
Time enough to find out...

1411
01:32:58,296 --> 01:33:00,078
The submarine's not picking us up 
'til Wednesday.

1412
01:33:00,078 --> 01:33:01,045
One passenger's enough...

1413
01:33:01,045 --> 01:33:03,531
We got to get across half Ireland...
to the Derry coast.

1414
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:05,589
Might be worthwhile...
It's a good-conduct pass with the girl.

1415
01:33:06,148 --> 01:33:07,787
I'll handle this my own way.

1416
01:33:07,787 --> 01:33:10,200
Are we playing poker, 
or aren't we?

1417
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,287
Somebody is.

1418
01:33:11,287 --> 01:33:13,205
I'm not sure it's us.

1419
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:01,710
What do you make of it, Michael?

1420
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:03,942
Smugglers, maybe.

1421
01:34:03,942 --> 01:34:05,342
Or German spies.

1422
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:09,567
I read in the English newspapers 
that they're swarming all over Ireland.

1423
01:34:09,567 --> 01:34:12,673
It's almost our biggest national industry, man!

1424
01:34:12,673 --> 01:34:16,186
Whoever they are, you'd better ring up 
Garth Crawley at the police station.

1425
01:34:18,188 --> 01:34:20,263
Tell him they're coming ashore at Dunraghen.

1426
01:34:20,263 --> 01:34:24,909
They'll likely as not take the road 
past Sean Murphy's to the railway station.

1427
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:27,382
He'll head them off there, if he hurries.

1428
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,314
Good morning, Douglas...

1429
01:34:46,314 --> 01:34:50,444
You didn't by any chance 
see four strange men around here?

1430
01:34:50,733 --> 01:34:51,398
No.

1431
01:34:51,398 --> 01:34:53,482
They landed at Rocklin Bay 
an hour ago...

1432
01:34:53,482 --> 01:34:54,873
Mike Reagan spotted them.

1433
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:59,316
I didn't put much stock in it myself 
until I phoned headquarters.

1434
01:34:59,316 --> 01:35:00,841
Terribly excited they were.

1435
01:35:00,841 --> 01:35:02,810
Tell me what time's the next train.

1436
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:04,229
Goes 4.30.

1437
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:05,928
Maybe they'll turn up for it.

1438
01:35:05,928 --> 01:35:07,204
I'll be back.

1439
01:35:07,204 --> 01:35:10,077
Tell me, what's Sean Murphy's cab 
doing today? 

1440
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:11,358
I don't know.

1441
01:35:11,358 --> 01:35:13,222
I thought he was in Drogheda.

1442
01:35:13,222 --> 01:35:14,861
Well, goodbye now.

1443
01:35:19,825 --> 01:35:20,828
Has he gone yet?

1444
01:35:20,828 --> 01:35:24,191
Going...Lucky I spotted him.

1445
01:35:24,191 --> 01:35:25,949
Puts paid to us catching the 4.30 though.

1446
01:35:27,611 --> 01:35:29,773
Looks like we're stuck 
with Sean Murphy's cab.

1447
01:35:39,336 --> 01:35:41,346
Where do you think 
your taking us now?

1448
01:35:41,346 --> 01:35:42,598
Shut up.

1449
01:35:48,848 --> 01:35:51,043
What's the trouble?...
Can't we go any faster?

1450
01:35:51,043 --> 01:35:52,226
Something in front.

1451
01:35:52,226 --> 01:35:54,120
Well, give him a shout...
Ask him to pull in.

1452
01:35:59,445 --> 01:36:02,053
It's a funeral...no room to pass.

1453
01:36:03,301 --> 01:36:05,888
Alright...alright!
Turn off at the next by-road!

1454
01:36:23,035 --> 01:36:23,861
Whoa up there!

1455
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:31,065
What is it?

1456
01:36:31,065 --> 01:36:33,773
It's the police...
They've stopped the procession.

1457
01:36:35,112 --> 01:36:36,117
Carry on!

1458
01:36:44,493 --> 01:36:45,440
We're off again.

1459
01:36:46,529 --> 01:36:47,726
They must have asked 
if we'd passed.

1460
01:36:48,643 --> 01:36:50,214
Good thing we hadn't.

1461
01:36:50,214 --> 01:36:54,572
We'd better hang on to this show for a while...
It has its points.

1462
01:37:21,613 --> 01:37:23,237
Why did you follow me?

1463
01:37:24,813 --> 01:37:26,412
Nasty habit!

1464
01:37:28,633 --> 01:37:30,736
We can't hang about here all day.

1465
01:37:31,563 --> 01:37:33,895
Take the next fork to the left...
Whatever it is.

1466
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,280
There's a policeman on the corner.

1467
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:41,915
Alright...carry on as you are.

1468
01:37:42,182 --> 01:37:43,312
Don't try anything!

1469
01:38:09,095 --> 01:38:10,606
Now what's happened?

1470
01:38:10,606 --> 01:38:12,998
Perhaps they've stopped for a drink...
I could do with one.

1471
01:38:18,534 --> 01:38:21,641
They're taking the deceased back to Doonpadrig...
where she was born.

1472
01:38:21,641 --> 01:38:23,200
The permit's in order.

1473
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,293
It's me poor wee sister Bridget...
a good poor soul.

1474
01:38:26,293 --> 01:38:28,386
Never did any harm to anyone.

1475
01:38:28,386 --> 01:38:30,149
From Doonpadrig, eh?

1476
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:31,403
That's the truth.

1477
01:38:31,403 --> 01:38:37,489
Take me...said she, and bury me...said she, 
in the little graveyard behind the hill.

1478
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:41,130
Tell me...do you happen to know 
Robert Moore from Doonpadrig?

1479
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:44,138
Is it the "Hard Bob"?

1480
01:38:44,138 --> 01:38:48,635
Isn't Bob's uncle a first cousin 
of me daughter-in-law's!?

1481
01:38:48,635 --> 01:38:51,324
I knew him in '32 
when he was at Backincuren. 

1482
01:38:52,491 --> 01:38:54,827
You know there's a travel ban...
other side of the border.

1483
01:38:54,827 --> 01:38:58,175
I know that, but I've permits 
to cover the whole party.

1484
01:38:58,175 --> 01:38:59,293
Do you want to see them?

1485
01:38:59,293 --> 01:39:02,052
It doesn't concern us...
but you better get a move on... 

1486
01:39:02,052 --> 01:39:04,115
...if you want to be in Doonpadrig 
before nightfall.

1487
01:39:04,115 --> 01:39:06,502
Aye...well I'll remember you to Bob, 
so I will.

1488
01:39:12,528 --> 01:39:15,083
What's the explanation of that?

1489
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:19,967
That was me sister Bridget's last wish...
to be buried with her alarm clock.

1490
01:39:19,967 --> 01:39:21,296
Open it up!

1491
01:39:21,296 --> 01:39:23,175
The Devil take you, 
if you lay a finger on it!

1492
01:39:23,175 --> 01:39:24,960
Have you no respect for the dead?

1493
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,050
It's nothing short of blasphemy 
and sacrilege!

1494
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:31,296
It's a wicked crime 
you'll be perpetrating!

1495
01:39:31,296 --> 01:39:33,093
Oh, me poor Bridget!

1496
01:39:33,942 --> 01:39:35,056
Beat it!

1497
01:39:42,783 --> 01:39:44,666
Hop it, lads...
We're rumbled!

1498
01:40:02,209 --> 01:40:03,296
What's going on?

1499
01:40:03,296 --> 01:40:04,449
A fight of some sort.

1500
01:40:04,449 --> 01:40:06,110
We can't afford 
to get mixed up in anything.

1501
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:07,709
Get out of it...quick!

1502
01:40:13,891 --> 01:40:15,356
My daughter, Biddy, is in the last carriage...

1503
01:40:15,356 --> 01:40:17,500
Pick her up and I'll meet you 
at Craig's farm.

1504
01:40:29,403 --> 01:40:32,379
Are you Mike Cleary's daughter Biddy?...
you're to come with me.

1505
01:41:17,205 --> 01:41:18,798
Where's this, do you think?

1506
01:41:18,798 --> 01:41:21,284
No idea...Seems to be 
the only hotel in the place...

1507
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:22,642
I'll ask them the way 
to the border.

1508
01:41:22,642 --> 01:41:27,601
The border? What are you going 
to do with me, David?

1509
01:41:27,601 --> 01:41:28,981
Take you across... 
into Northern Ireland.

1510
01:41:28,981 --> 01:41:30,186
And hand me over?

1511
01:41:30,186 --> 01:41:31,451
I must, Bridie.

1512
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:34,571
You're not going to take me out of 
a neutral country where I belong...

1513
01:41:34,571 --> 01:41:37,364
...so that I can be...tried and shot!

1514
01:41:37,364 --> 01:41:38,331
It's my duty.

1515
01:41:38,331 --> 01:41:41,056
It's your stiff-necked British obstinacy...
that's what it is!

1516
01:41:41,056 --> 01:41:42,270
Look here!...We're fighting a war!

1517
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:44,073
At the moment 
you're endangering part of it...

1518
01:41:44,073 --> 01:41:46,067
Can't you see?  You're a menace
that's got to be neutralised!

1519
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:47,664
I was born neutralised!

1520
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,525
Well, now that you seem 
to have made up your mind...

1521
01:41:50,525 --> 01:41:51,817
...why don't you go in 
and ask?

1522
01:42:04,349 --> 01:42:06,077
Go on...tap on the hatch!

1523
01:42:13,074 --> 01:42:13,741
That's right!...

1524
01:42:16,104 --> 01:42:17,568
Yes, sir...now what can I do 
for you?

1525
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:19,908
Ask him!

1526
01:42:22,908 --> 01:42:23,743
Is there any whiskey?

1527
01:42:24,854 --> 01:42:27,117
No...it's nothing but draught beer.

1528
01:42:27,117 --> 01:42:28,103
Alright...2 halves.

1529
01:42:28,103 --> 01:42:29,348
2 half pints.

1530
01:42:29,348 --> 01:42:31,809
I thought you were going to ask him 
the way to the border.

1531
01:42:31,809 --> 01:42:32,508
I am.

1532
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,771
Thanks.

1533
01:42:38,189 --> 01:42:39,952
How far is it to 
the nearest police station?

1534
01:42:39,952 --> 01:42:42,290
About a mile and a half 
up the road.

1535
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:43,438
Where's your telephone?

1536
01:42:44,405 --> 01:42:46,078
In the back parlour...why?

1537
01:42:46,078 --> 01:42:49,450
I want you to telephone them.

1538
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:51,182
It's important, and I can't leave 
this young lady.

1539
01:42:51,182 --> 01:42:53,447
Oh, you can't, can you?

1540
01:42:53,447 --> 01:42:54,592
Tell them she's the one 
they're looking for.

1541
01:42:54,592 --> 01:42:56,986
She's here waiting for them.
Her name's Bridie Quilty.

1542
01:42:56,986 --> 01:42:59,455
Bridie Quilty...will they know it?

1543
01:42:59,455 --> 01:43:00,602
By now, they will.

1544
01:43:01,488 --> 01:43:02,470
I said it's important.

1545
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:03,338
Right.

1546
01:43:04,356 --> 01:43:05,932
Do you know what you're doing?

1547
01:43:05,932 --> 01:43:07,798
Of course...behaving 
like a gibbering idiot.

1548
01:43:07,798 --> 01:43:09,571
When the police get here they'll intern me.

1549
01:43:09,571 --> 01:43:10,321
Exactly.

1550
01:43:10,321 --> 01:43:12,802
Here in Eire, where you'll be safe, 
and can't do any harm.

1551
01:43:12,802 --> 01:43:13,737
But what about YOU?

1552
01:43:13,737 --> 01:43:15,082
I'll say goodbye 
when they get here.

1553
01:43:15,082 --> 01:43:16,827
But those 2 officers 
on the Isle of Man...

1554
01:43:16,827 --> 01:43:18,782
...they know you've been concerned with...

1555
01:43:18,782 --> 01:43:19,882
...with ME!

1556
01:43:19,882 --> 01:43:20,934
Yes.

1557
01:43:20,934 --> 01:43:23,313
The War Office is going to object, isn't it?

1558
01:43:23,313 --> 01:43:25,159
Oh, no, no...
I'll probably get a gong for it.

1559
01:43:25,159 --> 01:43:26,797
You'll be shot!

1560
01:43:26,797 --> 01:43:30,594
Oh, hardly!  Merely cashiered, drummed out
and imprisoned in The Tower.

1561
01:43:30,594 --> 01:43:31,892
Why are you doing this?

1562
01:43:31,892 --> 01:43:32,943
I've probably gone mad.

1563
01:43:32,943 --> 01:43:34,412
Well, I'm not going to let you.

1564
01:43:34,412 --> 01:43:36,022
You're not going to have any choice.

1565
01:43:38,402 --> 01:43:39,608
They're on their way.

1566
01:43:40,434 --> 01:43:42,245
They'll be here any time now.
I was speaking to Micky Doyle.

1567
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:44,440
Himself...he's the sergeant.

1568
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:45,340
Good.

1569
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:48,252
From what he says, she must be 
a desperate character altogether.

1570
01:43:48,252 --> 01:43:49,339
She is, very.

1571
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,703
Thank you.

1572
01:43:50,703 --> 01:43:52,282
That'll be 1/8d Sir

1573
01:43:53,677 --> 01:43:56,494
1/6d for the beers...
and 2d for the telephone.

1574
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:03,332
You wouldn't be wanting 
any help with her, would you?

1575
01:44:03,332 --> 01:44:04,434
No! Go away.

1576
01:44:08,984 --> 01:44:09,882
David...

1577
01:44:10,818 --> 01:44:11,600
Yes?

1578
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:13,755
I AM sorry!

1579
01:44:13,755 --> 01:44:16,202
You'd much better 
never have met me.

1580
01:44:16,722 --> 01:44:18,216
I'd do the same again.

1581
01:44:18,943 --> 01:44:21,643
Couldn't you let yourself 
get interned with me, maybe?

1582
01:44:21,643 --> 01:44:22,586
No.

1583
01:44:24,445 --> 01:44:25,427
Sláinte!

1584
01:44:25,427 --> 01:44:27,080
Sláinte!

1585
01:44:32,486 --> 01:44:33,911
How much is draught beer in Eire?

1586
01:44:33,911 --> 01:44:36,216
4d a half pint, for this stuff.

1587
01:44:36,216 --> 01:44:37,751
They charged me double...1/6d.

1588
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:38,607
Then he cheated you.

1589
01:44:38,607 --> 01:44:40,567
And no spirits.

1590
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,393
Does it matter, 
at a time like this?

1591
01:44:43,393 --> 01:44:45,511
Bridie..look at that girl...

1592
01:44:49,003 --> 01:44:49,927
She's chewing gum.

1593
01:44:56,608 --> 01:44:58,181
Hi ya slick chick...what's cookin'?

1594
01:44:58,181 --> 01:44:59,970
Oh, lay off, Al!

1595
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:01,657
We're in Northern Ireland!

1596
01:45:01,657 --> 01:45:03,038
Say, what's been giving you, kid?

1597
01:45:03,038 --> 01:45:05,130
He wouldn't let me go until 9, honey.

1598
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:07,048
Gonna be mighty late for that dance.

1599
01:45:07,048 --> 01:45:09,490
It'll be OK, they don't start til late 
over the other side.

1600
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:11,192
Yeah, but by the time we get there...

1601
01:45:11,192 --> 01:45:13,841
Listen to me high pockets, 
just let me get my handbag...

1602
01:45:13,841 --> 01:45:16,526
...and we'll be south of that 
little old border in 10 minutes.

1603
01:45:16,526 --> 01:45:18,464
- Right on the ball, ain't you babe?
- You're darned tootin'!

1604
01:45:23,211 --> 01:45:25,929
David...that means you must 
have telephone the British police.

1605
01:45:25,929 --> 01:45:27,227
The Ulster Constabulary.

1606
01:45:28,833 --> 01:45:30,262
You heard what they said...
it's only a 10 minutes' walk.

1607
01:45:30,262 --> 01:45:32,945
If they can slip over for a dance, 
there's nothing to stop us.

1608
01:45:32,945 --> 01:45:35,604
No, David, it seems like Heaven's will 
that we'll be caught...

1609
01:45:35,604 --> 01:45:37,119
...and here I'll stay.

1610
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,767
- But we can be over the border in 10 minutes...
- It's no use telling me...

1611
01:45:39,767 --> 01:45:40,740
I've made up me mind... 

1612
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:43,217
...and all the powers on earth 
won't make me change it.

1613
01:45:43,217 --> 01:45:45,197
Bridie...for heaven's sake, be sensible.

1614
01:45:45,197 --> 01:45:47,149
Now sit down, and take it easy.

1615
01:45:49,202 --> 01:45:50,289
They'll be here any minute!

1616
01:45:50,289 --> 01:45:52,798
And we'll met them together, 
tell them the truth... 

1617
01:45:52,798 --> 01:45:53,870
...and hope for the best.

1618
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:55,615
There's nothing they can do 
to you now...

1619
01:45:55,615 --> 01:45:57,562
There's no reason why you shouldn't feel 
as happy as I feel...

1620
01:45:57,562 --> 01:45:59,672
...now that me mind's at peace 
for a change.

1621
01:45:59,672 --> 01:46:01,149
- Bridie...
- Give me your hand, David...

1622
01:46:02,686 --> 01:46:06,077
Now, we'll sit here quietly and enjoy 
the last few minutes we have together...

1623
01:46:06,077 --> 01:46:07,999
Just the two of us.

1624
01:46:08,765 --> 01:46:09,638
Alone.

1625
01:46:11,629 --> 01:46:12,557
Excuse me!

1626
01:46:23,868 --> 01:46:25,795
This is the BBC Home Service...

1627
01:46:26,679 --> 01:46:29,353
Here is the news, read by John Snaid...

1628
01:46:30,309 --> 01:46:31,675
D-Day has come...

1629
01:46:32,617 --> 01:46:34,981
Early this morning the Allies 
began the assault 

1630
01:46:34,981 --> 01:46:37,548
on the Northwest corner 
of Hitler's European fortress.

1631
01:46:37,548 --> 01:46:38,214
It's started!

1632
01:46:38,214 --> 01:46:40,542
- Then there's no reason...
- No! Not now!

1633
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:41,317
The border!

1634
01:46:58,234 --> 01:46:59,159
Up here!

1635
01:47:10,978 --> 01:47:13,554
- Mind how you go, Sugar!
- Oh there she goes!

1636
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:17,492
Alright?

1637
01:47:17,492 --> 01:47:18,367
Yes.

1638
01:47:21,914 --> 01:47:22,612
Where is she?

1639
01:47:22,612 --> 01:47:23,312
She's in the saloon.

1640
01:47:44,325 --> 01:47:45,638
That's funny...she was here a minute ago.

1641
01:47:46,416 --> 01:47:47,417
Goodbye!

1642
01:47:48,461 --> 01:47:50,022
Goodbye David!

1643
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:10,690
Could be in the lounge 
or in the back parlour.

1644
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:12,358
Go with him to the back parlour, Pat.

1645
01:48:45,209 --> 01:48:46,164
Easy now, gentlemen!

1646
01:48:53,078 --> 01:48:54,202
Open the door at once!

1647
01:49:03,109 --> 01:49:03,865
Come out!

1648
01:49:43,811 --> 01:49:46,738
- That was couple of swell dishes!
- I'll say!

1649
01:50:15,965 --> 01:50:19,093
I am glad we stopped here 
instead of going on to Hereford.

1650
01:50:19,093 --> 01:50:22,228
Did you notice my hand trembling 
when I wrote "Mr & Mrs Baynes."?

1651
01:50:25,757 --> 01:50:26,942
I'll slip down and put the car away.

1652
01:50:44,591 --> 01:50:46,990
Well!...of all the...!

1653
01:51:01,079 --> 01:51:02,246
Bridie!...

1654
01:51:17,582 --> 01:51:19,451
What the Devil are you up to?

1655
01:51:19,451 --> 01:51:21,973
How dare you do 
a thing like this to me?

1656
01:51:21,973 --> 01:51:24,076
I won't stop in this place, 
so I won't...

1657
01:51:24,076 --> 01:51:26,635
Not if the sky itself were to fall down 
on the top of me head...

1658
01:51:26,635 --> 01:51:28,307
I won't stop in it!

1659
01:51:40,284 --> 01:51:43,963
