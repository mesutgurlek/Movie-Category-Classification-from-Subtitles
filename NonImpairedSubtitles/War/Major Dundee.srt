1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,536
<i>In the territory of New Mexico,</i>
<i>toward the end of the Civil War...</i>

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,613
<i>an Indian, Sierra Charriba,</i>
<i>and his 47 Apache warriors...</i>

3
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,450
<i>raided, sacked, and looted an area</i>
<i>almost three times the size of Texas.</i>

4
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,654
<i>On October 31, 1864...</i>

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,459
<i>an entire company</i>
<i>of the 5th United States Cavalry...</i>

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,929
<i>sent out from Fort Benlin to destroy him...</i>

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,496
<i>was ambushed and massacred</i>
<i>at the Rostes ranch.</i>

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,093
<i>We are indebted to Timothy Ryan, bugler,</i>
<i>5th United States Cavalry...</i>

9
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,456
<i>the company</i>'<i>s sole survivor, for his diary...</i>

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,977
<i>the only existing record of this tragedy,</i>
<i>and the campaign that followed.</i>

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,572
Let go of me! I want my mom!

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,812
Pony soldier, I am Sierra Charriba.

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,256
Who you send against me now?

14
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,529
- Lieutenant!
- Sir?

15
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,692
Take the first, second and third squads
and cover the ridge sides.

16
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,816
- Yes, sir.
- lf I signal you to come, you come.

17
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,891
If I signal you to charge, you charge.

18
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,175
If I signal you to run,
you follow me and run.

19
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,012
- Otherwise hold your position.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,692
- First squad to the right.
- Mr. Potts.

21
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,452
Second squad to the left.

22
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,809
Major.

23
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,369
I'm a long way from Gettysburg.
Any suggestions?

24
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,529
Let's go have a look, slow and easy.

25
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,455
To the left. To the right.

26
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,619
<i>November 1.</i>

27
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,049
<i>This morning I returned with the relief</i>
<i>column to the scene of the massacre.</i>

28
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,892
<i>The Major had expressed little hope...</i>

29
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,858
<i>that any of the civilians or troopers</i>
<i>would be alive.</i>

30
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,896
<i>But Samuel Potts, the Major</i>'<i>s scout...</i>

31
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,813
<i>knew Apaches well</i>
<i>and said they never kill boy children.</i>

32
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,051
<i>They take them as captives</i>
<i>and raise them as warriors.</i>

33
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,177
<i>He felt the three Rostes boys</i>
<i>may still be alive.</i>

34
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,818
<i>But he had no such hope</i>
<i>for their sister, Beth.</i>

35
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,053
<i>He was right.</i>

36
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,740
<i>I looked down at her</i>
<i>and thought with hatred of Riago...</i>

37
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,618
<i>our Apache scout, who led us to this place.</i>

38
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,577
<i>His body was never found...</i>

39
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,779
<i>and I will always wonder if he escaped</i>
<i>the massacre or was part of it.</i>

40
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,693
Hold your positions!

41
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,538
- That scarf belonged to Lt. Brannin.
- That's for you, Major.

42
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,093
I hope he was dead
when they did that to him.

43
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,933
If he was dead they wouldn't have bothered.

44
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,610
- Go cut him down, Sergeant.
- Brannin was a soldier, Amos.

45
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,134
Goes with the pretty girls and the pension.

46
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,536
How much chance have I
of getting those children back?

47
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,614
One chance in a thousand, I'd say...

48
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,217
if they gave you a division
and a year to do it, at least.

49
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,210
Much chance of that, is there?

50
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,168
I'll take five days
to get men, horses, ordnance.

51
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,170
On the fifth day I want you back
at Fort Benlin to tell me where Charriba is.

52
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,854
I'll get the children and I'll get him.

53
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,572
- Sam.
- Yeah?

54
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,050
Don't get yourself killed.
That would inconvenience me.

55
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,171
Ryan!

56
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,772
<i>With so many troopers away...</i>

57
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,569
<i>five Confederate prisoners</i>
<i>broke out of Fort Benlin and escaped.</i>

58
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,696
<i>We trapped them on our way back.</i>

59
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,657
Evening, Ben.

60
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,049
Evening, Amos.

61
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,051
Should have tried it before I took command.

62
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,928
Command of what, the burial detail?

63
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,016
- Move them out, Lieutenant.
- Move them out!

64
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,933
Troops, right! Pair of twos, right!

65
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,693
I brought back your wandering boys,
Captain.

66
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,609
Now you tell me how they got loose.

67
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,737
They clubbed two guards
and went over the wall.

68
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,093
I'd like to point out, Amos,
at the time of the escape...

69
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,775
131 men of this command
were half a day's march from here...

70
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,019
either digging graves or rotting in the sun,
waiting to be buried.

71
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,057
I want every prisoner that can walk
on this parade ground in 10 minutes.

72
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,655
Including those in irons.

73
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,291
Bugler, sound assembly.

74
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,380
They're gonna give us a party, Captain.

75
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,733
It sure looks like it.

76
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,331
You thieves, renegades, deserters...

77
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,414
you gentlemen of the South.
I want some volunteers.

78
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,936
I want volunteers to fight
the Apache Sierra Charriba.

79
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,175
I need horse soldiers.
Men who can ride, men who can shoot.

80
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,575
In return I promise you nothing.

81
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,289
Saddle sores, short rations,
maybe a bullet in your belly.

82
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,453
And free air to breathe,
a fair share of tobacco, quarter pay.

83
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,089
My good will.

84
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,536
Best offices for pardons
and paroles when we get back.

85
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,688
I don't know
what that might be worth to you.

86
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,098
But I do know if any man signs on with me
and then attempts to desert...

87
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,895
I will shoot him out of hand.

88
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,729
From you I'll accept one man
with some experience of command...

89
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,697
as an acting lieutenant.

90
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,573
Captain Tyreen...

91
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,290
does the prospect of serving
under your country's flag once again...

92
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,009
seem more attractive
than dragging its chains in this prison?

93
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,729
It is not my country, Major Dundee.

94
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,735
I damn its flag and I damn you...

95
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,935
and I would rather hang than serve.

96
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,769
Corporal Veitch just died, sir.

97
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,891
And hang you will!

98
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,570
You and your four good friends.

99
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,972
You're going to stand trial
on a charge of murder.

100
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,569
That guard you clubbed just died.

101
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,249
You've been found guilty of the charges
and specifications here mentioned.

102
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,138
It is the sentence of this court
that on November 6...

103
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,530
at 6:00 a.m. you shall be hanged by the neck
until dead.

104
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,775
Remove the prisoners,
with the exception of Benjamin Tyreen.

105
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,659
Right face, forward march.

106
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,657
These proceedings are closed.

107
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,014
Sit down.

108
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,139
Five years.

109
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,698
You're still blaming me
instead of yourself, huh?

110
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,733
I'll say one thing, Ben,
you sure haven't mellowed any.

111
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,653
When are you going to learn
you made all your own troubles?

112
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,651
Who had me cashiered out of the regiment?

113
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,890
I cast one vote out of five.

114
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,574
Two of those votes were for my acquittal.

115
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,969
But not you. Not my own captain.

116
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,891
Not my own friend.

117
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,778
The conscience of the court
was not my concern.

118
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,816
What did concern you, Amos?

119
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,897
- That the man I killed was a Yankee?
- He was your brother officer.

120
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,777
It was a duel of honour.

121
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,132
You're Southern born,
you knew what that meant.

122
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,778
If he had killed me, and he had a chance...

123
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,090
- would you have convicted him?
- I would.

124
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,613
You're a liar.

125
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,772
You voted to please the generals
in Washington.

126
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,458
You voted a promotion
for Amos Charles Dundee.

127
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,928
You're a traitor to your country, Ben.
You gonna blame me for that, too?

128
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,659
Sergeant!

129
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,739
Yes, sir.

130
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,690
I should have known better
than to try to talk to you.

131
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,371
You'll try again, Major.

132
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,375
<i>The Major had asked for thieves,</i>
<i>renegades and deserters...</i>

133
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,897
<i>and that</i>'<i>s what he got.</i>
<i>After four hours he had accepted only three.</i>

134
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,938
Ryan, what are you doing here?

135
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,773
I'm volunteering, too, sir. I've earned it, sir.

136
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,217
You'll need a bugler, sir.

137
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,410
- Stand over there.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,375
Benjamin Priam, sir.

139
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,337
What do you do?

140
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,532
What did you say?

141
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,013
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- I'm a horse thief!

142
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,171
You a good horse thief?

143
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,578
The best there is, sir.

144
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,890
Sign your name or make your mark.

145
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,129
I need horses and mules, Mr. Priam.

146
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,575
Here's the amount you'll have to spend...

147
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,690
and here is your safe-conduct.

148
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,892
- Do you need an escort?
- No, sir.

149
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,732
He'll be back, sir.

150
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,970
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

151
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,449
- Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,179
- Get Lt. Andreen.
- On duty, Major.

153
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,175
- Lt. Fredericks.
- Hospital.

154
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,335
- Lewison.
- Officer of the day.

155
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,650
- Sgt. Cable?
- Patrol.

156
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,894
- Get me Lt. Graham.
- Yes, sir.

157
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,571
- Five hours, five men.
- You need a regiment.

158
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,411
Charriba can't be taken by a pick-up
company of garrison troopers.

159
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,536
You should know that by now.

160
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,656
What are you trying to say, Frank?

161
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,896
Come on, speak up. Spit it out!

162
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm not trying to say that
the massacre was your fault.

163
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,930
I'm saying that you should recognise
that your transfer to this post...

164
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,818
was a disciplinary action, pure and simple.

165
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,055
And if you try to fight your own war again
as you did at Gettysburg, they'll break you.

166
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,738
They won't break me,
not if I get Charriba and those kids.

167
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,050
Has it occurred to you, Major...

168
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,571
that the Apache will undoubtedly
enter Mexico for the winter?

169
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,369
Mexico presently contains an army
of 30,000 French soldiers.

170
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,337
Yes, it's occurred to me.

171
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,218
Frank, I am a professional soldier,
I'm not a prison keeper.

172
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,695
Now this is something that's gotta be done
and I'm gonna do it...

173
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,929
now!

174
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,773
Are you pursuing the Apache, Major,
or a promotion?

175
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,132
Whatever my reasons are, Frank...

176
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,179
you'd better get down on your knees
and pray to God I don't take you with me.

177
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,340
I suppose you intend to strip this garrison.

178
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,369
I will take just 10 men from the command.
Volunteers.

179
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,209
The bulk of my force
will be made up of prisoners.

180
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,098
You'd be well advised
not to accept Confederate prisoners...

181
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,329
even if they're forthcoming.

182
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,854
In my absence,
you'll assume command of the garrison.

183
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,613
Discharge all duties
incumbent upon that command.

184
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,453
I have, as you can see...

185
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,336
appended to your orders
a statement over my signature...

186
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,652
to the effect that I assume
total and complete responsibility...

187
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,492
for all such actions.

188
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,693
Here. Does that cover it?

189
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,289
No, sir.

190
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,535
I consider it my responsibility
to notify General Carlton...

191
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,533
of what I believe to be an irresponsible
and dangerous course of action.

192
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,657
- Do your worst.
- You could be shot for this, Amos.

193
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,058
My executioners will have to stand in line.

194
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,253
That's all, Captain.

195
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,737
Corporal Tinney!

196
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,615
Sir?

197
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,209
Where in hell is Lt. Graham?

198
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,973
Carry on.

199
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,094
- The Major's waiting to see you, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.

200
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,736
- Sir!
- Lieutenant Graham.

201
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,809
- They're not much, are they?
- No, sir, they don't seem to be.

202
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,969
Cigar?

203
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,051
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

204
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,531
- Coffee?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

205
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,499
Why did they put you in the cavalry,
Lieutenant?

206
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,095
- Sir?
- Why did they assign you to the cavalry?

207
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,812
You're ordnance, aren't you?

208
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,855
No, sir. Artillery.

209
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,373
- Artillery?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,697
As Napoleon said, "Only thunderbolts
can be preferred to cannon."

211
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,498
- Napoleon?
- Yes, sir!

212
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,778
You'll do, Lieutenant. You'll have to.

213
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,616
I need rifles and ammunition.

214
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,576
It's all listed there in that inventory:
number of rounds, types of ordnance.

215
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,218
You go get them for me.

216
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,459
Forthwith.

217
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,288
Yes, sir!

218
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,974
Lieutenant.

219
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,055
- Sir?
- Where are you going?

220
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,970
I said, "Where are you going?"

221
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,019
To obtain...

222
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,574
these weapons?

223
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,096
And just how and where
do you intend to accomplish that?

224
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,970
It has come to my attention that
a supply train from the Ordnance Depot...

225
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,699
at Denver,
en route to the 2nd California Column...

226
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,736
now garrisoned in Santa Fe...

227
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,695
should be encamped tomorrow morning
at the Sand River crossing...

228
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,493
thirty miles away.

229
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,771
Now, if you have the opportunity,
you might just take C Troop.

230
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,773
See if you can be of any assistance.

231
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,493
Yes, sir.

232
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,533
<i>November 4.</i>

233
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,569
<i>Lt. Graham had no official orders,</i>
<i>but this didn</i>'<i>t stop him.</i>

234
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,528
<i>He was very persuasive,</i>
<i>with Sgt. Gomez and C Troop standing by.</i>

235
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,176
<i>He took what the Major needed.</i>

236
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,971
<i>We returned with 48 new Henry rifles,</i>
<i>5,000 rounds of ammunition...</i>

237
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,050
<i>and a baby howitzer</i>
<i>for the lieutenant to play with.</i>

238
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,538
I see you transferred back to the artillery,
Lieutenant.

239
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,848
Yes, sir.

240
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,254
<i>Over a hundred civilian prisoners</i>
<i>volunteered...</i>

241
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,248
<i>and from them the Major took six,</i>
<i>and they were doubtful at best.</i>

242
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,537
<i>While we waited for horses,</i>
<i>the rebel prisoners that we needed...</i>

243
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,770
<i>watched the gallows being built.</i>

244
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,819
<i>The gallows on which the Major will hang</i>
<i>Sgt. Chillum, the Hadley brothers...</i>

245
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,856
<i>Jimmy Lee, and their captain.</i>

246
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,339
Captain.

247
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,338
- You figure he's bluffing?
- Sure, he's bluffing.

248
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,131
He needs us much more than we need him.

249
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,893
Captain, that ain't no dance floor
they're building for us.

250
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,256
We just want you to know, sir,
that whatever you figure on...

251
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,092
we're all with you.

252
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,573
<i>Without Confederate volunteers,</i>
<i>the Major was forced to accept cowboys...</i>

253
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,332
<i>drifters and drunks.</i>

254
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,848
You wanted Injun-fighting, mule-packing,
whiskey-drinking volunteers, sir.

255
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,851
Well, by God, you've got one.

256
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,056
What am I going to do with you?

257
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,496
He's the biggest drunk,
but the best packer in the territory, sir.

258
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,491
- What's your name?
- Wiley.

259
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,095
Wiley, make your mark.

260
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,250
- Whiskey?
- All you can drink.

261
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,849
When you've earned it.

262
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,329
Sergeant, throw him in a cell
and dry him out.

263
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,059
- Come on, Wiley.
- I never seen anything like it.

264
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,018
- How many is that, Ryan?
- Twelve, sir.

265
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,456
- Name?
- Dalhstrom.

266
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,332
Any man with a just cause
should travel with the word of God.

267
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,093
With all due respect,
God has nothing to do with it.

268
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,456
I intend to smite the wicked,
not save the heathen.

269
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,136
Seventeen years ago,
I married John and Mary Rostes.

270
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,052
Who that destroyeth my flock,
I will so destroy.

271
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,689
Reverend.

272
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,379
<i>November 5.</i>

273
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,896
<i>The Confederate prisoners are angry</i>
<i>and uneasy, waiting for tomorrow...</i>

274
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,336
<i>the day the rebel captain</i>
<i>and his four companions are to hang.</i>

275
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,930
<i>We are fearful of the consequences.</i>

276
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,098
<i>All of us know the Major needs the Captain</i>
<i>and his men...</i>

277
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,852
<i>but the Major is stubborn.</i>

278
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,417
<i>I think he will hang them</i>
<i>if they don</i>'<i>t volunteer.</i>

279
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,174
I would like to volunteer, sir.
Me and my six coloureds.

280
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,410
I haven't asked for volunteers
from the command.

281
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,889
- We're doing the asking, sir.
- Why?

282
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,095
To fight, sir.

283
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,298
We've been standing guard
and cleaning stables for nearly two years.

284
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,330
Tomorrow morning you ask
the officer of the day to see me.

285
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,970
You and your six coloureds.

286
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,048
Thank you, sir.

287
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,453
The rebel captain
Ben Tyreen's compliments, sir.

288
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,098
He will see you now.

289
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,449
He will?

290
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,969
Yes, sir.

291
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,769
And he further states that he will
volunteer himself and his men as needed...

292
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,535
for double rations for all prisoners
plus Gen. Carlton's written guarantee...

293
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,088
that all Southern soldiers
who serve with you, sir...

294
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,648
will be automatically granted full pardon.

295
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,300
Now, sir,
if I may be so bold as to suggest<i>...</i>

296
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,649
Guard!

297
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,897
- Open it up.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,134
Major, it has come to my attention...

299
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,539
You kill one of my soldiers and then
have the gall to dictate terms to me?

300
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,978
You're a damn traitor, Ben.

301
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,415
You were a rebel
before you ever saw the South.

302
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,092
And now you're a murderer.

303
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,775
Tomorrow morning, I am going to hang you
and be done with you.

304
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,969
Jailer.

305
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,854
Sergeant!

306
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,053
How many men do you need?

307
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,778
Twenty. Good ones.

308
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,216
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed,
only that.

309
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,329
Agreed.

310
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,296
Then you have my word, Major.
We will serve.

311
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,810
But after that we're going home.

312
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,849
If it's too rich for you...

313
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,651
hang us now and be done with it.

314
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,459
I just might hang you
and that Injun to the same tree, Ben.

315
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,610
You'll play hell getting it done, Amos.

316
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,249
This man will hold lieutenant's rank
under myself and Lt. Graham.

317
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,419
Will you serve?

318
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,658
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed, sir.

319
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,939
Attention!

320
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,453
Lieutenant Graham,
get away from that damn bell!

321
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,297
Priam, they're a bunch of Roman-nosed,
broken-gutted, spavined...

322
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,611
sore-footed, swaybacked dogs.
You call yourself a horse thief?

323
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,419
Samuel Potts!

324
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,138
Those Injuns you got with you
look kind of shy, Samuel.

325
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,813
- They ain't sure they're welcome, Amos.
- Get on up here. I'll buy you a drink.

326
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,215
Ryan!

327
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,376
<i>Today Mr. Potts got back.</i>
<i>With him was Riago.</i>

328
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,097
<i>If Lt. Brannin were alive</i>
<i>he would hang the Apache...</i>

329
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,739
<i>and I would help.</i>

330
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,731
Yeah, but where in Mexico?

331
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,979
The children?

332
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,609
Well, they're skinny,
but doing better than you'd expect.

333
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,617
Making their own arrows now.

334
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,533
That's Riago who rode in with you, isn't it?

335
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,735
They all look alike to you, Amos?

336
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,656
I asked you a question, Sam.

337
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,093
That's Riago.

338
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,452
Where'd you find him?

339
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,777
Didn't. He found me.

340
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,130
He said after the massacre
he hit for the bush, stayed on their trail...

341
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,370
figured I'd be along sooner or later.

342
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,257
I believe him, Amos.

343
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,652
Who's the other one?

344
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,090
He's got a personal score to settle.

345
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,329
Seems old Charriba wouldn't take him
along with him on this last raid.

346
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,331
Said he couldn't be trusted.

347
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,059
Now he's got his mind set
on killing the old man.

348
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,894
Do you expect me to believe these Apaches
will turn against their own families?

349
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,857
Track down their own people?

350
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,058
Why not?
Everyone else seems to be doing it.

351
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,409
Lt. Brannin didn't trust Riago. Right, Ryan?

352
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,974
Yes, sir.

353
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,374
I'm afraid I go along with that, Sam.

354
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,498
Well, you go along with Lt. Brannin then.

355
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,810
Well, you go along without me.

356
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,214
Sam Potts.

357
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,939
Looks like the Union jackets
you gave us didn't quite fit, Major.

358
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,528
So I see.

359
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,893
<i>The last day was spent getting</i>
<i>acquainted with our comrades-in-arms.</i>

360
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,133
<i>Learning how to handle the pack animals</i>
<i>with sureness and dispatch.</i>

361
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,658
<i>And learning the character of our officers.</i>

362
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,013
Troop, fall in!

363
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,611
Foot soldiers,
I want a company of twos on my right.

364
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,973
Cavalry, fall in 20 paces in front of me.

365
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,535
I want a column of twos on my right!
Line up here.

366
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,016
Get that mule out of there!

367
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,694
Fall them in with the artillery,
20 paces in front of me!

368
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,896
Column of twos on my right!

369
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,249
Fall in!

370
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,695
If I tell you one more time,
you're court-martialed!

371
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,578
Why don't you find a horse and mount up,
Lieutenant Graham?

372
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,890
You don't seem
to be doing very well on foot.

373
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,174
Mount up!

374
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,539
<i>November 7, and we were ready,</i>
<i>all who volunteered.</i>

375
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,532
<i>Civilians, criminals, Southerners,</i>
<i>and Negroes.</i>

376
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,851
Gentlemen,
we've given the Major our parole...

377
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,976
and we will serve him until I say we will not.

378
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,209
And until that time...

379
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,258
he will be your commanding officer
and will be treated as such.

380
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,811
And any sign of disrespect to him
will be taken as a personal insult by me.

381
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,175
Don't worry none, Uncle Ben,
when the time comes...

382
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,615
we'll turpentine that caulky,
chicken-picking Yankee.

383
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,295
I am not your uncle,
you redneck peckerwood.

384
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,093
And one more word out of you
and you'll end this campaign in chains.

385
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,615
Attention!

386
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,409
Good luck, Frank.
Give my regards to the General.

387
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,449
I mean for you to have that pleasure
within the week, Amos.

388
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,014
If you don't, good luck.

389
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,369
I have but three orders of march:

390
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,893
If I signal you to come, you come.
If I signal you to charge, you charge.

391
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,655
And if I signal you to run,
you follow me and run like hell.

392
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,776
Move them out, Lieutenant.

393
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,092
- Twos right!
- Twos right!

394
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,251
- Left turn!
- Left turn!

395
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,539
- Whistle me a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,009
<i>November 18.</i>
<i>We are now in Texas approaching Mexico.</i>

397
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,250
<i>And the Major</i>
<i>does not mean to be surprised...</i>

398
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,615
<i>by Confederate patrols out of Fort Davis.</i>

399
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,419
- No fires tonight, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,098
Trooper Hadley,
you are not part of my gun crew.

401
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,332
Cold coffee again.

402
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,296
It's 50 miles to the border,
and 86 to Fort Davis.

403
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,056
I wonder if we'll make it.

404
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,454
Make what, Sergeant Chillum?

405
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,338
Make it back to where we come from,
Captain.

406
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,934
We'll make it. It's just a question of time.

407
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,456
<i>It was just after dawn and we were starting</i>
<i>for the Rio Grande when Riago returned.</i>

408
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,575
<i>I still don</i>'<i>t trust him.</i>

409
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,537
- Twos right!
- Major.

410
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,257
Says he got close enough
to smell the stink of many white men.

411
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,570
I wager they're waiting for us
at the river, Amos.

412
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,494
- We'd better walk on water.
- Let's find out what we're made of.

413
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,249
Boy!

414
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,496
Full gallop, son. We'll let those rebels
know there's a Yankee army come to call.

415
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,219
Troop, halt!

416
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,128
Mr. Potts. Sergeant Gomez.
First 12 men across as skirmishers.

417
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,893
- Troop right, roll!
- Lieutenant Graham, move them out!

418
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,413
Column of twos.

419
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,210
Confederate cavalry, Lieutenant.

420
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,657
We don't have much time.

421
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,934
Your word's worth about
as much as your cause.

422
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,252
- Then why don't you release him from it?
- Ben, you gave it, you break it.

423
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,733
And be damned to you.

424
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,495
- What do you want from us anyway?
- I've got what I want, Sergeant.

425
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,172
I've got his word.

426
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,050
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir.

427
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,212
- Move them out.
- Which way, Captain?

428
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,689
To Mexico, you bloody idiot!

429
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,660
<i>November 19. We are in Mexico...</i>

430
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,252
<i>November 19. We are in Mexico...</i>

431
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,848
<i>and this day</i>'<i>s events</i>
<i>have made it clear to everyone...</i>

432
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,330
<i>that the Major</i>'<i>s present war is not</i>
<i>with the South, but with the Apache.</i>

433
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,020
- Lunge!
- That's very good, Aesop.

434
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,255
Thank you, sir.

435
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,055
But as Napoleon said, only thunderbolts
can be preferred to cannon.

436
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,256
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

437
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,579
Order arms.

438
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,258
Thank you, Priam.

439
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,136
Boy, I'm speaking to you!

440
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,054
You're forgetting your manners, nigger.

441
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,419
Come on over here and pull off my boots.

442
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,419
Lieutenant Graham.

443
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,852
Check the pickets.

444
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,858
Did you hear me, boy?

445
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,416
Do it, boy, now.

446
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,539
Let me, son.

447
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,252
Let go off my leg!

448
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,495
Preacher, you sure kick up a lot of dust
with your sermon.

449
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,369
Don't forget your footgear, sonny.

450
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,289
- You started it, now finish it.
- No, we're gonna finish it.

451
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,293
By doggies, Preacher,
now we're gonna get in line for you.

452
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,453
- I'm gonna cut me a piece of you first.
- You southern trash sit down!

453
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,490
Was you talking to me, Sergeant?

454
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,135
Now maybe you don't know it,
but you're fixing to get tried.

455
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,859
You and all the rest of your bluebellies.

456
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,889
Trooper!

457
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,693
Mr. Aesop, we would like to compliment you
and your men...

458
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,170
on the way you handled the river crossing
this afternoon.

459
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,253
Thank you, sir.

460
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,368
That gesture was necessary.
I'm sorry it was so painful for you.

461
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,216
Mr. Aesop is a fine soldier.
It won't happen again.

462
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,419
What happened is what it's all about, Ben.

463
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,615
If it was as simple as that, Amos.

464
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,370
We can take care of our own.

465
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,020
If you can, you waited too long to do it.

466
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,979
All you people, all the way down the line.

467
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,335
"You people"?

468
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,333
I'm not going to thank you for keeping
your word this afternoon at the river.

469
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,092
You were obliged to.

470
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,534
But it wasn't easy, and I respect you for it.

471
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,216
I don't need respect from a man who took
his kin to fight against their own brothers.

472
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,978
I took soldiers to fight for their country.

473
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,498
- You betrayed it.
- What country have I to betray?

474
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,176
I'm fighting for the only country I have left,
and I kill men in a hopeless war for it.

475
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,173
But not men who were my neighbours
and my friends.

476
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,169
Friends.

477
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,696
The best friend you ever had
was the man who got you into West Point.

478
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,812
He was killed with the 2nd Michigan
in Chickamauga last winter.

479
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,414
- Did you know that?
- I knew that, Amos.

480
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,415
You're a would-be cavalier,
an Irish potato farmer with a plumed hat...

481
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,254
fighting for a white-columned
plantation house...

482
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,456
you never had and never will.

483
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,010
How exactly do you see yourself,
Major Dundee?

484
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:05,530
Have you ever stopped to think why
they made you a jailer instead of a soldier?

485
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,773
<i>December 22, 1864.</i>
<i>We are five weeks into Mexico...</i>

486
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,454
<i>and have lost all contact with the Apache.</i>

487
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,816
<i>Even the scout, Samuel Potts, admits this,</i>
<i>and I</i>'<i>m glad.</i>

488
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,252
<i>I wish to avenge the massacre,</i>
<i>but I remember it too well, and I</i>'<i>m afraid.</i>

489
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,329
<i>How can we catch the wind</i>
<i>or destroy an enemy we never see?</i>

490
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,170
<i>It is Christmas Eve,</i>
<i>the year of our Lord, 1864...</i>

491
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,851
<i>and there is a deep and reverent sense of</i>
<i>peace and tranquillity in the camp tonight.</i>

492
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,535
<i>Mr. Potts and Riago, the Apache...</i>

493
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,293
<i>indulge in a high-spirited,</i>
<i>brotherly bout of wrestling.</i>

494
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,292
<i>At stake is Mr. Potts</i>' <i>gold railroad watch...</i>

495
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,656
<i>and the Apache</i>'<i>s shotgun</i>
<i>with the silver inlaid stock.</i>

496
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,651
<i>It is a friendly contest.</i>

497
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,332
Come on, Injun, get up.

498
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,809
There he is over there, go get him!

499
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,370
- That one brought him.
- Get up!

500
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,732
I think he's going to take you, Samuel.
You know why?

501
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,814
Because the artillery's betting on you.

502
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,778
Do you know Lt. Graham's bet $5 on you?

503
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,734
Artillery and a lieutenant, to boot.

504
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,295
Did you ever hear of an artilleryman
winning a bet, or a girl...

505
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,019
or a war when there was cavalry about?

506
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,452
- Who bet against me?
- Me.

507
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,015
- Just one, Major. He wants to talk.
- Bring him in.

508
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,659
He says he's a good Apache,
and he's peaceful...

509
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,935
and for nobody to shoot at him.

510
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,056
- Is he a Chiricahua?
- He surely is.

511
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,893
Why would an old man like that
be raiding with Charriba?

512
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,372
He says, why not? It's their land, all of it.

513
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,933
Now he'd like a little soft food
as his teeth are no longer with us.

514
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,339
Why did he quit?

515
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,418
Charriba kicked him out.

516
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,530
He says he's too old,
much too old to fight anymore.

517
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,049
Ask him why I should believe him.

518
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,009
Well?

519
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,057
He says Charriba's camp is across the river.

520
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,539
He'll lead us there. They'll be asleep.

521
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,329
Does he expect me to believe that?

522
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,690
Let him lead us into an ambush?

523
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,249
He says his heart is true, Major...

524
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,098
and he brings proof.

525
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,250
What kind of proof, Mr. Potts?

526
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,459
The children.

527
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,456
He's brought the children.

528
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,773
Pretty good.

529
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,133
Go on, sing up.

530
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,694
Soup's on.

531
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,138
Here's one for you, shorty.

532
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,575
Come on, buck, get around here
where you can eat.

533
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,651
- Can I have seconds?
- Get in here.

534
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,614
- Don't we get any?
- Watch out, don't spill it.

535
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,976
Don't look to me like them gut-eaters
has been feeding them very good.

536
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,858
- Did you ever see a fat Apache?
- I ain't yet.

537
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,773
This is good.

538
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,214
You're going back now that you've got
what you came for, Major?

539
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,137
Everything points to that old man
talking straight.

540
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,171
Potts is half convinced.

541
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,252
I'm more than half.

542
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,652
Did it ever occur to you
that Charriba gave us what we wanted...

543
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,413
because he intends to take it back again?

544
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,532
It's occurred to me.

545
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,293
I want two of your best men
to help Sgt. Gomez take the children home.

546
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,410
We'll still outnumber you, Amos.

547
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,290
You surely will, Ben.
Now go do as you're told.

548
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,214
Yes, sir.

549
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,255
But only until the Apache is taken
or destroyed.

550
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:41,740
<i>Sgt. Gomez headed back to safety</i>
<i>with the three Rostes boys...</i>

551
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,619
<i>Sgt. Gomez headed back to safety</i>
<i>with the three Rostes boys...</i>

552
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,692
<i>while we followed the old Apache</i>
<i>toward Sierra Charriba.</i>

553
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,537
Lieutenant,
take 12 men across as skirmishers.

554
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,618
First 12 men, follow me.

555
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,492
- Sergeant Chillum, take them through.
- Yes, sir.

556
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,174
Get them back to the far side of the river!

557
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,258
Back to the river!

558
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,813
- Try and regroup on the far bank!
- Hadley, run them out!

559
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:40,252
Keep moving, Lieutenant Graham,
there's nobody left to shoot at out here.

560
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,017
Merry Christmas.

561
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,251
He was making a doll for his girl child.
Riago!

562
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,057
How did they know?

563
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,213
They're Apache.

564
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,016
Just what in hell is he?

565
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,772
I'm a tame Apache.

566
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,019
A camp dog.

567
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,532
Christian Indian.

568
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,092
Charriba is Apache.

569
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,099
Sam, you take this camp dog
and go find me Charriba.

570
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,529
That's what you pay us for, Amos.

571
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,018
- Wiley, did you get hit?
- No, sir.

572
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,694
One of them damn mules kicked me.

573
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,214
Fourteen men killed, sir. Thirteen wounded.

574
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,813
Four critically.

575
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,533
70% of all stores lost, 20% ammunition...

576
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,654
and 60% of livestock either killed or stolen.

577
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,459
- Damn it to bloody Confederate hell!
- What?

578
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,136
- Sorry.
- He's all right, Doctor.

579
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,256
He'll live forever
and have a hundred children.

580
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,854
But if time and battle prove
that you have a weakness...

581
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,979
for being shot in that vicinity,
I'd wear an iron board inside my pants.

582
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,935
You tell him go easy with that, Major,
or I'll shoot you right between the eyes.

583
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,099
You patrolled this whole area with Grant
in '47, didn't you?

584
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,970
Yes. The tequila was excellent.

585
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,208
How far would you say we are
from the nearest food and shelter?

586
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,575
About a week's march. Maybe less.

587
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,339
There's a pretty village, and rather friendly.

588
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,298
If you're really serious
about replenishing our supplies...

589
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:19,612
there's a well-stocked garrison
I could recommend just about here.

590
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,855
But we'd probably have to tangle
with some French Lancers.

591
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,415
That's one thing I plan to avoid.

592
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,014
Major, we can't follow the Apache.

593
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,656
I'm not letting go of that Injun.

594
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,536
- Boy!
- Sir!

595
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,690
Pass the word to the command
we move out in the morning.

596
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,658
And bring me a bottle
of that medicinal brandy.

597
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,973
There is no more brandy, sir,
except at the bottom of the river.

598
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,454
Now this time, Lieutenant, try and hold still.

599
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,490
Prepare to move out in the morning.

600
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,580
We left a lot at the bottom of the river.

601
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,132
We ask thee, Lord, to take these soldiers
who have fallen in thy service.

602
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,369
Amen.

603
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,898
We got whipped, Major.

604
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,612
Burying your dead is not going to change it.

605
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,129
<i>January 9, 1865.</i>

606
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,338
<i>Sgt. Gomez and the troopers returned today.</i>

607
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,690
<i>The Rostes boys are well and safe.</i>

608
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,248
<i>This made us feel better, but not for long.</i>

609
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,011
He's not running anymore.

610
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,259
He's waiting.

611
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,970
Let's move. Mount up!

612
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,338
<i>January 10.</i>

613
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,376
<i>Two more died last night.</i>

614
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,050
<i>I</i>'<i>m afraid all the wounded will perish</i>
<i>unless we rest.</i>

615
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,058
<i>I wonder whether any of us will ever return.</i>

616
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,890
<i>The war of rebellion and Fort Benlin</i>
<i>seem very far away.</i>

617
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,212
The village is occupied.

618
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,655
The blockhouse, there are 10, 15 men.

619
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,376
Regulars, I think. I don't know.

620
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,929
Their garrison is about six hours away...

621
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,176
and about 300 Lancers,
Legionnaires, or maybe less.

622
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,409
We'll move on the village at sunup.

623
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:25,569
Dismount! Prepare to fight on foot!

624
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,934
- Horses to the rear.
- Get those horses!

625
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,057
- Point blank range.
- Fuse timing zero.

626
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,134
Unload.

627
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,415
Locked, loaded and primed,
and ready for firing.

628
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,252
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.

629
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,137
Boy, whistle me a tune.

630
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,858
Will you show the colours, sir?

631
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,773
No, Lieutenant,
we will not show the colours.

632
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,292
All right, Sam, make it short
and to the point.

633
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,410
Hey, get out here!

634
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,374
Compliments, Major Amos Dundee,
irregular United States Cavalry.

635
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,133
You have five minutes to surrender
your arms and stores...

636
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,371
- or he's going to cut loose.
- He would not dare.

637
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,612
This is an act of aggression
against a friendly power...

638
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,533
- an outrageous breach of international law.
- Sonny...

639
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,536
the Major ain't no lawyer.

640
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,450
You've now got four minutes.

641
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,500
Sergeant, I want to talk to the mayor.

642
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,136
- There seems to be no end to it.
- What did you say?

643
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,691
We've been attacked by Apaches,
by local bandits...

644
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,535
by freebooters from Texas,
then liberated by the French...

645
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,055
and now United States Cavalry.

646
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,969
Unfortunately, you came too late.
We have nothing to give you.

647
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:28,575
No food, no guns, no women.

648
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,536
That is what you want, isn't it?

649
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:38,579
That's why you come here
without flying your country's brave flag.

650
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:43,329
Are you speaking for these people?
You're not Mexican, are you?

651
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,695
My husband was the doctor of this village.

652
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,772
But he was also the doctor for the Juaristas.

653
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:51,932
He died there, where they did.

654
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,658
I've paid for my place here.

655
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,459
Well, I'm sorry for that, ma'am,
but we've come a long way.

656
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,532
I need fresh horses and food.
My men are hungry.

657
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,380
They are no more hungry than this village.

658
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,490
They are willing to share everything
they have got with you, Major...

659
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,690
most particularly their hunger.

660
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,533
Would you like to see the children
in our dispensary...

661
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,571
whose sickness is starvation?

662
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,491
- Lieutenant Graham, fire!
- Sir!

663
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,210
Sgt. Gomez, slaughter two mules,
distribute the meat...

664
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,088
and whatever stores you find in that
blockhouse to the people of the village...

665
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,570
- and to this lady.
- Teresa. Teresa Maria Santiago.

666
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,817
- Ma'am. Ryan!
- Yes, sir.

667
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,259
Lieutenant!

668
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,819
With beauty such as yours,
this village is rich beyond comparison.

669
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,738
Lieutenant Tyreen!

670
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,971
God save the Queen.

671
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:37,420
<i>We entered the village</i>
<i>to take food and horses...</i>

672
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,218
<i>We entered the village</i>
<i>to take food and horses...</i>

673
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,372
<i>but instead gave away our own,</i>
<i>and everyone was thankful.</i>

674
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,970
<i>Our wounds were tended</i>
<i>by a German lady...</i>

675
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,097
<i>who spoke English and was pretty,</i>
<i>if somewhat old.</i>

676
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,535
- Hold it there, will you?
- Thank you, ma'am.

677
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,375
<i>Also, a very lovely Mexican girl</i>
<i>who was kindness itself, gentle and young.</i>

678
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,254
Don't worry, son, it ain't near your heart.

679
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,215
To the victors belong the spoils.

680
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,540
Well, Ben, you look quite the gentleman.

681
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,097
After the war, Amos...

682
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:55,093
the Tyreens of County Clair become
the landed gentry of Virginia.

683
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,892
It's not over yet.

684
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:04,016
By midnight tonight I want every man in this
command drunker than a fiddler's bitch.

685
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:08,369
At that point, our prisoners will escape
and run for help.

686
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,653
But we will not discover this until sunup.

687
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,294
Tomorrow night, after following us all day...

688
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:18,771
that French cavalry will camp and prepare
to attack our disorganised rabble.

689
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,211
But before they make their move,
we will steal them blind and be on our way.

690
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,572
You are either...

691
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:31,132
a $70, red-wool, pure-quill military genius...

692
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,531
or the biggest damn fool
in Northern Mexico.

693
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,452
No question of it.

694
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,216
You haven't got the temperament
to be a liberator, Amos.

695
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,569
I don't?
