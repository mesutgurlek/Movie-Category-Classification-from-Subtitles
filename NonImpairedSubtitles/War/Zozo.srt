1
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:09,122
Mom?

2
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:13,280
Mom? Look what I made.

3
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:18,202
- That's nice.
- Look, please.

4
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:21,081
Not now. Wait a minute.

5
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:38,366
Mom,
when are we going to Sweden?

6
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,836
What's wrong with you?
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!"

7
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:44,198
Cut it out, we're watching the news.

8
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:23,801
- What's the matter?
- Look what I made.

9
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:28,278
- It's very nice. Did you carve it?
- Yes.

10
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:36,805
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

11
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:41,881
- Tell me, Zozo.
- It's nothing.

12
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:53,366
- Do you ever dream, Mom?
- Yes. Have you been dreaming?

13
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:59,765
Did you dream a lot
when you were a child?

14
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:08,722
Tell me
what you've been dreaming?

15
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:13,835
You're not going to leave me,
are you?

16
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:19,919
Darling, what makes you think that?
How can you think I'd leave you?

17
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:27,800
I'd leave the whole world
before I left you, sweetie.

18
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:36,716
Don't ever think like that again.

19
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:42,405
- Have you finished your homework?
- No, not yet.

20
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:51,080
Come here! Give me a kiss.

21
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,402
I'll tell you something.
Look at this ruler.

22
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:21,006
If it's one mm shorter than 15cm,
you'll never see the money.

23
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:25,758
- Well?
- Wait, I'm thinking of a beautiful girl.

24
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:28,202
- Imagine Amil's sister.
- What?!

25
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,166
I'm kidding.
But... your sister is amazing.

26
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,807
As amazing as your head.
Shut up, will you!

27
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:40,560
My God! My granddad doesn't even
have a thing like that!

28
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:45,084
- It must be fake.
- Hurry up if you want to measure it.

29
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:50,680
Amil! Riad! I've been
looking for you everywhere.

30
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:54,282
- Where's my money?
- Shut up. Never mind him.

31
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,285
Come on, let's go!

32
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:15,881
- His sister is pretty, isn't she?
- Yeah, but don't exaggerate.

33
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:20,040
I'm not. It's not like
I'm gonna do something to her.

34
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,926
Forget her. Just forget her!

35
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:29,435
Guys... Who wants bread?
But it's not my turn.

36
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:33,600
- I went last time.
- No, I did, then him and now you.

37
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:38,522
On one condition...
I get to meet your sister.

38
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:43,124
- Stop talking about my sister!
- I just want to say hello to her.

39
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:47,485
- OK, but that's the last time.
- Think about the bread instead.

40
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:52,198
Shit, he's really horny.

41
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:56,879
- Three breads, please.
- Certainly.

42
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:00,836
OK. One, two, go!

43
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:06,205
- My money!
- Hold the bread.

44
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:09,962
You brats, you bastards!

45
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:12,402
Where did he go? Did you see him?

46
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:16,157
- Son, I have no idea.
- Bastards!

47
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:22,917
Charbel, my son. Warde, my daughter-
in-law. I hope you're all well.

48
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:27,200
And most importantly, Zozo?
Zozo, my love. You're well, I hope.

49
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:32,839
Hurry up with the paperwork
so you can come to Sweden soon.

50
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,646
We're waiting, grandma and I.

51
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:40,323
I'll teach you some Swedish-

52
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:44,082
- so you're prepared
when you arrive. I'll start now.

53
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,920
"What's your name"
is "what's your name".

54
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,159
"How you are" means "how are you".

55
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:54,878
"Where comes from school" means
"when did you come from school".

56
00:09:55,047 --> 00:10:01,282
"Table dining" means "dining table".
"Curtanny" means "curtains".

57
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:07,238
"Flowers" means "flower".
They like flowers a lot over here.

58
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,877
"Go play soccer, Zozo"
means "Go and play soccer, Zozo".

59
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,800
I know you love soccer, Zozo.

60
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,800
Please hurry and come over
so that we can meet soon.

61
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:21,163
Take care now, my dear Zozo.

62
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:24,239
"Bye" means "bye".

63
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:26,318
"Bye."

64
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:30,599
- How's the paperwork going?
- The passports are ready...

65
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:35,363
...and the tickets
are coming any day now.

66
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:38,245
- Flowers...
- What's that?

67
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:42,718
- Grandpa just said it.
- It means "flower".

68
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:48,040
"Flower"? Does that mean
that my name is Flowers in Swedish?

69
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:52,166
Lmagine me introducing you: "I'm
Charbel and this is my wife Flowers."

70
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:56,556
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

71
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:59,276
- Have a bite.
- No, I'm going downstairs.

72
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:02,883
- Where to? Eat first.
- I'm studying with a girlfriend.

73
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:06,642
You're too thin.
Eat first and study later.

74
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:10,083
You're the one
who's always telling me to study.

75
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:14,604
- Okay. Give my love to her Mom.
- I will.

76
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,406
Take care now, my son.

77
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:22,315
"Give my love to her Mom"? You did
anything to catch a glimpse of me.

78
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:27,163
I did? You were always
showing off behind the curtains.

79
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:32,765
- We didn't have any curtains.
- I meant "curtanny", like Grandpa said.

80
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:36,806
Okay, but we did have a rug
that I used to beat on the balcony.

81
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:52,399
They won't even let you eat in peace...

82
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,126
Dani, get downstairs!

83
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:14,285
Hurry, hurry! Give me the passports.

84
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,564
Hurry up!
Wait for me downstairs by the door.

85
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:23,999
There are so many
destroyed buildings in Lebanon.

86
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:28,399
It's not like that in Sweden.
They've only got nice houses there.

87
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:32,116
- How do you know?
- My grandmother sends me pictures.

88
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,805
- The sea, trees... It's like paradise.
- What are the girls like there?

89
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:43,365
- Tall and blonde. You'd like them.
- Send me one then, will you?

90
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:47,236
- Stop talking about girls.
- I'm not talking to you.

91
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,320
You're wet behind the ears
and you want to talk about girls!

92
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,999
- It's not your business.
- Who wants to date you?

93
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:30,635
Just a thought: We're going to Sweden
soon. Will you come with us?

94
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:35,721
- Where's Sweden? Never heard of it.
- It's a nice country far away.

95
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:40,085
- There's no war there.
- Are there countries without war?

96
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,317
- There's no war there.
- How'd you know?

97
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:44,847
I know because grandma's
sent me pictures.

98
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:49,557
- Here, have a look.
- Let me see. It looks nice.

99
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:54,642
Yeah, it's really nice. If we go there
we can have fun all the time.

100
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:56,445
- What?
- We'll have fun.

101
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,246
But how can I go with you?
I don't have a passport.

102
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:04,159
- I'll hide you, but my dad musn't see.
- What if your dad sees me?

103
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:07,757
Don't worry, I'll arrange something.

104
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:18,683
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

105
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,840
- Yes, you're talking to someone.
- No, I'm not.

106
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:36,678
Are you talking to a chicken?
Have you lost your mind?

107
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,440
No, I'm bringing him to Sweden.

108
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:45,636
Sure, just get him a passport,
a visa and a ticket too.

109
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:51,685
- No, seriously.
- Seriously, come up and eat instead.

110
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:45,196
- Guess where we're going today.
- To Sweden? Is it true?!

111
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:10,041
- I'm going to Sweden today!
- You're so lucky.

112
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,084
I'm going to miss you!

113
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,762
- I'll miss you too.
- Say hello to Riad, I won't have time.

114
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:19,522
- Tell him to leave your sis alone.
- He messes with her, I'll kick his ass.

115
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:27,440
- Before you go: Don't forget to write.
- I'll do my best.

116
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:31,725
- Just send anything.
- I will. Bye.

117
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,684
- Maybe I'll come after you.
- Please try.

118
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:39,877
- Where's your passport?
- I gave it to you.

119
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:43,005
- I can't find it.
- What do you mean you can't find it?

120
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:47,359
- Mom, where's my pink skirt?
- Forget about it.

121
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:52,362
- But I want to bring it with me.
- Bring something else. Just hurry up.

122
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:58,285
- You put it in the kitchen?
- In the kitchen?

123
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:04,158
Are you going to make soup of it?
Darling, I can't find your passport.

124
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:08,718
What do you mean?
I put it here with yours...

125
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,155
Here it is.

126
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:30,203
- Yes, Dad?
- Hurry home now. Hurry!

127
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:36,840
- I have to talk to my girlfriend.
- Forget about her. We're leaving!

128
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,959
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

129
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:44,324
Go and buy some water. Hurry!

130
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:49,117
- You said I was going with you.
- Yes, but on the next flight.

131
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:52,364
Why?
I thought we were going together.

132
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,281
- The plane was full.
- Why didn't you tell me?

133
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:59,484
I just found out.
I'll send you a ticket tomorrow.

134
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:03,116
- How will you send it?
- I'll arrange it.

135
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,402
- Have you been lying?
- No I'm not lying.

136
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,922
You said we'd get married
and have children.

137
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:11,166
- Yes, and we will.
- Why've you been lying!

138
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:14,126
You are my sweetheart,
I'd never lie to you.

139
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,435
- Mom!
- Don't look at them.

140
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,923
- Look at me!
- Mom!

141
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:33,724
- What are you doing?
- Climb inside. Hurry!

142
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:38,045
- Take these.
- Dani, come with me!

143
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:43,759
Listen! I can't, but don't be afraid.
I promise I'll come back for you.

144
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,644
The soldiers will be here
any second. Keep quiet!

145
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:51,799
- Get up now.
- Is that you, Mom?

146
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:54,481
Come here, Zozo.

147
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:08,805
- Where am I?
- You're with me.

148
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:23,203
- Where are you?
- Here.

149
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:46,956
- What is this?
- Don't be afraid.

150
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:31,324
Zozo? Come on, wake up now.

151
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,404
I don't think your brother will return.

152
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,447
I know it's hard,
but you must be strong.

153
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:49,041
Maybe he'll show up at the airport?

154
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,239
Come on, let's go to Sweden.

155
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:11,283
- Hello.
- Hello, what would you like?

156
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,756
One bread, please.

157
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:20,287
- Here. That'll be five lira.
- But I have no money.

158
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:26,203
No money? Do you think this
is charity? Give it back and go away!

159
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:30,724
- What's this supposed to mean?
- Why not give it to him, you bastard?

160
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:35,244
- Can't you see he's hungry?
- Aren't you the landlord's daughter?

161
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:39,320
- How are you? How's your dad?
- Fine. Why didn't you give it to him?

162
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:44,401
- I tried to, but he refused it.
- Don't lie. I heard you.

163
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:51,165
- Here you are. Enjoy.
- Here's some money to keep you happy.

164
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:54,603
- Would you like something else?
- It's on me.

165
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,247
- No, don't bother.
- Get off my back then.

166
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:03,126
We might as well close
if everyone gets to eat for free.

167
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,876
You look like you're starving.

168
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,998
Thanks for this.

169
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:38,523
Is that your chicken? It's cute.
What's its name?

170
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:41,917
- I don't know.
- Why are you so sad?

171
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:47,242
- Do you know the way to the airport?
- Why do you want to go there?

172
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:53,123
- I'm going to Sweden.
- To Sweden? By yourself?

173
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:57,564
- Yes.
- Where are your parents?

174
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:00,836
They're dead.

175
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:14,600
If you want to get to the airport
it's near my house. I'll take you.

176
00:32:18,007 --> 00:32:22,319
- What's your name?
- Zozo.

177
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,399
My name is Rita.

178
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:34,166
- Is the airport far away?
- No, we're pretty close.

179
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:38,445
But it's getting dark. I don't think
any planes fly this late.

180
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:59,722
- Are we by the airport?
- I want to show you something first.

181
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,923
- What's that?
- Cartridges.

182
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:24,805
- It's beautiful here, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

183
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:31,566
Dad takes me here when they go bird
hunting. I'll show you how they do it.

184
00:33:31,647 --> 00:33:38,678
They hide behind a tree,
load their guns and take aim...

185
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:42,237
And then, if they see a bird...

186
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:52,677
Come here, quickly!

187
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:57,679
I'll count to three,
and then we start shooting birds.

188
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,725
One, two... come on!

189
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,879
Quiet...

190
00:34:57,607 --> 00:35:02,920
Hurry up. In here!
Just hurry up and be careful.

191
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:09,320
Stay there and be as quiet as you can.

192
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:21,642
Where have you been?

193
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:26,517
You stupid little girl?
Don't you know what time it is?

194
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:29,724
Go straight to bed now!

195
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:35,564
Next time you're home this late
I'll kill you, you little brat!

196
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:49,039
You can come out now.

197
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:57,679
Can I sit down?

198
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:05,202
- Did he hit you?
- No.

199
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:09,246
- But you're all red.
- He's always that angry.

200
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:12,319
It's okay. I'll get a mattress for you.

201
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:16,275
Don't worry about it.
I can sleep on the floor.

202
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:55,524
- Zozo, are you asleep?
- No.

203
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,960
Can I hold your hand?

204
00:38:11,727 --> 00:38:14,560
One, two... come on!

205
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:19,001
Come on, shoot.

206
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,877
How are you feeling?

207
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:46,644
- Fine, but I feel something strange.
- Me too. What is it?

208
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:49,116
I don't know.

209
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:52,886
Do you?

210
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:22,280
- What are you doing?
- Going with you to Sweden.

211
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:27,642
- Really?
- Hurry up so we don't miss the plane.

212
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:30,996
Hurry!

213
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,317
- Wait.
- What is it?

214
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:42,205
I have to talk to my sister.

215
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:49,123
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to miss you very much.

216
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,359
I'm going to the airport
with my boyfriend.

217
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:54,523
- Where?
- The airport.

218
00:39:54,687 --> 00:40:00,159
To the airport? With him?
Kids today... Get upstairs now.

219
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:03,524
No, we'll miss the plane.
Don't tell dad.

220
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:06,519
- What? Get upstairs now.
- Don't tell him.

221
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:08,359
Get in here or he's going to kill you!

222
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:11,525
- I can't. Bye.
- Rita, come back!

223
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:31,966
- Hurry up, we'll miss the plane!
- Wait, I'll be right there.

224
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:37,155
- Are you sure you don't want to come?
- Yes, don't worry.

225
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:42,401
Why should I go there? It's too cold.
At least it's warm here.

226
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:45,285
I'm a chicken, I need warmth.

227
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:49,639
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

228
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:55,438
- But that's life. What can you do?
- What will you do? Where will you go?

229
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:58,525
I'll be alright.
I'll just hang out with my buddies.

230
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:03,636
We'll have fun, chill, catch some rays,
drink some beer. I'll be alright.

231
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:16,006
Alright, you take care.

232
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:28,601
Turn the engine off and open
the window. Where are you going?

233
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:32,680
- To the airport.
- You too? Where are you going?

234
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:37,198
- To Sweden.
- Bullshit. Both of you, out of the car!

235
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:42,407
To Sweden? You serious?
Do you have the necessary papers?

236
00:42:42,487 --> 00:42:46,799
Get them. Little kids
going to Sweden... What a joke!

237
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:52,120
Let me have them
and wait here with her.

238
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,079
- But I don't have a passport.
- Maybe my sister's will do?

239
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,158
What if they find out?

240
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:09,161
- Come, quick.
- What is it?

241
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,959
- What is it?
- It's my dad.

242
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:19,645
How did he get here?
What do we do now?

243
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:29,999
Have you seen a little girl?
She's about this tall.

244
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:33,881
- Yes, we just stopped a girl and a boy.
- Where are they now?

245
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:38,085
Wait, I'll have a look.
- Guys! Where are the kids?

246
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:41,045
- They were just here.
- So where are they?

247
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:44,997
Zozo, I like you so much.
But... I have to go now.

248
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,646
What!

249
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:58,005
Come here, you little brat!

250
00:43:58,207 --> 00:44:01,882
Where have you been? I'll teach you
not to run away like that!

251
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,322
What have you been doing? Tell me!

252
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:13,844
- Leave her alone!
- You little bastard! Who are you?

253
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:19,520
Do you think
you can take my little girl?!

254
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:24,960
Let go of me! I'm going to kill him!

255
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:31,367
Rita, come with me. Rita!

256
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:50,956
- What's your name?
- Zozo.

257
00:44:51,247 --> 00:44:54,603
What was going on out there, Zozo?

258
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:59,598
- I don't know.
- What do you mean "I don't know"?

259
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:02,042
And the man who was shouting?

260
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:07,163
- I don't know.
- Are you here all alone?

261
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,998
Yes.

262
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:18,595
All these identification documents
and tickets... who do they belong to?

263
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:22,846
- My family.
- Where is your family?

264
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,758
Dead.

265
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:45,486
- Are all of them dead?
- Yes.

266
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:56,119
- Can you help me get to Sweden?
- Who do you know in Sweden?

267
00:45:58,167 --> 00:46:01,955
My grandfather and grandmother.

268
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:17,086
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

269
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:27,558
Hello, this is Tony.
Can I ask you a favour?

270
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:46,637
Grandpa! Grandma!

271
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:51,239
Sweetheart! Welcome.
I'm so glad you're safe!

272
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:54,842
I've missed you, Zozo!

273
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:07,445
It's so good to hug you. You're
the most precious thing in our lives.

274
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:24,040
- What shall we do with Zozo?
- What do you mean, my love?

275
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:30,646
- Should we talk about his family?
- Does it matter if we talk or not?

276
00:51:30,727 --> 00:51:35,847
What's happened has happened.
He's a child. Why remind ourselves?

277
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:41,206
Let him live like other kids,
in peace and quiet.

278
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:45,519
You're right.
I won't dress in black then.

279
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:49,566
No, it's best you don't.
It was God's will. What can we do?

280
00:51:50,047 --> 00:51:56,156
- Talk quieter so he won't hear us.
- Okay.

281
00:51:56,407 --> 00:51:59,797
Go back to sleep now, my darling.

282
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:46,603
Let's go to the lake.
It's a very nice lake.

283
00:52:50,207 --> 00:52:55,440
Come on now, Zozo!
Well done. Well done, my boy!

284
00:52:55,527 --> 00:53:00,920
Well done! Attaboy, Zozo!
You're granddad's little hero!

285
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:12,402
- Let's break it so it's easier to chew.
- Can I share it with you?

286
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:20,556
Add a little bit of salt
and we'll have a really tasty apple.

287
00:53:26,207 --> 00:53:31,839
- You can remove your teeth?
- It helps me taste better.

288
00:53:31,927 --> 00:53:34,885
I can remove them
and put them wherever I want.

289
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:40,041
- Doesn't it hurt?
- No, nothing hurts your granddad.

290
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:43,517
- I'm as tough as nails.
- Where are your real teeth?

291
00:53:43,607 --> 00:53:48,727
Do you want to hear that story?
It's a long and winding one.

292
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:52,197
- Which tooth do I begin with?
- They each have a story?

293
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:56,445
- Yes, they all have a story. Pick one.
- That one.

294
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:59,923
Did you have to pick that one?

295
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:05,764
Your granddad got into some rough
fights when he was young.

296
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:12,320
I'd smash people to pieces. I would
crush anything that got in my way.

297
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:16,719
This tooth... Your grandmother and I
were going to the cinema -

298
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:24,487
- when some bastard came and bumped
her on the shoulder. Right here.

299
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:31,200
I have a brain, by God, but that
bastard made me shut it down.

300
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:36,765
- So you attacked?
- Yes, I did. Bravo, Zozo!

301
00:54:36,847 --> 00:54:40,806
I closed in on him:
"You son of a whore! You fuck!"

302
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:44,926
I used my left fist
and went... bam! Right in the face.

303
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:47,805
Then my left fist... bam!
Crushing his nose...

304
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:55,845
- Shall I take that one?
- Yes, just go ahead and take it.

305
00:54:56,167 --> 00:55:00,843
- Shit, you're heavier than me now!
- What the hell are you doing?!

306
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:12,600
- He scared me.
- What a monster.

307
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:19,638
- I have a few in my pocket.
- What a cheap bastard. Bloody idiot!

308
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:30,801
Take it easy.

309
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:36,964
Look how he's eating! The shame! It
looks like he hasn't eaten in a month.

310
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:42,686
For God's sake, leave me alone.

311
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:45,759
I've eaten like this for 30 years
and now it's a problem?

312
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:50,557
Leave me alone. Go find someone else
if I'm not good enough anymore.

313
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:54,322
That man Lambare,
he likes talking to me.

314
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:58,241
My darling. Lambare, I don't care
about Lambare or his father Ambare.

315
00:55:58,407 --> 00:56:01,080
At least he doesn't have a gut
and even has hair on his head.

316
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:05,285
This is true.
No gut and hair on his head.

317
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:10,839
But one leg is wooden, the other one
plastic. You can have him.

318
00:56:11,607 --> 00:56:18,843
What are you waiting for? Tell her
how the girls hound us on the street.

319
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:24,081
- How they keep fondling us.
- Congratulations.

320
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:28,524
I hope you live a thousand years.
Believe me, you are my everything.

321
00:56:28,607 --> 00:56:31,599
I hope God doesn't
take you away from me.

322
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:35,475
- You know I'm kidding too.
- We have to lighten things up for Zozo.

323
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:41,164
He's the apple of his grandfather's
eye. We just want to make you laugh.

324
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:26,085
Really? Well,
I think we have something here...

325
00:57:27,607 --> 00:57:32,601
- Yes, a shoe.
- Shoes? Shoes...

326
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:35,362
Can I haggle over the price?

327
00:57:35,927 --> 00:57:42,526
- Haggle? Like sheep's guts?
- Haggle. Shoes.

328
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:46,964
- Your Swedish is coming along so well.
- I'm learning.

329
00:57:47,127 --> 00:57:50,358
Bravo.
Tell me what words you've learnt.

330
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:56,204
Shoes, haggle, orange, apple, car...

331
00:57:56,367 --> 00:58:02,636
You speak better Swedish than your
granny. You're smart, like grandpa.

332
00:58:02,727 --> 00:58:06,197
You speak better Swedish than me?

333
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:09,723
I speak better Swedish than the
Swedes. What are you talking about?

334
00:58:09,847 --> 00:58:11,724
- Go ahead, then.
- I'll go ahead alright.

335
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:17,007
Where are ayou from?
I can aspeak a lot of Sweden.

336
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:21,565
I can adance, I can asing,
I can aplay the sexyphone.

337
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:32,319
I... can speak... a little Swedish.

338
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:35,720
I can speak a little Swedish.

339
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,242
Orange...

340
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:45,121
Orange, apple...

341
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:50,797
...car, haggle, shoes...

342
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:54,880
...bear... I'm leaving.

343
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:59,159
You're leaving.
I am dumb.

344
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:04,720
Hi, my name is Zozo
and I'm eleven years old.

345
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:10,006
I can speak a little Swedish
and Arabic.

346
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:12,521
I live with my grandmother
and grandfather.

347
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:18,160
I'm from Lebanon
and I like to play soccer.

348
00:59:18,327 --> 00:59:21,683
And I also like apples with salt.

349
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:24,797
- Salt?
- Yes, it's nice.

350
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:28,403
It's a little...

351
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:34,080
- Sour?
- Sour.

352
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:40,846
- I like pears with salt. Don't you?
- Yeah. I need to try bananas with salt.

353
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,920
- How about bananas with pepper?
- Be quiet.

354
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:50,358
Zozo? You can sit over there.

355
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:01,161
- Hey.
- Hi.

356
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:05,126
My name's Kalle.
Don't call me Karl, it's a stupid name.

357
01:00:05,207 --> 01:00:07,675
- Hi, Karl.
- No, Kalle.

358
01:00:07,847 --> 01:00:11,044
- Your name is Karl.
- No, it's Kalle. One more thing.

359
01:00:11,327 --> 01:00:15,445
- I hate girls too.
- No, you don't.

360
01:00:15,527 --> 01:00:21,966
- You asked Jenny to go steady.
- No, she asked me.

361
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:25,723
- Be quiet!
- It's them. They're teasing me.

362
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:29,163
They're saying I go steady
with Jenny, but I hate her.

363
01:00:32,247 --> 01:00:36,035
Remember you have sports
after the break.

364
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:19,766
Give me the ball.

365
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:24,479
Give it here. Give me the ball, dammit.

366
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:49,686
Hi.

367
01:01:55,647 --> 01:02:02,200
- What a big book.
- I've read bigger.

368
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,405
How can you read everything...
so much?

369
01:02:09,327 --> 01:02:11,636
It's not that hard.

370
01:02:11,807 --> 01:02:14,002
I can't do it.

371
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:18,603
I read too. I read Bamse.

372
01:02:18,687 --> 01:02:21,963
With Bamse and Little Skutt.

373
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:25,807
That's not a book, that's a comic.

374
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:30,684
I know. I read it. It's good.

375
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:40,200
- Do you want to play soccer?
- I don't know. I'm not very good.

376
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:43,915
We can play anyway.

377
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:54,244
- I've got to go.
- Okay. I'll see you.

378
01:02:55,327 --> 01:03:00,321
- Hey there. Who are you?
- My name is Zozo.

379
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:04,042
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Lebanon.

380
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:07,437
Lebanon? Where's that?

381
01:03:07,527 --> 01:03:10,360
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

382
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:13,883
- Do you play soccer?
- Yes, I'm good at soccer.

383
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:16,920
Sorry.

384
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:21,320
- That was good?
- Not especially.

385
01:03:22,047 --> 01:03:25,801
- Why did he leave?
- It doesn't matter.

386
01:03:25,887 --> 01:03:29,800
- Why does it matter if he leaves?
- I don't understand.

387
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:34,006
What do you mean? We're the ones
who make the rules here.

388
01:03:34,087 --> 01:03:37,762
- Why?
- You have problem with that?

389
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,644
- What?
- Stop it!

390
01:03:39,807 --> 01:03:42,526
Cut it out. Are you stupid?!

391
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,243
Stop!

392
01:03:46,887 --> 01:03:49,526
Stop it, dammit!

393
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:45,163
- Hello, sunshine.
- Hello, gorgeous.

394
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:49,479
What a beauty.
Is that your face or is it the sun?

395
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:52,559
God give me strength.
Are you sewing my shirt?

396
01:04:52,647 --> 01:04:56,799
Zozo fell off his bike
so I'm sewing the button that fell off.

397
01:04:56,887 --> 01:04:59,401
- Zozo!
- Yes, grandpa.

398
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:05,125
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing, I fell off my bike.

399
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:08,563
No, you've been in a fight.

400
01:05:08,647 --> 01:05:13,437
- No, it's true.
- Come on, we're friends. What is it?

401
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:16,405
- It's the truth.
- Zozo?

402
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:22,483
- I was in a fight.
- With who?

403
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:26,526
- These three guys.
- What? Three boys hit you?

404
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:31,238
- Yes, they were older than me.
- Who are these fags?!

405
01:05:32,087 --> 01:05:33,964
Damn hooligans.

406
01:05:52,727 --> 01:05:56,402
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, I can't drink any more.

407
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:59,127
Coffee is...

408
01:06:00,607 --> 01:06:03,804
Do you understand? Good.

409
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:07,482
Hello, Jocke. Have a seat right there.

410
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,877
Is that the boy that hit you?

411
01:06:14,047 --> 01:06:18,199
- Why did you hit my grandson?
- I didn't hit him.

412
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:20,801
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I didn't hit anyone.

413
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:23,044
Hold on!

414
01:06:23,207 --> 01:06:26,358
- Don't you understand?
- Yes, but I didn't hit him.

415
01:06:27,727 --> 01:06:33,120
- You want to wrestle with Zozo?
- Please, this is no way to resolve this.

416
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:35,960
Sit down and be quiet!

417
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:41,116
Don't you understand?
You can't be three boys against one.

418
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:46,725
Get up. - Come up here
and beat the shit out of him.

419
01:06:46,887 --> 01:06:48,687
One, two, three!

420
01:06:48,687 --> 01:06:52,236
- Stop this.
- Get out of here!

421
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:56,559
- You want to wrestle with me? Wait.
- I don't want anyone to fight.

422
01:06:56,967 --> 01:07:01,438
We need to be calm and reasonable.
I don't want to fight!

423
01:07:08,407 --> 01:07:11,001
Hold on. Take it easy.

424
01:07:13,767 --> 01:07:18,682
Bloody stupid headmaster.
He's ruined my day.

425
01:07:18,767 --> 01:07:23,602
What kind of headmaster is he?
How do the students stand him?

426
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:29,876
Zozo, listen to me. Promise me
never to be afraid of anyone.

427
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:36,122
Anyone comes up to you, just hit him.
Rearrange his face.

428
01:07:36,207 --> 01:07:40,485
Don't be afraid, no matter who it is.
Understand?

429
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:43,517
Okay?

430
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:54,996
Hey, hold on!

431
01:07:56,447 --> 01:08:01,680
Let me make myself clear, if you ever
rat on me again you're dead!

432
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:04,919
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

433
01:08:05,007 --> 01:08:08,682
- I won't squeal.
- And don't squeal to your grandpa.

434
01:08:08,807 --> 01:08:13,483
Come to me instead. Be a man.
What's this? Math?

435
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:19,517
He studies math. Don't study math,
study Swedish, fucking foreigner!

436
01:09:04,967 --> 01:09:07,527
Hello.

437
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:13,999
What is your name?

438
01:09:14,927 --> 01:09:17,043
My name is Zozo.

439
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:27,399
Do you speak Arabic?

440
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:11,326
Who are you?

441
01:11:11,407 --> 01:11:14,683
What do you want from me?

442
01:11:21,447 --> 01:11:23,836
Are you God?

443
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:34,241
Can you bring my family back to life?
Can you bring my Mom back to life?

444
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:42,766
This is my Mom.
Can you bring her back to life?

445
01:11:47,927 --> 01:11:51,522
Why won't you answer me?

446
01:11:52,127 --> 01:11:54,482
Answer me!

447
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:59,366
Come on, answer me.

448
01:12:22,007 --> 01:12:25,966
- What's with you? What're you doing?
- Nothing.

449
01:12:27,007 --> 01:12:30,886
What do you mean "nothing"?
Why do you look so sad?

450
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,003
- Been fighting again?
- No.

451
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:37,285
Yes, you have. Look at me.
Who hit you?

452
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:39,756
No one.

453
01:12:39,847 --> 01:12:46,036
What did I tell you?
You don't take crap from anyone.

454
01:12:46,127 --> 01:12:50,405
If anyone messes with you
you just swing at him right away.

455
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,319
Grandpa, I can't.

456
01:12:52,407 --> 01:12:54,967
- Why not?
- I just can't.

457
01:12:55,047 --> 01:12:58,881
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not like you.

458
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:02,198
You should be better and stronger
than me. Don't say that again!

459
01:13:02,367 --> 01:13:05,757
- Then I'll just have to be a coward.
- No, you won't. Come back!

460
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:08,566
- Leave me alone.
- Don't be so hard on him.

461
01:13:08,727 --> 01:13:11,525
Should he get beat up every day?

462
01:13:11,607 --> 01:13:16,965
- Calm down.
- I won't be calm! Come back here.

463
01:14:14,647 --> 01:14:18,276
"Hi, Rita. How are you?"

464
01:14:19,327 --> 01:14:26,642
"I'm writing to you from Sweden to
tell you everything is great here."

465
01:14:26,727 --> 01:14:32,324
"The other day I dreamt we were in
a house, playing and having fun."

466
01:14:32,487 --> 01:14:35,957
"I hope the dream comes true."

467
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:43,523
"I've missed you so much.
Can't you come to Sweden?"

468
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:28,366
- Nice eraser.
- Thanks.

469
01:15:28,447 --> 01:15:32,235
- Where did you get it?
- From the store.

470
01:15:33,767 --> 01:15:37,965
- Do you want it?
- You're giving it to me? Thanks.

471
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:42,245
- Look what Zozo gave me.
- Cool. Can I have one too?

472
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:48,118
I don't have any more.
You can have this. It smells good.

473
01:15:48,887 --> 01:15:49,876
Thanks.

474
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,840
- Can I have a pen too?
- Sure you can.

475
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:57,398
- Then can I have an eraser too?
- An eraser and a pen? Sure.

476
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:59,921
Thanks.

477
01:16:15,007 --> 01:16:19,080
- I want these.
- That'll be six crowns.

478
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:23,286
- And his head goes flying off...
- Hi.

479
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:27,918
- I got you an eraser and a pen.
- That's so nice of you. Thanks.

480
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:31,443
- Were there any other colours?
- Yes... No... What...?

481
01:16:31,607 --> 01:16:35,520
- Were there other colours?
- Where did you get that pen?

482
01:16:35,607 --> 01:16:39,202
- Would you like one? I can get it.
- Can I have one too?

483
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:43,442
Can I have an eraser?

484
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:46,883
- My sister needs an eraser.
- My mom needs one too.

485
01:17:28,647 --> 01:17:34,119
"Hi, Zozo. Grandpa and I are at
the hospital, but don't worry."

486
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:39,122
"Hopefully, we'll be home tonight.
There's food in the fridge."

487
01:17:39,207 --> 01:17:42,005
"Take care."

488
01:17:54,367 --> 01:17:59,646
- What's wrong with you, grandpa?
- Why are you here? School's over?

489
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:04,358
- Yes. What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I fell off my bicycle.

490
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:07,519
I broke both my legs.
Don't worry about it.

491
01:18:07,607 --> 01:18:11,202
- You broke your legs?
- Yes, they got a bit broken.

492
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:18,326
- Why is gran crying?
- That's just how she is.

493
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:24,846
Could you leave so that
I can speak to Zozo alone?

494
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:33,485
I want to tell you something.

495
01:18:34,207 --> 01:18:38,439
- Have you ever seen me cry?
- No.

496
01:18:38,527 --> 01:18:42,759
Have you seen anything
that shows me as being weak?

497
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,800
It is true... my son has died.

498
01:18:46,887 --> 01:18:49,879
I've grieved, but it was his fate.

499
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:55,121
Everyone has to walk that path.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

500
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:57,357
Okay, so my legs are broken.

501
01:18:57,487 --> 01:19:01,366
But if all of me is broken I'll still
make it, with God's help.

502
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:05,560
I fear nothing. I have a heart of iron
and a will of steel.

503
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:09,515
I want you to be like me.

504
01:19:09,607 --> 01:19:12,644
Grandpa, I've tried to be like you,
but I can't.

505
01:19:12,807 --> 01:19:18,120
Maybe next week, next month, it'll
happen. Never fear. Stay strong.

506
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:23,279
Okay. Give me a kiss.

507
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:25,485
May God give you a long life.

508
01:19:40,887 --> 01:19:44,243
Excuse me for being late.

509
01:19:57,887 --> 01:20:00,799
What is this?

510
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:05,284
I don't know.

511
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:12,403
- Everyone in here says it was you.
- What?

512
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:17,516
- You can't take things without paying.
- It wasn't me.

513
01:20:17,727 --> 01:20:20,082
- Admit it, it was you.
- What?

514
01:20:20,247 --> 01:20:23,557
Don't try to pretend, everyone knows.

515
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:49,516
- Zozo!
- Bloody idiots! I hate you all!

516
01:20:52,327 --> 01:20:55,285
I hate you all!

517
01:20:55,527 --> 01:20:58,997
Bloody idiots!

518
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:28,518
- How are you?
- Go away.

519
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:33,082
Just so you know, I didn't tell
the teacher, the others did.

520
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,840
I don't care. Go away.

521
01:21:37,047 --> 01:21:39,766
But...

522
01:21:39,847 --> 01:21:44,125
- I know the feeling.
- You know nothing about me. Go!

523
01:21:46,287 --> 01:21:48,721
Go away!

524
01:22:17,407 --> 01:22:20,205
I live over there.

525
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:36,118
- Isn't that bike hard to ride?
- Yes. It's my grandfather's.

526
01:22:43,687 --> 01:22:47,123
- Aren't these apples too sour?
- No.

527
01:22:47,287 --> 01:22:50,802
- They're good with salt.
- Can you eat apples and salt?

528
01:22:51,487 --> 01:22:54,604
Yes, I eat it with my grandfather.

529
01:22:55,647 --> 01:22:58,957
In Sweden we never
eat apples like that.

530
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:01,004
I know. In Lebanon too.

531
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:03,641
I don't know, I eat it with grandpa.

532
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:08,165
Why does everyone write here?

533
01:23:10,247 --> 01:23:14,479
I don't know, it's graffiti.
You write and draw...

534
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:19,038
I drew one thing here. This one.

535
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:23,678
- What does the Z mean?
- It's a letter.

536
01:23:23,767 --> 01:23:27,203
It's just from the alphabet.

537
01:23:29,967 --> 01:23:32,561
Come on in.

538
01:23:37,087 --> 01:23:39,521
Nice room.

539
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:44,363
- You don't like to clean?
- Sure I do, but this morning...

540
01:23:44,447 --> 01:23:49,885
- It's not a problem.
...I was late and didn't have time.

541
01:23:49,967 --> 01:23:52,720
- Can I sit down?
- Sure.

542
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:57,756
Take these and I'll go get some salt.
Coarse salt or regular?

543
01:23:57,847 --> 01:24:01,760
- Salt.
- Okay.

544
01:24:38,647 --> 01:24:42,959
- You draw very well.
- Thank you.

545
01:24:43,047 --> 01:24:46,164
- It looks real.
- Yeah, kind of.

546
01:24:46,327 --> 01:24:50,878
- Are you good at drawing?
- No, not like you. Just a little.

547
01:24:50,967 --> 01:24:53,401
Everyone can draw a bit.

548
01:24:53,847 --> 01:24:59,558
I had a girlfriend named Rita and she's
good at drawing - rita in Swedish.

549
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,877
Rita can rita.

550
01:25:03,367 --> 01:25:07,758
- Is she nice?
- Yes, nice.

551
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:11,798
- Leo?!
- Yes?

552
01:25:11,887 --> 01:25:15,846
- Have you cleaned your room?
- No, I'm going to.

553
01:25:15,967 --> 01:25:19,846
- Do it right now.
- It's just my dad, never mind him.

554
01:25:20,007 --> 01:25:23,124
- Why?
- No...

555
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:25,926
Just never mind.

556
01:25:26,767 --> 01:25:30,476
What did we tell you about cleaning?
It smells like...

557
01:25:30,567 --> 01:25:32,478
- Who are you?
- Zozo.

558
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:38,836
What did I tell you about having
friends over? Out, you little bugger.

559
01:25:41,647 --> 01:25:45,162
I never want
to see you here again, understand?

560
01:25:51,127 --> 01:25:54,324
Leo, what have I told you about
having friends over?

561
01:25:54,487 --> 01:26:00,517
- I know I'm not supposed to.
- So why did you? Now clean up!

562
01:26:00,607 --> 01:26:04,043
- I will.
- When? Get to it.

563
01:26:04,127 --> 01:26:07,915
Start cleaning right now or I'll...

564
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:11,675
- Zozo?
- Yes?

565
01:26:12,007 --> 01:26:18,355
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Your dad is stupid.

566
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:22,235
I know, butjust never mind him.
Can we meet up tomorrow?

567
01:26:22,407 --> 01:26:27,197
- Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

568
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:34,276
- Do you know what this means?
- The pinky.

569
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:37,367
I see, "the pinky".

570
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:42,077
- What about this one?
- The ring finger.

571
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:45,364
It's where you wear your ring
when you get married.

572
01:26:45,687 --> 01:26:50,363
- And...
- Middle finger. That lets you do this.

573
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:53,406
- Index finger.
- That's right.

574
01:26:53,487 --> 01:26:56,240
- Thumb?
- Thumb.

575
01:26:56,327 --> 01:27:01,447
So you can light a lighter.
What are fingers called in Arabic?

576
01:27:05,447 --> 01:27:06,675
No, not like...

577
01:27:09,567 --> 01:27:11,558
No...

578
01:27:17,447 --> 01:27:19,438
- It's kind of hard.
- Yes.

579
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:23,798
Yes. That's it. Good.

580
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:32,721
- You know Anna in our class?
- Blond hair? Yes, I know.

581
01:27:34,287 --> 01:27:37,757
- What do you think of her?
- She's nice.

582
01:27:37,967 --> 01:27:41,243
- What do you think?
- I think she's pretty.

583
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:45,320
You like Anna? Is she your girlfriend?

584
01:27:45,407 --> 01:27:47,443
- No.
- Why?

585
01:27:47,607 --> 01:27:50,963
- I don't know.
- Have you asked him?

586
01:27:51,047 --> 01:27:55,006
Her. I've asked her many times.

587
01:27:55,087 --> 01:27:58,159
- What did she say?
- No, of course.

588
01:27:58,327 --> 01:28:03,037
- Why?
- I don't know. She doesn't like me.

589
01:28:03,127 --> 01:28:07,279
- But you're very good-looking.
- I know, but...

590
01:28:07,807 --> 01:28:13,643
I know. You're good at drawing.
You could draw a picture for her.

591
01:28:13,807 --> 01:28:16,719
You could maybe draw... yourself.

592
01:28:20,447 --> 01:28:23,007
The foreigner has got himself a friend.

593
01:28:23,087 --> 01:28:27,000
- What do you want from me?
- Could you stop?

594
01:28:27,087 --> 01:28:30,443
- We don't want to fight. Leave.
- Shut up!

595
01:28:30,607 --> 01:28:33,804
- Don't hit him.
- I'll hit him all I want.

596
01:28:33,887 --> 01:28:36,560
Stop that! Don't hit him.

597
01:28:36,647 --> 01:28:39,002
Don't hit him!

598
01:28:39,927 --> 01:28:42,043
You bloody idiots...

599
01:29:25,407 --> 01:29:28,001
- Mom!
- Come on, Zozo.

600
01:29:28,087 --> 01:29:30,362
- Mom!
- Not now.

601
01:29:30,447 --> 01:29:33,007
- Come on, stop.
- That's enough, Zozo. Not right now.

602
01:29:37,767 --> 01:29:42,841
- That's enough, Mom, stop.
- Can't you see the bombs?

603
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:45,805
Forget them, they're not real.
Not even the grenades.

604
01:29:46,007 --> 01:29:48,760
What do you mean "not real"?

605
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:53,876
Mom, why did you leave me?

606
01:29:55,047 --> 01:29:58,323
Zozo, what are you talking about?

607
01:30:00,287 --> 01:30:06,283
I'm not happy here. Why can't you
come back? I'm unhappy without you.

608
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:12,082
What's the matter with you?
What happened?

609
01:30:16,447 --> 01:30:20,281
Nothing. I've missed you.

610
01:30:25,567 --> 01:30:28,843
I missed you.

611
01:30:29,527 --> 01:30:33,440
Don't be scared,
everything will be alright.

612
01:30:39,687 --> 01:30:44,715
- I love you.
- I love you too.

613
01:31:37,287 --> 01:31:41,405
The foreigner has got himself a friend.

614
01:31:43,927 --> 01:31:49,923
- Stop it, we don't want to fight.
- Shut up.

615
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:52,885
- Come, Leo, let's go.
- That's what I thought. Geeks.

616
01:31:53,047 --> 01:31:57,563
Geeks! Couple of girls!

617
01:32:06,207 --> 01:32:09,677
- Do you want to play soccer?
- Sure.

618
01:32:09,767 --> 01:32:14,887
Let's go to the docks
and maybe get something to eat.

619
01:32:57,927 --> 01:33:04,116
- Do you think we'll catch anything?
- Yes, I do. Maybe...

620
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:08,679
Did you ever consider...

621
01:33:08,967 --> 01:33:12,403
How many fish
do you think there are here?

622
01:33:12,567 --> 01:33:15,320
- Maybe one...
- Just one?

623
01:33:15,487 --> 01:33:19,765
- No, maybe one hundred.
- Yes, or one million.

624
01:33:20,687 --> 01:33:23,121
One million! No...

625
01:33:23,207 --> 01:33:30,158
- Maybe... maybe two million.
- Yes. Or three.

626
01:33:30,327 --> 01:33:34,002
- Or four.
- Or five.

627
01:33:34,087 --> 01:33:38,444
- Or six.
- Or a billion.
