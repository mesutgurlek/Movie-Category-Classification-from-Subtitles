1
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,723
I have today ordered to Vietnam
the air mobile division

2
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,319
and certain other forces,
which will raise our fighting strength,

3
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:10,130
from 75,000 to 125,000 men,
almost immediately.

4
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:16,541
Additional forces will be needed later,
and they will be sent as requested.

5
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,839
This will make it necessary
to increase our active fighting forces

6
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:27,853
by raising the monthly draft call
from 17,000, over a period of time,

7
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,252
to 35,000 per month.

8
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,568
<i>This is a rather important conception,</i>
<i>both what's apt to happen in Chicago,</i>

9
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,770
<i>and also what kind of a movement</i>
<i>we're trying to build.</i>

10
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,109
We're trying to contribute to a set-up,

11
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,412
in which the energies
of the anti-war movement

12
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,418
can be unleashed or liberated.

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,184
We're working for some kind of
combination of planning and flexibility,

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,488
which will on the one hand
just avoid complete chaos.

15
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:13,157
We have to establish a network
for discussion and preparation

16
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,427
that takes into account the possibility

17
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,163
that you might want
at the time of the Convention

18
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,798
a very great outpouring of protest,

19
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,877
or the other possibility
that you might want

20
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,170
protests to occur
on a more moderate scale

21
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,511
at the Convention
and in other parts of the country.

22
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:34,417
We believe that politics is the way
you live your life, not who you support.

23
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,922
It's not in terms of rallies
or speeches or political programs.

24
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,254
It's in terms of images

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>and in terms of</i>
<i>transforming people's lives.</i>

26
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,195
<i>We are coming to Chicago,</i>

27
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,291
<i>at the time of</i>
<i>the Democratic National Convention,</i>

28
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,496
not to disrupt the Convention,
not to confront the police,

29
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,869
National Guard troops,
or the men in the United States Army.

30
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,441
But to challenge
the policies of militarization that

31
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,011
have been felt so strongly
and brutally in Vietnam.

32
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,111
We're going to invest our time,
our semen,

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,053
our love vectors, our intellect,
in America,

34
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,485
and we're not going to allow
our country to become

35
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,153
one of the fabled, damned nations
to join the Mayan ruins

36
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:20,926
and all the other violent civilizations
that have been snuffed.

37
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,663
<i>... just on the edge of the park.</i>
<i>ABC's Don Farmer is there.</i>

38
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,204
<i>Here come the cops. They're pushing</i>
<i>this crowd back now.</i>

39
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:39,144
<i>A big police van has now pulled into</i>
<i>the intersection.</i>

40
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,381
<i>Now here come the police.</i>
<i>Step up here.</i>

41
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,785
<i>Here they come.</i>
<i>This is a real police charge.</i>

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,589
<i>We're gonna get it. We're gonna get it.</i>

43
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,321
<i>Now the police are clubbing</i>
<i>this young man.</i>

44
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,160
<i>Clubbing him. Now I see them club</i>
<i>at least three young people.</i>

45
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,734
<i>Now they're moving into the crowd</i>
<i>and beating them with their nightsticks.</i>

46
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,928
<i>There are a lot of young people</i>
<i>on the ground now.</i>

47
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,402
<i>There's another one that hit the ground</i>
<i>and he's screaming.</i>

48
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,497
<i>They're really letting him have it now.</i>

49
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,840
<i>This is real violent. This is the worst</i>
<i>it's been so far here in Chicago.</i>

50
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,209
<i>Police running across here.</i>

51
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,477
<i>There's another one that hit the ground</i>
<i>and he's screaming.</i>

52
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,887
<i>They're really letting him have it now.</i>

53
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,755
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

54
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:25,288
the government will prove in this case,
the plan of the eight defendants,

55
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,889
who encouraged people
to come to Chicago

56
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,696
during the Democratic Convention

57
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:35,069
from August the 26th
through August the 29th, 1968.

58
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,803
Their plan was to bring people
into Chicago to protest,

59
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,904
and then create a situation
where these people would riot.

60
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:47,152
In doing so,
the defendants crossed state lines

61
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,245
with the intent to start this riot.

62
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,325
Intent to incite, is that the key line?
Intent to incite.

63
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,724
Did you intend to incite?
And it's not concerned...

64
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,956
It's a state of mind trial. I mean,
we're being tried for our thoughts.

65
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,626
We're charged with carrying
certain ideas across state lines.

66
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,596
Not with carrying machine guns,
or carrying little girls,

67
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,434
or little boys, or any other kind of shit.

68
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,940
We're charged with having
a certain state of mind

69
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,977
when we go from New York,
into Pennsylvania,

70
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,808
into Indiana, and then finally into Illinois.

71
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,212
We hope to prove that the prosecution

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,150
is the result of two motives
on the part of the government.

73
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,451
- Objection.
- I sustain the objection.

74
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,357
You may speak to the guilt
or innocence of your clients,

75
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,089
not to the motive of the government.

76
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,323
Your Honor, I have always thought...

77
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,835
Regardless of what
you always thought, Mr. Kunstler,

78
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,370
I sustain the objection.

79
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,443
We hope to show that what actually
happened in the streets of Chicago

80
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,739
was not a riot caused by demonstrators,

81
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,644
but a riot engineered
by the police of this city.

82
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,116
No one here is accused
of actually committing a violent act.

83
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,211
So, in getting the seven of us,
they're very smart,

84
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,415
'cause they're getting
seven of the people who,

85
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,618
for the longest time, stubbornly
kept talking about going to Chicago.

86
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,489
We will prove that the defendants,
David Dellinger,

87
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,088
Rennie Davis, and Thomas Hayden...

88
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,332
Who is the one that shook his fist
in the direction of the jury?

89
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,304
That is Mr. Hayden.

90
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,638
That is my customary greeting,
Your Honor.

91
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:22,579
We do not allow shaking of fists
in this courtroom, sir.

92
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,446
The defendants,
Dellinger, Davis and Hayden,

93
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,952
were the leaders of a group
called the Mobilization.

94
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,651
Their goal was to use
the unpopularity of the war in Vietnam

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,160
to lure young people to Chicago.

96
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,231
This August, I'm going to
the Democratic National Convention

97
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,299
in Chicago.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,526
I want the world to know

99
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,194
that there are thousands
of young people in this country

100
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,828
who do not want to see
a rigged convention

101
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,569
rubber-stamp another four years
of Lyndon Johnson's war.

102
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,572
Join us.

103
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,378
In addition to the Mobilization,

104
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,418
there was another group
that tried to lure people to Chicago.

105
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,080
That group was led by Abbie Hoffman.

106
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,460
The jury is directed to disregard the kiss

107
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,962
thrown by the defendant, Hoffman.

108
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,760
And another leader of this group
was Jerry Rubin.

109
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,600
They called themselves the Yippies.

110
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,502
We feel that it was not only our right,

111
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,973
but our duty to go to Chicago
and do what we did.

112
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,408
I will openly confess
to everything that I did,

113
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,241
and even to what they say I didn't do.

114
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,441
It's a thrill because
it's the Academy Award of protests.

115
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,644
And I want to congratulate
all the thousands of people

116
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,347
who came to Chicago
and competed for the honor.

117
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,321
I don't know why they selected
the eight of us,

118
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,882
but we're very nervous and excited,
and hope that we're equal to the task.

119
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,519
Two more of these individuals are
Lee Weener...

120
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,597
Weiner.

121
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:51,364
Lee Weener, and John Froines, joined
with Davis, Dellinger and Hayden.

122
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:56,033
The last person who joined
is a man named Bobby Seale.

123
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,638
We will prove that these defendants
made unreasonable demands

124
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,840
upon the city of Chicago
for certain permits.

125
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,248
Non-negotiable demands.

126
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,651
We hope to show that the nightstick
became the symbol

127
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,849
of what demonstrators could expect
who were demonstrating

128
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,795
against the continuance of this bloody
and unjustified war in Vietnam.

129
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,959
We will demonstrate that free speech
died here in the streets

130
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,665
under those clubs, and that
the bodies of these demonstrators

131
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,604
were the sacrifices to its death.

132
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,445
So you think you're going
to get a fair trial?

133
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,448
- If things work out right.
- Yeah.

134
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,315
Yeah, we'll get the usual fair trial,
Chicago-style.

135
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,782
They're building gallows
on the third floor, you know.

136
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,586
They got this little door going...

137
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,923
Testing guys, testing these bags,
and pulling ropes and shit.

138
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:56,127
I don't know, some people say that
that's a pretty pessimistic sign.

139
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,930
All rise.

140
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,071
The United States District Court

141
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,868
for the Northern District of Illinois
now is in session.

142
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,069
The Honorable Judge
Julius J. Hoffman presiding.

143
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,937
You should have seen that jury,
that was some audience to play to,

144
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,208
I'll tell you.

145
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,717
It was out of the back pages
of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal.</i>

146
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,184
It was weird.

147
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,582
Will you please identify yourself
for the record?

148
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,692
Of course I will, Len. My name is Abbie.
I'm an orphan of America.

149
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,559
Your Honor, may the record show
it is the defendant Hoffman

150
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,825
who has taken the stand?

151
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:31,063
Well, it is rather important in this case.

152
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,596
There's a Hoffman up here
and one down there.

153
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,369
I certainly wouldn't want the jury
to get confused.

154
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,111
We will concede, Your Honor.

155
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,643
- When were you born?
- Psychologically, 1960.

156
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,653
- Objection.
- Objection sustained.

157
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,223
What? My background has
nothing to do with my state of mind?

158
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,692
Will you remain quiet
while I'm making a ruling?

159
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,687
- Mr. Feinglass.
- Weinglass.

160
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,789
Weinglass, yes.

161
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,131
Will you please continue
the examination of the witness?

162
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,799
Now directing your attention
to September, 1967.

163
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,242
- What were you doing?
- What was I doing?

164
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,904
Well, I was doing a number of things.

165
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,780
Among them was a meeting I had
with the defendant Jerry Rubin.

166
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,875
Jerry said that the problem
with the peace movement

167
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,047
is that it's based solely
on the war in Vietnam.

168
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,556
See, we feel that the war
is not just an accident,

169
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,288
it's a by-product of a capitalist system
that we have in this country.

170
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,728
He felt that we had to put forth
new kinds of values

171
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,290
to create a society in which a Vietnam
War wouldn't even be possible.

172
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,616
We've got to let Johnson
and the Democrats know

173
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,024
that we don't support their fucking war.

174
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,098
We should go to Chicago
and greet the convention of death

175
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,031
with a demonstration
of an alternative culture

176
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,830
with alternative values.

177
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,700
Right, while they're having politicians
at the Convention Center,

178
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,240
we'll have rock bands
playing in the park.

179
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,674
It'll be a coming-together
of pot and politics.

180
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,679
We'll radicalize every hippie
in the country, man.

181
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,478
The actions we've already taken,
they've been exciting, alive,

182
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,779
the best kind of guerilla theater.

183
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,378
We have to create
that same spirit in Chicago.

184
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,049
Daley and Johnson will never
let it happen, man.

185
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,649
They're going to fucking lose it.

186
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,126
That's the point! Don't you get it?

187
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,753
We'll terrify the war machine

188
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,322
and force LBJ to be nominated
under armed guard!

189
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,732
Yeah, but we need to have a name,

190
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,361
you know, signifying
the radicalization of hippies.

191
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,674
Right? Okay. Now, what rhymes
with hippie? Hippie. Bippie...

192
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,680
Abbie? I think Paul just went
into our bedroom.

193
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,113
I think he may be having
one of those brainstorms.

194
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:03,150
Hippie, bippie, vippie, yippie, yippie.

195
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,280
Holy shit, that's it!

196
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,931
- Who do you want to give the letter to?
- To the mayor.

197
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,010
We want to give it to the mayor.

198
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,442
And if the mayor won't receive it,
we want the person

199
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,842
- closest to him to receive it.
- The mayor is busy.

200
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,539
Okay, well, who would be
the next in line to receive it?

201
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:34,312
This is not a petition, this is a formal
application for the use of Grant Park.

202
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,218
No, you want this for the mayor
to receive, don't you?

203
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,312
You said he's in a council meeting

204
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,686
- which is open to the public.
- That's right.

205
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,191
But you can't give it to him
during a council meeting.

206
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,523
- No, we won't.
- This is his office right here.

207
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,756
- We won't give it to him.
- I know you won't give it to him.

208
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,299
They won't even let you in there.
Who's the spokesman here?

209
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,766
- We all are.
- We all are.

210
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,633
Okay. Give it any place you want.

211
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,899
- Yippie!
- Yippie!

212
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,367
Yippy-skippy.

213
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,638
<i>We began negotiations</i>
<i>with the city of Chicago,</i>

214
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,976
back on March 25, 1968,

215
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,482
with a meeting with
the Parks Department,

216
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,108
and Deputy Mayor Stahl.

217
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,044
Your application is
still under consideration,

218
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,647
but the mayor doesn't have
the power to grant permits.

219
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:16,626
Are you fucking kidding me?
Daley's the boss of Chicago!

220
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,323
He makes all the decisions
around here.

221
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,266
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

222
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,769
But for many months we've been
planning a Festival of Life

223
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,032
with the basis of free music.

224
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,632
What else do you plan to do
besides demonstrate your music?

225
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:37,979
Well, a dawn ass-washing ceremony,
with tens of thousands participating,

226
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,745
will occur each morning at 5:00 a.m.,

227
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,787
as Yippie revelers and protesters

228
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,914
prepare for the 7:00 a.m.
volleyball tournament.

229
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,458
There will be public fornication,

230
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,155
whenever and wherever
there is an aroused appendage

231
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,696
and a willing aperture.

232
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,925
- Here, here!
- Look, Dave, Dave, Dave,

233
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,298
there's half a million Yippies
coming to our festival,

234
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,769
and they're gonna need
a place to sleep, you got it?

235
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,305
It has to be in the park, man.

236
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,433
The hotels are all gonna be
filled up with fucking delegates.

237
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,511
I wasn't aware that
your application says anything

238
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,045
about sleeping in the park.

239
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,308
That is simply not permitted.

240
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,376
Where would you sleep anyway?

241
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,113
Some of us will live in tents,
others will live frivolously.

242
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,053
You know what?
I got a great idea, Dave.

243
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,718
Why don't you just give me 100 grand
and we'll call the whole thing off?

244
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,351
What do you say?

245
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,255
Now, you testified on
the August 7th meeting

246
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,095
with Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman,

247
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,863
that there was some mention
of $100,000.

248
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,404
Is that not correct?

249
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,733
That is correct.

250
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,071
Did you take that discussion seriously,
Mr. Stahl?

251
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,168
Yes, I most certainly did.

252
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,538
Was that a betrayal of your friends
to take a ransom?

253
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,312
- A what?
- A $100,000 ransom.

254
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,322
I don't understand.

255
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,823
A ransom? You mean to rip off
this city for 100 grand?

256
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,225
- Yeah.
- It's a groovy thing to do.

257
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,529
What, are you kidding?
What are they gonna do with it anyway?

258
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,465
- Would you have done it?
- What?

259
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,060
Would you have taken $100,000
to call everything off?

260
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,436
I would have taken $100,000.
As to calling it off,

261
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,805
well...

262
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,212
How much is it worth to you

263
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,112
- to call it off?
- Call off what?

264
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,809
A million?
Would you have done it for a million?

265
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,819
- The revolution?
- Yeah.

266
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,021
- What's your price?
- My life.

267
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,625
At 7:10 this evening, Martin Luther King
was shot in Tennessee.

268
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,163
Martin Luther King,
20 minutes ago, died.

269
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,617
<i>I issued a police order to shoot</i>
<i>to kill any arsonists</i>

270
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,388
<i>or anyone with a Molotov cocktail</i>
<i>in their hand in Chicago.</i>

271
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,694
<i>And to issue a police order,</i>
<i>to shoot to maim,</i>

272
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,235
<i>or cripple anyone looting.</i>

273
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,004
<i>I remember seeing him, April 4, 1968.</i>

274
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,011
<i>Martin Luther King had</i>
<i>been assassinated.</i>

275
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,412
<i>Riots all over the country,</i>
<i>and LBJ came on, and he shed a tear,</i>

276
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,848
<i>they got tricky make-up men to do</i>
<i>that stuff, and he said,</i>

277
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:31,013
<i>"My fellow Americans,</i>
<i>in the memory of his name,</i>

278
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,183
<i>"we must be nonviolent."</i>

279
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,260
<i>And I put down a joint and said,</i>

280
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,455
<i>"Holy shit, LBJ's a pacifist.</i>
<i>I didn't know that."</i>

281
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,598
Towards the end of next month,

282
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,191
the scene below,
in front of Chicago's Amphitheater

283
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,670
will be one of surging crowds
and hectic activity.

284
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,765
The Democratic National Convention
will be under way.

285
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,141
But in addition to the delegates,
and their guests, others,

286
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,046
perhaps numbering in the hundreds
of thousands, will be on hand also.

287
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,448
And this may create some problems.

288
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,511
<i>Two major dissident groups are</i>
<i>planning to have their voices heard here</i>

289
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,681
<i>Convention Week.</i>

290
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,022
<i>The more militant of the two is</i>
<i>the National Mobilization Committee</i>

291
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,720
<i>to End the War in Vietnam.</i>

292
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,765
<i>Its Chicago office is making plans</i>
<i>to have upwards of 50,000 people here</i>

293
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,959
<i>during the Convention.</i>

294
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,030
We want to underscore again
that we're coming to Chicago

295
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,005
by the tens of thousands, whether
or not there are any permits given.

296
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,942
We are here to make a visible,
militant, but peaceful presence.

297
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,342
A political confrontation,
but not a physical confrontation,

298
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,213
in terms of Chicago.

299
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,115
We expect this to be a peaceful,
nonviolent demonstration,

300
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,190
and whether or not it will be peaceful,

301
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,418
it really is in the hands, at this time,
of the mayor of this city.

302
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,252
Why did you want the Convention
to come here so badly?

303
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,524
Because we have a great city.

304
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,033
Will it be a good convention, Mr. Mayor?

305
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,102
The best ever held.

306
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,387
I am commanding general of
the Emergency Operation Headquarters

307
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,355
of the Illinois Army National Guard.

308
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,254
<i>The Emergency Operation</i>
<i>Headquarters was established</i>

309
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,766
<i>for the purpose of controlling operations</i>
<i>in the event of civil disturbances.</i>

310
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:27,032
<i>We shall overcome</i>

311
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,035
<i>We shall overcome</i>

312
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,911
<i>Well, I think that it's quite clear</i>
<i>that the city and the Democratic Party</i>

313
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,510
is preparing for a police state
and martial law

314
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,021
during the week of
the Democratic National Convention.

315
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,331
Mr. Hoffman, why are the Yippies here?

316
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,027
- Abbie.
- Abbie, why are the Yippies here?

317
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,798
<i>Since we're not a carefully</i>
<i>structured organization,</i>

318
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,634
<i>you'd have to ask each person.</i>

319
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,435
<i>Everybody is allowed to do their thing.</i>

320
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,409
<i>If some people storm the Amphitheater,</i>
<i>they storm the Amphitheater.</i>

321
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,241
Other people wanna smoke dope,

322
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,441
other people wanna go and tell
the cops what we're doing, that's good.

323
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,314
If the cops wanna come down
and beat our heads, that's it.

324
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,081
I mean,
it's all conceived as a total theater

325
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,749
<i>with everyone becoming an actor.</i>

326
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,885
<i>These people are revolutionaries bent</i>
<i>on the destruction of the government</i>

327
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,293
<i>of the United States of America.</i>

328
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,992
<i>They're a pitiful handful.</i>
<i>They have almost no support.</i>

329
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,332
<i>But by golly, they get the cooperation</i>
<i>of the news media.</i>

330
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,496
<i>They're built into something really big.</i>

331
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,040
They're referred to as kids,
they're referred to as Yippies.

332
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,470
Gentlemen, the hardcore leadership
of this group are Communists.

333
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,885
We're training people in the use
of highly mobile defensive tactics

334
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,752
that might be required
in the eventuality of police violence.

335
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,528
<i>There are some young people</i>
<i>in the city practicing snake dancing</i>

336
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,799
<i>and other techniques</i>
<i>to stay up against the police.</i>

337
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,135
<i>Does this disturb you in any way?</i>

338
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,006
No, snake dances never disturb me.

339
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,008
Did you have a conversation with
Jerry Rubin in November of 1967?

340
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,985
Yes. Mr. Rubin said
that he was, at present,

341
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,556
working full-time on plans
to have a youth festival in Chicago

342
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,557
when the Democratic Convention
would take place.

343
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,492
I was overtaken with the audacity
of the idea and I said,

344
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,257
"It's a beautiful and frightening idea."

345
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,561
And Rubin said, "I think that the beauty
of it is that the establishment

346
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,135
"is going to do it all themselves.
We won't do a thing.

347
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,104
"They will smash the city themselves,
they will provoke all the violence."

348
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,003
And I said, "I think you're right.

349
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,133
"But I have to admit to you that
I'm scared at the thought of it."

350
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,679
If people stay in the park
and play the role of the good niggers,

351
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,719
<i>they'll be okay, they'll be treated</i>
<i>with respect by the police.</i>

352
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,484
<i>But those Yippies that march</i>
<i>on the Amphitheater or go downtown,</i>

353
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,950
they'll be risking their lives. That's right.

354
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,791
These cops here are tough.
They'd kill you with a smile.

355
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,888
We are not going out to fight the cops.

356
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,230
I mean, we basically hope
that this is going to be

357
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,066
a nonviolent situation in this park.

358
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:19,576
However, if the violence comes,
we will soak it up.

359
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,475
<i>There's a struggle going on</i>
<i>in the world today,</i>

360
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,072
<i>and it's a struggle about what</i>
<i>the future of this country's about.</i>

361
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,913
And young people are not going to stay
neutral, they are going to be involved.

362
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,319
In the face of repression,
you either sit at home in fear,

363
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,392
<i>or you accommodate by closing</i>
<i>your eyes, or you fight.</i>

364
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,462
And in this country,
people are going to fight repression

365
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,291
by any means they choose to fight.

366
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,161
<i>They're not going to take over Chicago,</i>

367
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,234
<i>and they're not going to</i>
<i>take over any convention,</i>

368
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,496
and they're not going to
take over any streets.

369
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,901
And that goes for all of them.

370
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,236
And I don't care how many of them
come here or where they come from.

371
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,076
"Many of us may fight and die here.

372
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,579
"We recognize this as the vision
of the founders of this nation.

373
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,778
<i>"We recognize that we are America.</i>
<i>We recognize that we are free men."</i>

374
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,878
Political pigs, your days are numbered.

375
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,752
We are the second
American Revolution.

376
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,415
We are winning. Yippie.

377
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,197
A Democratic Convention is
about to begin in a police state.

378
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,956
There just doesn't seem to be
any other way to say it.

379
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,072
And now, here's Yippie!

380
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,011
Now what happened to Bobby Seale is...
You know when we were all indicted,

381
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,545
Bobby Seale was
the eighth person indicted,

382
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,548
which was really weird because Bobby
was only in Chicago a couple of hours.

383
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,016
But the government believes
in integration, equality,

384
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,314
and so, if it indicts seven,
it's got to add on a black person.

385
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,116
And what could be better
than the national chairman

386
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,748
of the Black Panther Party? Beautiful.
You've got eight, perfect.

387
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,053
Bobby Seale was
in Stockholm, Sweden,

388
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,354
when he heard he was indicted.

389
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,520
He couldn't even remember
what it was all about.

390
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,225
There is a motion here
of defendant Bobby Seale

391
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,732
to be permitted to defend himself.

392
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,161
I will hear you, Mr. Seale.

393
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,075
Thank you, Your Honor.

394
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,582
I want to present this motion
on behalf of myself.

395
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,587
I'm not a lawyer, but I do know
that I, as one of the defendants,

396
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,089
have a right to defend myself.

397
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,354
Your Honor, the other defendants
would like to join in this motion.

398
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,656
I would like to call
Your Honor's attention to

399
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,427
<i>Adams v. The United States,</i>
where the Supreme Court said,

400
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:26,493
"The Constitution does not force
a lawyer on a defendant."

401
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,938
Mr. Seale has said that
he does not desire to have me,

402
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,533
or any of the other attorneys,
represent him in any way.

403
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,140
Motion will be denied.

404
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,079
I should be allowed to defend myself.

405
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,411
I will ask you to sit down.

406
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,679
I should be allowed to speak
so I can defend myself.

407
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,379
- Be quiet!
- Don't tell me to shut up.

408
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,682
I got a right to speak.

409
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,984
I need to speak in order
to defend myself.

410
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,558
Mr. Seale,

411
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:54,096
I admonish you that any outburst
such as you have just indulged in

412
00:23:54,199 --> 00:24:00,604
will be appropriately dealt with
at the right time during this trial.

413
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:04,266
I want to argue the point about this so
you can get an understanding of the fact

414
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,343
that I have a right to defend myself!

415
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,502
Mr. Marshal, will you go to that man

416
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,602
- and ask him to be quiet?
- I want my constitutional rights.

417
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,181
I want to have my constitutional right.
How come you won't recognize that?

418
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,409
Sit down and be quiet!

419
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,917
- Hey, man. Come on!
- Stop it! Come on!

420
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,081
Now, go ahead, continue.
I'll watch and get railroaded.

421
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,130
<i>The Democratic National Convention</i>
<i>opens in Chicago tonight</i>

422
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:32,795
<i>as the political scenery is being shifted</i>
<i>into place for the four-day stand.</i>

423
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,235
<i>Why did you decide</i>
<i>to come to Chicago?</i>

424
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,673
Mostly because I felt
that my presence in Chicago,

425
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,304
even of one individual, might bring
home to the delegates there

426
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,714
just how wide and how extensive
the problem is in America today.

427
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,447
<i>I'm here for two reasons.</i>

428
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,352
One, we're going to demonstrate
against the war.

429
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,187
Number two is just
what it's called, the Festival of Life.

430
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,294
I'm sure it's going to get much more
difficult as the war goes on,

431
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,991
but we just gotta keep on protesting
until the war is ended,

432
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,692
until this obscenity is finished.

433
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,272
We need somebody to follow
the orange curtain

434
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,806
all the way down to the cafeteria.

435
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,520
<i>It is now my honor to present to you</i>

436

<i>the mayor of our host city,</i>
<i>Richard J. Daley.</i>

437

<i>thank you.</i>

438
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,299

<i>The people of Chicago and its mayor</i>
<i>are proud to welcome</i>

440
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,715
<i>a great political gathering of Americans</i>

441
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,318
<i>who come here to shape</i>
<i>the future of a nation,</i>

442

- That's us!

444
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,094
Yeah!

445
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,470
Have another great
Democratic National Convention.

446

<i>Democrats understand the imperative</i>
<i>need for respect of the law.</i>

448
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,793
All right, now I'm going to ask
your opinion

449
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,025
on the famous issues
facing our country today.

450
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:47,833
<i>But it is high time for the political</i>
<i>leadership of this generation</i>

451
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,238
<i>to reject the language</i>
<i>of conflict and despair!</i>

452
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,840
<i>Right now...</i>

453
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:59,440
<i>Right now it's time to kick</i>
<i>out the jams, motherfucker!</i>

454
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,012
<i>Rock, rock, rock!</i>

455
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,618
The issue of law and order?

456
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,095
- Shoot to kill! Shoot to kill!
- Shoot to kill! Shoot to kill!

457
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:17,625
<i>And as long as I'm mayor of this town,</i>
<i>there will be law and order in Chicago!</i>

458
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,910
The aggressive war in Vietnam?

459
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,546
- Negotiate with bombs!
- Negotiate with bombs!

460
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,228
The issue of rebellious youth?

461
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,297
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

462
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,831
- Crush those motherfuckers!
- Crush those motherfuckers!

463
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:48,899
- Crush them!
- Crush them!

464
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,445
<i>At today's event,</i>
<i>protestors clashed with police,</i>

465
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,710
<i>and the first blood of the confrontation</i>
<i>in Chicago was drawn.</i>

466
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,248
Ten miles away, Convention Hall.

467
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,652
"You came here to disrupt
the Convention."

468
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,623
They had 10 miles of barbed wire fence.

469
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,855
They had 25,000 troops
counting the cops and National Guard.

470
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:22,490
They had tanks, armored tanks,
in the streets of Chicago,

471
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,862
National Guard with bayonets.

472
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,027
They had helicopters
with machine guns.

473
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,231
"We came to disrupt the Convention."
Out of sight.

474
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,139
We couldn't find our way
out of the park!

475
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,881
<i>This is Lincoln Park in</i>
<i>the city's swank Near North side.</i>

476
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,889
<i>Hippies, Yippies, and just plain kids</i>
<i>have wanted to sleep in this park</i>

477
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,222
<i>during the Convention,</i>
<i>but the city has repeatedly said no,</i>

478
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,421
<i>and police have enforced that order.</i>

479
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,364
<i>... for remaining in the park between</i>
<i>11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.</i>

480
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,902
<i>11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.</i>

481
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,131
- <i>Please obey the law.</i>
- <i>We're going to stay in the park!</i>

482
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,360
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mr. Bob Fass?

483
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,198
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- I have a collect call for you.

484
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,435
- Collect call! Yeah?
- A collect call from Mr. Abbie Hoffman,

485
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,009
will you accept the charge?

486
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,101
Yes, we'll accept the charge,
but would you like to say hello

487
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,840
to anybody in New York, operator?

488
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,575
- No, sir, thank you.
- Thank you.

489
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,949
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, Abbie.

490
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,713
- Robert.
- <i>Hi.</i>

491
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,050
- Yeah, it's a chilly night here.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

492
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,623
Yeah, how are you doing, man?

493
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,988
<i>Okay. How was it in court today?</i>

494
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,994
Oh, it's unbelievable.
I mean, our trial is a jewel.

495
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,122
The judge, he's 74 years old.

496
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,600
He was alive at
the first and second Balkan Wars.

497
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,194
I think he just missed going
on the <i>Titanic.</i>

498
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,035
Yeah, I think he's even
beyond the generation gap.

499
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,871
Are you sure you're not related to him?

500
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,469
- No, no.
- You're sure? The name...

501
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,945
<i>I brought him a present though.</i>

502
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:28,348
I heard he had tired blood and
I bought him a year's supply of Geritol.

503
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,047
Do you really think he'd take a thing
like that kindly, Abbie?

504
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,349
Giving him Geritol?

505
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,517
Well, he has a bit of a sense of humor.

506
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,187
He might think of it as an attempt
to bribe him.

507
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,231
- <i>No.</i>
- I think you probably are relatives

508
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,425
in some distant way, Abbie.

509
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:48,801
In some distant way, yeah. In the great
conspiracy, we're all sort of relatives.

510
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,137
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

511
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,544
the testimony the witness is
about to give

512
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:03,315
is offered by the government only
with respect to the defendant Derringer.

513
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,912
I think Your Honor means Dellinger.

514
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,015
Dellinger, that's right.

515
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,458
Mr. Dillinger said that,
"We must issue a..."

516
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:16,158
I mispronounced the defendant's name.
You said, "Dillinger."

517
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:22,604
It's "Derringer." We're both wrong.
You mean Mr. Derringer, do you not?

518
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,403
Your Honor, it's Dellinger.

519
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,943
Let's move on, shall we?

520
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:34,678
Now, Mr. Pierson, taking you back
to Monday, August the 26th.

521
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,983
Did you have occasion to be
in Lincoln Park that day?

522
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,488
Yes, sir, I did.

523
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,082
I was introduced to Jerry Rubin
by someone I had befriended.

524
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:47,654
He said, "Jerry, this is Bob Levin.
He will be your personal bodyguard.

525
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,326
"He can be trusted,
and he handles himself well."

526
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,405
Rubin shook my hand and said that
he was glad to have me with him.

527
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,702
And what occurred after
this introduction, please?

528
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,245
There was a commotion to the south
of where Rubin and I were sitting.

529
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:04,144
<i>We saw two men being placed</i>
<i>in a police squadron.</i>

530
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,842
<i>Rubin asked one of the people</i>
<i>standing there what had happened,</i>

531
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,284
<i>and they told him that Tom Hayden</i>
<i>had been arrested.</i>

532
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,913
<i>He told Rubin that a march</i>
<i>was being formed to go down</i>

533
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,288
<i>to police headquarters to free Hayden.</i>

534
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,758
<i>What did you do then?</i>

535
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,556
<i>Rubin and I joined the march.</i>

536
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,733
<i>The march was called to protest</i>
<i>the arrest of Tom Hayden</i>

537
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,600
<i>who was accused of disorderly conduct</i>

538
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,572
<i>for letting the air out</i>
<i>of the tires of a police car.</i>

539
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,610
<i>There were rumblings of the trouble</i>
<i>to come all afternoon.</i>

540
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,537
- Free Hayden! Free Hayden!
- Free Hayden! Free Hayden!

541
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,041
- Free Hayden! Free Hayden!
- Free Hayden! Free Hayden!

542
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,117
- Free Hayden!
- Free Hayden!

543
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,256
What do we want?

544
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,225
- Revolution!
- When?

545
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,591
- Now!
- Now!

546
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,719
What do we want?

547
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,798
- Revolution!
- Revolution!

548
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,829
<i>Now, when you arrived</i>
<i>at the police headquarters,</i>

549
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,543
<i>did you see any policemen in the area?</i>

550
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:05,907
<i>did you see any policemen in the area?</i>

551
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,969
<i>Yes, there were uniformed officers</i>
<i>in front of the building.</i>

552
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:14,040
<i>Rubin said, "There are too many</i>
<i>pigs here, let's go to the Hilton."</i>

553
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,019
<i>We went east on 11th</i>
<i>to Michigan Avenue</i>

554
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,112
<i>and then north on Michigan Avenue.</i>

555
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,748
<i>When the march was midpoint</i>
<i>past the Logan Statue,</i>

556
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,795
<i>the crowd broke and ran up</i>
<i>to the statue screaming, "Take the hill."</i>

557
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,738
<i>You are in an assembly</i>
<i>which you have no permit for.</i>

558
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,546
<i>If you do not leave,</i>
<i>you will be subject to arrest.</i>

559
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,347
<i>Move it back!</i>

560
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,292
<i>Move it back!</i>
<i>Let them have their statue,</i>

561
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,953
<i>let the pigs have their fucking statue!</i>

562
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:11,528
<i>Forty thousand troops,</i>
<i>their tanks, their mace, their artillery.</i>

563
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,196
<i>Chicago has become</i>
<i>a concentration camp</i>

564
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,637
<i>and it is clear for everybody to see.</i>

565
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:22,145
Mr. Pierson, what, if anything, happened
after the incident at the Logan Statue?

566
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:27,212
Rubin and I saw some people tacking
newspaper articles on some trees.

567
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,754
The first article showed a picture
of a policeman with a club.

568
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,880
Rubin looked at me and said,

569
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:38,018
"Look at that fat pig. We should isolate
one or two of those pigs and kill them."

570
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,326
- And what did you say?
- I agreed with him.

571
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,229
Then Rubin looked at me and said,

572
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,928
"We've got to do more
to keep the crowd active.

573
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,597
"We want them in the park
for the Bobby Seale speech tonight."

574
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,436
I object on the grounds
that my lawyer is not here.

575
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,009
You know my lawyer is not here,
Your Honor.

576
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,136
I want my lawyer here
when he mentions my name

577
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,078
and testifies against me.

578
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:02,084
Ask him...
Ask him to sit down, Mr. Marshal.

579
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,154
Sit down, Mr. Seale.

580
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,222
And what, if anything, occurred
after this conversation?

581
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,955
Two people walked up to us.
One of them had a plastic bag.

582
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,687
The man with the plastic bag
said to Rubin,

583
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,063
"We're going to fill this bag
with human shit

584
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,898
"and we're going to throw it
at the pigs tonight."

585
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:24,134
Rubin laughed and said, "Good,
it will make good food for the pigs."

586
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,410
I'm going to go into the whole thing.

587
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,340
- Go ahead.
- Do it.

588
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,177
I got a lot of different emotions
when I hear this guy Pierson.

589
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,348
One is I feel like vomiting
'cause it's so nauseating.

590
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,359
The second is I feel like laughing
'cause it's so funny.

591
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,056
I mean, it's really hilarious.
The guy's on a real fantasy trip.

592
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,929
The third, I feel like crying
because it's so dangerous.

593
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,970
<i>Because this is the man</i>
<i>that they're trying to use</i>

594
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,666
<i>to put all of us in</i>
<i>the federal penitentiary for 10 years.</i>

595
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,266
<i>Back in the courtroom,</i>
<i>defense attorneys told the judge,</i>

596
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,314
<i>"We have certain information about</i>
<i>the mental capacity of this witness."</i>

597
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,541
<i>Pierson was then asked,</i>

598
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,414
<i>"At any time have you ever been</i>
<i>under treatment by a physician</i>

599
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,114
<i>"for your mental capacity?"</i>
<i>CBS News, Chicago.</i>

600
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,751
When you went to Lincoln Park
on the 26th of August,

601
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,920
did you know that Abbie Hoffman
was going to be there?

602
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,190
No, sir, I didn't.

603
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,198
Had you ever seen him
before that time?

604
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,699
No, I hadn't.

605
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,032
Can you describe what he looked like
when you first saw him?

606
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:32,474
Not really, other than the wild hair,
and the nose, which impressed me.

607
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,909
- In which way did it impress you?
- Its size.

608
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:40,313
Mr. Rubin turned to his group
and began to shout in a loud voice.

609
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,512
- He used some profanity.
- What did he say?

610
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,852
"The pigs are in our park.
They're MF-ers and shitheads."

611
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,756
Were there any obscenities
in his speech?

612
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:54,957
Every other word was an obscenity,
especially the four-letter word.

613
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,594
You say, "Blank pigs."

614
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,933
- Did he say, "Blank pigs"?
- No, sir.

615
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,405
Did he use another word
other than "blank"?

616
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,874
- Yes, sir.
- Was it a four-letter word?

617
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,001
Yes, sir.

618
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:12,208
What was the first letter
of that four-letter word, please?

619
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,412
- F.
- No laughing in the courtroom!

620
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:22,021
At this point, Mr. Hayden said...
This is becoming rather obscene.

621
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,527
- Go ahead.
- Mr. Hayden said,

622
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:30,498
"Fuck them all. They're all pigs.
We should have an army and get guns."

623
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,660
While you were assigned
to follow Mr. Rubin,

624
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,297
did you ever see him throw
any object at another human being?

625
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,841
- Yes, Tuesday night.
- Tuesday night he threw an object?

626
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:43,004
Yes. He threw a sweater.

627
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,014
- At who?
- At me.

628
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,475
I take it you were uninjured
by the sweater.

629
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,783
Did you ever see any person in
the Mobilization wearing a gun?

630
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,016
I saw bulges under their coats.

631
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,789
You saw bulges? Did you say to yourself
at the time, "Those are guns"?

632
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:02,092
I said to myself, "Those are bulges."

633
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,894
Extremely accurate.

634
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,038
Abbie Hoffman is here
from Chicago on the telephone.

635
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,438
Only, he's not really here,
he's in Chicago. Hey, Abbie.

636
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,271
- Robert!
- Hi.

637
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,312
I heard my first dirty four-letter word
today in court.

638
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,245
- <i>You did?</i>
- It was MF-er.

639
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,941
- Is that heavy?
- Well, it's...

640
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,384
They kept, like, saying it.
"What was this dirty word?"

641
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,422
And he would say, "MF-er."

642
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,486
Oh, it's unbelievable.

643
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,924
- I mean, our trial is a jewel.
- Yeah.

644
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:35,556
After every witness we'd hear
we'd say, "We're in the wrong court."

645
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,158
Like today there was
this big bull dyke of a policewoman.

646
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,137
I'm probably gonna get
sued for that one.

647
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,666
- Is it Miss or Mrs?
- Miss.

648
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,675
Do you know a person
named Abbie Hoffman?

649
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,872
Yes, sir.

650
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,314
And do you see that person
in the courtroom at this time?

651
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,616
Yes, sir. He's hiding behind
the gentleman in the maroon shirt.

652
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,519
He... Right behind you.

653
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,785
Calling your attention
to Monday, August 26th.

654
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,558
Did you see Abbot Hoffman
in Lincoln Park?

655
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:14,727
I did. There was a group of
people gathered around Mr. Hoffman.

656
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:15,828
I heard him say it,

657
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,033
"On Wednesday,
we're gonna meet in Grant Park,

658
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,973
"and we're gonna storm the Hilton."

659
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,408
And then he said,

660
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:26,506
"We're gonna need a lot of weapons,
so we should bring rocks, bottles,"

661
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,278
and another good weapon,
he said, was a brick.

662
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,946
And then someone asked
about holding the park that night.

663
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,516
And he said, "Yeah. We should hold
the park tonight at all costs.

664
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:41,724
"It's our park, and the... And the fucking
pigs have no right to push us out."

665
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:52,034
<i>The city ordinance prohibits persons</i>
<i>from remaining in the park</i>

666
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:57,341
<i>from 11:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.</i>
<i>Please obey the law.</i>

667
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,485
<i>The city ordinance prohibits</i>
<i>persons from...</i>

668
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:05,111
Look, we're not here
to fight anyone, all right.

669
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:09,352
If the cops want the park, let them
have the park. Who gives a shit?

670
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,399
- Hell, no, we won't go!
- Hell, no, we won't go!

671
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,297
- Hell, no, we won't go!
- Hell, no, we won't go!

672
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,369
<i>Please obey the law.</i>

673
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,371
Get the fucking pigs!

674
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:00,935
Get the car!

675
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,715
- Hell, no, we won't go!
- Hell, no, we won't go!

676
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,912
- Hell, no, we won't go!
- Hell, no, we won't go!

677
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,579
- Hell, no, we won't go!
- Hell, no, we won't go!

678
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,249
Is anybody hurt? Is anybody hurt?

679
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,317
Mike?

680
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,924
<i>Now, from your own observations</i>

681
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,489
<i>at the Democratic National Convention</i>
<i>on these nights,</i>

682
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,230
<i>did you see any policemen</i>
<i>beat any demonstrators?</i>

683
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,362
<i>No, sir.</i>

684
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,408
<i>Did you see any policemen</i>
<i>do anything wrong?</i>

685
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,498
<i>No.</i>

686
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,236
Up against the wall, motherfucker!

687
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,106
He hit you there with a club

688
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,341
- and over the eye?
- He hit me all over the place.

689
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,474
And there were two of them that hit me,

690
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:48,710
but only one that I can recognize.

691
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,150
Do you want me to try
and stop the bleeding?

692
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,619
Wanna let me try to stop your bleeding?

693
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,815
- Is it bleeding badly?
- Yeah.

694
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,453
And I asked the bartender
for another drink,

695
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,892
and all of a sudden these guys
with blue helmets come in,

696
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:02,124
pushing people out of the way,
and telling everybody, "Get out!"

697
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,029
So I turn around and look
at this guy in a blue helmet,

698
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,897
this pig, and he says to me, "Get out!"

699
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,470
I said, "Why?
This is only my second drink."

700
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,630
He said,
"You had enough drinks, get out!"

701
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,766
And I'm real mad because I'm not part
of this Yippie gang or anything like that.

702
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,107
I'm just an ordinary citizen
in this Oxford pub

703
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,942
having a Black Label and soda.

704
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,245
So I just laid my drink down and got out
before that guy put the stick to me.

705
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,444
How come you weren't
drinking White Horse?

706
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,650
That's all I got to say.
I was scared, just plain scared.

707
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,018
<i>As you come around the corner</i>
<i>of the back porch</i>

708
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:35,462
<i>into the yard behind</i>
<i>5012 South Dorchester,</i>

709
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,694
<i>you may see a group</i>
<i>of 10 to 12-year-old boys</i>

710
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:42,670
<i>playing what looks like any one</i>
<i>of the games that city kids play.</i>

711
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,764
<i>But this game is new.</i>

712
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,708
<i>The kids call it,</i>
<i>"Cops and Demonstrators."</i>

713
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,509
Michael, would you rather be a cop
or a demonstrator

714
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,244
when you play this game?

715
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,785
A demonstrator.

716
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,685
I like to be a cop
better than a demonstrator

717
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,782
because the demonstrators,
when you hit the person,

718
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,622
you know, it kind of hurts sometimes.

719
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,553
Cops and Demonstrators
is a relatively new game.

720
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,098
But the different thing about it,
according to the boys,

721
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,794
is that in this one no one ever wins.

722
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,341
- All the way with LBJ!
- All the way with LBJ!

723
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,579
- All the way with LBJ!
- All the way with LBJ!

724
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,158
One man followed these people all
the way around.

725
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,887
Why couldn't we give it to them?

726
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:38,984
March or leave.

727
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,524
We wish to announce now
our firm determination

728
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,328
to organize a rally

729
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,493
the afternoon of August 28

730
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,231
and from there to march
to the International Amphitheater

731
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,398
where we will be heard
on the fundamental issues

732
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,068
of the war in Vietnam
and racism in the United States.

733
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,076
<i>This is David Dellinger,</i>
<i>who is a national chairman</i>

734
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,844
<i>of the National Mobilization Committee</i>
<i>to End the War in Vietnam.</i>

735
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:07,117
What's the purpose of your arrival here
and wait at the mayor's office?

736
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:11,661
Well, obviously there's an emergency
created by the city's refusal

737
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,356
to give us
any meaningful place to protest.

738
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,695
The city invited
the Democratic Convention to come in,

739
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,099
in fact paid a lot of money
to have it come in.

740
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,203
In these days, with Americans
and Vietnamese being killed daily

741
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:28,108
in Vietnam,
you can't hold a political convention

742
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,409
without expecting some form of protest
to accompany it.

743
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:35,043
I would like to say here and now

744
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:40,681
that this administration will never permit
a lawless, violent group of terrorists

745
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,692
to menace the lives
of millions of people,

746
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,627
destroy the purpose
of this National Convention

747
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,698
and take over the streets of Chicago.

748
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,550
<i>Ms. Willis, what is your reaction</i>
<i>to the news we get from downtown</i>

749
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,951
of all the violence
that's going on down there?

750
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,355
Well, the way I understand it
is the white people are always hollering

751
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,553
about how the colored people act
and everything,

752
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,130
but, you know,
now things that it's turned around

753
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,791
to show you who it really is.

754
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,893
Are you happier
that it's downtown and not up here?

755
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,337
Yeah, I'm very glad.

756
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,273
Well, do you feel any sympathy
for the white people

757
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,312
who are being beaten up
and tear-gassed downtown?

758
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,244
Well, no.

759
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,718
At this point,
are you still planning to go ahead

760
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,309
with your march to the Amphitheater?

761
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,581
Yes, we are.

762
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,419
And we think also that, you know,
there is that old song about

763
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,154
"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

764
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,423
And I think that
if people simply fold up their tents

765
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,295
and go away when they're threatened
with arrest or brutality,

766
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,392
then we will have a police state.

767
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,471
What to do about the march?
I don't know.

768
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:05,268
This was originally to be a festival
of life, not a confrontation.

769
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,900
My own feeling is
I don't want to get my head busted in

770
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,275
and I don't want anybody
who came knowing

771
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,712
that I was coming here
to have their head busted in.

772
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,341
So I'm not going to march formally
as a Yippie.

773
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,818
I'm going on the Mobilization march
as an individual

774
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,151
but not as a leader of Yippies.

775
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:24,091
And I don't know if I'll march from here
if it looks like a bloodbath scene.

776
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:28,954
I mean, man, 25,000 troops.
Are you kidding me? It's ridiculous.

777
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,829
I don't know
about the rest of the people here,

778
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,496
but I'm gonna be in that march
and I'm gonna march from here,

779
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,438
and I'll march all the way down there.

780
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,371
What do you think about the trial?

781
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,384
- I don't know anything about the trial.
- Oh, yeah, where you going?

782
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,649
- And listen...
- What's your name?

783
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,884
My name is Frankie. How are you?

784
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,393
Some of my friends are on trial in there.
What do you think about it?

785
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,395
- They are going to prison for 10 years.
- I don't know.

786
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,192
For having a state of mind

787
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:03,459
- and looking silly.
- Are they?

788
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,762
- Well, you ought to get sensible.
- Who?

789
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,996
- Like the... All of you guys.
- Why?

790
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,766
- Dress like the rest of them.
- Why?

791
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,740
Because you'd look better.
You look too messy.

792
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,074
Oh, so you think people should go
to prison 'cause they look messy?

793
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,237
- No.
- Why not?

794
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,871
- You should cut your hair.
- Why?

795
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,210
- Because...
- What? It ain't cute?

796
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,784
- You want to touch it?
- No.

797
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,353
Oh, come on, look.
I cut it every morning.

798
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,648
It grows like this. By midnight,

799
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:29,123
- it'll be down to my ankles.
- Listen, I got to go.

800
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,553
So what do you think
about the trial, man?

801
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,655
Well, I have... I have a good seat,

802
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:41,466
and it's unbelievable theater.
Great show.

803
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,833
The outcome don't look good,

804
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:47,501
but the beginning
and the middle is looking great.

805
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:50,341
I view it as a clash
between life and death.

806
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:55,248
Between what the French call
<i>la vitale,</i> the vital force.

807
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,287
And I think that...

808
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,516
Well, as I conceptualize it and frame it,

809
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:05,527
I try to have all the symbolism
on our side

810
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,529
reflect the symbolism of life

811
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:12,933
that's reflected in the revolution
of which we are symbols ourselves.

812
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:16,904
I teach and I write poetry
and I lecture at universities.

813
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:20,170
And did you have any occasion
to meet with Abbie Hoffman?

814
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,266
I did.

815
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:25,542
Do you recall what Mr. Hoffman said
in the course of conversation?

816
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:29,085
He said that politics had become
theater and magic, basically,

817
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,883
that it was the manipulation of imagery
through the mass media

818
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:37,187
that was confusing and hypnotizing
the people in the United States.

819
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:40,821
Making them accept a war
which they really didn't believe in.

820
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,923
After he spoke to you,
what, if anything, was your response

821
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,302
to his suggestion?

822
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:45,324
to his suggestion?

823
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,903
Oh, I was worried whether
the whole scene would become violent.

824
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:51,701
I was worried whether the government
would let us do something

825
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,436
- that was funnier, or prettier or...
- Objection.

826
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:55,533
I...

827
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,135
- I sustain the objection.
- I sustain the objection.

828
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,917
That was our conversation, sir.

829
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,645
Mr. Ginsberg, you were named

830
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,712
as kind of a Yippie religious leader,
were you not?

831
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,758
No, not really,
because the word "leader"

832
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,158
was one we really tried
to get away from.

833
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,392
- It was more like a...
- A religious Yippie teacher?

834
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,664
...religious experimenter.
- Oh, experimenter.

835
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:24,797
Now, concerning a number of books
of poetry that you have written.

836
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:28,969
In the <i>Empty Mirror,</i> there is a poem
called "The Night Apple."

837
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,537
Do you believe
you could recite that for the jury?

838
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,311
"The Night Apple.

839
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,319
"Last night I dreamed of one I loved

840
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,584
"For seven long years

841
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,252
"But I saw no face

842
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,525
"Only the familiar presence of the body

843
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,465
"Sweat, skin, eyes

844
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:55,299
"Feces, urine, sperm, saliva

845
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:58,465
"All one odor and mortal taste"

846
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,839
Could you explain to the jury

847
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,880
what the religious significance
of this poem meant?

848
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:09,350
If you would take a wet dream
as a religious experience, I could.

849
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,852
It's a description of a wet dream.

850
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,053
Right. Your Honor,
I have to get some materials

851
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,687
to properly carry on
my cross-examination of this witness.

852
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:24,494
All right, we will go until 2:00.

853
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,069
Your Honor, we asked for five minutes
two days ago

854
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,762
and you refused to give it to us.

855
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:32,069
- You are shouting at the court.
- Oh, Your Honor.

856
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:36,509
I have never shouted at you
during this trial.

857
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,240
Your Honor, your voice has been raised,

858
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,714
- and several times...
- You have been disrespectful.

859
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,409
It is not disrespectful.

860
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,511
And sometimes even worse than that.

861
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,286
Will you step off the witness stand?

862
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,259
He's just trying to calm us both down.

863
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,990
I needed no calming down!

864
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,930
Allen Ginsberg demonstrated
to the court

865
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:02,664
a chant that he uses to calm tensions
and quiet crowds.

866
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,637
It goes, "Um."

867
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,106
When an argument broke out

868
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,801
between defense attorneys
and the judge

869
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,471
about an early recess,
Ginsberg said, "Um."

870
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,775
The judge got mad
and kicked him out of the courtroom.

871
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,851
And there was a running verbal battle
down in the corridors, into the elevator

872
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,886
between the defendants
and the lawyers.

873
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,616
Under cross-examination,
US Attorney Thomas Foran,

874
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:25,127
had Ginsberg read to the jury
three of his most erotic writings.

875
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,718
The jury looked shocked.

876
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,594
It's doubtful that they understood
Ginsberg's explanation

877
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,224
of the religious significance
of those works.

878
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:33,862
- Hello.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

879
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,200
- Yes. Yes. Abbie.
- <i>How are you?</i>

880
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,399
Okay. How was it in court today?

881
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:41,409
There's a whole fascist thing going on
around this trial.

882
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,604
This is the only trial
where you search the hair

883
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,044
before you come in.

884
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,911
I mean,
they have this whole thing downstairs,

885
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,679
if you've got long hair
you don't get in the federal building.

886
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,755
- That must be a relief for you.
- <i>Right. Oh, I'm always pulling that.</i>

887
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,916
I'll say, "Yeah, okay, I'll see you.
You can have my seat.

888
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,086
"Go ahead,
get the next short-haired prisoner."

889
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:03,259
<i>The public starts waiting</i>
<i>about 10:00 at night</i>

890
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,062
<i>outside the federal building</i>
<i>to get into our trial.</i>

891
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:09,468
<i>In Chicago now,</i>
<i>it's about 15 below zero at night.</i>

892
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,199
<i>Gentlemen, what was it like</i>
<i>out here last night?</i>

893
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,242
<i>Cold. Very cold.</i>

894
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,573
- <i>Were you able to get any sleep?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

895
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,738
Have you got anything more with you
than the blanket

896
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:20,247
- that's wrapped around your shoulders?
- Not other than what's on me, no.

897
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,045
If I did, it would be on me.

898
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,416
Is it worth standing out here
in this freezing cold?

899
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:25,886
I think so.

900
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,752
Why? What's the attraction?

901
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:31,486
Well, it's something
that you're not gonna see on television

902
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:35,257
and I'd like to see it,
you know, first-hand.

903
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,698
- How long have you been out here?
- Since about 4:00 this morning.

904
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,032
- Are you pretty cold?
- I'm freezing.

905
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,240
These people are Communists.
I receive intelligence reports.

906
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,869
There is a Communist conspiracy
in which they're involved,

907
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,843
not only in this country, but abroad.

908
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,614
Order in the court. Order in the court.

909
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,450
- Here come the judges.
- All right.

910
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,353
Hey, man, what's up? Good to see you.

911
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,983
- Hey, honey, how you doing?
- Hey, what's up?

912
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:07,996
- Order in the court. Order in the court.
- How you doing there, Counselor?

913
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,693
Oh, you look lovely today, ma'am.
Is that your real hair?

914
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:12,961
You don't need to get up.

915
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,402
May the record show
that the defendants

916
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,669
Hoffman and Rubin came in attired

917
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:23,439
in what might be called
collegiate robes.

918
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,104
That's judge's robes, sir.

919
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,946
Some might even consider them
judicial robes.

920
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,452
Judicial robes, that's right.

921
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:36,685
Your idea, Mr. Kunstler?
Another of your brilliant ideas?

922
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,523
Your Honor,
I can't take the credit for this one.

923
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:42,325
That amazes me.

924
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:45,697
- Take off those robes.
- Off with the robes.

925
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,605
- Off with the robes.
- Off with the robes.

926
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,372
Abbie, I don't want to suggest

927
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,535
that you change your style
or anything like that,

928
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:59,342
but have you ever considered
that maybe saying all these things

929
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:03,146
<i>is antagonizing the judge?</i>
<i>Maybe you should try being nice.</i>

930
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:09,317
Frankly, the only thing
that we and Julius would agree upon is

931
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,620
that we're infantile.

932
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:15,960
I have to reduce myself to being 15
or even seven or eight

933
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,863
confronting my third or fourth grade
English teacher

934
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:22,460
who wants to make me do fucking ovals,
round, round ovals, you know,

935
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,732
for seven hours a day,

936
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,502
you know, when I want
to go out in the schoolyard and play.

937
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,167
That's how I have to relate to him.

938
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,941
And I think our role...
We're kids. It's not us and the kids.

939
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,539
I mean, it's true,
we're some kind of teacher, too,

940
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,381
and our role in the court
is to destroy its authority

941
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,183
and the next generation will come along
and destroy its power.

942
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,559
Conspiracy.

943
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,395
- Bob?
- Yeah.

944
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,830
Did you get Southern? Terry Southern?

945
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,731
- He's not there.
- He's not there?

946
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,770
- He's not there, that's right.
- He's the first witness tomorrow.

947
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,429
He told me yesterday

948
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,030
that he wasn't going to be in
until 8:00 or 9:00 tonight.

949
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,542
No, no.
He was due in at 11:00 this morning.

950
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,475
Here call... I know what, call his hotel...

951
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,877
We called. He's not there.
He hasn't checked in.

952
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,075
How about calling his home
and seeing when he left?

953
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,344
'Cause, see, he's the first witness

954
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,818
and we're really shy
on witnesses tomorrow.

955
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:15,186
We might have to get
Yippie pneumonia or something.

956
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,184
This is Abbie.

957
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,393
Oh, he's in Chicago?

958
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,900
Okay, bye. Okay, I'll see you. Bye.

959
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:32,306
<i>We must have a $2,000 a week</i>
<i>phone bill.</i>

960
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:34,706
<i>Most of our money</i>
<i>we raise by speaking,</i>

961
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,746
<i>which means we have to leave court,</i>
<i>we meet for two hours,</i>

962
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,975
<i>and then people like to fly</i>
<i>around the country to go speak,</i>

963
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:44,520

<i>the honorarium is $1,000."</i>

967
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,786
Yeah, they want to know
if you would speak there

968
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:57,924
for 15, 20 minutes at 10:00 p.m.

969
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,729
- In where?
- In Los Angeles.

970
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,832
<i>We're really taking the issues</i>
<i>of this trial across the country.</i>

971
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:09,139
Especially to the campuses
on weekends and on evenings like this.

972
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,658
And they sold 27,000 tickets
in two days.

973
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,489
<i>How's this for an ego trip?</i>

974
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:30,259
<i>I got a letter today that said,</i>
<i>"Abbie Hoffman, Chicago, Illinois."</i>

975
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:35,835
- <i>That's something, huh?</i>
- <i>That's fame, Abbie. That's immortality.</i>

976
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,605
<i>Accused of conspiracy,</i>
<i>we call ourselves The Conspiracy.</i>

977
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,406
<i>We answer the telephone,</i>
<i>"This is The Conspiracy."</i>

978
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,546
<i>Dig it. They accuse us of inciting to riot.</i>

979
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,087
<i>It's impossible to incite to riot.</i>
<i>If somebody wants to riot, he riots.</i>

980
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:55,624
<i>Malcolm X put it well. He said,</i>
<i>"I didn't come here to get you</i>

981
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,818
<i>"to do anything</i>

982
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,725

<i>are we going to be strong enough,</i>

983
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,129
<i>powerful enough, brave enough,</i>
<i>together enough</i>

984
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:07,498
<i>to survive as a generation</i>
<i>and change this country?</i>

985

David Dellinger.

986
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,870
All right, thanks.

987
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:18,575
We are the future of this country,

<i>All power to the people. Right on, do it.</i>

01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,666
- Can you tell us what it was?
- I'll give you an exhibit.

1036
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,739
There were several of these
thrown at police officers.

1037
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,932
Would you describe that?

1038
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:38,276
Yes, it's a golf ball, a practice ball
that has many spikes through it.

1039
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,653
<i>I take one look at the troops in Vietnam,</i>

1040
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,621
<i>I know what America's</i>
<i>foreign policy is about.</i>

1041
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:51,819
<i>America now is the America</i>
<i>of the Democratic Party.</i>

1042
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,726
<i>Most of us here didn't come</i>
<i>to support McCarthy.</i>

1043
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,157
- The guards!
- <i>The troops are out.</i>

1044
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,361
- The guards!
- <i>Troops are out.</i>

1045
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,744
- Peace now! Peace now!
- Peace now! Peace now!

1046
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,683
- Peace now! Peace now!
- Peace now! Peace now!

1047
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:54,347
- Peace now! Peace now!
- Peace now! Peace now!

1048
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,583
<i>This is Gore Vidal here.</i>

1049
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,162
<i>Isn't it wonderful to be in a free country</i>

1050
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,960
<i>where we can speak</i>
<i>in front of bayonets?</i>

1051
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,394
<i>We are faced with</i>
<i>a situation here today</i>

1052
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,030
<i>where the enemy appears</i>
<i>to be the troops</i>

1053
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,577
<i>that are now facing the demonstrators,</i>
<i>surrounding them.</i>

1054
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,272
<i>We don't see the troops as our enemy.</i>

1055
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:24,176
<i>... this orderly selection</i>
<i>of gentlemen here that is behind you.</i>

1056
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,481
<i>You should bear in mind</i>

1057
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,853
<i>that just as soon</i>
<i>as they get those uniforms off,</i>

1058
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,018
<i>a very goodly number of them</i>
<i>will join you.</i>

1059
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:37,132
<i>Everybody sit down and let's sing.</i>

1060
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:42,068
<i>Sit down and sing to the soldiers.</i>
<i>Let's see if they can hear us.</i>

1061
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,634
- <i>This land is your land</i>
- <i>This land is your land</i>

1062
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:48,801
- <i>This land is my land</i>
- <i>This land is my land</i>

1063
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:52,105
- <i>From California</i>
- <i>From California</i>

1064
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:55,047
- <i>To the New York Island</i>
- <i>To the New York Island</i>

1065

- <i>From the redwood forest</i>
- <i>From the redwood forest</i>

1066
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,555
- <i>To the Gulf Stream waters</i>
- <i>To the Gulf Stream waters</i>

1067
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,354
- <i>This land was made for you and me</i>
- <i>This land was made for you and me</i>

1068
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:10,125
<i>One more, this time,</i>
<i>to everybody who is listening,</i>

1069
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:15,693
<i>not to disregard these young people</i>
<i>who are the hope for the...</i>

1070
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:30,709
<i>The reality of American society</i>

1071
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,755
<i>is daring us to take a step.</i>

1072
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:36,256
<i>But we are going to take the step.</i>

1073
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,927
<i>We are going to gather here,</i>

1074
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:45,057
<i>we are going to make our way</i>
<i>to the Amphitheater,</i>

1075
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,998
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

1076
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:54,709
As you probably know, today is
the National Vietnam Moratorium.

1077
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,779
The purpose of the Moratorium is,
in essence,

1078
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:03,443
to protest the continuation of the war

1079
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:08,285
and to urge the withdrawal
of American forces in Vietnam.

1080
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:12,487
I myself, and I'm sure all of us,

1081
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,223
and all of you, are simply staggered

1082
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:19,027
by the thought of what the life
of a single person

1083
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:22,366
needlessly slaughtered
in Vietnam means.

1084
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:27,566
So, we will read the names of those
who were killed in the war this week.

1085
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:33,070
Michael Edward Adams, Grand City.

1086
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:37,210
Robert Charles, of Chicago.

1087
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:42,821
Ron Charles Allen, South Beloit.

1088
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,586
Howard Lloyd Elm, Earl, Illinois.

1089
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:50,164
- Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
- Henry A. Holmes...

1090
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,290
- The honorable judge...
...Chicago.

1091
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,233
...of the United States district court
is present.

1092
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:57,305
The court is now in session.

1093
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:01,103
Mr. Hoffman,
we are observing the Moratorium.

1094
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,304
I am Judge Hoffman, sir.

1095
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:08,941
I believe in equality, sir,
so I prefer to call people "Mister"

1096
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:12,543
- or by their first names.
- You will sit down, sir.

1097
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:14,748
- Can I be heard, Your Honor?
- Your Honor, I object

1098
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:17,325
- to this man speaking out in court.
- We would just like to propose

1099
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,257
- a moment of silence.
- You needn't object.

1100
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:23,457
I forbid him to disrupt the proceedings.

1101
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,535
Your Honor,
I want to object to Mr. Foran's yelling

1102
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,796
in the presence of the jury.
Your Honor has admonished

1103
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:29,438
- the defense counsel...
- Your Honor, this is outrageous.

1104
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,496
- the defense counsel...
- Your Honor, this is outrageous.

1105
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:35,737
This man is a mouthpiece! Look at him.
He's wearing an armband of his clients.

1106
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,109
The government protests his attitude

1107
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:42,275
and requests the court move
to take notice of his conduct!

1108
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:46,218
Your Honor, I think that the temper
and the expression

1109
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:50,053
on Mr. Foran's face speaks
more than any picture could tell.

1110
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,356
- Of my contempt for Mr. Kunstler!
- Mr. Kunstler...

1111
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,895
To call me a mouthpiece...

1112
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:55,964
- Jesus Christ!
...and for Your Honor

1113
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:59,033
not to open his mouth and say
that's not to be done in your court,

1114
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,865
I think, violates the sanctity of this court.

1115
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,930
That is a word Your Honor knows
is contemptuous and contumacious.

1116
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,566
Don't tell me what I know.

1117
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,144
I want him admonished, Your Honor,

1118
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,714
- and I request you to do that.
- I do not admonish

1119
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,646
the United States attorney

1120
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:18,686
because he was properly
representing his client,

1121
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,618
the United States of America.

1122
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,953
To call another attorney a mouthpiece?

1123
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:29,622
You, a lawyer, permitting your client
to stand up in the presence of the jury

1124
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:31,927
and disrupt these proceedings...

1125
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,728
I don't know how to characterize it.

1126
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,831
Your Honor, we do not permit,
or not permit, our clients.

1127
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:43,173
They are free,
independent human beings

1128
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,246
who have been brought

1129
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:45,973
- by the government to this courtroom.
- That's right.

1130
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:50,279
They're free,
but they'll conform to the law

1131
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:54,482
and they'll conform to the direction
of the court here, sir.

1132
01:09:54,590 --> 01:10:00,859
- Are you turning down my request?
- I not only turn it down, I ignore it.

1133
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,430
That speaks louder than words.

1134
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,098
<i>The crowd of</i>
<i>about 10,000 anti-war protesters</i>

1135
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:13,608
<i>finally got a permit today to hold a rally</i>
<i>in the Band Shell area of Grant Park.</i>

1136
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,545
<i>Police performed the menial task</i>
<i>of passing out handbills</i>

1137
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,740
<i>telling the demonstrators that a permit</i>
<i>for their rally had been granted,</i>

1138
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:24,751
<i>quote, "In the interest of free speech</i>
<i>and assembly" end quote.</i>

1139
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,844
<i>The handbills also said that no permit</i>

1140
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:29,254
<i>for a march to the Amphitheater</i>
<i>had been granted</i>

1141
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:32,418
<i>and that demonstrators would get</i>
<i>nowhere but to a jail cell</i>

1142
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,688
<i>if they tried to march.</i>

1143
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,787
Why did you come to the rally
in the first place?

1144
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:39,356
We're sympathetic with these people
and their feelings.

1145
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:43,598
<i>Are you and these other, as you put it,</i>
<i>beautiful people looking for trouble?</i>

1146
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:46,607
<i>No, I think we all recognize</i>
<i>that we don't have a chance</i>

1147
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:49,769
against bayonets,
clubs, guns and tear gas.

1148
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,745
We're unarmed
and most of us are nonviolent.

1149
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,442
Do you intend to stay on here
if there's trouble?

1150
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,777
No, we'll run very fast.

1151
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:04,355
<i>I've just got word</i>
<i>from the Chicago Police</i>

1152
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:09,124
<i>that there are 15,000 people</i>
<i>in this park right now.</i>

1153
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,894
<i>And under these circumstances,</i>
<i>I think that's pretty great.</i>

1154
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:21,132
<i>Now, let me tell you what we have</i>
<i>planned for this afternoon.</i>

1155
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,973
<i>We're going to hear</i>
<i>from a few speakers</i>

1156
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,539
<i>and then, as discussed,</i>
<i>I will be leading a nonviolent march</i>

1157
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:32,052
<i>down to the Democratic Convention</i>
<i>at the Amphitheater.</i>

1158
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:37,685
<i>We will be prepared for arrest</i>
<i>if that's what is going to happen.</i>

1159
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:42,263
<i>But we believe</i>
<i>that the power of the people is a permit,</i>

1160
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:45,561
<i>and we hope that the city will let us go.</i>

1161
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,864
<i>All right, our first speaker</i>

1162
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:54,409
<i>will be the Youth International Party's</i>
<i>Jerry Rubin.</i>

1163
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:01,415
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the most important convention</i>

1164
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:05,078
<i>that is going on in this city. Yeah!</i>

1165
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,187
<i>Right now I'm ready to go to jail.</i>

1166
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:14,922
<i>I'm ready to get clubbed on the head.</i>
<i>I'm ready to die to change this country.</i>

1167
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:20,231
<i>We come here to express</i>
<i>our point of view</i>

1168
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,861
<i>about the Convention,</i>
<i>and what do we have?</i>

1169
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,963
<i>Twenty-four hours a day,</i>
<i>seven days a week,</i>

1170
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,667
<i>we've got a fucking armed camp.</i>

1171
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,074
<i>You know what I say? Fuck them!</i>

1172
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:41,879
<i>They announced that this would be</i>
<i>the most secure convention</i>

1173
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,424
<i>in the history of the country.</i>

1174
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:48,792
<i>They have no respect</i>
<i>for organized protest.</i>

1175
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:52,389
<i>The gas falls on all of us</i>

1176
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:59,236
<i>and it is time for us to begin to show</i>
<i>a little bit of contempt</i>

1177
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,434
<i>and a little bit of resistance</i>

1178
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,910
<i>because that is all</i>
<i>that they are showing us.</i>

1179
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:14,285
<i>At this point we will begin</i>
<i>to assemble peacefully</i>

1180
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:18,326
<i>for a nonviolent march</i>
<i>to the Amphitheater.</i>

1181
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,054
<i>We have got to go.</i>

1182
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,932
A little faster in the front.

1183
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:30,067
<i>All right, we're just keeping our cool,</i>
<i>moving out here.</i>

1184
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,369
<i>There's a tremendous crowd</i>
<i>and we want the people in the back</i>

1185
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:37,275
<i>to be able to form</i>
<i>into orderly lines also.</i>

1186
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,108
<i>We'd like not to have</i>

1187
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:43,014
<i>too many people massed in front</i>
<i>or the side.</i>

1188
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,552
<i>We're trying to have an orderly march,</i>
<i>eight abreast.</i>

1189
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:48,088
<i>It looks to me like we're many more</i>
<i>than eight abreast.</i>

1190
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:52,684
<i>Now, if we do get</i>
<i>into a confrontation situation...</i>

1191
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,922
I want to request again, demand again

1192
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,294
that I be able
to cross-examine the witness.

1193
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,959
Now, you have Benjamin Franklin
and George Washington

1194
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,559
sitting in pictures behind you
and they were slave owners,

1195
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:04,332
that's what they were.
They owned slaves.

1196
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,671
And you are acting in the same manner
by denying me my constitutional right.

1197
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:12,008
- Young man, if you keep this up...
- Look, old man, you're being exposed

1198
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,172
to the public and to the world

1199
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,750
- that you don't...
- Have him sit down, Mr. Marshal.

1200
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,318
I want to defend myself!

1201
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:20,820
I have the right to speak
on behalf of my constitutional rights.

1202
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:26,190
I didn't think I would ever live to sit...

1203
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,923
To sit on a bench in a courtroom

1204
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:35,129
where George Washington
was assailed by a defendant

1205
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:39,867
and a judge was criticized
for having his portrait on the wall.

1206
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,808
The law protects my right
not to be discriminated against.

1207
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:47,905
- Why don't you recognize that?
- Mr. Seale! Do you want to stop?

1208
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,280
- Or do you want me to direct...
- You can't deny me my rights!

1209
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,546
You can't deny me
my constitutional rights!

1210
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:57,682
Take that defendant
into the room in there

1211
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:01,194
and deal with him
as he should be dealt with.

1212
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,958
I still want to be represented.
I want to represent myself!

1213
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:08,230
Let me go! I want to represent myself.
It's my constitutional right.

1214
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:11,238
I got a right! I got a right! I got a right!

1215
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,071
<i>If anybody's interfering with our rights,</i>

1216
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,838
<i>we're going to take</i>
<i>this peacefully and orderly.</i>

1217
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:34,018
<i>I would like a chance to speak</i>
<i>to the commanding officer, please.</i>

1218
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,955
<i>Are you the commanding officer?</i>

1219
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,393
I'm David Dellinger,
National Mobilization.

1220
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:49,426
We wanted to communicate peacefully
from here to the Amphitheater.

1221
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:51,935
There will be no march.
There will be no march.

1222
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,871
There's no permit to march.

1223
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,275
Well, we believe it's not necessary
to have a permit.

1224
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,973
There will be no march today.
That's our order.

1225
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:01,982
We would like to have a reason

1226
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,712
so that that could be communicated
to the world.

1227
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,412
There will be no march today.

1228
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:51,365
Your Honor, if Mr. Seale would express
to the court his willingness to be quiet,

1229
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,498
will the court entertain the possibility

1230
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:58,232
of Mr. Seale being unbound
and ungagged?

1231
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:03,243
Mr. Seale, if you will assure the court

1232
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,245
that you will be respectful

1233
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:10,546
and conduct yourself in a manner
that is gentlemanly,

1234
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:12,415
then I am willing to allow you

1235
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:16,514
to resume your former place
at the table.

1236
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,990
Will you, sir?

1237
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,084
I would like to speak

1238
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:25,064
- on behalf of my constitutional right.
- If you will give me your assurance,

1239
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:30,537
will you please indicate
by raising your head up and down?

1240
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:37,370
Mr. Marshal, I don't think
you have accomplished your purpose

1241
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,845
by that contrivance.

1242
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,712
...I would freely express my...
- We will take another recess.

1243
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:46,276
I want to speak
on behalf of my constitutional right!

1244
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,049
You can't deny me my rights.

1245
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,125
You can't deny me
my constitutional right!

1246
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:55,786
<i>All right, now we're continuing</i>
<i>to maintain our cool.</i>

1247
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:02,404
<i>We have been told by a captain</i>
<i>that there will be no march today.</i>

1248
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,668
<i>When we asked him why,</i>

1249
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:08,869
<i>he said, "Those are the orders.</i>
<i>There will be no march today."</i>

1250
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,069
<i>We're stubborn bastards.</i>

1251
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:13,739
<i>We may be nonviolent,</i>
<i>but we're stubborn.</i>

1252
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,146
Yes, yeah. I just want to get them out of
here so they won't do anything to them.

1253
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,718
Get your hands off me.

1254
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,623
Go! Come on now. Go! Go!
Just roll them over!

1255
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,599
Roll up the window and go, ma'am, go!
Come on now, go.

1256
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:14,039
<i>Negotiations at the front of the march</i>
<i>have not produced anything so far,</i>

1257
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,404
<i>negotiation with the police.</i>

1258
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,604
<i>Two Mobilization representatives</i>
<i>have gone to talk</i>

1259
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,238
<i>to negotiate with people higher up</i>
<i>in the administration,</i>

1260
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,374
<i>perhaps Daley,</i>
<i>though that is not confirmed.</i>

1261
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,854
Well, we're right in the middle
of negotiating about a decision

1262
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,252
as to where we're going to go.

1263
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,756
- Are you going to get out of here?
- I think we will.

1264
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,053
You think they'll let you march?

1265
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,958
I think that we will be able
to proceed further.

1266
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:37,763
<i>And so it is our opinion</i>

1267
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:42,394
<i>that we should regroup</i>
<i>at the Hilton Hotel.</i>

1268
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,938
<i>We are not being arrested here,</i>

1269
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,908
<i>so we will proceed to the Hilton Hotel</i>
<i>to regroup.</i>

1270
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,702
Man, please.

1271
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:18,534
If Your Honor please.
The buckles on the leather strap

1272
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,337
that's holding Mr. Seale's hand
are digging into his hand.

1273
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,536
Could he be assisted?

1274
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:30,243
If the Marshal has concluded
that he needs assistance, of course.

1275
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:33,116
Your Honor, are we going
to stop the medieval torture

1276
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,451
that's going on in this courtroom?

1277
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,219
This is no longer a court of order,
Your Honor.

1278
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,351
This is an unholy disgrace.

1279
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:43,090
- Created by Mr. Kunstler!
- Created by nothing

1280
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:45,132
other than what you have done
to this man.

1281
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,064
Judge, you come down here
and watch this.

1282
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,430
- Fascist dogs!
- Your Honor,

1283
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:50,663
- he's being choked to death.
- You low-life son of a bitch!

1284
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,171
Somebody protect him!

1285
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,764
Your Honor, may the record show that

1286
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,105
that comment was made
by Mr. Dellinger?

1287
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,611
You fucking fascist pigs! Fascist pigs.

1288
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:03,844
- And that was Mr. Rubin speaking.
- Everything you say will be taken down.

1289
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,386
It's cruel,
cruel and unusual punishment.

1290
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,284
You're a fascist dog, Judge.

1291
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,255
Why don't you just kill him
if you're going to gag him?

1292
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:11,757
I mean, doesn't it seem that way?

1293
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,421
You are not permitted
to address the court, Mr. Hoffman.

1294
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:18,294
This is not a court. It's a neon oven.

1295
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:22,432
This whole thing started
when these guys got into overkill.

1296
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:25,097
It's the same thing
as last year in Chicago!

1297
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:26,798
It's the exact same thing!

1298
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,387
<i>Two blocks north,</i>
<i>there's an open bridge.</i>

1299
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:50,157
<i>Two blocks north,</i>
<i>there's an open bridge.</i>

1300
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:55,162
<i>Go north on Michigan then over</i>
<i>to the Conrad Hilton to get through.</i>

1301
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:57,771
<i>You go directly across</i>
<i>the National Guard troops</i>

1302
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:00,397
<i>blocking the way with machine guns.</i>

1303
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,941
You're not alive.
You're a dead person with no feelings.

1304
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,809
And you call me a long-haired freak.

1305
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:10,043
But that's what this is all about,
you know? The compassion.

1306
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,018
Do you men ever stop to think
or do you obey blindly?

1307
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,816
State-ordered machines.

1308
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:35,770
Kill! Kill!

1309
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,276
- Kill!
- Hey, kill. Come on.

1310
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,006
- Come on, kill!
- Come on!

1311
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:41,241
- Come on, I'm over here.
- Kill, shoot, come on.

1312
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,580
- Just shoot. Use those things.
- Come on, shoot to kill.

1313
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,744
- Kill!
- Shoot to kill!

1314
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:46,821
- Kill!
- Kill!

1315
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,980
- Kill! Come on!
- Come on, shoot.

1316
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,580
Kill! That's it, spray him, get him.

1317
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,730
Watch the gas!

1318
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,825
Watch it, boys. Cover your face.

1319
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,130
Cover your face.

1320
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,240
The cans, watch the cans!

1321
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,437
Jesus Christ.

1322
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,207
Be careful, they're kids.

1323
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,209
Let's get water.

1324
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:32,290
- Don't run!
- Don't run! Don't run! Don't run!

1325
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,560
Don't run!

1326
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:36,660
<i>You people... You people on the street.</i>

1327
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:42,209
<i>Don't get trapped by the cops</i>
<i>and don't play games with them.</i>

1328
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,108
<i>'Cause they're not playing games</i>
<i>with us.</i>

1329
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,108
<i>Stay together. Stay together.</i>

1330
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:54,052
<i>Don't let them stop you,</i>
<i>don't let them provoke you,</i>

1331
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,589
<i>don't let them catch you alone.</i>

1332
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:13,274
- Join us! Join us! Join us!
- Join us! Join us! Join us!

1333
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:16,241
- Join us! Join us! Join us!
- Join us! Join us! Join us!

1334
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:38,365
Let's hold on
and see what happens here.

1335
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,461
Cut him off! Cut him off!

1336
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,306
- He got him!
- He got him, he got him.

1337
01:25:58,319 --> 01:25:59,752
<i>Get behind the mule train</i>

1338
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,879
<i>so you can follow it</i>
<i>right to the Amphitheater.</i>

1339
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,959
<i>There's an illegitimate convention</i>
<i>being held there.</i>

1340
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,816
<i>Shoot the Bar Mace,</i>
<i>you fucking jackoff.</i>

1341
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:42,385
- Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!
- Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!

1342
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:45,762
- Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!
- Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!

1343
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:51,237
- Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!
- Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!

1344
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:54,399
- Watch it. The cops are coming.
- It's the cops.

1345
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:08,213
If you want the street, take it!

1346
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:24,270
Watch it. The cops are coming now.

1347
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,460
Come on, move it! Get out of here!

1348
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:38,504
You prick ass motherfucking chump,
you ain't shit!

1349
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:53,360
Mace, mace, mace.

1350
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:56,555
Spray in my face, and I'll kill you.

1351
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,402
Up against the wall, motherfucker.

1352
01:29:58,593 --> 01:29:59,560
Open them up.

1353
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:06,099
<i>We shall overcome</i>

1354
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,499
<i>We shall overcome</i>

1355
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:10,571
Peace.

1356
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,442
Get in here.

1357
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,259
There's nothing else.
There's not our daddies.

1358
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:39,560
There's no one else. It's us.

1359
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:41,393
We're the only people

1360
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:43,060
that can protect ourselves
from genocide

1361
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:45,867
and protect all of us on trial
and everyone else on trial.

1362
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,736
And I have no program on what to do.

1363
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,276
I think it's wrong for someone to get up
and say, "Tell us what to do,"

1364
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:52,140
'cause you know what to do,

1365
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,441
you know where you are,
you know what's effective.

1366
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:55,914
And you know that across the country

1367
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,211
there are people like you
who are ready to act.

1368
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:01,117
And they don't need no leader
telling them what to do,

1369
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:03,156
'cause we're all leaders.

1370
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,251
They don't need anyone giving orders.

1371
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:08,419
They don't even need anyone
giving instructions.

1372
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:16,330
And I can tell you
that all eight of us are going to jail

1373
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:20,737
with that view of history,

1374
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:22,707
with that view of the future.

1375
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,710
And we're all going to jail smiling

1376
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:27,440
'cause we know damn well
that the people in this room

1377
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:31,040
are going to break the jail down
and free us! Thank you.

1378
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:07,537
<i>With all these people here,</i>
<i>I think the most appropriate,</i>

1379
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:10,845
<i>very human, revolutionary</i>
<i>thing to first say,</i>

1380
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:15,007
<i>like we always say, is,</i>
<i>"All power to the people."</i>

1381
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,049
