00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,801
AUGUST EIGHTH

2
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:34,317
Mrakovlast, I came back
Magic Dust people!

3
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,508
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

4
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:27,971
The magic dust is mine!

5
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,974
Hence, we will fight!

6
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,602
Ha-ha-ha!

7
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:37,275
Kosmoboy wants to fight
with Mrakovlastom alone?

8
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:39,945
Yes.

9
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,864
Kosmoboy, I'm here!

10
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:44,033
Oh! Oh!

11
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,211
Erase its boiling snot.
I have a friend Kosmoboya!

12
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,338
Oh well!

13
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,641
(Growls)

14
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:13,613
Just a little bit, and we are not maps.

15
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:15,533
I can handle

16
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:22,458
To me! Fetch!

17
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,643
Already very dangerous Kosmoboy.
Team.

18
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:38,437
Blow out the engines!

19
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,356
There blow the engine!

20
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,618
Countdown!

21
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,497
- Five.
- Mark!

22
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:55,418
Four. Three.

23
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,253
- Two.
- Cool!

24
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,090
One. Let's go!

25
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,015
(Mrakovlast laughs)

26
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:12,231
For our tail.

27
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:13,608
Get ready for the attack.

28
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,610
Coup!

29
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,742
Fire! Rather water.

30
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:43,772
I lose control.
We're falling, falling, falling!

31
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:05,634
Whoa!

32
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:08,220
Oh! We like to cuddle? On you!

33
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,650
Kosmoboy!

34
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,830
No!

35
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:41,889
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

36
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,080
No. The Magic Dust
useful to yourself.

37
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:03,041
I'm just a piece of iron.

38
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,211
So what, you piece of iron!

39
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,715
You're my friend,
I will not leave you!

40
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,603
Do not open!

41
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:20,062
Spell!

42
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:22,859
Mom, this is my favorite scene.

43
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:26,071
Aza-mizi-MAZ-

44
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:29,284
Amaravati, Chandrika!

45
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,499
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!

46
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:41,758
Wow!

47
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:46,556
<i> friend and I - we are together! 

48
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:52,689
<i> In a way, we take a song, 

49
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:59,781
<i> And in a dream a beautiful ... 

50
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:03,787
<i> impregnation, your mother!
Zakharovna, I'll kill you. 

51
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,667
<i> Together! 

52
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:20,308
Imagine, today, one
the dragon's head on fire.

53
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,311
The truth is that right?

54
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:25,982
Mom, I f you MMSku sent.
Do not you ever received?

55
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:30,905
The topic I wanted to with you a very
talk seriously about ...

56
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,616
And what is this?

57
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,995
It ... It's candy.

58
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,291
Yegor presented.
It is really very good.

59
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,669
You're late because of it.

60
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,466
However, for me it is very important
you to be loved of Yegor,

61
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:49,638
because, perhaps,
If Yegor love us,

62
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:53,351
he will live with us.
That would be cool, huh?

63
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:56,730
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!

64
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:59,859
Do you see?
For us being chased by evil robot!

65
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:04,198
However, it's just a truck.

66
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,743
No, it's evil robot.

67
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,317
It happens. Many of the boys
there are new pope.

68
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:36,156
Stop hiding behind their robots,
when you do not like something.

69
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,577
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

70
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:41,830
Do you even hear
what I'm telling you?

71
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:44,250
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

72
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:45,961
(Truck signals)

73
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:52,719
You have two days as from the hospital,
and going to whitewash the kitchen ceiling?

74
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:57,309
Two days! You doctor
restricted to strain.

75
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,689
What kind of stairs, my mother?

76
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:06,612
So, give me the other day vacation
I will come and he'll do anything.

77
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:10,534
And Freud says that a person
ceases to depend on their parents ...

78
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,829
to achieve them
age of five.

79
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:18,294
Yes, the food is good. Take care of yourself.

80
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:19,878
Aha. Yet.

81
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,385
Bad.

82
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,431
Not in time, devils, at the wrong time.

83
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,561
- So, you work in a bank?
- Yes.

84
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,607
The investment bank.
to be exact.

85
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,276
Thank you very much.

86
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,237
And you finished?

87
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:40,948
Moscow Academy of
business and management.

88
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:44,453
- And, of course.
- My mother taught at the university.

89
00:09:44,537 --> 00:09:46,539
Where are you, by the way the girl called.

90
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:51,504
A man is that? Books?
From Tolstoy's not much better.

91
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:54,925
In any case, could
basic knowledge to get there.

92
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:59,055
And here I am, you know, something to the knowledge
not stretched. Business more interesting.

93
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,270
And how much you earn
at your bank?

94
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,230
Mom!

95
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,818
Xenia, in my time such a question
was not considered obscene.

96
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,111
So what?

97
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:12,531
- It play the fool.
- Nothing, nothing.

98
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,745
I am well paid.

99
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,458
However, at present
Moscow prices and ...

100
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:24,463
Especially at high cost
Rest in Sochi.

101
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,108
Well Vrej him.

102
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,141
Well, buddy, all you laughing,
laughing, and eating bad, huh?

103
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:10,106
I'm evil robot!

104
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,944
- Theme, how could you!
- I'm sorry. Excuse me, please.

105
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:16,614
- Mom, I accidentally.
- Subject, apologize quickly!

106
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,159
- In order to everything. Nothing.
- Forgive me, please.

107
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,078
Apologize immediately. Sorry.
(Phone rings)

108
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:22,872
I'm not on purpose, I swear!

109
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:25,918
- Well it is! a?
- You to the phone, Xenia.

110
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,841
Hello?

111
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:34,512
Wait, wait. Do not hang up.
Xenia, listen to me.

112
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:38,559
Saur, I can not talk right now.
Can not do. Absolutely.

113
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:44,025
My parents do not last forever.
They must sometimes see with my grandson.

114
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:48,530
Let me take leave for a couple of
weeks to stay with Temko.

115
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:50,867
We have an incredible beauty of the countryside.

116
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:56,124
Saur, there is very, very dangerous.

117
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,794
And now everywhere is dangerous, Xenia.

118
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:02,757
We have been here 20 years as a
dangerous, but we live somehow.

119
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:05,552
And in Moscow is not dangerous, or what?

120
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,679
- Yes, yes.
- Well.

121
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:11,393
A guy should at least once a year
mountain air to breathe, eh?

122
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:15,148
Listen, the next day arrives
here is my friend Ilya.

123
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:18,361
It can take a theme to the Beslan
and then I meet him,

124
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,073
and we toss in our Sidamontu.

125
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,285
A Xenia? Ksenia?

126
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:27,496
Well? A?

127
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,383
You can go through?

128
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:40,013
Get out of the house! Angry Robot
does not let you!

129
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:41,265
If I had let go,

130
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,645
promise me that you send
it back at the slightest ...

131
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,814
Lord, thank you!

132
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,360
You send it back,
put on a plane ...

133
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,446
the first word I say.

134
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,077
Op-pa!

135
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:59,830
Let me go! What are you doing?

136
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,834
Listen, and she come, eh?

137
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,127
I beg you.

138
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,090
In our village a cow calved.

139
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,972
Remember how you loved
young calves to touch his nose?

140
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,019
I beg you, Xenia. Come.

141
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:17,521
Let your friend call me.

142
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:19,899
And remember: with anyone
I did not send a child.

143
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:40,926
Xenia?

144
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,932
Ilya? A Saur did not tell me
that you are a soldier.

145
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:49,061
So it is almost
no more civilian friends.

146
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:56,071
Recently been in the mountains with his
parents - there is a beauty.

147
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:59,367
According to her grandson when they are bored.

148
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:04,665
Look. Here's a new friend,
fly with you.

149
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:07,293
You take it with you?

150
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,964
I am friends with only robots.

151
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:18,641
Here is my mobile number.
I'll call as soon as we land.

152
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,437
Do not worry you so
everything will be fine.

153
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:25,192
Oh! See, even the President
Our vacation flew.

154
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:34,203
Well, captain, take me to
from a fight with robots?

155
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,892
You do not want to go?

156
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:54,062
Let's not going anywhere?
Everything went home.

157
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:58,068
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!

158
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:00,362
I love you very much.

159
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,365
And I love you too very much!

160
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,180
(Businessmen laugh)

161
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:27,230
Oh! Hey.
What are you doing here?

162
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:31,611
I wanted to see the look on your eyes,
I'll tell you news.

163
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:32,821
Well?

164
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:36,617
I can not tonight ...

165
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:41,624
I can tonight
fly away with you in Sochi.

166
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,252
Yes! Yes! Yes!

167
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:49,134
I just sent a Topic
to his father and ...

168
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,118
Come on.

169
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,784
- Hello.
- Mom, are you?

170
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:44,580
But I do Temko apples
brought from the country. What are you?

171
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,167
And I'm going to Sochi Yegor.

172
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:49,587
A theme?

173
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:53,676
Wait a minute, and where the topic?

174
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:56,262
I sent the theme to his father.

175
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:03,021
Whatever it was,
he did his father and has the right.

176
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,819
Are you crazy!
You do not watch TV?

177
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:09,404
They passed that day,

178
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:12,533
that the concentration of troops
and almost on the border war.

179
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:14,703
- What?
- What?

180
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:18,458
Are you due to its Yegor
You see nothing at all.

181
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:22,129
That is.

182
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,802
Sit down and watch.

183
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,063
(Mobile phones)

184
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:37,858
Xenia, hello.

185
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,361
Saur, listen to me, please.

186
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,697
What happened? Who hurt you?

187
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:46,995
Right now you have to put theme
on a plane and send it back.

188
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,580
Why not? What is it?

189
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:51,416
Immediately. Said,
Now the war begins.

190
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:54,630
Xenia, calm down.
They are 150 years old is already talking about.

191
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:56,131
But now all seriously.

192
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:58,051
Listen, I know what they're saying

193
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,262
But now there is no mad
start a war.

194
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,764
Subject feels here
great,

195
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,474
and you can not imagine
as he is all excited.

196
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,186
Topic! Topic! Go here.
Mum. Mum.

197
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,022
Say "hello" mom.

198
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:09,482
- Mom, hello!
- Topic!

199
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,193
Well see how well?

200
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:13,154
Saur, you promised me!

201
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:17,451
Xenia, I beg you.
What am I going to tell my parents?

202
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:20,663
What should I send them to his grandson
back, because his mom ...

203
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,459
went to the roof, and she decided
Now that the war begins?

204
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:25,962
But it's not I thought this government.

205
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:29,800
Xenia, is another
provocation, I tell you.

206
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:32,178
Send a private message home, please!

207
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:37,143
You know what? You are hysterical.
Again the same thing.

208
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:38,979
You do not want to listen
what you say

209
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,232
and do not want to know when
You want to explain everything.

210
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:44,736
The theme is nice and peaceful,
and I did not send it back.

211
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,488
Do not post!

212
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:51,286
Hello? Zaur?

213
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,122
Well?

214
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:55,625
He says everything is in order.

215
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,878
(Sounds of shooting,
Mobile phones)

216
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:00,548
However, in your backpack
the phone rings.

217
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,344
I'll take it.

218
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,930
And call it the war ..

219
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,437
What we're fighting for something
with each other?

220
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:14,608
<i> subscriber unit is switched off or
is outside the coverage area. 

221
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,194
Xenia.

222
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:19,239
So what? Well, he's there,
in the peacekeeping forces.

223
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,033
But he also knows better!

224
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,705
You can hear herself?
Fly back to take away theme home.

225
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:28,543
Why did you move when my
personal life begins to build?

226
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,587
Do you want me to be a
remains, how are you?

227
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:33,591
Egor is about to make
me an offer.

228
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:36,553
He is a very serious
concerns me.

229
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:38,890
Where are you calling from?

230
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:43,938
I order a ticket. You go to their Sochi
I fly for the theme itself.

231
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:58,039
Hey. Why are you so early for?

232
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:00,000
Theme. I sent him
in South Ossetia

233
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:02,044
and there was about to start a war.
- Xenia.

234
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:03,713
And my mom says I should go,
I do not know what to do.

235
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,716
- Xenia.
- Well what can I do?

236
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,552
Well, what can you do?

237
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:10,347
If you really start a war
nothing you can do.

238
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:12,391
I suggest an option.
Let's go to Sochi, and I think so.

239
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:14,519
that without your involvement
everything will be fine.

240
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,271
And if not?

241
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:18,941
The second option.
This is your marital problems, and I ...

242
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,695
But my problem - it's part of me.

243
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:24,574
It's part of you, which,
I forgive you too, please

244
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,743
I do not want to have the slightest cause.

245
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:29,580
But I ask your help.

246
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:31,791
Xenia ... Hello

247
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,211
Let's go for some coffee, huh?

248
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:37,048
Listen, you're very
like you as a person.

249
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,177
But you're acting like a little
baby, I promise.

250
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,514
All the time I
You learn something.

251
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:45,976
And even engage in sex.
Solve your problems ... personal

252
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:48,146
What-what you taught me?

253
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:52,318
Oh well. Opened up new
horizons of an intimate relationship.

254
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:53,737
Is that better?

255
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:56,030
What, right here and so
picked up and opened?

256
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:59,244
Listen, can you say
anything, but it's true.

257
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:05,043
But you ... You think so because
I want you to think.

258
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,630
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

259
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:10,967
- What's all this here is your ...
- These are my - what?

260
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:15,139
Well, what is it? Not really?
Pretending? I do not think so.

261
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:17,517
I always know when to pretend.

262
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,937
Of course, of course.

263
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:23,358
Yes, of course. Always.

264

What is your booking number?

275
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:14,711
I myself will fly this topic.

276
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:30,732
Saur, a scoundrel, take it up.

277
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,969
I'm sorry.
When is the next on Tskhinvali?

278

And why not?

280

00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:20,888
(Sing a song Ossetian)

336
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,594
Hey! Wait, you say! Stop!

337
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:26,139
Rocket!

338
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:41,033
Help!

339
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,045
There's a turn ahead!
Just go into the abyss!

340
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,089
Help!

341
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,887
Artem!

342
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:39,567
Okay, I understand. Come on.

343
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:41,111
What happened?

344
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,656
Mom, I'm on base. There's a meeting.

345
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:46,410
Do not lie to me, Saur.

346
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,913
Mom, everything is fine.

347
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:51,666
- Dad, can I have with you?
- Come on.

348
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:55,088
Take me. Op-pa!

349
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:58,258
Milk!

350
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:03,390
Tell him so tightly.

351
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:07,020
Back preload. Ready
move the truck to the curb.

352
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:10,316
- Ah! Aye.
- Silence. Well, how are you?

353
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:13,194
In order? You like?

354
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,030
- Sergei?
- Done!

355
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:19,160
And once, twice, three!

356
00:33:20,204 --> 00:33:23,624
And there you have iodine or bandage?

357
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,214
- Where?
- That hurts.

358
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,592
Healed. Well, what you do.

359
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:44,151
Who is there even fired?
They were caught?

360
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:47,155
But who knows. Maybe, saboteurs,
maybe the boys amused.

361
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:49,199
Ignoring bus!

362
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:52,954
Yes, lucky you. Anyone who has sat
ahead, all died.

363
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,792
For me.

364
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,255
Send you to Beslan.

365
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,301
I have already contacted them.
There you are waiting for doctors.

366
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:06,680
We all got here by accident.
Sent to Tskhinvali.

367
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:09,517
Topic! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

368
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:11,311
Hey, break it!

369
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,439
Topic!

370
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,333
Go on, go! Go!

371
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:35,593
Who are you lost?

372
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:38,847
Son. I do not need to Beslan,
I have nothing to do there.

373
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:42,435
You said that you are traveling to Tskhinvali.
Throw me? There are only 5 km.

374
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,229
It's impossible.

375
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:45,898
Why not?

376
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:48,651
We have not picked up civilians.
Let's take the bus.

377
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:50,237
Please, what are you worth?

378
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,491
The girl in the first place, I'm not a taxi.

379
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:55,994
Secondly, you have a shock,
and you need to see a doctor.

380
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,579
Let's sit down.

381
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:02,669
- I do not need to Beslan.
- Where are you going?

382
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:07,759
You walk up to you reach Tskhinvali.
This is far and dangerous!

383
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:13,600
Hedgehogs, let's go!

384
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:15,102
Yes, everything, everything!

385
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:18,940
Go go!
Changing.

386
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:34,205
Arrived.

387
00:36:34,456 --> 00:36:36,415
(Signals the machine)

388
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:38,836
Arrived. Do you hear?

389
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,298
How it all hurts.
You may not me ...

390
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,343
An order can not.

391
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,057
I was lucky. I found that one,
which performs the orders.

392
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:56,400
The former call.
Maybe, if he will take me.

393
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:58,903
Hey, hedgehogs, in the car.

394
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:01,824
- Teams no smoking.
- Why he does not fit as well?

395
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:03,868
We are in a hurry.

396
00:37:03,953 --> 00:37:06,830
We are very r-r-rush.

397
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,919
There behind the Parliament building
can catch the car.

398
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:18,595
Good luck.

399
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,495
(Phone rings)

400
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,210
(Call all phones)

401
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:28,436
I do not care. Wake them all!

402
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,355
Connects me immediately!

403
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,775
What are you doing here?
Hello? Hello?

404
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:36,321
Reports ...
What are you doing here? Get out of here.

405
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:38,908
They just shoot at the Parliament.

406
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:05,317
Where? Here!

407
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:12,535
They monitor the signals
mobile phone.

408
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:15,914
This is my phone.

409
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,576
Go. Do not stand. Do not stand.

410
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,601
Are you crazy?

411
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:05,932
Let's hand!

412
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:10,020
Let's hand! Hand!
Can you hear me?

413
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,070
In the car!

414
00:41:32,384 --> 00:41:34,594
(Phone rings)

415
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:47,527
I'm listening.

416
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,120
When?

417
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:04,341
Prepare a counterattack.
I'll soon be.

418
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,434
War.

419
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:22,114
The gate, the gate opens!
It came Saur.

420
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:24,783
Anton, get up, not time.

421
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,175
Watch out!

422
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:47,313
There are many wounded!
Stretchers come on!

423
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,404
Comrade Colonel, let
move his family to Java.

424
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:57,159
Communication, communication let me!
I need to know that the posts.

425
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,619
I hope you're joking.

426
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:02,040
My house is right on the border.
I need to take them out.

427
00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:07,130
In general, I promised my wife,
would be no war.

428
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:10,218
You know, I do not have
the right to let you go.

429
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:15,516
Vyvezesh son, and once back.
I need you.

430
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:17,476
Thank you, Captain.

431
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:58,196
Alive in the car!

432
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,041
Zdraste.

433
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:11,589
Faster, faster!

434
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:35,787
My opinion, it's a trap
and they certainly have ...

435
00:44:35,871 --> 00:44:38,791
any guarantee of support
Washington. There can not be.

436
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:42,754
Let the MOE puts the camp in the region.
Water, food, medicine, all you need.

437
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,465
Sit down.

438
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:05,700
Hold on!

439
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:10,498
All of the car, quickly!

440
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,005
Calmly, quietly. There.

441
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:19,176
Wounded there?

442
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:22,096
All are still alive?

443
00:45:39,746 --> 00:45:41,121
Ah!

444
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:05,361
(Mobile phones)

445
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:07,823
Oh, Topic! Hello?

446
00:46:08,074 --> 00:46:10,910
Allo. Xenia, I am.
Here, until all is quiet.

447
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,038
- I'm in Tskhinvali!
- Turn off.

448
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:16,417
As in Tskhinvali? Why in Tskhinvali?

449
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:17,418
Are you okay?

450
00:46:17,503 --> 00:46:19,504
Yes, yes, yes. A topic with you?

451
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:23,301
Do not worry, I'm going now
take it, and parents.

452
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:27,014
Here, not far away, in Java,
made a refugee camp.

453
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:28,975
Yes, we seem to be going there too.

454
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,393
Turn it off, I said!

455
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:32,520
Thank God. There we meet again.

456
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:35,442
Do not worry, with the theme of
everything will be okay.

457
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:39,864
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm such an idiot, eh?

458
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,491
Saur.

459
00:46:41,617 --> 00:46:45,622
I beg you, forgive me.
I love you, Xenia.

460
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,877
And I can not even understand
how much I love you.

461
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:51,546
Saur.

462
00:46:52,131 --> 00:46:53,590
Oh!

463
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:57,887
Fool. Will kill
We all because of you.

464
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:04,271
Xenia, hello? Ksenia?

465
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:23,128
(Signals the machine)

466
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,096
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

467
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:43,071
Get behind the wheel.
Otvezesh of the camp.

468
00:47:43,364 --> 00:47:45,574
I? I'm afraid!

469
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:50,747
What? Sit down, I say!
All otvezesh the camp.

470
00:47:50,832 --> 00:47:53,668
Hey, I'll take, I know the way.

471
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:55,045
Come on.

472
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,260
- What have we there?
- Kazbek N., there is no connection.

473
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,220
Missing out!

474
00:48:35,223 --> 00:48:36,307
Topic!

475
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:39,768
- Dad! Hello!
- Hey!

476
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:46,194
Come, and faster.
We ought to leave at dawn.

477
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,870
They have about 14,000 soldiers
in the border zone,

478
00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:55,957
75 tanks and 25-27
rocket launchers.

479
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,335
I think their calculation -
lightning break ...

480
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,338
to move into the Roki Tunnel
and cut it.

481
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:02,674
But they also know that we
just finished teaching there.

482
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:05,177
a person is stationed
in North Ossetia.

483
00:49:05,262 --> 00:49:07,055
It's a trap.

484
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:09,725
I gave the order form
column on the northern entrance ...

485
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:11,602
On whose orders?

486
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:14,648
Sit. On my instructions.

487
00:49:14,732 --> 00:49:17,317
Kirill Ivanovich
what do you really?

488
00:49:17,403 --> 00:49:22,241
Upon receipt of the order of the troops will
in South Ossetia, after eight hours.

489
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:27,331
Wait a second! We can not
respond symmetrically.

490
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:30,627
<i> Russian Information Bureau. 

491
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:34,382
Prime Minister Vladimir <i>
Putin arrived in Vladikavkaz today. 

492
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,302
There <i> Premier holds meeting
with the leaders of North Ossetia, 

493
00:49:37,387 --> 00:49:39,138
<i> heads of federal agencies, 

494
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:42,058
<i> and visited a camp for
affected by the conflict ... 

495
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:45,730
(Spoke in English)

496
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,988
Where are you from? From Tskhinvali?

497
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,618
Come, come. Go
the clinic, now you will be engaged.

498
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:06,423
Let us quickly.

499
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:11,554
Get in, Father.

500
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:19,315
(Engine noise)

501
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,753
However, do not bring me
handkerchief out of the house.

502
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:38,173
I think I forgot it
on the kitchen table.

503
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:40,801
Grandma, why do you
hands shaking?

504
00:50:41,303 --> 00:50:44,222
I became an old, dear.

505
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,392
Grandma must obey.

506
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:52,149
However, please.

507
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:06,459
Everything will be fine, Dad.

508
00:51:06,544 --> 00:51:09,421
He sees that I'm a peacemaker,
and we will not touch.

509
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:13,260
Zaur!

510
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,888
(Door slam)

511
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,241
Eat. The doctor said it is necessary.

512
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,126
(Glass cracking)

513
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:46,088
Something is wrong?

514
00:52:53,683 --> 00:52:57,270
I do not know. They have long been
were supposed to be here.

515
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:08,367
(Mobile phones)

516
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:35,361
Mom?

517
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:38,281
Topic, what happened? Topic?

518
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:40,993
There was Mrakovlast.

519
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:43,037
Subject, where the pope?

520
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:45,791
Mrakovlast killed him.

521
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:48,669
(Noise in the fire)

522
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:56,638
Hello? Topic, can you hear me?

523
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:05,399
Temochka? Hello?

524
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:14,328
Excuse me, please.
I have a son of misfortune.

525
00:54:14,412 --> 00:54:16,121
I urgently need to Sidamontu.

526
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:19,585
All roads of civil transport
blocked. Wait a while.

527
00:54:21,922 --> 00:54:26,010
Stop! I urgently need to Sidamontu,
Only I have no money.

528
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:30,599
Open your eyes - the war around.

529
00:54:58,302 --> 00:55:00,513
(Vibrating mobile)

530
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,932
Hello?

531
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:06,854
Hello? This is Xenia.
I need your help.

532
00:55:06,939 --> 00:55:08,523
It's very, very bad.

533
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:11,151
I need to urgently
to get home Zaur.

534
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:15,490
Glad to help, but we are sitting here
all ready and waiting for orders,

535
00:55:15,825 --> 00:55:18,119
and when we see and what
be able to take a ...

536
00:55:18,202 --> 00:55:20,246
Only accredited journalists.

537
00:55:20,498 --> 00:55:22,791
And if there is no order?

538
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:26,755
This means that Tskhinvali and the neighborhood
is the territory of Georgia.

539
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:33,263
How did I find her ...

540
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,959
("Shootout" Mobile phones)

541
00:56:04,722 --> 00:56:08,434
I do not want war, I want a robot.

542
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:11,730
Where is my Good Robot?

543
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:15,359
If we respond militarily,
mark my words.

544
00:56:15,444 --> 00:56:19,073
We will call the aggressors,
Russia accused of provocation ...

545
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:22,911
and say that we were attacked first.
Remain in international isolation.

546
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:27,166
According to your instructions
Ministry of Foreign Affairs ...

547
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,169
attempted to contact
with the President of Georgia.

548
00:56:29,254 --> 00:56:31,756
He said that
Georgian president is busy.

549
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:37,513
4,000 square kilometers.
A piece of worthless land.

550
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,140
But let it choke on them.

551
00:56:39,225 --> 00:56:42,895
Well, not Chechnya and Ingushetia
even less of a problem it would be, huh?

552
00:56:43,147 --> 00:56:46,692
It turns out some kind of instruction
to use us, Russia,

553
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:47,860
for any terrorist.

554
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:51,740
Rob, kill, take it that you liked,
and we are proud to keep silent?

555
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,994
Let's go away from South Ossetia - will lose the Caucasus.

556
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:30,040
- My opinion ...
- All the discussion is over.

557
00:57:31,543 --> 00:57:34,253
The column goes into the tunnel. That's an order.

558
00:57:37,842 --> 00:57:39,802
The cars!

559
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:43,390
Thus, all the cars!

560
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:02,623
Chased!

561
00:58:13,138 --> 00:58:15,348
(Mobile phones)

562
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,393
Yeah?

563
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,482
Xenia, we put forward. Listen to me,
because I did not hear you now.

564
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:28,323
At 18 km downstream of the tunnel is a playground.
There we stop to regroup.

565
00:58:28,532 --> 00:58:32,454
If after an hour you will be there
with journalists' documents

566
00:58:32,538 --> 00:58:34,540
I'll pick up.

567
00:58:36,585 --> 00:58:40,047
Can you hear me?
One hour with you. Run.

568
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:19,556
Here you go. This is my sister.
You will do.

569
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:22,852
- Thank you.
- What a terrible bruise.

570
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:35,494
Zdraste. Tell me, is
though one of whom I think?

571
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:38,164
Oh!

572
00:59:38,248 --> 00:59:39,207
- Yes.
- Oh!

573
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:43,254
Oh, you know, my mother loves it so.
Now I saw him and thought.

574
00:59:43,338 --> 00:59:46,174
maybe he will not refuse
in the autograph for her?

575
00:59:47,218 --> 00:59:48,969
A Th not? You can try.

576
00:59:49,054 --> 00:59:52,182
Really? Here she is overjoyed.

577
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:54,769
Well, wait a minute here.

578
01:00:34,237 --> 01:00:37,449
Hey! You Th there?

579
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:49,631
- Excuse me, but where you have staff?
- There.

580
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:02,523
Ivan Luchenko.

581
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:05,986
He is my witness,
and I - it.

582
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,947
In the turmoil of confused.

583
01:01:10,368 --> 01:01:13,663
Yes, I know her. Well, turned out
so that's nonsense.

584
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:16,708
But you understand now
in general no one knows anything.

585
01:01:20,422 --> 01:01:23,300
- Everything is under your responsibility.
- There are under my responsibility.

586
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,737
Temochka, please, if you
can you hear me, answer me.

587
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:41,824
Thank you very much for your support.

588
01:01:41,992 --> 01:01:45,495
On health. Smart coach.
The first war.

589
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:50,168
Calls can not be held -
line is overloaded.

590
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:52,338
Try to send a message.

591
01:01:55,927 --> 01:02:00,181
Temochka, everything will be fine.
Mom goes to you.

592
01:02:00,474 --> 01:02:02,976
Look who is here with me.

593
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:12,614
Temochka, please
If you hear me, answer.

594
01:02:14,117 --> 01:02:15,910
A cigarette?

595
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,038
Oh.

596
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:26,131

Roll forward 10, 10 Roll forward is Lipa.
We are in position. Reception.

There were no communications.

604
01:03:35,138 --> 01:03:36,097
There were no communications.

605
01:03:36,474 --> 01:03:39,143
I see. I see a column.

606
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:42,939
Reel 10, a Linden.
We see a ribbon.

607

- There were no communications.
- You see, alive!

609
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,411
Our friend is still alive.

610
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,914
Pants wore,
knees sorry sight.

611

Yes, they could electromagnetic
throw a bomb. I read about these.

Therefore, there is a connection.

01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:11,601
Ambush. Give your radio, and fast!

Damn, I 'll email my mother did not send.

649
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:35,031
There is no connection! Call on a cell phone!

Killed! Commander was killed!

655

I can not die, I can not,

656
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:56,303
I have a son there.

657
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:08,230
Excellent.

658
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:11,317
Welcome back.

659
01:10:12,653 --> 01:10:15,865
Sometimes, I saw
concussions go into a coma,

660
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:19,036
and no return no more.

661
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,205
Go to sleep. Close your eyes.

662
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,337
Do not be afraid of you, tilt your head.

663
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:28,172
Oh! Stings, it stings!

664
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:31,301
What have you got there it stings?
Nothing stings.

665
01:10:33,764 --> 01:10:36,475
I feel bad and very painful.

666
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:39,270
When did you eat last?

667
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:49,200
For you, girl, now is the
important in the world - is out.

668
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:56,417
I go into the house. We need a pan,
but it is not enough.

669
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,463
Sweetheart, come with me.
You need fresh air.

670
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:15,692
I was sick.

671
01:11:16,361 --> 01:11:18,654
This is a concussion.

672
01:11:24,037 --> 01:11:28,167
About Sochi heard?
These beaches, a night life.

673
01:11:28,627 --> 01:11:31,796
Always wanted to move to Sochi.

674
01:11:33,299 --> 01:11:35,343
Maybe even move.

675
01:11:46,316 --> 01:11:50,487
Perhaps it could be worse.

676
01:11:51,114 --> 01:11:53,408
(Car alarm)

677
01:12:01,294 --> 01:12:03,421
(Shootout)

678
01:12:39,594 --> 01:12:43,806
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati ...

679
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:46,059
(Automatic fire)

680
01:12:58,117 --> 01:12:59,285
You're going to have?

681
01:12:59,369 --> 01:13:01,413
Sonny, my love,
tell me, please.

682
01:13:01,497 --> 01:13:03,372
You can tell me.

683
01:13:07,046 --> 01:13:10,841
Where to? Go ahead, hero into place.

684
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,273
Mom, this is my favorite scene.

685
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:24,568
- Do not open!
- Spell!

686
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:29,240
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!

687
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:32,119
(Sing song)

688
01:13:39,296 --> 01:13:43,509
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika.
Kosmoboy, answer. Kosmoboy, welcome!

689
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,433
I drew how to get into your
village. We are here, and it is here.

690
01:13:49,518 --> 01:13:52,437
But do not go out until the city is not clean.

691
01:13:52,521 --> 01:13:55,065
If it is, as it was 20 years ago,
Circle will be snipers.

692
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:57,068
You can not hide from them.

693
01:13:59,614 --> 01:14:02,450
The robot, you're really needed.

694
01:14:02,534 --> 01:14:06,497
You have no idea
imagine how I need you.

695
01:14:17,888 --> 01:14:20,098
I'll phone charge.

696
01:14:26,023 --> 01:14:30,278
Kosmoboy, hold on! The robot is
to the rescue, robot goes to the rescue!

697
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:54,225
Yes, it does not work radio,
I'm on a cell phone rang.

698
01:14:54,393 --> 01:14:58,940
Duplicate. Encounter.
Armor 47, square 565 in 2837.

699
01:14:59,024 --> 01:15:01,944
Hey, Leh, with-a-look.

700
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,868
That can not be.

701
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:14,668
Damn! Eat hunting.

702
01:15:14,962 --> 01:15:20,176
- On a base.
- On a base.

703
01:15:20,344 --> 01:15:22,470
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

704
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:30,940
(In Georgian)

705
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:47,711
- Pressing it to the floor! To the floor!
- Let me go!

706
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:50,757
- Why the hell are you doing here?
- I'm going to Sidamontu.

707
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:52,509
You have a concussion, and here you nosishsya.

708
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:55,304
My son was injured. He was there alone.

709
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:59,143
Stop! Where to? Fool, they will kill you!

710
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:02,522
- Here, here!
- And who will help him?

711
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:08,530
It is full of snipers.
You have until the middle of the street you reach.

712
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:12,452
Then help me.

713
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:19,669
The enemy is moving in the direction of
villages of Eredvi, Erneti, Zeman and Cozy ...

714
01:16:19,754 --> 01:16:24,718
to kill civilians
and establish control over the city.

715
01:16:25,011 --> 01:16:26,512
Russian peacekeepers' camp ...

716
01:16:26,596 --> 01:16:28,472
subjected to massive
attacks of the enemy.

717
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:32,770
We set a goal to bring
Camp civilians ...

718
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,189
in an amount of 10-12 people.

719
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:38,192
I order to make the march ...

720
01:16:38,278 --> 01:16:41,489
towards the south
margin Tamarasheni

721
01:16:41,574 --> 01:16:45,202
then a bakery, then Shanghai.

722
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:50,334
At 5 km from this place, near the border
Sidamonta your village.

723
01:16:51,086 --> 01:16:54,381
During the march speed hold 50
distance of not more than 100

724
01:16:54,465 --> 01:16:56,133
in a collision with the enemy ...

725
01:16:56,218 --> 01:16:58,344
render all possible
fire resistance,

726
01:16:58,429 --> 01:17:01,432
but we continue to move
in the prescribed direction.

727
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:03,685
Watch ... Now in the head with the ladies.

728
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:06,730
Conducted in the prescribed manner.

729
01:17:07,315 --> 01:17:10,068
Near the bakery is our tank.

730
01:17:10,152 --> 01:17:13,322
The commander reported that the
during a fight broke down,

731
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:16,159
they had with the crew
alone eliminated.

732
01:17:16,285 --> 01:17:18,370
Ready to move, waiting for us.

733
01:17:18,455 --> 01:17:21,374
Taking the tank -
the second stage.

734
01:17:21,876 --> 01:17:24,503
Upon arrival to the area
possible collision ...

735
01:17:24,588 --> 01:17:27,632
with sniper razveddiversionnymi
groups of the enemy.

736
01:17:28,384 --> 01:17:32,389
If you find such destruction
all available means.

737
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:35,226
Although the windows of Purdue
but to drop dead.

738
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,644
The first group I command,
second - Serge.

739
01:17:38,022 --> 01:17:39,564
Questions hedgehogs?

740
01:17:39,649 --> 01:17:41,943
And this sandwich will we do?

741
01:17:42,027 --> 01:17:44,070
(Soldiers laugh)

742
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:48,618
Will, if necessary.

743
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:51,121
Nominated in ten minutes.

744
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,378
Kosmoboy, I'm on the road.
Even a little bit left.

745
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:58,214
The phone can not take it.

746
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:03,637
Okay, hold on to my
Belt and do not let go.

747
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,015
If I'm not holding you by the scruff of the neck.

748
01:18:06,601 --> 01:18:09,436
I say "sit down" - you sit down.
I say "run" - running away.

749
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:14,568
Thou shalt not do as I say
We are likely to be killed.

750
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,533
Are you going to pull the group back
I'll shoot myself. Is that clear?

751
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,166
I do not understand, hedgehogs,
and who will pick up the boxes?

752
01:18:54,955 --> 01:18:57,457
Will go quickly. Hold on.

753
01:19:00,462 --> 01:19:02,922
This is so that we
harder to get there.

754
01:19:06,094 --> 01:19:08,096
And if you press start?

755
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,973
Not retract, go clear.

756
01:19:10,058 --> 01:19:13,019
Do not sleep, warriors!

757
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:29,081
But!

758
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:31,626
- Your mother.
- Live?

759
01:19:31,711 --> 01:19:33,003
Living.

760
01:19:51,193 --> 01:19:54,531
Look, how scary.
Look, how scary.

761
01:20:13,682 --> 01:20:16,059
Boots, then hot.

762
01:20:19,313 --> 01:20:21,107
- On the hour RPG.
- I see.

763
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:26,406
Uy e!

764
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:28,033
On the minus sign.

765
01:20:28,868 --> 01:20:30,870
(Shouting in Georgian)

766
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,963
- 03 to the right, Lech.
- Mish. 03 on the right.

767
01:20:39,048 --> 01:20:40,132
Yes!

768
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:50,437
Bay!

769
01:20:53,358 --> 01:20:55,944
Ah-ha-ha!

770
01:21:02,453 --> 01:21:05,122
Just not yell. Just not yell.
Just not yell.

771
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,684
There's a checkpoint just around the corner, remember?

772
01:21:21,061 --> 01:21:22,103
Of course I do.

773
01:21:22,187 --> 01:21:24,314
- We will clean up.
- Adopted.

774
01:21:24,565 --> 01:21:26,817
Move around and feed them a window.

775
01:21:26,943 --> 01:21:29,070
- Earrings, ready?
- Ready, ready.

776
01:21:29,155 --> 01:21:30,614
We leave.

777
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:33,993
Go!

778
01:21:57,566 --> 01:21:59,192
Lie down, a pomegranate!

779
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:17,967
Clean!

780
01:22:18,051 --> 01:22:19,636
Forward, forward!

781
01:22:20,846 --> 01:22:22,806
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

782
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,748
Push come. Caught.

783
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:47,088
- Repulsed?
- Yes.

784
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:48,464
What?

785
01:22:50,385 --> 01:22:52,261
Directly on the batteries.

786
01:22:52,346 --> 01:22:55,223
Oh! The commander of the battery repulsed!
(Laughs)

787
01:22:55,516 --> 01:22:57,892
Now in the head with the ladies.
Attention to all.

788
01:22:57,978 --> 01:23:00,814
As we come to the area
Jeeps leave.

789
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:04,944
Look around, easy clean
and exhibited.

790
01:23:05,029 --> 01:23:07,030
Work planned.

791
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:10,159
We then crossed this area
Refugees display. Are there any questions?

792
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:12,579
There are no questions. On-line.

793
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,543
Mom, look - Jeeps!

794
01:23:16,626 --> 01:23:18,170
Archik!

795
01:23:30,103 --> 01:23:31,812
Lech, a tank.

796
01:23:33,065 --> 01:23:35,441
Tank! Tank, damn it!

797
01:23:39,991 --> 01:23:42,618
- Right. Right.
- You're human, Lesh?

798
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,370
Three.

799
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:47,957
Four. Serge, prepare the left.

800
01:23:48,126 --> 01:23:49,544
Five.

801
01:23:51,547 --> 01:23:53,172
Six.

802
01:23:54,509 --> 01:23:56,301
Seven.

803
01:23:56,429 --> 01:23:57,971
Cut!

804
01:23:58,056 --> 01:23:59,724
Faster, faster, faster!
Come on, come on!

805
01:23:59,808 --> 01:24:01,810
That-a-ank!

806
01:24:05,816 --> 01:24:07,525
You made a human circus?

807
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,695
Recharging the tank
six seconds. I gave them seven.

808
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:10,862
What is the charge?

809
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:13,450
He has a gun, it is 20 minutes
without stopping the firing can.

810
01:24:13,534 --> 01:24:15,118
But do not shoot well.

811
01:24:15,203 --> 01:24:17,038
And they have framed.

812
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:23,755
The commander, with your new pants
I'm crap!

813
01:24:24,256 --> 01:24:25,674
Ah-ah-ah!

814
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:37,898
Kosmoboy, hold on! The robot is
to the rescue, robot goes to the rescue!

815
01:24:48,496 --> 01:24:50,664
Armor 46 Armor, 46 for communication.

816
01:24:50,749 --> 01:24:52,458
47 th I!

817
01:24:52,584 --> 01:24:54,795
I'm in your direction at 9:00.

818
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:58,925
It's all right. I see you at 9.

819
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:00,803
Artist, damn.

820
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:03,598
Getting to the second stage.
We are waiting for you to point "B".

821
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,893
There are no questions.

822
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,036
Forward, forward, forward!

823
01:25:28,548 --> 01:25:30,675
Angle. Neater.

824
01:25:37,101 --> 01:25:38,560
Fire!

825
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,195
The door of the examination.

826
01:25:50,785 --> 01:25:52,578
Hold on to the belt.

827
01:25:53,622 --> 01:25:56,625
- Guys, we own!
- Put, lower machine.

828
01:25:56,709 --> 01:25:59,045
Got it, got it!

829
01:25:59,129 --> 01:26:02,549
- Put your machine, I get it!
- APCs blew up!

830
01:26:02,634 --> 01:26:04,343
- There's a sniper.
- Two zaherachili!

831
01:26:04,428 --> 01:26:06,346
Quiet!

832
01:26:10,185 --> 01:26:13,313
- Where is the sniper?
- In the second, on the second.

833
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:17,569
- The window?
- It is 40 minutes longer shot.

834
01:26:17,653 --> 01:26:19,488
- Maybe it was gone, huh?
- Drink it does not come on.

835
01:26:19,572 --> 01:26:22,075
- Okay.
- Gone - not gone, put the gun.

836
01:26:23,536 --> 01:26:25,579
- To cover for 10.
- Forward.

837
01:26:34,884 --> 01:26:37,386
It must leave here. It is dangerous.

838
01:26:37,471 --> 01:26:39,055
And there always is dangerous.

839
01:26:39,139 --> 01:26:41,224
- Clean!
- I went.

840
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,661
(Shots)

841
01:26:58,915 --> 01:27:00,124
How?

842
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,542
Clean!

843
01:27:01,627 --> 01:27:02,960
A.

844
01:27:14,769 --> 01:27:16,311
A.

845
01:27:41,512 --> 01:27:42,888
How?

846
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:45,266
Clean.

847
01:27:48,437 --> 01:27:49,062

01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:50,397
I. .. A.

01:28:01,663 --> 01:28:03,623
- Clean.

851
01:28:14,137 --> 01:28:16,222
Serge, where are you? Where are you got?

852
01:28:16,349 --> 01:28:17,975
Yes, everything is fine.

853
01:28:18,058 --> 01:28:20,061
Sanya, on the interception.
Quickly, quickly, quickly

854
01:28:20,144 --> 01:28:22,481
You Th doing, the hedgehog?
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

855
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:24,066
Earrings, where are you going?

856
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:28,405
Yes, I do not see anyone.
Do not you see, or what? They piled up.

857
01:28:37,751 --> 01:28:39,169
(Shots)

858
01:28:39,337 --> 01:28:43,007
Three hundredth! Three hundredth!
Direct! Throw!

859
01:28:43,091 --> 01:28:46,303
- Throw! Throw! Machine-gun fire!
- The smoke has gone!

860
01:28:46,388 --> 01:28:49,223
Top floor, two! Three hundredth!

861
01:28:49,308 --> 01:28:53,396
The departure! The group covers the retreat!

862
01:28:55,483 --> 01:28:57,901
Sergei, hold on! Just hold on!

863
01:28:57,986 --> 01:29:00,655
The group, the departure!
Left-right look!

864
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:03,826
- From left to clean!
- Left-right camouflage!

865
01:29:04,994 --> 01:29:07,789
In whom else will fall - in the head with nada!

866
01:29:10,419 --> 01:29:12,837
- Steer clear need.
- It is safe.

867
01:29:14,174 --> 01:29:16,717
I Lipa, Lipa me. Reception.

868
01:29:18,054 --> 01:29:20,514
Sit between the windows
and do not rock the boat, and then fall.

869
01:29:20,598 --> 01:29:24,019
I have three hundred. Heavy.
We need urgent evacuation.

870
01:29:24,353 --> 01:29:26,230
Sit down here.

871
01:29:28,651 --> 01:29:30,193
Barbidol puncture it.

872
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:32,655
- Where am I hurt?
- In the ass.

873
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:34,574

01:29:36,995 --> 01:29:39,539

01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:43,043
- Hose izmazhesh.
- Sergei, hold on, Serge!

877
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,630
- So, so, so.
- Squeeze.

878
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,798
All come to the position.

879
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:51,512
Bring him into another room
and talk all the time.

880
01:29:51,597 --> 01:29:53,599
- He must not lose consciousness.
- Hold on, brother.

881
01:29:53,683 --> 01:29:56,352
- Armor 47.
- You do need money, you bastard.

882
01:29:56,437 --> 01:29:58,021
Armor 47, where are you?

883
01:29:58,105 --> 01:30:00,649
Linden, I hear perfectly.

884
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:05,698
Come Blow on the area.
We've got a couple of snakes.

885
01:30:07,367 --> 01:30:08,827
Walk in the way.

886
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:11,664
You understand that, but not so soon
I find myself there.

887
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:13,832
The mechanic, go ahead!

888
01:30:13,918 --> 01:30:15,168
(Calls, mobile).

889
01:30:15,253 --> 01:30:17,838
Hello? Are you okay?

890
01:30:22,929 --> 01:30:26,057
Guys, How much did you have to
pay for such work?

891
01:30:26,225 --> 01:30:29,353
While some pay.
In order not conceited.

892
01:30:29,813 --> 01:30:32,399
Wait, what it means
"I whitewashed the ceiling"?

893
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:35,735
Mom, I told you not to do so.

894
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,405
Go now and rest.

895
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:39,700
His mother is calling.

896
01:30:40,993 --> 01:30:44,623
Only n-n-no punctures
I told you about it.

897
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:47,043
No, do not give a long vacation.
Yes, I do not know, just ...

898
01:30:47,127 --> 01:30:48,878
(Grenade)

899
01:30:51,132 --> 01:30:54,510
Yes this building we have nearby.

900
01:30:54,595 --> 01:30:57,974
Well, enough already! Goats!

901
01:31:00,478 --> 01:31:03,981
Yes, everything is normal. We sit, plump.

902
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:07,068
Yes, I must run.
It should be run. Yes, yes, yes.

903
01:31:07,153 --> 01:31:09,112
All ran. Come on.

904
01:31:10,991 --> 01:31:13,118
And I love you too.

905
01:31:16,123 --> 01:31:18,541
Hey, you, in outdoor advertising.

906
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:35,773
Ashamed to be a good son?

907
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:37,733
None of your business.

908
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:42,281
She is alone, her heart
and besides me there is none.

909
01:31:43,826 --> 01:31:46,536
It would be my theme in this,
when he grows up.

910
01:31:46,621 --> 01:31:49,040
You're working on it.

911
01:31:54,464 --> 01:31:56,508
Hush! Here, below.

912
01:31:58,303 --> 01:32:01,139
Alex, you said that
I am running with a concussion.

913
01:32:01,223 --> 01:32:03,600
And how did you know that I have
had a concussion?

914
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:13,071
What, you threw me Aza?

915
01:32:14,031 --> 01:32:15,950
So her name was Asa?

916
01:32:17,161 --> 01:32:20,914
Congratulations, you've become
this taxi driver.

917
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:25,504
How do you know that my son wounded?

918
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:34,265
Robot, robot, you're really needed.

919
01:32:34,349 --> 01:32:37,019
- Is it serious?
- It seems so.

920
01:32:39,064 --> 01:32:41,483
How could I send him here?

921
01:32:41,567 --> 01:32:43,444
C'mon, you do not know.

922
01:32:44,488 --> 01:32:48,784
All to the last did not believe.
A good kid.

923
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:55,584
So, now for the refugees,
Then I'll take you to your village.

924
01:32:57,963 --> 01:33:00,382
I see! I see you!

925
01:33:00,467 --> 01:33:05,806
Gunner, 15-0!
Fragmentation Charge!

926
01:33:12,231 --> 01:33:16,695
Ladies and gentlemen, the evening singles
in full swing. Tank ordered?

927
01:33:16,779 --> 01:33:19,031
The tank arrived.

928
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:23,579
Glad unspeakably. At the command
"Forward" on the label of the fire.

929
01:33:26,459 --> 01:33:27,960
Next.

930
01:33:33,509 --> 01:33:35,176
Fire!

931
01:33:38,891 --> 01:33:40,851
Caught! Caught!

932
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:44,481
And it was not necessary
hurt our kids!

933
01:33:46,777 --> 01:33:51,365
There are no admission against the tank
if you do not have another tank.

934
01:33:51,658 --> 01:33:54,494
The mechanic, a full back!

935
01:33:59,627 --> 01:34:01,586
The group put forward
peacekeepers in the camp.

936
01:34:01,671 --> 01:34:04,006
Grisha, Misha, to me.
Michael takes a machine gun.

937
01:34:04,091 --> 01:34:06,593
The second group here.
Falcon in the main.

938
01:34:07,846 --> 01:34:09,764
Cling. Leave!

939
01:34:15,813 --> 01:34:21,069
Robot, robot, I'm waiting.

940
01:34:28,706 --> 01:34:30,624
In time you will.

941
01:34:31,126 --> 01:34:34,254
There's a house, a couple of shots
it will turn out.

942
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:42,097
There, refugees, and then tank.
Enemy.

943
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:44,934
The tactic is simple: because of the angle
Get out - fired.

944
01:34:45,018 --> 01:34:46,979
And its an RPG, you bitch, do not take it.

945
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:49,189
(Engine noise)

946
01:35:03,376 --> 01:35:05,336
Cover.

947
01:35:05,545 --> 01:35:07,797
Offer your seat as well?

948
01:35:07,964 --> 01:35:10,091
Ready to go!

949
01:35:11,093 --> 01:35:12,762
Fire!

950
01:35:38,046 --> 01:35:39,713
EPT.

951
01:35:49,394 --> 01:35:51,479
It's okay.

952
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:56,736
Your mother.

953
01:35:57,196 --> 01:35:59,447
The Georgian side
captured the southern base of ...

954
01:35:59,532 --> 01:36:01,909
our peacekeeping forces
at about 11:00.

955
01:36:01,993 --> 01:36:05,413
In turn, the northern camp was able to
reflect the four massive attacks.

956
01:36:05,498 --> 01:36:07,583
- Heroes. Sit down.
- They are still struggling ...

957
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:09,752
with superior enemy forces.

958
01:36:09,837 --> 01:36:12,381
Most of the city,
As can be seen, destroyed.

959
01:36:12,465 --> 01:36:14,425
We assume that the order ...

960
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:17,845
fifteen thousand individual
composition of the enemy entered the city.

961
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:19,515
As yet unconfirmed reports,

962
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,310
They shot civilians,
hiding in basements.

963
01:36:22,395 --> 01:36:24,103
We respond artillery
and air strikes.

964
01:36:24,189 --> 01:36:26,441
We now know that the offensive
the enemy is stopped.

965
01:36:26,525 --> 01:36:30,821
With the approach of the 153rd and 693rd
mechanized infantry battalions,

966
01:36:30,906 --> 01:36:33,784
currently undergoing
tunnel, we are confident

967
01:36:33,868 --> 01:36:36,454
that a complete superiority over
opponent will be achieved ...

968
01:36:36,538 --> 01:36:39,124
Are we going to enter
the territory of Georgia?

969
01:36:42,337 --> 01:36:44,714
This can not be done - we zaklyuyut.

970
01:36:50,515 --> 01:36:52,808
Killing civilians.

971
01:36:52,976 --> 01:36:55,436
Attack our peacekeepers.

972
01:36:56,564 --> 01:36:58,232
Sit.

973
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,409
Why do you think that they may rest,
If we stop at the border?

974
01:37:24,475 --> 01:37:26,811
Grenade come on!

975
01:37:33,695 --> 01:37:35,822
We ran until he was blind!

976
01:37:41,956 --> 01:37:43,582
There's more than a hundred people.

977
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:45,126
(Whistles)

978
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:48,088
At night, remove b-b-will.

979
01:37:48,256 --> 01:37:51,301
- At least under the cover of ...
- No, Ela-burns, no.

980
01:37:53,346 --> 01:37:55,055
Armor 46, answer.

981
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,225
Yes, I'm the 47th!

982
01:37:57,393 --> 01:37:58,727
What's wrong with ammunition?

983
01:37:58,811 --> 01:38:04,275
Ha! But, in fact, everything!
Now I can only show figs.

984
01:38:04,569 --> 01:38:07,488
I'll bet your problem:
's get a couple of shells and chase us.

985
01:38:08,365 --> 01:38:10,909
Yasha, they hurl the house now,
and then a hundred civilians.

986
01:38:10,994 --> 01:38:12,577
Coordinates give him.

987
01:38:12,746 --> 01:38:15,081
- Now.
- Yasha, come on,

988
01:38:15,166 --> 01:38:17,877
n-chase on the road, but alive.

989
01:38:18,378 --> 01:38:21,047
- Listen ...
- Xenia. My name is Ksenia.

990
01:38:21,132 --> 01:38:24,343
Xenia. A beautiful name.

991
01:38:27,807 --> 01:38:30,059
I am Lech.

992
01:38:33,438 --> 01:38:35,024
Let's get acquainted. So what?

993
01:38:35,108 --> 01:38:36,734
Here is the deal.

994
01:38:36,861 --> 01:38:40,364
I had information that there
dozens of refugees, and here a hundred.

995
01:38:43,202 --> 01:38:46,288
And I have to pull out all the
before the crash roof

996
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:50,794
get a couple of armored personnel carriers,
to take them away,

997
01:38:51,212 --> 01:38:54,132
and prepare a cover
for departing convoy through the city.

998
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,552
Many cases.

999
01:38:59,223 --> 01:38:59,555
Yes.

1000
01:38:59,974 --> 01:39:04,728
In general, you make me wait
I go back and bring you to the Sidamontu.

1001
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,648
For a long time?

1002
01:39:08,694 --> 01:39:11,488
Hours 6-7.

1003
01:39:13,533 --> 01:39:15,702
I will bring you to your son.
Wait for me.

1004
01:39:15,786 --> 01:39:17,829
The village is just five
kilometers away,

1005
01:39:17,914 --> 01:39:23,336
but now it can be very
dangerous five kilometers in the world.

1006
01:39:25,048 --> 01:39:27,091
You're welcome.

1007
01:39:28,052 --> 01:39:32,265
Lech, say, and how would you
went to my place?

1008
01:39:43,572 --> 01:39:45,866
So so. You will need
a few things.

1009
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:49,537
Lech, a-c-shell for the tank no.

1010
01:39:49,621 --> 01:39:51,373
Grisha, I am now.

1011
01:39:52,167 --> 01:39:54,502
Grisha, I am now.

1012
01:39:56,297 --> 01:39:59,175
Lantern. Map.

1013
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:01,845
I have difficulty with the maps.

1014
01:40:30,298 --> 01:40:33,302
So, guys, no shells,
time, too.

1015
01:40:33,386 --> 01:40:35,263
Get ready to show civilians.

1016
01:40:35,347 --> 01:40:39,435
Look. Here is your village.
We're here.

1017
01:40:39,603 --> 01:40:42,439
Get out of camp and povernesh
to the left. You reach the bridge ...

1018
01:40:53,245 --> 01:40:56,707
Lech, fire! Fire!

1019
01:40:56,792 --> 01:40:59,169
And the fiery Hello!

1020
01:41:01,214 --> 01:41:02,924
After the bridge skinesh helmet and vest.

1021
01:41:03,008 --> 01:41:05,344
You'll be on their territory -
take a soldier and start shooting.

1022
01:41:05,761 --> 01:41:07,471
Forward!

1023
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:11,393
Dressing packet. Spliced ​​wounds.
Did you see how it works.

1024
01:41:11,478 --> 01:41:13,145
I already took you one.

1025
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:14,522
- Che, steal, or what?
- What?

1026
01:41:14,607 --> 01:41:16,148
Just kidding!

1027
01:41:21,115 --> 01:41:23,534
All my life I dreamed of
stay a scout.

1028
01:41:23,618 --> 01:41:25,620
- Suhpaek.
- And how are you?

1029
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:27,289
Without suhpayka that?

1030
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:31,628
- Yes.
- I shall die.

1031
01:41:32,046 --> 01:41:35,716
Yes, I'll manage somehow.
Faster, citizens, faster!

1032
01:41:37,428 --> 01:41:40,681
Your mother - a happy man.
She is someone to be proud of.

1033
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,942
Neat, neat.

1034
01:41:55,576 --> 01:41:57,411
Come on. There is no time.

1035
01:42:02,293 --> 01:42:04,462
The radio!

1036
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:07,090
Do not worry, the casino owner has a spare.

1037
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:12,723
Wait at least dark.

1038
01:42:12,807 --> 01:42:14,725
Hurry up, hurry up, dears!

1039
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:17,145
How do you think
poimeyut my tank as well?

1040
01:42:23,821 --> 01:42:26,866
Run, run, run, run!

1041
01:42:52,024 --> 01:42:55,069
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!

1042
01:42:55,278 --> 01:42:58,031
Kosmoboy, I, Robot.

1043
01:42:59,408 --> 01:43:02,120
I almost came.
Be patient a little bit.

1044
01:43:02,204 --> 01:43:04,164
Tell me, please, huh?

1045
01:43:05,292 --> 01:43:07,418
Reception Kosmoboy.

1046
01:43:09,714 --> 01:43:11,841

<i> Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!
Kosmoboy, I, Robot. 

1048
01:43:24,942 --> 01:43:26,944
<i> I almost came. 

1049
01:43:30,866 --> 01:43:33,243
Probably not to see
all these horrors,

1050
01:43:33,328 --> 01:43:35,580
he substituted their own robots.

1051
01:43:38,251 --> 01:43:42,339
My boy is poor.
As he was there, all alone?

1052
01:43:55,815 --> 01:44:00,904
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!
Kosmoboy, I, Robot.

1053
01:44:02,366 --> 01:44:05,577
I almost came.
Be patient a little bit.

1054
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:07,663
Tell me, please, huh?

1055
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:14,672
(Barking dog)

1056
01:44:16,801 --> 01:44:19,136
(Shouting in Georgian)

1057
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:32,487
Listen, I'm not going to hurt your
cubs. Miss me.

1058
01:45:39,992 --> 01:45:42,286
Fire Dragon.

1059
01:46:09,447 --> 01:46:12,909
Topic! Subject, where are you?

1060
01:46:14,412 --> 01:46:16,455
Topic!

1061
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,850
Temochka, my boy,
Well, where are you?

1062
01:46:43,115 --> 01:46:45,117
Lord. Theme.

1063
01:46:48,706 --> 01:46:52,293
Theme. Temochka, it's me, Mom.

1064
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:58,258
Go here. Go here.

1065
01:47:08,482 --> 01:47:11,443
You can not drink a little. It is impossible.

1066
01:47:19,704 --> 01:47:23,041
How do you feel?
You know me, theme?

1067
01:47:44,278 --> 01:47:47,656
That is. Be patient a little bit.

1068
01:47:51,788 --> 01:47:53,831
Quietly, quietly.

1069
01:48:36,262 --> 01:48:39,515
Russia has just got to his feet,
and this little conflict ...

1070
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,269
could topple the country
during the "Cold War".

1071
01:48:42,353 --> 01:48:43,979
What are we talking about?

1072
01:48:44,105 --> 01:48:49,194
Battalion group
135th, 503rd and 693rd regiments.

1073
01:48:49,487 --> 01:48:53,200
motorized infantry in the
15th Motorized Rifle Division and ...

1074
01:48:53,284 --> 01:48:55,160
came to the set position.

1075
01:48:56,914 --> 01:48:58,915
We can push
enemy troops abroad

1076
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,252
and can, if we want to
remember the lesson a long time,

1077
01:49:01,335 --> 01:49:03,546
go after them
on their territory.

1078
01:49:06,509 --> 01:49:08,970
I would recommend the latter.

1079
01:49:11,015 --> 01:49:12,683
Let me finish?

1080
01:49:15,062 --> 01:49:17,940
I have always appreciated your advice,
Kirill Ivanovich.

1081
01:49:19,568 --> 01:49:24,699
Times have changed.
I ask you to leave the meeting.

1082
01:49:49,857 --> 01:49:51,567
Proceed.

1083
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:51,812
Temochka, son, we need to run.

1084
01:50:59,030 --> 01:51:03,702
Aza-mizi-MAZ-Amaravati, Chandrika!

1085
01:51:04,955 --> 01:51:06,581
Robot.

1086
01:51:06,957 --> 01:51:10,710
Mrakovlast attacks. We need to escape.

1087
01:51:11,296 --> 01:51:13,631
Come on, Kosmoboy.

1088
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:44,880
What happened to you?

1089
01:51:49,095 --> 01:51:51,681
Silence. Hush-a.

1090
01:52:24,808 --> 01:52:26,935
(Cars honking)

1091
01:52:38,743 --> 01:52:40,995
No, no, no, no.
Just do not lose your mind!

1092
01:52:56,891 --> 01:52:59,018
I will. But!

1093
01:53:08,572 --> 01:53:11,367
Temochka, darling, tell me.
Answer me.

1094
01:53:14,956 --> 01:53:17,417
Can you hear me, theme?

1095
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:28,681
Subject ... Kosmoboy!
Kosmoboy! reception

1096
01:53:28,849 --> 01:53:33,521
The robot is not allowed to sleep!
I need you, Kosmoboy.

1097
01:53:39,113 --> 01:53:40,655
Oh my God!

1098
01:53:46,079 --> 01:53:48,164
So, what else was in this tale?

1099
01:53:48,249 --> 01:53:51,544
And remember, we have taken away
Magic Dust from Mrakovlasta?

1100
01:54:19,749 --> 01:54:23,626
And we have one more task,
absolutely super secret.

1101
01:54:23,712 --> 01:54:27,216
we must save one very
good boy, do you hear?

1102
01:54:34,309 --> 01:54:35,977
He lost in the dense forest

1103
01:54:36,061 --> 01:54:38,605
and he was absolutely nobody to help,
except you and me!

1104
01:54:50,956 --> 01:54:51,998
No!

1105
01:54:52,082 --> 01:54:53,708
We'll save this boy, and then ...

1106
01:54:53,793 --> 01:54:56,670
No Mrakovlast with dragons
and we are not afraid of monsters.

1107
01:54:56,755 --> 01:54:59,758
Only one I could not do it,
Kosmoboy without your help.

1108
01:54:59,842 --> 01:55:01,635
Will you help me?

1109
01:55:16,447 --> 01:55:18,824
(Shouting in Georgian)

1110
01:55:19,659 --> 01:55:22,871
No, no, no. Please
please, please.

1111
01:56:14,689 --> 01:56:17,066
Xenia? Xenia, welcome.

1112
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:21,071
Xenia, the reception

1113
01:56:21,907 --> 01:56:23,074
Lech!

1114
01:56:23,158 --> 01:56:25,911
Xenia, you should immediately
to find shelter.

1115
01:56:25,995 --> 01:56:28,623
We launched a counterattack,
and you are at its very center.

1116
01:56:32,379 --> 01:56:34,547
I can not stop! So long!

1117
01:56:35,174 --> 01:56:36,883
Xenia! Xenia!

1118
01:56:36,968 --> 01:56:39,846
Counterattack exactly along the line
your movement.

1119
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:42,599
What does it mean for my line of motion?

1120
01:56:57,161 --> 01:56:58,453
Times.

1121
01:57:00,957 --> 01:57:02,625
Two.

1122
01:57:03,419 --> 01:57:05,212
Three.

1123
01:57:06,006 --> 01:57:07,632
Four.

1124
01:57:08,424 --> 01:57:10,260
Five.

1125
01:57:10,887 --> 01:57:12,680
Six.

1126
01:57:13,348 --> 01:57:14,723
Seven!

1127
01:57:41,301 --> 01:57:44,137
This boy's name Subject
and it is a very good boy.

1128
01:57:45,807 --> 01:57:47,057
Uh, uh, eh!

1129
01:57:47,142 --> 01:57:49,728
We need to save it in a dense forest.
You should always tell him,

1130
01:57:49,812 --> 01:57:51,647
that he has a house.

1131
01:57:54,026 --> 01:57:56,528
We are sure it will change the wallpaper.

1132
01:57:56,613 --> 01:57:58,573
There is a couch,
on which he sleeps,

1133
01:57:58,657 --> 01:58:01,076
and under the sofa store
all of their toys.

1134
01:58:01,327 --> 01:58:03,913
And his grandmother is very, very fond of.

1135
01:58:05,666 --> 01:58:07,960
We must save the topic.

1136
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:11,172
Mrakovlast - very scary
and very dangerous,

1137
01:58:11,424 --> 01:58:14,677
but I, Robot, and you, Kosmoboy,
stronger than him.

1138
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:16,763
Together we are stronger than all!

1139
01:58:17,348 --> 01:58:19,683
Only when we are together.

1140
01:58:30,782 --> 01:58:32,492
You scared?

1141
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:40,460
I was taught:
Look, how scary.

1142
01:59:50,427 --> 01:59:53,763
Temochka. My son,
Lie down here.

1143
01:59:54,098 --> 01:59:56,893
Lie down, a little.
Be patient a little bit.

1144
01:59:56,977 --> 02:00:00,230
Here a number of track,
we will leave it to ours.

1145
02:00:00,315 --> 02:00:03,317
Suffer a little, little ... a little.

1146
02:00:04,904 --> 02:00:08,658
Subject, wake up. Topic, please
wake up. You're welcome.

1147
02:00:09,577 --> 02:00:10,535
My Little ...

1148
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:13,289
(In Georgian)

1149
02:00:24,137 --> 02:00:26,097
What are you doing in this jeep?

1150
02:00:27,391 --> 02:00:29,143
Where did you get this jeep?

1151
02:00:29,227 --> 02:00:31,980
I stole it!
I stole it, of course!

1152
02:00:32,189 --> 02:00:36,068
Yes, you Shoot it in horseradish
and let's, let's go quickly!

1153
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:40,783
My son needs a doctor!
He was wounded and lost a lot of blood!

1154
02:00:41,201 --> 02:00:44,538
For your sake, your mother would have done
just do not hesitate.

1155
02:00:46,124 --> 02:00:47,917
Shoot!

1156
02:00:48,502 --> 02:00:53,132
So ... That's what I'll do it.
I. .. I sit in the car.

1157
02:00:54,134 --> 02:00:56,678
I sit in the car
and I start the engine,

1158
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:59,640
turn on the transmission and drive forward.

1159
02:01:00,977 --> 02:01:03,479
And if you want
I have to shoot - shoot,

1160
02:01:03,563 --> 02:01:06,107
protect me
still nothing. Shoot.

1161
02:01:06,275 --> 02:01:08,736
Yes, come soon!

1162
02:01:10,781 --> 02:01:13,700
But wait you!
Russian behind that mountain.

1163
02:01:13,785 --> 02:01:16,537
If they see you in a military jeep
then shoot immediately.

1164
02:01:16,622 --> 02:01:19,082
Move. I'll take as I can.

1165
02:01:19,167 --> 02:01:20,918
Well, the same move, come on!

1166
02:01:21,002 --> 02:01:23,880
I'll take, how much they will allow me to.

1167
02:01:24,799 --> 02:01:26,759
Wait here!

1168
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:32,099
Stop! Stop!

1169
02:01:51,792 --> 02:01:55,588
(Leaves, signals)

1170
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:34,805
Chumazenkaya, you in Russian you know?

1171
02:02:36,934 --> 02:02:38,477
So you get away from the road

1172
02:02:38,561 --> 02:02:41,314
and it is yours, I'm sorry,
slows down our progress!

1173
02:02:45,153 --> 02:02:48,698
No, guys, so today we
to Tbilisi just will not make it.

1174
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:45,897
The robot picked up <i>
Kosmoboya his friend, 

1175
02:03:46,191 --> 02:03:49,777
<i> and together they flew
beat with Mrakovlastom, 

1176
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:53,574
<i> who could not beat them, 

1177
02:03:54,034 --> 02:03:57,955
because their friends
was stronger than his anger.

1178
02:04:00,125 --> 02:04:04,296
And when Kosmoboy
wanted to see my mother,

1179
02:04:05,549 --> 02:04:08,969
He said:
"The robot and let it fly?"

1180
02:04:09,596 --> 02:04:12,515
And the robot said, "Come."

1181
02:04:13,226 --> 02:04:17,313
Because he knew
my mom loves it ... Kosmoboya

1182
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:20,818
and experiences for him.

1183
02:04:22,654 --> 02:04:26,283
And then they won the last
mrakovlastovskogo dragon ...

1184
02:04:26,368 --> 02:04:28,244
Mum.

1185
02:04:30,456 --> 02:04:33,209
Silence. Temochka. Temochka. Silence.

1186
02:04:34,879 --> 02:04:40,426
I do not want more about robots
Tell me more about my father.

1187
02:05:08,589 --> 02:05:10,674
So this is your little man?

1188
02:05:11,134 --> 02:05:14,387
Theme, meet it Lech.
I really, really helped.

1189
02:05:16,933 --> 02:05:19,143
Do you have someone to be proud of.

1190
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:22,064
I knew that you
will succeed. Cool.

1191
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:24,400
And how did you find me?

1192
02:05:24,693 --> 02:05:26,778
Well, I did spy, remember?

1193
02:05:27,447 --> 02:05:29,073
Grisha!

1194
02:05:31,702 --> 02:05:33,245
What war?

1195
02:05:33,329 --> 02:05:36,624
Ended. We won.

1196
02:05:36,709 --> 02:05:38,418
We stopped in Gori.

1197
02:05:38,628 --> 02:05:40,337
Congratulations.

1198
02:05:43,759 --> 02:05:46,470
And you ... What are you doing here?

1199
02:05:47,347 --> 02:05:49,391
He came over the radio.

1200
02:05:55,191 --> 02:05:58,569
Do not worry, the casino owner has a spare.

1201
02:05:59,321 --> 02:06:01,531
Well, for the walkie-talkie, of course, too.

1202
02:06:04,536 --> 02:06:06,747
On the landing!

1203
02:06:07,081 --> 02:06:09,792
Mom, though it is cool?

1204
02:06:13,798 --> 02:06:15,675
Go here.

1205
02:06:18,304 --> 02:06:20,431
Well, take care.

1206
02:06:22,017 --> 02:06:24,812
You, too, Lech. Thank you very much.

1207
02:06:35,535 --> 02:06:40,624
Leh we go, we have r-r-rush.

1208
02:07:06,408 --> 02:07:09,244
(Children shout "Hooray")

1209
02:07:09,954 --> 02:07:12,540
Uncle, give me a cigarette?

1210
02:07:12,666 --> 02:07:17,213
- Hurray! Hooray! Hooray!
- Early-you still smoke, guys!

1211
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:31,231
<i> Hello. Ksyusha, hello. This is Egor. 

1212
02:07:31,315 --> 02:07:34,777
<i> Listen, I'm sorry for yesterday.
I very much want to see you. Call. 

1213
02:07:37,198 --> 02:07:40,535
<i> Xenu, Egor. Free again. 

1214
02:07:40,661 --> 02:07:44,331

1215
02:07:44,541 --> 02:07:47,627
<i> I hope you do not mind? Call. 

1216
02:07:48,630 --> 02:07:53,468
<i> Ksyun is Egor. It is true that I miss.
It missed. 

1217
02:07:53,886 --> 02:07:57,765
<i> Please, please, call.
I'm sorry. 

1218
02:07:58,392 --> 02:08:02,063
Call <i>, I really need to

1219
