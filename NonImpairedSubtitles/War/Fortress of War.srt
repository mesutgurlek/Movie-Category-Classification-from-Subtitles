00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:39,593
In mid-nineteenth century on the west
border of the Russian Empire,

4
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,904
at the confluence of the rivers Bug and Muhavec,
Brest fortress was built.

5
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,180
Powerful fortifications, fortress system,
ramparts, ditches and water obstacles,

6
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:48,841
were the impregnable fortress.

7
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:51,902
A century later, the emergence of new species
weapons, defensive properties of the fortress

8
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:55,244
are reduced to mimimum ...
But not people who have defended it.

9
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:58,439
Almost 20 years after the war,
the world is from the book by Sergey Smirnov

10
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:01,600
I learned the truth about achievement
defenders of the fortress.

11
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:05,471
8. May 1965 Brestka Fortress
earned the title of "Fortress-Hero".

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,004
Dedicated to the memory of
heroes of Brest Fortress

13
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:12,201
and to all who have
defending our homeland.

17
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:55,079

Come on, only I'll be the first to arrive.
- No, I will!

19
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,433
Where are you going?

20
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:03,203
I remember ...

21
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,608
I remember everything.

22
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:11,917
In the city park, as well as
Every Saturday, there was dancing. i>

What are you yelling?
You're not my father either, not even the commander.

40
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:36,381
What did you razvikao front of everyone?

It's easier to cope with the sheer,
but with you.

Citizens, do not push it!

67
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,803
It was ordered that no one is playing,
means that today there are no tickets.

68
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:11,349
No!
No tickets!

69
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:14,861
I am telling you - no maps!

70
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:18,949
I am telling you that there are no tickets!

71
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:21,653
Means - nor the military reservation,
nor by any other basis.

72
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:26,415
I explain to you in Russian.
They gave me only 3 days to get there and back.

73
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,142
May they give the ticket.
We do not have. You can go.

74
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:34,184
Listen, he has a wife and small child
in Daugavpils.

75
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,819
I have to move
the new place of service.

76
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,551
For 20 th July.
That's all I can.

77
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,965
Cancel the reservation!

78
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:46,880
Comrade Commissar,
I am telling you as your:

79
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,999
Forbidden to annihilate
Reservations!

80
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,904
We received a directive from headquarters:
Only by special order.

81
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,992
So you will not?
- Perhaps it is good.

82
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,046
Why do you want there,
when all they want from there?

83
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,687
What exactly does this
do you mean?

84
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,534
Hell.

85
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:10,743
Rights desert.

86
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:13,012
To die with envy!

87
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,217
German cargo?

88
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:46,158
Hello, comrade commissars!

89
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,593
Hello, Nicholas.

90
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,182
Film drive?
- Yeah, I'm driving.

91
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:10,444
'Hey ... Come on, come quickly!

92
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,492
Come on, come on!

93
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,858
C'mon!
C'mon!

94
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,894
Togušev!

95
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:39,494
Kolja is fast, but
Togušev even faster!

96
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:46,628
Dear, I have not managed to get.
The fortress was calm.

97
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,248
War will not be!

98
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:54,522
Mat!
- The logical coincidence.

99
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:57,389
Come more.
- Come on.

100
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,615
Commissioner!
- Shape up!

101
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:06,373
You are not gone, comrade commissars?
- To go, and I do not see the end of the party?

102
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,116
Choir!

103
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:12,388
Freeze!
On the right ravnajs!

104
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,319
To the right!

105
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,327
You brought the film?

106
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:20,250
Made.

107
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,821
And more beer.
- Do not be without it?

108
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,859
Well, tomorrow is Sunday!

109
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:30,881
On Sundays people are resting.
- Resting and me.

110
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,749
Mama!
- Three beers.

111
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:36,654
No, you tell him. Why me?
- Alec, Nina!

112
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,524
You did it tell you,
You just agreed.

113
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:44,264
And mineral water for children.
- You are remembered for the children ...

114
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,477
So, are we all take?
- What's cap!

115
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:53,145
Thanks a lot.
- Come on, chaps.

116
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,779
Come on, kids.
- It's beautiful ...

117
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,242
Yes, and my mom had this.

118
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,889
RECEIPT OF GOODS

119
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:19,749
Did you bring?

120
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,195
Yes.

121
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,324
Certainly love again?

122
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,726
Love.

123
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:46,298
I messed up thing, buddy sergeants?
- What?

124
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,638
Little is beating you?
And as you noticed?

125
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:53,326
I played off-key, but you
know what kind of hearing is my brother.

126
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,200
And what are you playing?
- "On the Hills of Manchuria".

127
00:10:56,235 --> 00:11:00,753
By tomorrow morning, you have learned.
Tomorrow to review the odsviraš.

128
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,221
Stop the music!

129
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,652
Hruš, what are you doing?
Where bleneš?

130
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,843
Comrade Lieutenant, this is
some kind of "Swan Lake".

131
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:30,812
Healthy-living.
- Hi-alive.

132
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,121
Zina, thank you.

133
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:43,316
And so ...

134
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:47,622
And when you think,
to start a war with Germany?

135
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:50,271
Seriously ask?

136
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,965
Commanded to
investigate your case.

137
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,224
The expansion ... So ...

138
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,385
... Panic about rumor
War with the Allies.

139
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:03,151
I believe and I see that you are
convinced Communists and honorable man.

140
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:07,969
How could that happen to you, Pyotr
Mihailovic, characterized as a panic?

141
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:11,737
Ask those who have me nabedili.

142
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:20,777
Help me, Pyotr Mihailovich.

143
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,236
I have a low rank,
little authority,

144
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,700
and assignments on the throat.

145
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:28,829
I see you with
these have nothing.

146
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:32,605
Who sow panic in the garrison?
What do you think?

147
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:38,275
In particular I called you here to talk,
as they say - in private.

148
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:41,827
Tell who, Comrade Major?
- I.

149
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:48,466
Nonsense to think that
Germans will soon rush.

150
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:54,393
Nothing that I did not like
heard from someone else.

151
00:12:55,806 --> 00:13:00,529
In garrison, there is no panic,
Comrade Weinstein.

152
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,462
Sleep peacefully.

153
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:12,066
Here Lieutenant see ...

154
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:18,232
If you rush, you will find yourself in the environment.

155
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:21,046
Garrison of 8,000 men.

156
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:25,352
Such a torrent of people will fail to
pass only through the North gate.

157
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:29,456
Wife, children, aunts loaded their
things, blanket, towels ...

158
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:32,258
Sanatorium, his mother ...!

159
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:36,708
Much of the garrison should be
performed outside the fortress,

160
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:40,443
Places to station units.
That's what I, a war commander,

161
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:44,041
which has passed the two wars, I say.
I will continue to speak.

162
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:47,604
A whole army of the fourth? Pjotr
Mihailovic, would not guess that leave us?

163
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,137
We will not be left hanging?
- It will not.

164
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:55,673
Not, if everyone is
where it should.

165
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:59,040
Soldiers in one place
Commanders on the second.

166
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,129
When there is a soldier without a commander,
there was panic.

167
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,986
These are basic things,
Comrade Lieutenant?

168
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,367
Quite understand you,
Pyotr Mihailovich.

169
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,871
I personally our conversation
I find very useful.

170
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,387
Of course, please
to keep it a secret.

171
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,895
For discussion of your case
determined on 27 June

172
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,666
Comrade Lieutenant,
allow to leave.

173
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,560
The film starts in the club ...
- Yes, of course.

174
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,635
Petya, it's time to enter!
- Ma stićićemo.

175
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,629
Where it needs to hurry ...
- Entrances.

176
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,773
Healthy-living!

177
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:49,042
"... Ju, ju, ju, ju ...

178
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:51,593
... Warmed up our iron ...

179
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:55,125
... I'm not jealous of another,
it will change ...

180
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,448
... Anyway, you will be mine,
thou shalt not escape me ...

181
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,891
Anjuta, a long time I
wanted to tell you ...

182
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,335
Silence there!

183
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:14,403
Sonja? - Mmm ...
'Hey Sonja?

184
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:19,200
You will remain?
- See how people live, a. ..

185
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:22,773
Anjuta, a long time I
wanted to tell you ...

186
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:29,059
Time to go home!

187
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,995
Thank you, Comrade Major.

188
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,810
Petya ...

189
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,749
Tea you stayed.

190
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,867
Go lie down, Katyusha.

191
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:24,960
So they appeared in Brest
German commandos.

192
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:27,170
In our uniforms.

193
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:32,983
Turn off electricity and water
Fortress is the work of their hands.

194
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,853
What's the matter?

195
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:45,213
However today is the watchtower
defected one Pole.

196
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:48,666
Said that the war will begin
today in four hours.

197
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:52,488
Do you believe him?
- No, of course.

198
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:55,327
Just this week we got
ten of these and each tells

199
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:58,192
that today or tomorrow, 8 August ...

200
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:04,059
S not that, but we eat because Njorke.
Increased. Previously we all talked.

201
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:07,783
And now that is something you ask,
Nadur and went somewhere.

202
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,055
Look, it's not sick?
- Yeah.

203
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,373
Her disease is called Saska Akimov.
Our Njurka in love.

204
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,549
So these are things, Daddy.

205
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:26,631
Dreams?
- Say.

206
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:29,515
Remember that you promised me you'd
to take me with you on a fishing expedition?

207
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,321
No, Newry, parents will not let you.
- Silent I will iskrati. When you fall asleep.

208
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:39,273
OK Njurka, you Zasviraj,
and I'm going to smoke.

209
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,322
Let's get married.

210
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:11,216
And I ask you and I, the groom?

211
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,403
Do not believe me?

212
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,225
Now I'll be right back.
- Wait!

213
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,712
For a moment I will.

214
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,492
Hello ...

215
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,991
Surname?
- Koljka.

216
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,828
I've made a film ...

217
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:53,046
22. jun 1941st The
03:58 h.

218
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:58,507
Maneuvers?

219
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,732
Do not give you any to get some sleep.

220
00:23:08,218 --> 00:23:10,234
I'm going to see what happens.

221
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:15,647
Zaleze!

222
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:19,974
What is it?
- Maneuvers.

223
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:41,049
Run!
- Where?

224
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,679
Home! You will find you!
- And you?

225
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,207
Where's Anja?
- Calm down. Appears.

226
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:49,215
Where's Anja?

227
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,272
Andrjušenjka.
- Where is Anja?

228
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,546
Petya!
War!

229
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,770
Katja! Quick!
- All of you have taken?

230
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,306
Hang in there.
- Run!

231
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:28,520
Katja!
Work the way I have taught.

232
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,322
Take shelter in the basement.

233
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,263
Petya!
- Quiet!

234
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:34,905
War!
- Come on, son!

235
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,966
Take a hat!
- When the silence, there will be you.

236
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,414
Petya!

237
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,502
You can find us, right?

238
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:50,940
So how?
- Stay here.

239
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:53,667
And you?
- I gotta go.

240
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:56,359
Katja, hold it!
- I believe it!

241
00:24:56,394 --> 00:25:00,304
See ya.
Run! Run!

242
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:03,136
Andrjuša. Andrjušenjka!

243
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:05,933
Mama!
- Andrjuša!

244
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,147
Is prone.

245
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:21,695
Not subject to provocations!

246
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,944
Come on, compelled!
All you waiting for!

247
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:27,918
C'mon, Bujko! Redman!
Come on, come on!

248
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:39,525
I imagined the war.

249
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:44,399
But I did not imagine ...

250
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,407
such a war.

251
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:48,633
All were waiting for him.

252
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:53,144
But no one expected
so suddenly.

253
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:57,687
Plain and horrible.

254
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:33,315
I fled into the house.
It was a rendezvous place

255
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:36,099
in case of war.

256
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:50,080
So it was written
in the schedule.

257
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:55,778
But the schedule has remained there,
but in the collapsed house.

258
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,474
It can not!
- Let go!

259
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,407
Get away! Without Commander
I can not give a weapon!

260
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:02,318
Quick!

261
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:11,683
I have not assigned a weapon.
- The first line, with me!

262
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:15,478
But I have had their weapons,

263
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:21,419
that do not have to
anyone's permission.

264
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,950
Appears to have ceased.

265
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,368
06:30 h.

266
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:50,727
Mama ...

267
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:05,124
Mom.

268
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,423
Small ...

269
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:15,728
Dopuzi here.

270
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:29,600
Run, run ...

271
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,441
It can not!
Here you can! Do not enter here!

272
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:39,595
Fortress. Volinska fortification.
Hospitals.

273
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,744
Where are you?

274
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:47,834
Well.

275
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:51,146
You can not operate!
It can not!

276
00:32:01,456 --> 00:32:04,020
Fortress. Kobrinsko fortification.
North Entrance.

277
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,839
Where are you, Hatter?

278
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,165
Where are you? Where are you?

279
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,129
Mama!

280
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,826
Mama!

281
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,077
Stop Panic!

282
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,551
Stop the panic!

283
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,557
Fortress. Kobrinsko fortification.
East Gate.

284
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:41,824
Back when I say!
Go back to the barracks!

285
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:46,217
Stop the panic!
Go back to the barracks! Back!

286
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,693
Guy ... Play it!

287
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:52,090
What should I play?
Never mind, Play!

288
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,100
Stop! Stop!

289
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:56,547
Stop!

290
00:32:56,582 --> 00:32:59,374
Child, are you crazy?
Begaj here!

291
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:02,022
Where is your weapon?
- Ma teraj up!

292
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:11,573
Commanders!
Over here!

293
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:14,470
We are. - We are here.
We are lieutenants.

294
00:33:15,102 --> 00:33:18,088
You are the lieutenants? I do not see.
Bring in a row.

295
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,251
I raportirajte properly, otherwise
I will make you ustrelim to panic.

296
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:23,472
I understand!
- All to return to the barracks!

297
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:27,845
Copy and seize weapons
Defense! Run!

298
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,777
March!
- Zamnom! - Fast!

299
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,039
Fortress. Holmsk gate.

300
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:35,453
Your resistance is useless!

301
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,348
And where are our?
- On the air to hear only the Germans!

302
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:42,648
Perhaps the maneuvers?
- What, who 'my maneuvers? What?

303
00:33:42,683 --> 00:33:46,472
Avoid it!
- I'm guilty associate commissioners!

304
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:49,081
Stop the panic!

305
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:51,638
If the commander
people in the fortress?

306
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,418
Clear.

307
00:33:56,453 --> 00:34:00,310
Taking over command of yourself.
Sergeants! - Please!

308
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:04,382
Collect and share all personnel weapon.
Arrange the windows up!

309
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,376
Do not let the Germans across the bridge!
Save ammo!

310
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:11,711
Do not end the attempts
to make the connection!

311
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,950
Here Fortress, Fortress here ...
- Tana!

312
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:19,226
Listen to my command! Save your weapon!
- There are few weapons, Comrade Lieutenant?

313
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:21,963
Buried under the rubble!
- Politruk? - Killed!

314
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,270
All those who have weapons - here!

01:01:01,585 --> 01:01:07,071
She will come tomorrow and all our ...
will all be over ...

484
01:01:07,106 --> 01:01:09,701
23. June

485
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:55,043
Soldiers and commanders,

486
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,823
this is a choice!
Decide!

487
01:01:59,624 --> 01:02:02,619
Do you find yourself under fire and you die ...

488
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:07,580
... Or the courage
to surrender and live!

489
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:10,547
Your position is baznadežan!

490
01:02:10,548 --> 01:02:14,009
Your Fight - obsolete!

491
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:17,944
We came to liberate
your country

492
01:02:17,979 --> 01:02:20,972
of Jews and Bolsheviks.

493
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:23,966
Build a new life

494
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:28,633
without argatovanja in kolkhozes
without stahanovščine!

495
01:02:28,668 --> 01:02:31,606
Surrender!
You will live!

496
01:02:31,641 --> 01:02:34,267
Let me kill them.

497
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,616
Leave!

498
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:45,910
Everyone will get
what he deserved.

499
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:52,875
Come here!
- Give your hand!

500
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:06,747
Comrade Lieutenant,
Allow me to report to!

501
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:12,027
A student of music department
333. Regiment, Alexander Akimov.

502
01:03:13,171 --> 01:03:15,063
Take him to the basement.

503
01:03:15,098 --> 01:03:17,861
Comrade Lieutenant,
And where is Anja?

504
01:03:18,115 --> 01:03:21,578
What?
- Anja.

505
01:03:26,587 --> 01:03:29,907
I saw, she ran towards you.

506
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,303
Take him to the basement, quickly!

507
01:03:34,304 --> 01:03:35,922
Quickly to the basement.
- Let me go!

508
01:03:35,923 --> 01:03:40,284
Stop! Where are you going? Wait! Where are you going?
- Načić is!

509
01:03:40,546 --> 01:03:42,389
Akimov!

510
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:45,339
Saska!

511
01:03:45,374 --> 01:03:47,898
You can find it!

512
01:04:29,229 --> 01:04:33,042
Do not!
No! No! No!

513
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,496
Do not! Please!

514
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:15,212
Excuse me, please!
Do not kill me! Please!

515
01:05:15,682 --> 01:05:18,230
Please!
No! No!

516
01:05:24,682 --> 01:05:27,941
Do, please!

517
01:06:19,495 --> 01:06:22,040
Drag him down!
- This is not kicking!

518
01:06:22,075 --> 01:06:24,851
Faster!
- Hold it, guys!

519
01:06:24,886 --> 01:06:29,075
Quick, quick! - Commissioner,
we captured prisoners!

520
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:32,781
I remember Fomina and foxglove

521
01:06:33,454 --> 01:06:37,934
and their small squad
in Holmsk gate.

522
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:42,739
Did not give the enemy
across the bridge.

523
01:06:42,962 --> 01:06:47,412
There I first saw
German prisoners of war.

524
01:06:48,657 --> 01:06:50,772
Maslow!

525
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,831
What story?

526
01:06:56,703 --> 01:07:01,239
He says the most likely
Minsk busy.

527
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:09,357
Says - you are in the background ...
We ... we are in a deep background ...

528
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:14,080
What Minsk?
What bulazniš? What?

529
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:18,827
You lie!

530
01:07:19,204 --> 01:07:22,129
Invite a lieutenant!
- At the place!

531
01:07:22,555 --> 01:07:26,256
Comrade ... associate commissioners!
See!

532
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:34,741
Our!

533
01:07:44,848 --> 01:07:46,961
Our!

534
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:29,569
Rear ... from behind ...

535
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,393
Are you alive?
- Yeah.

536
01:09:34,428 --> 01:09:36,066
And-outer!

537
01:09:38,452 --> 01:09:40,643
Come on.
Come on, come on ...

538
01:10:00,138 --> 01:10:01,913
Lieutenant Kareljin.

539
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:05,349
123. hunting people.
- Commissioner mere Fomin.

540
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:09,821
Talk.
What happens in Brest?

541
01:10:09,856 --> 01:10:13,999
The Cobra?
Why does not match our air force?

542
01:10:14,034 --> 01:10:17,943
Where are our?
- No airport, associate commissioners.

543
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:22,476
All were destroyed.
The Germans at Brest.

544
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:26,568
Our deviate towards Minsk.

545
01:11:43,434 --> 01:11:45,671
Comrades ...

546
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:50,308
... Fighters.

547
01:11:53,364 --> 01:11:57,166
Germans offer us
to surrender.

548
01:11:58,346 --> 01:12:03,054
We offer life cowards
in captivity.

549
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:07,705
Were wrong.

550
01:12:08,263 --> 01:12:10,847
We are soldiers of the Red Army.

551
01:12:10,848 --> 01:12:15,513
and will defend our homeland
to the last drop of blood.

552
01:12:16,063 --> 01:12:19,708
No choice - we do not.

553
01:12:27,498 --> 01:12:31,026
June 24

554
01:13:01,338 --> 01:13:04,497
Mister, give me a sip of water.

555
01:13:04,498 --> 01:13:09,034
No, dear.
- You give me, uncle.

556
01:14:02,815 --> 01:14:06,800
Kostya, where is your family?
- I do not know.

557
01:14:08,055 --> 01:14:11,554
I left and in the basement.

558
01:14:12,332 --> 01:14:15,700
And where they are now - I do not know.

559
01:14:16,682 --> 01:14:22,338
And the same with mine ...
I do not know ...

560
01:14:50,685 --> 01:14:54,411
It is not for drinking.
Petrol.

561
01:14:57,072 --> 01:15:00,336
I remember that morning ...

562
01:15:00,337 --> 01:15:05,310
... Or was the day.
I woke up and video arm.

563
01:15:05,311 --> 01:15:07,441
Kovaljenkove hands.

564
01:15:07,442 --> 01:15:11,583
He made
a flute made of wood.

565
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:15,971
I watched and thought:
Why do I need it?

566
01:15:16,006 --> 01:15:21,715
We need to gather up and go
a breakthrough. Who else should we look for?

567
01:15:23,515 --> 01:15:27,078
In a breakthrough. Immediately.
This night.

568
01:15:27,113 --> 01:15:30,607
Otherwise we will all be killed.
One by one.

569
01:15:30,642 --> 01:15:34,263
What break? The fortress was
environment, and Brest is busy.

570
01:15:34,298 --> 01:15:37,205
Where to break?
In captivity? In the camp? In death?

571
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,411
Kude?
- Comrade Captain, we are doomed.

572
01:15:40,594 --> 01:15:45,319
Yes. Many will die.
Perhaps all.

573
01:15:47,385 --> 01:15:50,284
While we have the power,
need to struggle.

574
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:53,136
We have to go to a breakthrough.

575
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,337
Write to the order.

576
01:15:56,751 --> 01:15:58,649
What size?

577
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,214
Order № 1

578
01:16:06,211 --> 01:16:09,577

01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:16,912
A situation that has agreed to
Fortress requires an urgent solution. "

581
01:16:19,098 --> 01:16:21,590
Strike out "an urgent solution".

582
01:16:27,901 --> 01:16:31,297
Write "organized
combat operations, "

583
01:16:32,408 --> 01:16:34,994
"To further the fight against an opponent.

to merge with the regular
units of the Red Army ...

Red Army ...

and for the further struggle with
fascist invaders. "

596
01:17:29,848 --> 01:17:31,888
Starting again, damn them ...!

597
01:17:31,923 --> 01:17:34,571
The Germans!
The Germans were on the bridge!

598
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:37,417
All of their seats!

599
01:17:48,824 --> 01:17:52,312
Here Fortress, Fortress here ...
We fight, we keep the defense ...

600
01:17:58,189 --> 01:18:00,891
Pavljenko! - There!
Pavljenko, over here!

601
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,761
Come here!
- Listen!

602
01:18:02,796 --> 01:18:06,123
Listen to me carefully. Judging by
the fact that shooting does not stop

603
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,862
in the area Terespoljske gates
and the eastern forts,

604
01:18:09,897 --> 01:18:13,567
tom is still our fight!
After me!

605
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:17,310
Make sure to get to them.

606
01:18:17,345 --> 01:18:19,298
Bring them on the operational situation

607
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:23,420
and transfer and the decision to
going to break. Tonight!

608
01:18:23,455 --> 01:18:26,543
Try to get there
to early breakthrough.

609
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:28,910
I had to go back!
Live!

610
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:32,597
Comrade Commissar, let me go!
- I do not allow.

611
01:18:32,632 --> 01:18:34,214
Drink water.
That's all we have.

612
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:37,816
Give wounded, comrade commissars!
- The execution!

613
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:41,547
Take the wounded in the basement.

614
01:18:41,582 --> 01:18:43,630
The execution!
- I understand!

615
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,234
It's over ... almost ...

616
01:18:57,665 --> 01:19:00,558
Let me see.
Quiet, quiet ...

617
01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:04,737
Good.
Finished alone.

618
01:19:21,913 --> 01:19:23,732
Doctor ...

619
01:19:25,378 --> 01:19:27,492
Doctor!

620
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:19,904
On Saturday, the military store

621
01:20:19,905 --> 01:20:22,976
brought cold mineral water.

622
01:20:55,343 --> 01:20:57,533
In the basement!

623
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:45,801
I failed.
I failed, Sask.

624
01:22:45,802 --> 01:22:49,074
Come on! East fort!
Our there.

625
01:22:49,075 --> 01:22:53,593
Transfer them orders.
Tonight ... Breakthrough.

626
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:56,960
I will give them ...

627
01:22:57,267 --> 01:23:01,561
I knew that with me
nothing will happen.

628
01:23:01,827 --> 01:23:04,805
Because I am ...

629
01:23:05,132 --> 01:23:09,584
... I had to pass
that order.

630
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,403
Anja.

631
01:25:41,631 --> 01:25:43,646
Look, now ...

632
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:46,754
Now we can not get out.
Wait here.

633
01:25:48,326 --> 01:25:52,624
I can not stay with you.
I have ordered.

634
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:56,762
Should it pass.
Do you hear?

635
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:01,958
Can you hear me?

636
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:55,140
There was no water.

637
01:27:56,048 --> 01:27:59,284
Specifically, it was
are all around ...

638
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,817
but to it
hard to come.

639
01:28:03,852 --> 01:28:07,909
All approaches to the coast were
are the line of fire.

640
01:28:09,473 --> 01:28:12,211
For vedarce water

641
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:14,702
to sip,

642
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:18,218
the fires.

643
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:22,695
And what they brought,

644
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:25,034
guarded

645
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:27,509
machine guns.

646
