1
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:14,315
Come on, Cheeta.
Come on, Cheeta, get aboard.

2
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,019
Buli, go.

3
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,698
Oh, be quiet, Cheeta.

4
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:32,139
I know Tarzan said not to leave the house.

5
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,732
But I want to meet him.

6
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:42,043
I know it's this way. I want to see it.

7
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:51,983
Wait a minute, Buli.

8
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,460
Look, Cheeta.

9
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,903
That's Palandria,
the hidden city Tarzan told us about.

10
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,700
As long as we're here,
I'm gonna get a good look.

11
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:09,467
Oh, we've got plenty of time
to meet Tarzan. Come on.

12
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:10,365
- Are you all right?
- I feel fine.

13
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:17,646
- Who are you?
- I'm Boy, son of Tarzan.

14
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:20,808
Tarzan? He should take better care of you.

15
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:24,581
Oh, Tarzan is gone to Randini on
the seacoast for a letter from my mother.

16
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,646
She's gone across the ocean
to the great city, London.

17
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:31,854
- I've told you my name. What's yours?
- Zandra.

18
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:35,694
- Thank you, Zandra, for saving my life.
- I haven't saved it yet, Boy.

19
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:38,425
We can't go back the way we came.

20
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:41,670
Gee, Zandra, I've got you in an awful fix.

21
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,825
Tarzan. He's coming!

22
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:26,541
Tarzan!

23
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,078
Hang on, Boy. Tarzan get!

24
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,653
Buli!

25
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,367
All right, Boy.

26
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:50,768
You are a lady,
therefore you must go first.

27
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,308
And you are a little gentleman. Go ahead.

28
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,967
Why Boy not wait home like Tarzan say?

29
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,599
- I was gonna meet you.
- In Palandria?

30
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,107
This is Zandra, Tarzan.

31
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:04,169
She lives in Palandria
and she saved my life.

32
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:07,375
Zandra? Tarzan thank.

33
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,848
I hope I shall see you again.

34
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,878
Well, you see,
Tarzan doesn't like people to bother us,

35
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,254
so he doesn't think
we should bother other people.

36
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,486
Jane and Boy enough people for Tarzan.

37
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,358
Others always bring trouble.

38
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,332
- But Tarzan thank. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

39
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,492
Come, Boy.

40
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,897
- Come on, Buli.
- Bye.

41
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,170
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

42
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,694
"I must tell you,
the world is at war again."

43
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:04,069
Why men have to kill each other?

44
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,076
"Once more the Germans,
Nazis they call them now,

45
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:09,509
"are on the prowl.

46
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,776
"More ruthless than the most
savage beasts of the jungle."

47
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,945
I bet you could kill those Nazis, Tarzan.
Just like you killed Bolgat, the gorilla.

48
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,351
No.

49
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:22,516
Tarzan kill Bolgat to save Jane and Boy.

50
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,423
Why Tarzan kill Nazis?

51
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,786
No more war talk. When Jane come home?

52
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:31,961
She says she can't come home
until her mother is entirely recovered.

53
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,695
It may be weeks.

54
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:38,533
- It's her duty, Tarzan.
- Tarzan know. Read more.

55
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:43,909
"Goodbye, my own darlings.
I long for you so very, very much,

56
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:49,082
"more than words can say.
All my love, always, Jane."

57
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,385
That's all, Tarzan.

58
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:56,652
It's lonesome without her.

59
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,524
Lonesome? Boy sleep now.

60
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,432
Think of Jane. Be there in dreams.

61
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,305
"All my love, always, Jane."

62
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:50,535
- Why, thanks, Cheeta.
- No!

63
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,637
Cheeta bad. Steal from little friends.

64
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,381
You stole this fruit, Cheeta?

65
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,498
Cheeta find own good things.
Take fruit back.

66
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,391
Tarzan's right. Come on now.

67
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:24,766
Put it back.

68
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,938
Cheeta!

69
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,782
Show little people you're sorry.

70
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,226
What is it, Tarzan?

71
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:23,598
- I don't hear anything.
- Tarzan hear. Cheeta hear. Boy listen.

72
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:26,467
I hear it now.

73
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:29,470
- Iron bird come.
- Another airplane?

74
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:37,342
Iron bird go. Good.
Come, Boy, study lesson, now.

75
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:40,280
Oh, gee, Tarzan, I'd rather go swimming.

76
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:43,284
Later. Jane say Boy study every morning.

77
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,547
I bet I could study a lot better
in the evening.

78
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:50,183
Tarzan know best for Boy.
Tarzan mother now! Come. Get!

79
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,642
- Circle slowly.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:13,477
- It will just be a few moments now.
- Good.

81
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,679
If they have half the raw material
that you have promised, Captain Bausch,

82
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,744
it will be a great day for the fatherland.

83
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,120
You will not be disappointed,
Colonel von Reichart.

84
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:24,887
Though I was down with jungle fever
most of the time,

85
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,928
my eyes did not deceive me

86
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,557
about the wealth of oil,
tin and other resources.

87
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,032
That is the place to descend.

88
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:35,400
Just beyond that grove of rubber trees
lies Palandria.

89
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,498
Good.

90
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:43,605
Attention!

91
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:47,306
We have reached our destination.
Get ready to make the descent.

92
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:50,841
Attention! Fix your static line.
Open the door!

93
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,184
- Lieutenant Schmidt?
- Yes, sir.

94
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:59,125
You will tell the pilot
that he has to return to his last base

95
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,526
as soon as we have descended

96
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,258
and wait until we have built
an emergency landing field.

97
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:06,233
- I will send him further orders by radio.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:38,463
- All clear, sir.
- Good, we shall return to the base.

99
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,175
It's coming back.

100
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:58,918
Man come down.

101
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,181
What stranger want here?

102
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:42,726
LZX calling LVW.

103
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:46,894
Hello, LZX. This is LVW. Over to you.

104
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:51,295
It's Lieutenant Schmidt.
You must turn back. I'm...

105
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,802
I'm hurt. Separated from the others.

106
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:59,371
- It's Lieutenant Schmidt. He's hurt.
- Let's return and try to locate him.

107
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,849
Hold on, Lieutenant. We're turning back.

108
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,692
Look out!

109
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,261
Look out!

110
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,971
The propellers!

111
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,816
Quick, Tarzan. Quick!

112
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,942
Quick, Tarzan. Quick!

113
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:03,965
- Is he going to live?
- Man live. Home now.

114
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,702
Cheeta!

115
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,278
Come on, now.

116
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:48,748
- Man speak funny words.
- It's not English.

117
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,581
More medicine.

118
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:03,223
- Will it be long before he's well?
- Not long.

119
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:22,380
- Feel better?
- Yes. Thank you.

120
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:27,218
- You are English?
- Of course.

121
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,952
- Are you?
- Yes. Certainly.

122
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,052
Name Sheldon.

123
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:37,895
Explorer. Have trouble.

124
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:41,868
- Where Sheldon going?
- Headed north.

125
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:45,395
But I... I...

126
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,307
Man all right.

127
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,653
Cheeta try dance.

128
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,249
Colonel. We've searched the jungle
for miles, sir.

129
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,988
Not a sign of Lieutenant Schmidt.

130
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,394
- What of the radio?
- We couldn't find that either, sir.

131
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:46,264
- Blast. How far is it to Palandria now?
- Not over an hour.

132
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,599
You, Captain Bausch and the sergeant
will accompany me there.

133
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,401
The men will remain here.
And then you will find the radio, Sergeant.

134
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:55,068
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel. Wait. Look.

135
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:33,643
- Amazing, here.
- Thank you.

136
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,024
Very interesting.

137
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,624
The strong always win.

138
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,593
Attention!

139
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,902
You men stay here till you get orders.
Schultz, take over.

140
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,038
Strangers coming! Strangers!

141
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,761
Welcome, strangers, to Palandria.

142
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,672
<i>Grandfather, it's Herr Bausch.</i>

143
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,768
You invited me to return someday.
I've taken you at your word.

144
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,437
We are happy to see you, my friend.

145
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:42,313
And this is Colonel von Reichart.
Oman, leader of Palandria.

146
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:44,985
Zandra, his granddaughter.

147
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,490
I am indeed enchanted.

148
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:54,093
Oh, and Achmet, her brother.

149
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:56,490
Achmet?

150
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,194
- How are things with you, Achmet?
- Very well, thank you.

151
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,464
These are the good people
that found me in the jungle.

152
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:06,598
Oh, and I can highly recommend Zandra
as a nurse.

153
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,267
You always were a lucky fellow, Bausch.

154
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:10,606
Words will keep.

155
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,048
The jungle has been unkind to you.
You have need of rest and food.

156
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,607
Thank you very much.

157
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:26,460
You are very hospitable, sir,
and, if I may say so,

158
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:29,861
for a recluse people,
you speak remarkably good English.

159
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,234
In my youth,
I sought the knowledge of the outer world.

160
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:36,031
I fear though that I'm woefully ignorant.

161
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,368
For all that I learned was a language.

162
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:41,403
You mean that you have been
isolated here

163
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:43,603
and cut off from the outside world
ever since?

164
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:46,704
Yes, and content that it should be so.

165
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,876
Gentlemen, my home is at your disposal.

166
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:56,717
Yes, long ago, our ancestors
dwelled in a far-off land,

167
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,625
in what you would call civilization.

168
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:02,424
Then came barbarians
who envied their happiness,

169
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:06,194
driving them from their homes,
looting their treasures of art and science,

170
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,168
despoiling them of everything.

171
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,965
Everything but faith.

172
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:13,633
Our ancestors prayed for aid
to the master of the sun.

173
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,141
He offered them hope.

174
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,442
So inspired, they set forth across
the mountains, the jungles and the deserts

175
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,982
until they came to this valley
and founded Palandria.

176
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,642
A haven of peace.

177
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,786
Your country has a very interesting
and appealing history.

178
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,153
And you, dear lady, if I were the ruler,

179
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:35,361
would be my choice for its future queen.

180
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:38,357
That's very gallant of you, Colonel.

181
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,366
You are very fascinating, my dear.

182
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:52,342
You will excuse me, please.

183
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:03,319
Yes, Sergeant?

184
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:06,792
Your orders have been obeyed, sir.
Everything is in readiness.

185
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:10,387
Excellent. Wait till the town is asleep
and then take up your positions.

186
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:11,591
Yes, sir.

187
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:18,532
But, Sergeant,

188
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:22,134
we cannot interrupt this charming
little interlude here, can we?

189
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,507
No, sir.

190
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,140
Then, Sergeant, the advent
of the new order for Palandria

191
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,912
- will take place in the morning.
- Yes, Colonel.

192
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:42,660
Look alive, you, and go to work!

193
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,457
Get them going, men, and going fast!

194
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:49,561
- Move on!
- Move on!

195
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,491
The Palandrians may be poor fighters,
but they are excellent workers.

196
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,530
- They will do. Sergeant?
- Colonel.

197
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:50,690
Any news of the radio?

198
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,494
None yet, Colonel,
but they are still searching.

199
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,798
Let us hope that the plane starts looking
for us when we do not communicate.

200
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,361
At least we'll have a landing field
ready for them.

201
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,566
Faster!

202
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:05,505
What's the delay over there, Sergeant?
Get them going.

203
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,878
Yes, Colonel. What's the delay over there?

204
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:11,180
What is this? Get up! Get up.
Get up, you, back to work.

205
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:25,081
One, two! One, two!

206
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:30,094
- So this is how you repay our kindness.
- My dear girl, this is war.

207
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,798
<i>And you, Herr Bausch.</i>

208
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:34,398
We found you helpless,
near death in the jungle.

209
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:35,670
We cared for you,

210
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:38,736
and now you show your gratitude
by bringing these jackals

211
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:40,212
to despoil our land and people.

212
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,512
- Hold your tongue, young woman!
- Don't.

213
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:49,922
<i>My dear Fräulein, we are soldiers
of the Reich. We merely do our duty.</i>

214
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:52,858
You have oils, many minerals
vital to our victory.

215
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:55,054
Must you steal them from us?

216
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,999
You are far too beautiful to act like a child.

217
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:05,436
A new day has dawned, my dear.
A new era.

218
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:08,806
Accept it and you will share in its glory.
Reject it and...

219
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:12,708
Well, I am quite sure you are
just as intelligent as you are lovely.

220
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,676
We have harmed no one,
Colonel von Reichart.

221
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:20,281
Please go. Leave us in peace.

222
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:24,256
In rage or supplication
you are equally enchanting.

223
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,888
How dare you!

224
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,640
Achmet! Achmet!

225
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,975
Achmet.

226
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:02,488
Come, Zandra. Hurry. Come.

227
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:13,606
Wait until they've reached the crest
of the hill. You cannot miss then.

228
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:16,303
Be careful.
We got to bring the girl back unharmed.

229
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:18,437
Colonel von Reichart's orders.

230
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:29,919
Omar. Omar.

231
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:49,370
Cheeta, give me that coil.

232
00:28:56,851 --> 00:29:00,014
Come, Cheeta. Nice Cheeta.

233
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,914
This beast...

234
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:09,429
Here, have some of this fruit.

235
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,302
It's delicious. Here. I'll trade.

236
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:38,453
LZX calling Berlin. LZX calling Berlin.

237
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:41,889
Hello, LZX. This is Berlin. Over to you.

238
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:43,589
This is Reinhardt Schmidt,

239
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:46,657
radio operator
in Colonel von Reichart's expedition.

240
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:49,669
We've reached destination.
Our plane on way back crashed.

241
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,137
<i>I'm separated from the others
but will join them as soon as possible.</i>

242
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,908
Colonel von Reichart building
emergency landing field.

243
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:00,573
Expects full battalion
and transport planes.

244
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,343
Hold them ready to send.

245
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:07,350
We'll guide you with radio,
otherwise Palandria impossible to find.

246
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,821
It's located at...

247
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:13,289
Cheeta! Come back here, you ugly brute!

248
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,496
I said come back!

249
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,398
Mr. Sheldon.

250
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,870
We've picked some more fruit for you.

251
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:31,736
Well, what's the matter?

252
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:34,543
That pet of yours has stolen
part of my radio again.

253
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,982
Cheeta. Here, Cheeta, give it to me.

254
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:40,219
Here you are, Mr. Sheldon.
Will you get some music?

255
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:43,223
Yes, yes, but first I must call my base
to send a plane for me.

256
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,317
No! Tarzan want no more people come.

257
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:48,419
But I've got to get out of here.

258
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,191
Soon be well enough.
Tarzan take to Randini.

259
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:59,702
You set great store by your privacy,
don't you, Tarzan?

260
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:03,106
People have always brought us trouble.

261
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:05,869
You're completely happy living here alone?

262
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,644
Tarzan happy when Jane come home.
Tarzan like jungle.

263
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:14,481
Jungle people only fight to live.
Civilized people live to fight.

264
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,080
The perfect isolationist.

265
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:18,953
What's that?

266
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:22,694
Isolationists are people
who are very self-sufficient.

267
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:25,324
They think they don't need
the rest of the world.

268
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,526
Tarzan.

269
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,060
Somebody's shooting!

270
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:04,698
- Zandra.
- Tarzan.

271
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,143
I had to come to you, Tarzan.
You must help me. You must.

272
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,779
They will kill me!

273
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:16,272
Give it to me, Hans.

274
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:22,787
Tarzan fix them.

275
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:31,090
Swine.

276
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,991
You breathed down my neck
and spoiled my aim.

277
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:54,917
Cannibal fish.

278
00:32:56,524 --> 00:32:57,821
We go overhead.

279
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:52,169
Zandra safe now.

280
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,309
- Who those men?
- Germans.

281
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:57,180
They are making slaves of my people.

282
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:59,685
Germans? Nazis!

283
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:03,155
Man like that with Boy! Come, quick.

284
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,660
And now can you do this?

285
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:51,934
Cheeta, give me that coil.

286
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,703
Cheeta! Cheeta. Give it to me.

287
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:05,278
Cheeta!

288
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:13,052
Cheeta.

289
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,827
Come back here.

290
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:43,823
Come down from there!

291
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:06,238
Boy!

292
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,634
Mr. Sheldon, no! Let Cheeta alone!

293
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:30,193
- Run, Cheeta, run!
- Get away from me!

294
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:48,813
Boy!

295
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:54,786
Boy!

296
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:01,861
Boy!

297
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:08,375
Tarzan!

298
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:16,982
Boy! Boy all right?

299
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:21,481
- Mr. Sheldon, he's trying to kill Cheeta.
- Cheeta?

300
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,414
Cheeta all right?

301
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,581
Buli all right?

302
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,980
Nazi hyena dead now.

303
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:35,554
Tarzan!

304
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:44,171
Zandra? What's she doing here?

305
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,233
Talk later.

306
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,740
- Boy, get medicine.
- Yes, Tarzan.

307
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:08,687
Tarzan...

308
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,465
- Zandra rest now.
- But I can't rest now.

309
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:16,799
- There's so much I have to tell you.
- No talk. Drink!

310
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,170
- But I must tell you. The Nazis...
- Drink.

311
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:29,041
Good. Drink have jungle medicine.
Make sleep.

312
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:31,476
But I don't want to sleep now.

313
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:34,020
Talk tomorrow. Sleep now.

314
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:46,263
She still sleeps. Good.

315
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,994
Isn't she beautiful?

316
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,637
Boy sleep now.

317
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:55,339
But, Tarzan... Where are you gonna sleep?

318
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:57,874
Come.

319
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:09,254
- But that's my bed.
- Boy's bed, Cheeta's bed, Tarzan's bed.

320
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,792
Good thing elephant sleep in corral.

321
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,928
Oh, what I went through.

322
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:27,539
Poor Lieutenant Schmidt and Grüber
and Hans. They are all dead.

323
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:29,041
- Dead?
- Yes.

324
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,807
I found Lieutenant Schmidt's diary,
and when you see the...

325
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,939
Why do I talk to you?

326
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:39,545
Why do you bring me Schmidt's diary
and not the radio?

327
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:42,922
I found his body
at the foot of the escarpment, sir.

328
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,652
And when I read in the diary
about the plane crash, sir,

329
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:47,557
I thought you ought to know
as soon as possible.

330
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:51,325
Idiot. All I want to know is about the radio.
Without it, we'll rot here!

331
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:54,094
But the diary says
the jungle man has the radio

332
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:55,863
and he is worse than a wild beast.

333
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:58,097
I can see I must handle the matter myself.

334
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:01,107
And you will accompany us,
Sergeant, at once!

335
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:03,405
But I'm exhausted, sir. I must have rest.

336
00:41:03,477 --> 00:41:07,846
<i>- Soldiers of the Reich never rest.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

337
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:15,249
But you do not understand, Tarzan.
The Nazis are your enemies, too.

338
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:18,519
- One hurt Boy, tried to shoot Cheeta.
- He dead now.

339
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,991
But the others...

340
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,154
Others leave Boy and Tarzan alone,
Tarzan leave them alone.

341
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,458
But they won't,

342
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:27,365
and as long as they are here,
Boy will never be safe.

343
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,837
Tarzan stay, protect Boy like Jane say.

344
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,874
Oh, Tarzan.
You don't need to worry about me.

345
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:36,239
I want you to go with Zandra
and fight those Nazis.

346
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,538
No!

347
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:39,408
But Zandra saved my life.

348
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,381
Tarzan saved Zandra's life. Pay back.

349
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,715
Tarzan swim now.

350
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:51,689
Don't worry, Zandra.
He'll change his mind about helping you.

351
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,558
Sure he will.
Sometimes he's like that with Jane.

352
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:57,722
But she knows how to get her way.

353
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:00,934
That's it. Come on.

354
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:30,586
Jane.

355
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,328
Smile. Wave to him.

356
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:35,968
Zandra.

357
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,571
Zandra swim?

358
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,704
Go on, swim with him.

359
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,384
Zandra!

360
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:34,018
Oh, this is like paradise.

361
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,217
Tarzan glad Zandra like.

362
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:40,783
Palandria was such a paradise, too,

363
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,358
before they came.

364
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,969
It's working.

365
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,207
It just takes time.

366
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,439
Can you cook?

367
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:04,906
Yes.

368
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:06,174
Come on.

369
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:28,234
Zandra cooked dinner for you.

370
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:36,511
Looks good.

371
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:48,023
- How is it?
- Tastes good.

372
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:53,757
I'm glad you like my cooking.

373
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:59,736
Would you like some more?

374
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,266
More.

375
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,977
I bet Zandra will come over
and cook for us often

376
00:46:07,781 --> 00:46:10,409
after you've driven those Nazis away.

377
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:15,544
So!

378
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,290
What's the matter?

379
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,588
Zandra tried to bribe Tarzan.

380
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:21,650
No!

381
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:52,820
Zandra?

382
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:32,028
- Good morning, Zandra.
- Boy, what are you doing here?

383
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,533
I'm just taking my morning walk.

384
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,865
What are you doing up so early?

385
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:40,462
I'm going home, Boy,
back to my own people.

386
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,805
But you can't go through the jungle alone.

387
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:47,108
You know, if Tarzan's so stubborn
about it, I'll help you.

388
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,045
Tarzan would be angry, Boy.

389
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,913
Please let me go with you.

390
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:53,475
I'm a good shot with my sling.
I have a knife.

391
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:55,215
I can fight the Nazis.

392
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,147
I know.

393
00:47:58,325 --> 00:48:00,190
You are my little friend.

394
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:03,761
If I ask you to do something for me,

395
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,889
- will you do it?
- Sure.

396
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,194
Then go back.

397
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:10,060
Zandra will never forget.

398
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,031
Goodbye, Boy.

399
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,620
Tarzan, Tarzan!

400
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,326
Zandra's gone!

401
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,820
Zandra?

402
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:40,422
Gone?

403
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:44,600
- Where?
- She's on her way home alone.

404
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,070
Boy stay. Tarzan get.

405
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:07,583
We've got a fearful climb
ahead of us, Colonel.

406
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:11,722
- Couldn't we rest just a minute or two?
- Certainly not. We proceed at once.

407
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,298
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

408
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:27,373
Zandra!

409
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:36,513
- Why Zandra leave now?
- My place is in Palandria.

410
00:49:36,623 --> 00:49:38,648
- Zandra stay here.
- No, Tarzan.

411
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,158
Tarzan say yes.

412
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,458
- I must return to help my people.
- Come back till Nazis go away.

413
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:45,225
They will never go away.

414
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:46,663
I must go.

415
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,594
Zandra very stubborn.

416
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,467
Tarzan know best.

417
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,210
Come, please.

418
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:11,313
I tell you, I don't know!

419
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:13,359
You little devil.

420
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,794
- Where is the coil of that radio?
- I tell you, I don't know.

421
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:18,592
Tell me!

422
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:22,157
- Sergeant, bring him here.
- Yes, sir.

423
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:23,497
Come on!

424
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,372
Not so rough, Sergeant,

425
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:28,440
you'll hurt the boy.

426
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:31,170
Well, I can see you're quite
a bright little fellow.

427
00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:32,575
We don't mean you any harm.

428
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:35,672
We only want the radio part,
so that we can talk to our people.

429
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:37,944
I don't know anything about it.

430
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:40,543
- Colonel, it's not here, sir.
- You have searched everywhere?

431
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,349
We've torn the place apart, sir.

432
00:50:42,422 --> 00:50:44,686
You force me to be unpleasant.

433
00:50:58,538 --> 00:50:59,698
Boy!

434
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,275
Hurry, Tarzan, hurry.

435
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,812
Very well.

436
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:18,047
- Where is Zandra and that jungle man?
- I don't know.

437
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:26,490
Speak, you.

438
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:39,609
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir.

439
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,170
He is coming. Let us welcome him.

440
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:43,238
Yes, sir.

441
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,970
Tarzan, go back! Go back, go back!

442
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,027
Boy!

443
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:07,598
Open fire.

444
00:52:07,808 --> 00:52:08,900
Open fire.

445
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:22,510
Tarzan!

446
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,720
- I am sure he fell here.
- Oh, no, sir. He couldn't have.

447
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:03,524
See those monkeys playing?
They would've been frightened off.

448
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:07,465
He must have fallen into the ravine,
and that's the end of him.

449
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:09,229
You should've been
in the Gestapo, Sergeant.

450
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:11,930
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah, you are always so sure.

451
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:14,939
Bring the boy.
We return to Palandria at once.

452
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:16,134
- He'll talk.
- Fall in.

453
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,531
Cheeta!

454
00:53:59,552 --> 00:54:00,541
Tarzan.

455
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:01,945
Tarzan.

456
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,452
He's alive, Cheeta. Alive.

457
00:54:40,894 --> 00:54:42,623
I'm here, Boy.

458
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:45,156
- Boy.
- Tarzan.

459
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,558
Zandra.

460
00:54:54,307 --> 00:54:56,275
Tarzan dream.

461
00:54:56,343 --> 00:54:58,072
You had a terrible fall,

462
00:54:58,144 --> 00:55:01,272
and I gave you the jungle medicine
to make you sleep,

463
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:03,680
just as you gave it to me.

464
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:05,648
Now Tarzan remember.

465
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,375
Nazis.

466
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:09,420
Where Boy?

467
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,020
They took him away, Tarzan.

468
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,950
Took away? Boy?

469
00:55:30,143 --> 00:55:32,703
Now Tarzan make war.

470
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:07,875
- Tarzan go find Boy now.
- I'm going with you.

471
00:56:08,014 --> 00:56:10,915
No, Zandra safe here. Tarzan bring Boy.

472
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,445
Cheeta!

473
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:50,531
Tarzan.

474
00:58:51,544 --> 00:58:53,239
Boy all right?

475
00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:15,768
So the jungle man lived, huh?
Drop that knife.

476
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,966
I said drop it!

477
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:21,303
Sergeant, shoot the boy
if he makes another move.

478
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:22,466
Yes, sir.

479
00:59:31,918 --> 00:59:34,216
- Tie them both up, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:37,155
Come on, you.

481
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,456
Over here.

482
00:59:44,297 --> 00:59:46,390
Stand, or I'll fire.

483
00:59:50,536 --> 00:59:53,300
Well, good man, Carsten.

484
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:56,837
- Bring her to my headquarters.
- Yes, sir!

485
01:00:10,723 --> 01:00:12,520
Did you bring the radio part with you?

486
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,734
Where is the radio part?

487
01:00:25,605 --> 01:00:27,038
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

488
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:30,507
See that the guard is doubled immediately
and if they still remain stubborn,

489
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:32,510
order a firing squad
for 6:00 in the morning.

490
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:33,567
Yes, sir.

491
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:43,679
Remember, jungle man,
the strong always win!

492
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,796
Tarzan, what is a firing squad?

493
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,534
It is I who am to blame,
Colonel von Reichart.

494
01:01:03,443 --> 01:01:07,345
They have chosen to defy the power
and dignity of the Reich, my dear.

495
01:01:08,314 --> 01:01:11,772
They must be shown
the inevitable consequences of that.

496
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:15,651
If you must make an example of someone,
make it of me.

497
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:18,189
Take my life instead of theirs.

498
01:01:20,693 --> 01:01:22,661
My dear Zandra,

499
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:25,027
you are very courageous.

500
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:27,928
But very, very foolish.

501
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:30,359
I don't want your life, Zandra.

502
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:33,970
All I want is your friendship
and companionship,

503
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:36,134
and if you'll give them to me

504
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:38,541
we will share the glory
of the new day together.

505
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:44,880
Sergeant!

506
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:48,376
Sergeant!

507
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:50,250
Yes, Colonel.

508
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:54,392
The young lady wishes
to join her friends, Sergeant.

509
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:55,683
Yes, sir.

510
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,388
Come.

511
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,628
The rope is strong.

512
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:08,429
Get in here!

513
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,370
Zandra.

514
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:16,471
Why Zandra not wait like Tarzan say?

515
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,744
I had to try to help you.

516
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,618
Oh, Tarzan, forgive me for bringing
this trouble on you and Boy.

517
01:02:22,688 --> 01:02:25,521
Nazis bring trouble, not Zandra.

518
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:00,455
Release Zandra!

519
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,105
This revolt shall be punished.

520
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:17,972
Take every tenth man.

521
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,877
They will die before a firing squad
in the morning.

522
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:09,924
- Don't take him away.
- Father.

523
01:04:09,996 --> 01:04:11,725
- Open up!
- Come out.

524
01:04:11,797 --> 01:04:14,265
Please let him go. Please!

525
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:21,802
Master of the Sun,
our eyes are turned to you.

526
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:26,777
For in this dark hour
we are bereft of all human aid.

527
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,346
Therefore, we humbly beseech you

528
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:33,283
for deliverance of those
who are soon to die.

529
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:02,777
Ten minutes more,
and the firing squad will relieve us.

530
01:05:19,632 --> 01:05:21,600
It's no use. She can't do it.

531
01:05:28,374 --> 01:05:31,104
Tarzan sent her to try and get his knife
from the Sergeant.

532
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,269
But he'll kill her.

533
01:05:34,246 --> 01:05:36,544
Yes, Colonel von Reichart. Yes, I'll come...

534
01:05:36,616 --> 01:05:37,605
What...

535
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:45,017
I'll get you. I'll get you.

536
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:53,359
Good Cheeta.

537
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:47,518
- Come.
- Wait.

538
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,386
Take gun. Kill Nazis.

539
01:09:37,957 --> 01:09:41,085
LZX calling Berlin. LZX calling Berlin.

540
01:09:42,361 --> 01:09:43,521
Fight Nazis!

541
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,740
<i>Herr Colonel, the jungle man.</i>

542
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,742
Take care of this.
It's our only chance of getting help.

543
01:11:00,272 --> 01:11:01,261
Bausch.

544
01:11:08,147 --> 01:11:09,136
Bausch.

545
01:11:51,323 --> 01:11:52,312
Look!

546
01:12:43,675 --> 01:12:44,664
Nazi!

547
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,601
Nazi!

548
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:18,202
Nazi!

549
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:55,242
LZX calling Berlin.

550
01:13:55,414 --> 01:13:57,041
LZX calling Berlin.

551
01:13:57,249 --> 01:13:59,911
LZX calling Berlin. Go ahead, Berlin.

552
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,174
Nazi.

553
01:14:01,987 --> 01:14:02,976
Nazi.

554
01:14:03,255 --> 01:14:04,244
Nazi.

555
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:15,157
Tarzan here, Nazi.

556
01:14:21,173 --> 01:14:22,333
Gun no more good.

557
01:14:33,418 --> 01:14:34,942
Take knife, Nazi.

558
01:14:39,992 --> 01:14:41,516
Come, Nazi.

559
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,393
Here, Nazi.

560
01:14:54,173 --> 01:14:56,198
In jungle, strong always win.

561
01:14:57,509 --> 01:14:58,669
Tarzan!

562
01:15:01,947 --> 01:15:03,312
Tarzan!

563
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:04,938
Zandra!

564
01:15:05,384 --> 01:15:06,373
Boy!

565
01:15:09,354 --> 01:15:12,016
<i>Come in LZX, Berlin calling.</i>

566
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:13,858
<i>Come in.</i>

567
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,951
<i>Berlin calling LZX.</i>

568
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:18,189
<i>Come in LZX.</i>

569
01:15:24,169 --> 01:15:26,160
- I've got them now.
- Good.

570
01:15:29,841 --> 01:15:32,241
General Hoffman,
we have contacted them.

571
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:36,512
I'll talk to them myself.

572
01:15:40,852 --> 01:15:43,753
Come in, Colonel von Reichart.
Here is General Hoffman.

573
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,794
Idiot!

574
01:15:57,002 --> 01:15:58,629
It is not von Reichart.

575
01:15:58,737 --> 01:16:00,102
<i>It is der Führer.</i>

576
01:16:01,206 --> 01:16:02,537
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

577
01:16:14,953 --> 01:16:15,942
English
