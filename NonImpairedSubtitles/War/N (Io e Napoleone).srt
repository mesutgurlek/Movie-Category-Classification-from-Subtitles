1
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,280
NAPOLEON EXILED
TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA

2
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
Portoferraioo March 4o 1814.

3
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Same dream again.

4
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,400
The foulo bloodthirsty beast
is reigning over the island...

5
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
that's been reduced
to a heap of corpses...

6
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,480
and I kill him!

7
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Good morningo Master Martino.

8
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,440
Your sister ordered me
to bring you breakfast...

9
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,120
Good morning, Master Martino.
Your sister ordered me...

10
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,640
Good morning, Master Martino.

11
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I wonder about the recondite meaningo
perhaps a sign of fate...

12
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,080
- What is it?
- Your sister...

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm not hungry!

14
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,320
- Ordered me...
- Take it away.

15
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,400
Which draws me to...

16
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,240
- To bring you breakfast. Good morning.
- Did you hear me?

17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,920
- Yes.
- Well?

18
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,120
Yes.

19
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,240
Close the door.

20
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,640
Which draws me to the object
of my sacred hate.

21
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Martino, you'll be late for class!

22
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
Why are you standing around?
Bring him breakfast...

23
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
- and help me with the mattresses.
- Yes.

24
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,200
Dunce, I'll come back
with the hatchet!

25
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
Sir Ferrante,
he said he isn't hungry...

26
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm going to give
your sister a hand.

27
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,560
- What did she say?
- I don't know.

28
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,440
Mad.

29
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,120
NAPOLEON AND ME

30
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,040
Good morning.

31
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,840
Hello.

32
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,240
- Good morning, how are you
- Fine, thanks.

33
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,480
- Good morning, buy something.
- I'll be right back.

34
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,080
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

35
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
Come on, come on!

36
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,520
So, the arrogant,
reactionary ogre...

37
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,520
asked Buchettino:
"How did you climb up there?"

38
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,960
Buchettino,
who was a free spirit...

39
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,720
responded... colon...

40
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,560
open quotation marks.

41
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,600
"I'd be a dullard to tell you!

42
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,520
You'd climb up here and eat me."

43
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,320
Close quotation marks.

44
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,240
- Pietro, bring me that paper.
- Me?

45
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,400
Yes, come here. Let me see.

46
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,880
- But I didn't do it.
- What is this?

47
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,600
The Army of Elba, he said so.

48
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,880
Bruno, who might this be?

49
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,200
- Our new king, sir.
- Since when do we have a king?

50
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,080
Napoleon will become king of Elba!

51
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,320
Napoleon?
For your information...

52
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,520
Napoleon is coming here in exile!

53
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,160
From the Latin word exilium...

54
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
which means, out of the city.

55
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,560
He was thrown out
because he's a scoundrel...

56
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,680
and thus, will be tried
and executed.

57
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,640
He deserves any death he gets.

58
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,680
- Why, Ferruccio?
- He's an arrogant reactionary.

59
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,560
Like the ogre of Buchettino, worse!
Marcellino!

60
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,480
- Because he's a dunce!
- Yes! You.

61
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,880
He's a lump of poo.

62
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,760
- Yes!
- He's a son of a gun!

63
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
- You.
- Son of a pig!

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
- You.
- Piece of poo!

65
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
- You.
- He's a fart!

66
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,440
- You.
- Piece of shit!

67
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,160
Worse! He's a traitor, tyrant,
and assassin.

68
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,240
An assassin who killed
thousands of young people.

69
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,560
In one single battle,
12,000 people died...

70
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,560
12,000 is the population of Elba.

71
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,720
Imagine our island deserted.
Everybody dead.

72
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,200
King my foot,
he'll get the reception he deserves...

73
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,960
he'll be booed!

74
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,840
Rotten cauliflower in his face!

75
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,440
Dead cats and rotten onions!

76
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,720
Good morning, sir.

77
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,160
I warned you, Master Papucci...

78
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,880
leave your political ideas
outside the classroom.

79
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,040
- Are you unable to do that?
- It's painfully difficult.

80
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,960
I don't intend to make you suffer,
Master Papucci...

81
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,720
so go outside with your ideas
and say goodbye to your pupils...

82
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,560
who are no longer.

83
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,520
- Pupils?
- Yours!

84
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
Leave. You can leave now.

85
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,040
Forever?

86
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,720
In aeternis.

87
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,520
Okay.

88
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,480
I thank you.

89
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,720
Dear children...

90
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,440
goodbye.

91
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Remember, rotten onions!

92
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,680
Now, children, hands folded.

93
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,920
"Salve regina,
mater misericordiae..."

94
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Come, Uncle Egisto
will introduce you to His Majesty.

95
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,840
May 18o 1814o
the scoundrel has arrived.

96
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,800
At dawno
the English ship "Undaunted"...

97
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,680
anchored off the coast
of Bagnaia...

98
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,560
he set foot on the island
this morning.

99
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
I tooo wanted to look at his face...

100
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,640
so I joined the crowd of fools
who welcomed him...

101
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,520
with the blessing
of Mayor Egisto Lonzi Tognarini...

102
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,640
Grand Knight of Peckers.

103
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,520
Welcomeo Your Majesty.

104
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,320
I barely caught sight
of his grimace...

105
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,400
more foul than how it has been depicted
by ass-kissing painters.

106
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,000
The crowd is enthusiastic
about something worse than them...

107
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,160
this places more blame on he
who charms and captivates them.

108
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,600
The more they venerate
that bloodthirsty being...

109
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,360
the more I hate him.

110
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,120
Good morning.

111
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,440
- I said good morning.
- Good morning, Ferrante.

112
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,000
Most of the cargo has been loaded.

113
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,360
- Did you see him?
- No, I was busy.

114
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,080
Are you ready?

115
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,400
Brother, I'm confused.

116
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,440
Are you setting sail or not?

117
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,960
They should have cut off
his head...

118
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,400
but instead they make him
our sovereign.

119
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,720
What does that have to do
with your departure?

120
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,400
You're mixing work and politics.

121
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,800
Tell me why! I'm an imbecile!

122
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,160
I consider it philosophically
correct, ethical!

123
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,480
Politics at the expense of others...

124
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,040
removes you from duties
and real life, which is elsewhere.

125
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,640
Elsewhere, in the shop?

126
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,280
You lost your job, you surround
yourself with faded books...

127
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,560
containing no trace of reality.

128
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,400
- Let go of my arm!
- Answer me, are you setting sail?

129
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,840
Is that a question or an order?

130
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,040
If it's an order, let it be clear
that I take orders from no one.

131
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,320
Understand?

132
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
Holy Mary...

133
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,160
Quietly!

134
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,240
- Careful!
- It's your brother's lunch.

135
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Room service! Absurd!

136
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,880
Careful!

137
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,800
- Sorry.
- He's so lazy.

138
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,360
400 bottles of Aleatico wine,
280 by 3 sqm of storage space...

139
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,200
plus these bales of buckwheat.

140
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,200
When your brother's ready,
they'll set sail.

141
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,640
Martino won't go.

142
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,360
You must go, Oreste.

143
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,080
I know your wife is ill...

144
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
My daughter gives birth
at the end of the month.

145
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
- May I speak to you?
- Quiet!

146
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,200
So, it isn't possible?

147
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,200
Master, if you command me...

148
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
If you command him...

149
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,640
You be quiet!

150
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
Go on, I'll see you at the pier.

151
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,480
So I'll have to set sail,
with all the things I have to do!

152
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,200
Try to understand, I want to stay
and see what Napoleon does.

153
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,080
Are you fighting?

154
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,000
Diamantina, your brother won't leave
because he hates Napoleon.

155
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,600
- Yes.
- I hate him too...

156
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,880
but what does that matter?

157
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't feel like leaving
for three months.

158
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,200
I feel uneasy and wary,
I don't know why.

159
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,120
Marseilles, Genoa, Barcelona,
Gibraltar, Lisbon!

160
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,720
- Some people would pay to do it.
- Exactly!

161
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,960
Don't you want to be a writer?

162
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,520
New worlds, customs, traditions.

163
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,440
A writer mustn't go
dawdling around...

164
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,400
he must be the eyes and voice
of his country.

165
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,160
I must stay here
and see what that scoundrel does...

166
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
and bear witness to it.

167
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,920
Uneasy and wary my foot,
I know why you don't want to leave!

168
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
What do you know?

169
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,760
That old, foul,
Miss Big Buns is back.

170
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,400
- Quiet, you idiot!
- I'll speak when I please.

171
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,080
You're no Jacobin,
you're just the Countess's plaything...

172
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,360
and she's a whore!

173
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,120
What are you saying, you idiot!

174
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,000
- She's a Baroness, not a Countess.
- She's not a whore!

175
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,040
How dare you, you spinster!

176
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,160
- How dare you?
- How you dare!

177
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,640
Don't you dare touch your sister!

178
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,280
Dreadful rats!

179
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,120
- You're nothing but beasts!
- What did I do?

180
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,400
So?

181
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,560
Truce! Truce!

182
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
- Truce!
- Truce! Truce!

183
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,920
- Shame on us, we're siblings.
- We're shameful!

184
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,040
What did dad say before he died?

185
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,480
- I know.
- Let's say it again.

186
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,200
- "Be a mother to him".
- "Be a father to him".

187
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,560
Both.

188
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,680
- We love you...
- Yes.

189
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,200
That's why we tell you
to not lock yourself in your room...

190
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
acting as if you were
Dante Alighieri and we were...

191
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,680
- Two lumps of sod!
- Yes.

192
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,520
Now be good, go pack,
and set sail.

193
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,280
No.

194
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,920
- Mirella?
- Yes.

195
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,040
Put all his things in a sack...

196
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,800
and place it outside
because I am leaving...

197
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,240
but you're not staying
in this house, get out!

198
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,360
- Ferrante...
- Don't Ferrante me!

199
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
Do as he says, actually...

200
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,600
I'll do it myself.

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
Farewell!

202
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
Ferrante...

203
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,880
Martino...

204
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,440
What a mess!

205
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,640
Don't go.

206
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,960
- Stop crying.
- I'm not crying!

207
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,880
Don't make things worse.

208
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,720
- I'm not crying!
- That's the way.

209
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
Let's go!

210
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
Farewell, brother.

211
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,480
Goodbye! I'll miss you.

212
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,400
Forgive me.

213
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,680
Hurry up!

214
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
Prepare yourselves!

215
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,840
Arms to the right.

216
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,520
Arms to the left.

217
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,680
- Good morning, master teacher.
- Alas, I'm no longer a teacher.

218
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
Good morning anyway.

219
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Emilia?

220
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,880
Emilia?

221
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,400
- Mr. Martino.
- Is Madam in her room?

222
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,760
In an impossible mood!

223
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,240
Notary Baccelli
and Councilor Mainardi are here.

224
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,120
- She used unkind words with us.
- Bad words!

225
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,960
- You might want to return later.
- Excuse me.

226
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,160
Not again? Please!

227
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,080
That sea voyage was a nightmare,
I was sick to my stomach.

228
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
My grandmother used to say...

229
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,360
"For us residents of Citta di Castello,
the sea gives us rotgut."

230
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,320
I don't want to see anyone,
you handle evetything.

231
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,600
I'll leave the tray and be off.

232
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh my!

233
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,040
Oh my!

234
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,600
I can't believe it's you!

235
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,920
Welcome back.

236
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,640
- Are you angry with me?
- Why?

237
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,040
I didn't inform you I had arrived.

238
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,280
But I'm glad you're here,
I have something to tell you.

239
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,760
Me too.

240
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,360
- I came to say I accept.
- What?

241
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Your proposal
that I move in with you.

242
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,320
- What?
- Remember? Emilia?

243
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,200
You said I could tend the garden
and library...

244
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,480
even in your absence.

245
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,240
Emilia?

246
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,720
- I accept.
- Right, I did propose that.

247
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,880
- Will you help me?
- You don't seem happy.

248
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,360
The only thing I like
about this empire is the style...

249
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,200
Iofty petticoat
that hides the hips and rear...

250
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,520
while the cupolas are on display
for admirers.

251
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,680
What did you want to tell me?

252
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,720
You're so precious
with that prickly beard.

253
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,800
What did you have to tell me?

254
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,640
My dear Martino,
we can no longer see each other...

255
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
we simply can't.

256
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,040
Why?

257
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,400
When a relationship is over,
it's over.

258
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,320
Over?

259
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,560
I'm sorry for throwing cold water
on your flames.

260
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,800
She's arrived,
I'll go there and say I love her...

261
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,080
we'll roll around on the bed
and meet again in 15 days.

262
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,680
Emilia!

263
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,800
I liked it as much as you did.

264
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,040
"He arrives, reads me his poetry
of rhymed couplets...

265
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,400
we'll kiss each other all over...

266
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,800
then I'll return
to my 80-year-old...

267
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,480
asinine Bourbon husband in Naples".

268
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
- Martino?
- Yes.

269
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,720
Come here.

270
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,880
Here I am.

271
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,120
We're selling it all:
Villa, farm, and mines.

272
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,760
- Selling, when?
- Now, right now.

273
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,960
The Mayor of Porto Longone,
who now goes by Maire...

274
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,880
is buying on behalf of His Majesty.

275
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,560
For him,
small Napoleon is a big deal.

276
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,880
- Another sign?
- Sign of what?

277
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,920
- Nothing.
- Come on, smile!

278
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,280
Don't make that gloomy face
or I'll become sad.

279
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,480
- Shall we toast with champagne?
- At this hour?

280
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,560
- I never expected this.
- I'm sorry.

281
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,240
I'll call for some champagne.
Pascalina?

282
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
So for you, I'm just...

283
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,800
A fortnightly whim?

284
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,200
A fortnightly whim... that's right.

285
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,840
Since you're kind and good,
you'd suffer if I suffered?

286
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,000
- Of course.
- Sure.

287
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,840
Don't bother suffering,
I think the same thing you do.

288
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,880
Goodness, what do I think?

289
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,720
For serious reasons,
I too must say farewell forever.

290
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,880
Goodbye!

291
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,000
- You called?
- Get out! Now!

292
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,720
- Sincerity is wonderfulo Martino!
- My goodness.

293
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,720
I agree.?

294
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,600
- Pig!
- Are you mad?

295
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
You sure seized the opportunity!

296
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,200
Your false,
cowardly, petty sincerity!

297
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,080
- And yours?
- A pitiful lie.

298
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,760
Actually, a pathetic lie, for me!

299
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
How humiliating!

300
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,800
Emilia?

301
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,480
- Leave!
- Let's be clear.

302
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,280
What's there to clarify, Casinoski?

303
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,440
I had a Russian servant whom I called
Cretinoski, he liked it.

304
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
I know.

305
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,840
What's there to clarify,
you're 19 and I'm 40!

306
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm 21!

307
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,600
I thought: "Next year my breasts
will droop and he'll leave me...

308
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
then what'll I do, kill myself?

309
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
I'll leave him so I won't suffer."

310
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
Next year my foot,
you were already planning it!

311
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,040
There are people waiting for me.

312
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,800
"O goddess,
with time thou hast fled away...

313
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,200
to grievous memories
abandoning me...

314
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,360
and to a future
faced with blinding fear."

315
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,840
I'll sleep here.

316
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,840
Does anyone mind if I sleep here?

317
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,960
I'll sleep here.

318
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,600
It's nice.

319
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,720
"Hear ye, hear ye, on this day...

320
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,440
the Great Knight
Maire Egisto Lonzi Tognarini...

321
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,840
summons Master Martino Papucci...

322
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,440
to present himself expeditiously
to confer with the aforementioned...

323
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,040
at the Town Hall of Portoferraio."

324
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,680
Are you Master Papucci?

325
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,800
Cosimo Bartolini, are you deranged?
Who do you think I am?

326
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,600
I was appointed herald,
I'm just following the rules.

327
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,960
- The Mayor awaits you.
- The Mayor?

328
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,360
Is it true your brother set sail
because you wouldn't go?

329
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,800
- Mind your own business.
- I asked your sister.

330
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,920
Now that Ferrante's at sea
and you've been kicked out...

331
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,840
Diamantina is alone,
so can I court her?

332
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
I've always been fond of her.

333
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,240
Be the personal librarian
and secretary of Napoleon?

334
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,200
His Majesty seeks
a man of letters...

335
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,680
he can dictate his reflections to.

336
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,920
The Mayor suggested my brother?

337
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,720
The pay is rather lavish...

338
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,160
there's also the privilege of being
in His Majesty's presence daily.

339
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,880
You don't know Martino,
he'd rather...

340
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
- Found him, may we see the Mayor?
- Martino?

341
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,400
- Here he is.
- Come along.

342
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,600
- Please.
- Monsieur le Maire, Master Papucci.

343
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,800
Come on in, please.

344
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,400
Sir Mayor, I'll wait right here.

345
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,800
Dearest Diamantina, see?

346
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,560
- My goodness.
- The Mayor and I are friends.

347
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,120
Who would've guessed?

348
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,520
It's the right moment...

349
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,520
we're a state with an Emperor
as king, we're set.

350
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,240
Hence, time to start a family...

351
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,480
What are you saying?

352
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,040
If I weren't me and they asked me...

353
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,000
"What do you think of Diamantina
and Cosimo together?"

354
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,240
I'd say: "Great match!
Great match!"

355
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,560
For what?

356
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,080
At the St. Anna feast, we danced...

357
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,400
and I stepped on your gown,
you said, I remember it well...

358
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
"Damn you, may you die!"

359
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,840
- So?
- You weren't indifferent toward me.

360
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,440
Very, very...

361
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,240
yes, very good.

362
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's go give the good news
to Monsieur Drouot.

363
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,160
- General?
- Yes.

364
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,520
Master Papucci accepts
with great honor.

365
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,200
Really? Well, welcome on board.

366
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,880
I thank you,
for this fortuitous occasion.

367
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,000
As you see,
Elba has more than miners...

368
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,600
fishermen and farmers.

369
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,160
You'll begin tomorrow, you may go.

370
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
- General?
- Goodbye.

371
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,720
- Martino, wait.
- Excuse me.

372
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,480
Now, let's take care of...

373
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,280
Wait!

374
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,600
- You said yes?
- So what?

375
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,800
- Aren't you coming home?
- I was thrown out.

376
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Martino...

377
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,080
Woe is me...

378
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,960
I remember when we were tots...

379
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,160
you threw a rock at my nose,
I still have the bump.

380
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,840
It was then I realized
we were made for each other.

381
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,640
Good, don't respond hastily...

382
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,560
important decisions
must be pondered long and hard.

383
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,200
What a woman!

384
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,480
Maestro Fontanelli?

385
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,520
Argus, where is your master?

386
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,960
He translates Shakespeare!
Well...

387
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,520
Maestro?

388
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,720
- Maestro, how are you?
- It's been so long!

389
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,520
- I must speak to you.
- We'll have crudites with oil.

390
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,520
Jacopo kills himself...

391
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,320
for believing
Napoleon would free Italy.

392
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,560
I think Jacopo
should've killed him...

393
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,480
the paladin of liberty
turned despot and assassin.

394
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,240
Are we correcting books?
Changing endings?

395
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,720
Change the title too: "The Second
to Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis".

396
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,840
Martino!

397
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,680
You seem troubled, what happened?

398
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,840
You were thrown out of your home,
fired from work...

399
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,520
you dream of killing Napoleon.

400
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,120
What did you come to tell me?

401
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,480
Troubled?

402
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,480
My recurring dream
he gets sent here of all places...

403
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,200
- and finally...
- Finally what?

404
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,600
My date of birth,
September 9th...

405
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,040
is the same as Harmodius's,
the assassin of the tyrant Hipparchus...

406
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,800
you pointed it out to me.

407
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,200
Harmodius! Come now!

408
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,520
Do not laugh, these are
unmistakable signs from destiny...

409
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,040
the gods are trying
to tell me something...

410
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,880
If gods did exist,
do you think they'd waste time...

411
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,680
sending signs to Martino Papucci
of Portoferraio?

412
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Your head is full
of harebrained ideas.

413
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,520
You're the one who put them there!

414
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,160
You must not only love liberty,
but also your fellow man...

415
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,360
whoever he may be,
or else anyone could say...

416
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,480
"Since I love liberty,
I'll kill anybody I want to."

417
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,240
It sounds like
you've changed your ideas.

418
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,680
Explain this rubbish to me, reason.

419
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,680
Death to the tyrant...

420
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,360
you once approved of this thought.

421
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,840
Thoughts are thought,
it's not obligatory to act on facts.

422
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,360
Damn it!

423
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,680
I'm amazed at you,
you were in Paris in '89...

424
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,280
you lost a son,
a volunteer soldier, in Marengo...

425
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,480
he has no tomb
for you to weep upon.

426
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,880
How dare you say such things,
you beast!

427
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,640
You think I'm bursting with pride...

428
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,160
because the Emperor
is honoring us with his presence?

429
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Think what you will,
you break my heart but I don't care.

430
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,520
You've lived twenty years,
which isn't enough...

431
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,840
to toss them upon the heap
of other corpses who died in vain.

432
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,680
Go back to your family
and be at peace.

433
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,560
- The door is there, leave!
- Alright.

434
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,480
- You've truly disappointed me.
- Out! Out!

435
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,240
Is that you? You startled me!

436
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,520
I came to get some books.

437
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,160
Wait!

438
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,160
Please, don't leave me alone!

439
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Don't leave me alone.

440
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
- Why are you crying?
- You always leave me here alone.

441
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,600
My dear sistero
my faraway brother...

442
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,880
father was right.

443
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,600
You were more than a mother
and father for me.

444
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,840
But for youo I was never a son
or affectionate brother.

445
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,680
Destiny has handed me
a more burdensome task...

446
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,240
which you'll learn of
upon reading these words.

447
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,080
I don't expect your forgivenesso
but I beg you for mercy.

448
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,200
You're here, good thing!

449
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm leaving.

450
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,320
- Good day.
- Farewell.

451
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,000
That which led to such a firm
decision for a nature like mine...

452
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,160
which never shined
because of this...

453
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,120
was the disdain
for his ominous undertakings...

454
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,360
for the bloodbath
he dragged Europe through...

455
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,200
for having imposed
his hideous persona...

456
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,880
upon each of us
to venerate or hate.

457
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,320
Furthermoreo for the Italian
patriots he betrayed.

458
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,520
Henceo for all of this...

459
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,320
I raise a castigatory hand
to obliterate him.

460
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,000
What pretty words,
I don't understand a thing!

461
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,720
As for your childreno
which I hope you'll have someday...

462
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,600
I beg you to tell them their uncle
immolated himself for their freedom.

463
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,320
With loveo your brother Martino.

464
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,640
Yes, "immaculated",
like the Virgin Mary.

465
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,800
Not immaculated, immolated.

466
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,760
Luigina, what does obliterate
and castigatory mean?

467
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,360
I have no time for such things.

468
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,840
Good morning.

469
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,760
I am Martino Papucci.

470
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,480
- Sir, follow me, please.
- Excuse me, sir.

471
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,400
This way.

472
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,360
His Majesty
is very anxious to meet you.

473
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,680
Come on.

474
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,560
Please, this is the new librarian,
Martino Papucci.

475
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,520
Search him.

476
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,560
That's not necessary.
He's only the librarian.

477
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,480
Go in.

478
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,520
Please.

479
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,040
- I'm only the librarian.
- True.

480
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
I am Martino Papucci,
kindly announce my presence.

481
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,280
Please, announce my presence.

482
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,920
You've been announced, lad.

483
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,400
You are requested to reorganize
documents and memos...

484
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,920
by era and topic...

485
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,680
and to transcribe reflections.

486
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,760
It's a tranquil task
I will carry out with pleasure...

487
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,800
with your help, Marchino.

488
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,120
Martino.

489
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,960
- Nice name.
- Thank you.

490
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,280
Always have pen and paper in hand.

491
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,360
You look at me?

492
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,320
Is there something excessive?

493
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,120
Is there something missing?

494
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,200
Speak.

495
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,200
More paunch, less hair?

496
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,760
Eyes... do I still have eagle eyes?

497
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,280
Between you and me...

498
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,680
I don't believe
I ever had eagle eyes.

499
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,800
Enough!

500
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,360
In the morning, I will tend
to useless and important issues.

501
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,000
In the afternoon,
we will work here each day.

502
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,720
It's past noon and I am hungry.
Are you?

503
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,520
Please, lemonade!

504
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,360
Lemon stimulates the appetite
and stops water from fermenting.

505
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
Hence, the abdomen doesn't swell.

506
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,680
- Leave now.
- Yes.

507
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,000
Martino is my name!

508
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,080
I even took off my hat!

509
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,600
Would you announce me?

510
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,400
Idiot!

511
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,640
Moron!

512
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,640
Imbecile!

513
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,280
He didn't "oblisterate"
or immolate himself, thank you!

514
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,200
Dish of the day, please.

515
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,080
Today we have macaroni
with sausage and broccoli...

516
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,560
a delicious dish!

517
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,720
- Well?
- What?

518
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,920
- Did you see him?
- Who?

519
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,640
Him! What's he like?

520
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,920
- What do you think he's like?
- Did you speak to him?

521
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,600
Seems he wants
a troop of guards from Elba.

522
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,400
Put in a good word for me...

523
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,280
No need to, he'll enlist anyone,
elderly and children.

524
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,040
There'll be lots of work...

525
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,600
he wants to build
a breakwater barrier.

526
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,640
He'll bring public lighting,
garbage collection.

527
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,000
Since we're becoming
an imperial power...

528
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,800
we'll have to put on airs.

529
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,840
- Bravo.
- That's right.

530
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,160
Imperial power?
What are we, England?

531
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,600
That's an island too!

532
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,360
You'll see how much money...

533
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,760
traffic and commerce come our way.

534
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,080
- It's a miracle!
- A miracle in Elba.

535
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,680
- Not eating?
- I lost my appetite.

536
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,240
It's so delicious.

537
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,480
- What happened?
- He's getting too big for his boots!

538
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,520
That's right.

539
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,560
Where is it?

540
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Diamantina?

541
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,400
Diamantina?

542
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,600
- Yes?
- Where's the key to my desk drawer?

543
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,560
I don't know.

544
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,560
You're obsessed
with being the key master!

545
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,400
I said I don't know.

546
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,040
Why don't you look for it?

547
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,160
You're always trying to take care
of everything.

548
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,040
- What did he say?
- I didn't fully understand...

549
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,880
Why doesn't that path
follow the coastline?

550
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,520
Well actually...

551
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,040
it's always been that way.

552
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,120
Perhaps because
the terrain below is rocky...

553
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,200
while up here it's smooth.

554
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,160
We'll blast through the rock,
ever heard of black powder?

555
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,720
We'll straighten out the path.

556
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,440
Pure genius!

557
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,040
Genial! Genial!

558
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,240
It'll take half a day less
to go from Portoferraio to Marciana.

559
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,960
- Extraordinary.
- Extraordinary.

560
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,080
- How come you never thought of that?
- That's right.

561
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,200
We never thought of that...

562
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,240
Inspector, architect, surveyor...

563
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,520
- descend...
- Yes, sir.

564
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,080
- Observe...
- observe...

565
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,400
- measure...
- measure...

566
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,960
and straighten the path!

567
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,360
On the double!

568
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,360
Aren't you going?

569
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,080
Your Majesty,
I'll dash right down there!

570
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,520
Hey, wait for me.

571
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,640
There, got it!

572
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,520
If it were clearer
I'd be able to see the coast.

573
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,680
Corsica.

574
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,920
My brothers and I would hunt
for seashells...

575
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,880
to give to mother.

576
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,680
Careful, step away from there...

577
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,880
this wind is dangerous.

578
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,880
I was looking for a pencil.

579
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,000
It's true, our only happy moments
are from childhood...

580
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,640
but recalling them is sad.

581
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,440
The day we lose our passion
for seashells...

582
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,640
a passion for ourselves sets in...

583
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,160
which leads us toward vanity...

584
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,320
until death.

585
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,080
Today's compendium?

586
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,360
- Compendium?
- Read me what I said.

587
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,240
- "Blast through the rock..."
- No, my thoughts!

588
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,680
"A throne is nothing
but a velvet adorned platform."

589
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,120
Next one.

590
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,000
"France will always be
a great nation.

591
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,560
What else?

592
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,720
Those who have intense
and constant will, always succeed."

593
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,640
Enough. Thank you.

594
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,640
What's going on?

595
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,320
Majesty, there's a crowd.

596
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,680
The road is blocked...

597
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,800
- we'll clear the way.
- Alright.

598
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,920
It's market day.

599
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,080
The market!

600
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Let us go to the market too.

601
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,720
Come, Martino.

602
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,680
Long live Napoleon,
you're number one!

603
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,440
You blow them all away!

604
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,680
Thank you.

605
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,800
- May I?
- Be my guest!

606
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,560
In France we call this "renette".
How much is it?

607
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,480
- Two silver coins for a case.
- So expensive.

608
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,480
For you, they're free.

609
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,320
For him, they're free.

610
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,400
He's Napoleon!

611
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,200
Down with the English,
long live Napoleon!

612
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,760
Look at the eyes of these people.

613
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,440
They see the reflection
of themselves...

614
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,720
and their desire to be uplifted.

615
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,160
To sum up,
has Napoleon chosen the multitudes...

616
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,200
or have the multitudes
chosen Napoleon?

617
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,640
- Well?
- He doesn't want to eat.

618
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,120
- Open up.
- Leave me alone.

619
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,640
You used to despise him,
now you spend all day with him...

620
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,640
and you treat your family
like strangers.

621
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,960
Fine, starve yourself!

622
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,120
What is happening to me?

623
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,120
I hesitate and waste opportunities...

624
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,120
now even my objects are missing.

625
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,080
It's as if the godso
after having incited me...

626
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,920
now enjoy cluttering my course
with obstacles.

627
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,440
Or perhaps
they are testing my will.

628
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,080
I can do it...

629
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,320
Dear Mary! Martino!

630
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,480
Or perhaps they
want to choose the moment...

631
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,480
I must merely be prepared
to receive another sign...

632
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,880
this time it'll be unequivocal
and definitive.

633
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,920
You come along too, lad.

634
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,360
- Where are we going?
- To Pianosa...

635
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,600
reconnaissance and boar hunting.

636
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,160
I think the wind will help us.

637
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,960
Grab the pans, dried codfish,
and onion stew.

638
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,800
Trackers and hunters this way!

639
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,600
Beloved Majesty, notre soleil!

640
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,880
Notary Bonci Baccelli,
historic leader of Elba's hunters.

641
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,960
I yearn for your command!

642
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,560
Let us go.

643
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,640
Let us go.

644
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,560
Your Majesty used to come here
with your esteemed father.

645
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,800
Sadly, it's true.

646
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,760
Our only happy moments
are from childhood...

647
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,600
but recalling them is sad...

648
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,560
because a passion for ourselves
has set in...

649
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,800
which leads us toward vanity...

650
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,120
until death.

651
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,760
That's the meaning of life
in a nutshell.

652
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,800
I'm speechless!

653
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,240
In position for hunting.

654
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,000
On our way, mouths sealed
because boars have keen ears.

655
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,480
As if the boars
are waiting for him!

656
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,720
Two rifles are weighing you down,
give me one.

657
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,640
Thank you.

658
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,720
Isn't that better?

659
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,320
In position.

660
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,240
Let the hunting begin,
unleash the hounds.

661
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,280
If you ask me,
there's something brewing.

662
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,400
- The boars are approaching?
- No way!

663
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,320
The other night
they had us unload a sailboat...

664
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,440
five heavy coffers,
I think they were full of money.

665
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,720
Yes.

666
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,800
They were taken away on wagon
in the night.

667
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,400
I bet they're part of a secret plan
against the English.

668
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,200
Weapons?

669
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,680
There's never been
so much boat traffic...

670
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,600
day and night, as you've noticed.

671
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,600
I have.

672
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,560
I'll go take a look.

673
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,320
Beware of vipers.

674
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,880
Why are you here?

675
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,840
Boars...

676
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,200
There are no boars.

677
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,240
There are no boars.

678
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,280
Positions are there.

679
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,680
- The boars are down there.
- Down there.

680
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,240
If there are any.

681
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,600
The hunt is over.

682
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,960
It's over.

683
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,880
- I'd better take the rifle.
Yes.

684
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,480
Because...

685
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,920
It's beyond meo Your Majesty...

686
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,720
there's usually
an abundance of game here.

687
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,560
At least we got some fresh air,
worked up an appetite.

688
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,360
Aren't you hungry?

689
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,480
I command the troops
to attack the dried codfish.

690
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,920
How funny!

691
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,240
Your Supremacy,
we nominate you honoris causa...

692
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,160
one of us, a rough and tough Tuscan
of the woods and coast.

693
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,120
Hurray!

694
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,760
If Your Supremacy consents,
I'll recite my lyrical poem

695
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,480
about our passion for stomping turf
and hunting game.

696
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,280
- It's lovely.
- Let's start.

697
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,680
"At every minute of the day,
with fervent hearts we make our way...

698
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,520
one eye open, the other closed,
finger on the trigger we are posed...

699
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,160
with attentive ears we prowl,
to hear the boar's growl.

700
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,840
- When suddenly..."
- Short, but effective. Bravo.

701
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,240
- You should write more, let's eat.
- Thank you.

702
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,080
Let's eat.

703
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,480
- He liked it!
- Very much!

704
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,360
Majesty, it's unbelievable,
terrible...

705
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,240
the boars ate evetything.

706
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,400
Nothing works on this damn island!

707
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,920
The bread, salami,
cheese, galantine!

708
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,800
While you were up there,
in one second they came...

709
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,200
Shoot him!

710
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,560
Then we'll roast and eat him.

711
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,560
He was kidding!

712
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,720
He's so funny he slays me!

713
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,840
Lovely...

714
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,320
we're snacking together.

715
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,440
How odd, we attribute grace
to the sparrow...

716
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,520
and fierceness to the lion...

717
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,640
yet they both devour live beings,
insects or lambs.

718
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,360
What's the difference?

719
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,840
Are you not writing?

720
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,760
Should I write that the sparrow
is as cruel as a lion?

721
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,960
If you don't mind.

722
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,720
You were speaking
of fallen soldiers.

723
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,640
The two themes are connected.

724
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,400
Nature says the strongest
overcome the weakest. So...

725
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,640
Write...

726
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,920
During the crucial point of a battle,
he who uses unexpected artillery...

727
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,600
is sure to win...

728
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,520
with no worries of fallen soldiers.

729
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,040
What is it?

730
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,320
How is that possible?

731
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,800
I just told you.

732
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,680
Position the troops
so they're easily gathered.

733
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,320
How is it possible to not worry
about fallen soldiers?

734
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,800
How is it possible to not worry
about fallen soldiers?

735
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,200
War can be written about,
it can't be waged as it's written.

736
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,080
What impedes us from considering
war and death one in the same?

737
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,160
Fear! It obliges us
to think about victory.

738
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,880
Woe is you if you write that.

739
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,960
You cannot imagine the pride...

740
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,120
and desperate joy
of the many people I saw die.

741
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,120
- Thousands of people!
- I know!

742
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,200
Don't meddle in my anguish...

743
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,280
stupid boy, how dare you!

744
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,320
Evetything's fine, thank you Ali.

745
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,640
I'm sorry...

746
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,040
but I can't bear hearing you
apply arithmetic...

747
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,200
to my pain.

748
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,560
Tell Marchand to bring some cognac.

749
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,920
Have you forgiven me?

750
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,440
Of course! Yes, yes.

751
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,320
I've heard some rumors about you...

752
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,640
about our little teacher...

753
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,240
- You rascal!
- The Baroness...

754
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,360
- Can I serve you?
- Sure.

755
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,840
I hear she's rather beautiful.

756
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,840
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

757
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,240
We're friends...
I have the honor of her friendship.

758
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,840
You're quite the gentleman too.

759
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,920
So you're a master in the classroom
and in the bed.

760
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,600
His mother and sister Paolina
are here too.

761
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,200
- They're so stylish.
- It's true.

762
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,360
Silence.

763
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,520
Mr. Papucci?

764
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,720
Mr. Papucci?
This is for you, it's urgent.

765
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,040
We could go eat
some fritters with sugar.

766
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,880
Enough, don't overdo it.

767
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,280
- Be happy that you took me to mass.
- Alright.

768
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,280
Where's that madman going?

769
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:16,960
Martino?

770
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,480
- Some biscuits and sweet wine, why not?
- Stop it.

771
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,920
Where is she?

772
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,800
Hello.

773
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,880
- What a surprise!
- I couldn't resist.

774
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,320
I just disembarked,
I wanted to see your home.

775
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,840
Since I can't see you anymore,
I can picture you in your settings...

776
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,640
in your bed...

777
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,400
with your books, toy soldiers...

778
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,880
your wooden top!

779
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,960
With your rag bear, how sweet!

780
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,480
- What's its name?
- I didn't even know I had that.

781
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,480
- May I keep it?
- Go ahead.

782
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,680
Thank you.
I'll call it Martino.

783
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,680
The cordial you requested.

784
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,800
Thank you.

785
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,400
You may leave, dear.

786
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,280
- Close the door.
- Yes, sir.

787
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,520
Sweet thing, she's in love with you.

788
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,960
- Who?
- The servant, didn't you notice?

789
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,600
Mirella? Oh, please!

790
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,560
Listen to what
I'm forced to hear and write...

791
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,640
"In war the best calculation
of genius is audacity.

792
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,280
An army is a sword
with glory as its hilt."

793
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,280
- Read, it's amusing.
- I hear he's fond of you.

794
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,200
That's absurd, I hate him.

795
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,640
This is sweet: "Love is a folly
acted out by two people".

796
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,520
He's a true expert
of the human psyche...

797
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,360
not just a bloodthirsty strategist...

798
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,080
he's also an expert of medicine,
naval engineering...

799
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,400
and noodle soup.

800
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,880
Let's act out this folly,
me and you.

801
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,520
Make love?

802
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,040
Yes.

803
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,240
What's going on here?

804
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,560
- Madam surprised me.
- Good evening.

805
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,800
Good evening.

806
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,600
A surprise? You surprised me!

807
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,720
- What manners!
- I could say the same for you!

808
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,200
How dare you barge
into someone's room?

809
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,720
Someone who?

810
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,280
Dear Madam,
I'm the lady of the house.

811
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,160
You're a rather boorish
lady of the house.

812
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,120
That's true.

813
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,520
- You're a harlot!
- It's better than being a spinster!

814
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,080
Who, me? I'm betrothed.

815
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,480
- To whom?
- To whomever I want.

816
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,840
To him!

817
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,400
Cosimo Bartolini?

818
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,840
- But I thought that...
- I changed my mind.

819
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,440
He's not a winner,
but most men aren't.

820
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,920
Especially once
you've married them.

821
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,040
- Thank you.
- You should see my husband...

822
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,680
- Why?
- We even hit each other once.

823
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,440
He wanted his mother's portrait
above the bed...

824
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,120
she looks like a witch!

825
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,160
Dearest Diamantina...

826
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,120
excuse me, I'm thrilled
about the news you just gave me.

827
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,480
Simmer down,
the Baroness was talking...

828
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,480
go wait downstairs.

829
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,360
Sure, we'll talk
about our matters after.

830
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,760
Downstairs, you half-witted dope!

831
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,320
Take a seat.

832
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,400
- You were saying about your husband?
- He's never acted his age...

833
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,000
he's 80, remove the zero
and he's 8.

834
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,640
His mother still makes him soup
and feeds him.

835
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,320
- Horrific! Why not leave him?
- And eat bread and flies?

836
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,520
Better a poor husband,
you can leave him with no regrets.

837
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,280
Or even a young handsome one
like Martino.

838
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,240
It's true.

839
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,920
But it's too late for me now,
I'm old.

840
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,200
You're a rosebud!

841
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,960
You've lost weight too.

842
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,200
Out of sadness, seeing my home
half-empty like that...

843
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,680
They've removed
most of my furniture.

844
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,360
Enough whining, I'll leave now.

845
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,920
Why don't you stay the night?

846
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,400
I was invited to stay
with Count Pallavicino.

847
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,360
Head to Marciana at this hour,
no such thing!

848
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:45,720
The sheets are fresh
and the bed is big enough.

849
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,760
- Thank you.
- No, thank you!

850
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,920
I'm honored to have made
your acquaintance.

851
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,200
My respects.

852
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,680
- Good night.
- Good night.

853
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,920
- Martino, behave with the Baroness now.
- Go away.

854
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,480
Why are you here?

855
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,600
I was waiting for that chat
people have...

856
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,000
when they make important decisions.

857
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,920
Move it, you half-wit pinhead!

858
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,320
Will you help me?

859
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,320
Yes. Yes.

860
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,040
Kiss me, this is our last time.

861
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,800
Last time.

862
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,200
This and this.

863
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,440
Will the Baroness be needing this?

864
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,040
Take it just in case.

865
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,040
- Want a hand?
- No, thank you.

866
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,400
Why are you still here?

867
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,320
Go away! Pleaseo go away.

868
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,960
I'll take them inside.

869
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,960
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

870
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,400
Thank you.

871
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,760
You have to hold tight.

872
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,520
Careful with the painting of Baron
Mimi and his beloved mother.

873
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,360
Okay, alright.

874
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,640
Pascalina, hurry we're shivering!

875
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,200
Do you know Martino and I
are no longer together?

876
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,400
Stop it.

877
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,200
When I go back to Naples,
we'll never see each other again.

878
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,000
Stop it.

879
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,120
Isn't he delightful?
Too bad he's always cross.

880
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,240
- Do you know why?
- Enough!

881
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,240
Because he despises Napoleon.

882
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,680
- Enough, what does she care?
- She cares and how!

883
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,040
Pascalina is Corsican,
she was the Bonaparte's servant.

884
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,480
What can I say?

885
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,160
I loved him like a son.

886
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:25,000
Sit down,
tell us what he was like as a child.

887
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,240
What was he like?

888
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,680
A lad who was obedient, kind...

889
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,640
and very sad.

890
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,440
Many a night
I woke up to console him...

891
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,160
because he cried in his sleep.

892
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,920
- How old was he?
- Nine, ten.

893
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,000
But through the years,
he didn't change.

894
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,640
When his father, hoping
to be forgiven by the French...

895
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,080
for having supported
independence...

896
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,360
decided to send him
to military school in Paris...

897
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,560
he was devastated.

898
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,680
He was 16...

899
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,840
he didn't want to go!

900
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,080
He was afraid
of moving to another land.

901
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,400
He was ashamed
he spoke French so poorly.

902
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,400
Poor thing!

903
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,200
I'll bring more water.

904
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,200
Blockhead!

905
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,240
Piece of shit!

906
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,280
Martino!

907
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,360
- What happened?
- A disaster.

908
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,320
Bastard, how can you say such a thing
with that idiotic face!

909
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,440
- Not the onions!
- With the onions.

910
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,600
- Diamantina, what happened?
- Ferrante was shipwrecked.

911
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,480
We don't know that,
I just relayed the news.

912
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,880
With that moronic smile!
"There was a tragic, violent storm...

913
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,240
hope Ferrante's all right."

914
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,960
- He was laughing!
- I didn't want to alarm you.

915
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,880
- I'm sure they're not all dead.
- Shut up, idiot!

916
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,280
- Miserable!
- Not the codfish!

917
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,880
- Miserable! Idiot!
- Easy with the dried codfish!

918
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,640
- Relax.
- That man...

919
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,600
Evetything is fine.

920
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,320
That man brought a curse
upon this island.

921
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:49,280
- Me?
- I'm talking about N.

922
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,120
- N?
- I don't even want to say his name.

923
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,720
Who gave you the news?

924
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,920
Sailors from Livorno
who arrived this morning...

925
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,720
they found the Santa Marina
dismasted near Majorca...

926
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,680
the lifeboat was gone...
I just relayed the news.

927
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,240
- Laughing!
- I wasn't laughing!

928
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,160
One disgrace after another,
now Mirella too...

929
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,840
Why? What does Mirella do?

930
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,880
She doesn't want to stay here,
she left for her grandmother's...

931
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,640
this morning at dawn.

932
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,320
- Why?
- How should I know?

933
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,600
Calm down.

934
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,120
- Calm down.
- Poor Ferrante! I wonder what happened.

935
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,320
What?

936
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,320
It's my fault,
I should've left instead of him.

937
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,600
- It would've been the same.
- Exactly...

938
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,520
- See, he's laughing! He's laughing!
- No!

939
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,840
I'm trying to lift your spirits,
turtledove.

940
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,040
Now that we're engaged,
I feel responsible for you.

941
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,960
Engaged my foot,
the turtledove is dead!

942
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,320
I've changed my mind.

943
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,440
Laugh now you moron!

944
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,120
She dumped me?

945
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,200
She dumped me!

946
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,520
Goodness, my heart...

947
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,200
- No, no, no.
- Sorry.

948
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,200
Carry on.

949
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,200
I'd better not, I'll ruin it.

950
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,520
How proud I was
when they told me...

951
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,520
Beethoven composed it for me.

952
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,720
- Actually...
- I know!

953
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,560
Then he changed his mind,
like many did.

954
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,280
Many...

955
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,240
Write it down.

956
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,560
What?

957
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,680
Napoleon cries.

958
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,480
Write that?

959
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,280
Yes, son, we'll let everybody know!

960
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,360
Write...

961
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,880
On January 23, 1815...

962
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,720
Napoleon Bonaparte
declares himself...

963
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,600
reformed, remorseful...

964
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,720
no, repentant, write repentant
and that's that.

965
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,680
Don't write that's that.

966
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,320
Alright.

967
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,120
You bring out the sincerity in me.

968
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,040
- Ad posteritati notum 'facer'.
- Facere.

969
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,440
Right! Facere.

970
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,560
Latin rouses the anguish
of my days in military school.

971
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,040
There's a notebook
in the secretaire.

972
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,200
Thank you.

973
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,800
"I'm always surrounded by men...

974
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,920
I abandon myself...

975
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:43,400
to the impetus of my dolefulness.

976
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,600
Which way is it facing?

977
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,800
Toward death."

978
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,360
Toward death!

979
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,680
I was 17 and I wanted to die.

980
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,280
I was hateful!

981
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,160
I was ridiculous
with my Corsican accent.

982
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,160
I hated them all.

983
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,240
I hated France.

984
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,960
- I should write this.
- Yes! No...

985
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:22,800
No, write:
"I wasn't fond of France".

986
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,000
No, no, no.

987
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,400
I'm hungry, let's have a snack.
Marchand? Snaks!

988
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,600
Damn!

989
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,680
Am I still the traitor
Beethoven repudiated his love for...

990
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,640
even though I'm now convinced
he was right?

991
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,240
Sit down.

992
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,440
Doesn't repentance count?

993
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,840
Should it be content with itself?

994
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,880
I can tell you're thinking
something.

995
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,000
Say it.

996
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,160
You can't expect repentance
to be rewarded immediately.

997
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,200
That is true...

998
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,000
my friend.

999
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,800
- Aren't you hungry?
- No.

1000
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,800
Watch.

1001
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,360
Sorry.

1002
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,920
Alright. Thank you.

1003
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,160
I guess his Majesty would like to attend
another concert this evening.

1004
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,760
Please, Campbell.

1005
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,360
Please.

1006
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,720
I adore my guardian!

1007
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,120
Colonel Campbell, I adore him!

1008
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,120
- Grab today's work.
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,160
I heard about your brother...

1010
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,360
I had a message sent
to all the harbor offices.

1011
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,360
Thank you!

1012
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,160
Evetything will be fine.

1013
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,360
I hope so.

1014
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,920
- I'll write a few words to my wife.
- Yes.

1015
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,400
I have a wife
and a three-year-old son.

1016
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,360
I'd like my son here, not her.

1017
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,960
He's beautiful and blond.

1018
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:53,560
I wonder what language he speaks,
French or German?

1019
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,240
See you tomorrow, Majesty.

1020
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,320
What is it?

1021
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,560
I thought I saw...

1022
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,800
What is it? Who's there?

1023
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,080
- Come on!
- Alert!

1024
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,200
- Alert!
- Alert!

1025
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,800
What were you going to do?

1026
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,440
Murder! Murder!?

1027
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,800
Let's take him.?

1028
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,960
Call all guards!?

1029
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,040
Come on, don't do that.

1030
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,040
Don't think about it.

1031
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,920
I'm sorry, Emilia.

1032
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,160
I got him arrested.

1033
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,000
Martino.

1034
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,800
My teacher!

1035
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,720
Damn me!

1036
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,120
Madame? We have a visitor...

1037
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:51,800
My God.

1038
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,880
My friend!

1039
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,240
I was searching for you.

1040
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,840
- Ali told me.
- A gift for you.

1041
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,920
It's only mother of pearl, but it's
worth more than what you saved...

1042
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,720
this old shell of a king.

1043
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,520
Heavens!

1044
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:17,640
I come bearing trinkets
in a home which contains a treasure!

1045
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,280
Please excuse the invasion...

1046
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:26,600
it's an old habit of mine...

1047
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,320
I'm honored by your presence.

1048
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,920
- Majesty?
- Yes.

1049
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,280
I know the person
you had arrested.

1050
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,720
I know...

1051
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,400
and I know you care for him.

1052
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,360
He's an exceptional person.

1053
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,160
- He lost his son in...
- Marengo, I know.

1054
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,200
What will you do to him?

1055
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,720
Poor thing,
what will they do to him?

1056
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,440
Nothing. The war is over.

1057
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,280
No more death, no more blood.

1058
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,040
- Am I right?
- Yes, Majesty.

1059
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,680
Thank you.

1060
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,440
My God.

1061
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,640
How are you?

1062
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,600
Fine, thank God!

1063
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,320
I never stopped thinking about you.

1064
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,600
Dearest Pascalina...

1065
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,440
you've always been in my heart.

1066
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,080
What honor.

1067
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,480
Ferrante!

1068
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,840
Ferrante!

1069
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,240
Easy there!

1070
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,960
We were so worried about you!

1071
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,120
You crushed me!

1072
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,560
Big brother!

1073
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,520
- Little brother.
- You stink...

1074
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,920
but you look nice with a beard.

1075
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,000
Let's go home.

1076
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,040
Dearest Ferrante,
we were all so concerned!

1077
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,040
- Bartolini, why the kisses?
- We're family now, tell him.

1078
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,840
Now's not the time!

1079
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,520
- Alright.
- Let's go home.

1080
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,200
- Can I carry your bag?
- You'll carry nothing.

1081
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,320
- What's this about "we're family"?
- Tell you later.

1082
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,840
- It's not set in stone!
- I'll lead the way, enter.

1083
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,320
At one point,
we see a brig pass by...

1084
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,520
we get up and shout out "help"!

1085
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,480
Nothing, we were on our last legs.

1086
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:11,480
When we'd lost hope,
they turned back and came to get us.

1087
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,960
We were elated,
but we get on board and...

1088
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,400
They were pirates!

1089
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,120
The same thing happened
to my mother's uncle!

1090
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:24,360
They sent us below deck, four days
and nights of bread and water...

1091
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,520
we arrive in Algiers. You should see
how nice it is, Martino.

1092
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,120
Nice!

1093
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,920
Even if it was terrifying,
they took us to the medina...

1094
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,240
and sold us to a merchant,
Mustafa...

1095
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,000
a good man!

1096
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,280
He made us unload bales
of fabric day and night...

1097
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,520
but we ate well together...

1098
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,400
there were musicians and dancers...

1099
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,920
what beauties...

1100
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,760
The famous bayadere beauties, right?

1101
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,720
- Would you shut up!
- I'll shut up.

1102
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,920
- Who decided he's family now?
- It's not set in stone.

1103
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,120
Brother, an experience
worth writing a book about.

1104
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,520
- Write!
- I learned lots of Arabic words.

1105
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,720
It means "My love, I love you."

1106
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,680
What were you up to?

1107
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,120
Shut up,
you've never even been there!

1108
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,120
What's going on outside?

1109
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,840
Everybody's running toward
the fortress.

1110
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,000
In positions!?

1111
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,160
Present arms!?

1112
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,280
Brogi?

1113
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,360
Falaschi?

1114
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,120
Foresi?

1115
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,400
The son of Beppe the miller.

1116
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,320
- What's your name?
- Lucianino, Maestro sir.

1117
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,400
- Stop it.
- That's right.

1118
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,280
Aren't you ashamed?

1119
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,320
- The condemned cannot speak.
- Silence! Shut up!

1120
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,520
- He told us to be ashamed.
- Shut up!

1121
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,360
You start off as bootlickers
and end up assassins.

1122
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,240
Look who's talking, Maestro,
you wanted to kill!

1123
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,480
Don't call me Maestro!
Did I teach you to become beasts?

1124
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:46,520
We shouldn't kill anyone,
not even Napoleon, he's done good!

1125
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,640
- Silence! Shut up!
- He's a good man.

1126
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,800
Look at the good he's done to me.

1127
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,600
You asked for it!

1128
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,840
I agree with him,
we shouldn't hurt people.

1129
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Tell it to those cowards.

1130
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,640
I repeated the right ideas to you
over and over...

1131
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,040
but you have heads
and hearts of stone.

1132
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,040
- Stop it! Stay back!
- You shut up!

1133
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,400
He can't speak!

1134
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,120
You think shooting people
doesn't make us suffer?

1135
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,800
- We do it if it's necessary!
- Get ready!

1136
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,960
Obey your commander,
that's all you know how to do.

1137
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:25,120
- Slaves!
Prepare arms! Attention!

1138
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,080
Do as he commands, you duffers!

1139
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,080
Shoot, you animals, you beasts!

1140
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,800
Ass-kissers!

1141
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,040
What are you waiting?

1142
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,040
Shoot!

1143
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,360
Happy now?

1144
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,960
Maestro, did you get
what you wanted?

1145
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,280
No!?

1146
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,400
No!?

1147
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,960
Damn you all!

1148
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,920
Assassins!

1149
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,160
Traitor!

1150
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,000
Assassin!

1151
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,520
Assassin! Assassin!

1152
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,120
Death to the tyrant.

1153
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,680
Long live freedom.

1154
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,240
He fled...

1155
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,240
He fled!

1156
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,720
He fled!

1157
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,280
Where is he?

1158
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:15,880
Where is he?

1159
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,560
Where is he?

1160
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:24,720
Damn him, he pretended he'd construct
roads and buildings...

1161
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,720
Champagne for two!
He must've slept with some whore...

1162
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,840
Dearest Martino...

1163
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,400
I've longed to write you every day
but never had the nerve to...

1164
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,560
so much time has passed...

1165
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,560
who knows how much longer
I'll have to tell you this...

1166
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,720
I allowed myself to be conquered
by the Emperor...

1167
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,840
because I was certain
I had conquered him.

1168
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,120
You fell for it tooo don't deny it.

1169
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,280
That man is conquered
by himself only.

1170
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:47,240
- Enough, I'm getting soaked.
- But so am I!

1171
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,960
You're subordinate, get soaked.

1172
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,840
- Get off your high horse!
- He thinks he's family too...

1173
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:59,120
Boss, all set,
the wagon's almost loaded.

1174
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,600
- Go then.
- It's raining.

1175
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
- So get wet.
- Can't I wait a bit?

1176
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,520
- Go!
- I'll get sick.

1177
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,160
After we fled from Elba...

1178
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,920
in 100 days he formed an army...

1179
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,560
he wono torchedo killed...

1180
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,880
he was defeatedo
and sent to a remote island...

1181
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,400
let's hope it's forever this time.

1182
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,040
But meanwhileo
there were 70o000 more deaths.

1183
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,480
The load for Porto Longone
is setting sail.

1184
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,920
Good job.

1185
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,600
Very well, good.

1186
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,080
I've just finished chapter 54...

1187
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,400
the arrival in Algiers.

1188
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,040
- What chapter did you read up to?
- 50.

1189
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,000
Bravo, thank you.

1190
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,400
18 pages.

1191
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,840
Last night I wrote about
when we were sold at the market.

1192
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,120
You're blocking my flow.

1193
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,400
Talk to me later.

1194
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,280
Here. Martino?

1195
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,440
Remember,
your opinion means a lot to me.

1196
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,840
I've written 300 pages
and my head's still chock-full!

1197
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:04,720
We'll make another trip
for the barrels of Aleatico wine.

1198
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,640
You handle it,
you're good, thank you!

1199
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,240
I'll come for the pages later.

1200
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,080
"Suddenly, a vessel so grand
appeared before our eyes...

1201
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,880
A grand vessel."

1202
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,120
My Waterloo
occurred shortly after his.

1203
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:29,000
If we crossed pathso
you wouldn't recognize me.

1204
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,520
I have gray hairs
and more wrinkles around my eyes.

1205
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,440
I'll take that.

1206
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:40,320
Give me him, you'll scare him.

1207
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,200
He's mine too. Darling?

1208
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,720
Isn't he the spitting image
of my father's uncle?

1209
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:50,800
- You're sick, you half-wit.
- Look at his profile.

1210
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,640
When I feel sado I hope
you're not as precious anymore...

1211
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,240
my dear Martino.

1212
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,880
I hope you've grown bald
and have a potbelly.

1213
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:05,000
If you write backo
I beg you to tell me it is so.

1214
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,560
Actuallyo there's no need to reply.

1215
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,280
Let's forget about it and remain
what we were for each other.

1216
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,000
Farewello Emilia.

1217
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,720
How nice, breakfast in bed!

1218
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,440
Thank you.

1219
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,280
- Did you sleep well?
- He kept kicking!

1220
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,480
You can feel him now.

1221
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,000
He can't wait to get out.

1222
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,560
How odd.

1223
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,880
Where was it again?

1224
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,320
Your sister found it
under the donkey's hay.

1225
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,320
Odd!

1226
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,120
I'm so happy!

1227
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,680
Really, really happy!

1228
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:42,120
GIORGIO FONTANELLI
MAESTRO AND PROFESSOR

1229
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,280
Goodbye, Maestro.

1230
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
"He felt destiny imposed
a new task upon him...

1231
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,240
a definitive task."

1232
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,760
"He said goodbye to his family
and left for St. Helena...

1233
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,320
but he got there too late."

1234
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:51,280
IT WAS MAY 6, 1821

1235
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,280
"...MAN IS NOT RESPECTED
FOR HIS GARMENTS
