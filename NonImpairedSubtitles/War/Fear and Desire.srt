1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,200
FEAR AND DESIRE

2
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,700
There is war in this forest.

3
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,000
Not a war that's been fought,
or one that will be,

4
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
but any war.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,500
And the enemies who struggle
here do not exist,

6
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,000
unless we call them into being.

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,000
This forest, then,

8
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,500
and all that happens now,
is outside History.

9
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Only the unchanging shapes of fear

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,000
and doubt and death

11
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
are from our world.

12
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
These soldiers that you see

13
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
keep our language and our time,

14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,400
but have no other country
than the mind.

15
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Do you think they're looking for us?

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,000
It's one of ours alright.

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,600
He can't see us.

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
But maybe they saw
a plane back there.

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,500
There isn't much left of it to see,
'less it's still burning.

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,000
Even if they could spot us, there isn't
anything they could do to help us here.

21
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah. Six miles behind the enemy lines.

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,000
- Well, that's not too far.
- Not too far?

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,600
In those six miles there's probably
thousand of guys

24
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,000
and every one of them was taught
to shoot at uniforms like this.

25
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,500
If you're so worried about that,

26
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,700
why don't you keep your voice down?

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,900
I'm not worried.

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
What's going to happen, Lieutenant?

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Somebody around who saw
our plane go down.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
They might be looking for us
in the woods already!

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
It'd be a lot easier if ours
knew where to start.

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,300
It isn't very much.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,300
Too bad you fellows didn't get
your rifles out of the plane.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Let's see what can be done.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Once you understand
how a mousetrap works,

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,300
if you're clever enough,
you can use it as a springboard.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,500
Here are the front lines.

38
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,600
From our position just
before we crashed,

39
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,100
we should be in this general area.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
Our own lines are here

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,100
and we should be about here.

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,800
There's a river that runs East
of where we are now, I think.

43
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,000
That river cuts through the front lines
and winds up on our side.

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,700
Now, as I see it,

45
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,300
we could use our reconditioned
mouse trap on the river.

46
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Is that your idea?
To go down the river?

47
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
Yes.

48
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,200
But how? How can we get down it?
I can't swimm very well.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
And Fletcher.

50
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,600
We could do it on a raft.

51
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:52,701
At night.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,900
Well, we'll never make it
any other way.

53
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,500
It's suicide to try to walk out.

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,900
I wouldn't have the vaguest idea
of how and where to start.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,100
This way we'd cruise through together
in a few hours and arrive in one piece.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,250
- Well, by my computations...
- Your computations...

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,550
With your brilliant figuring
that got us here in the first place.

58
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,000
They must be somebody's pet.
It has a collar.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ney, make a better watch dog.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
Seems friendly enough.

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,700
We can't use a mascot
in this trip.

62
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,000
Hurry up! We don't have all day.

63
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,000
If no one has a better suggestion,
let's head for the river.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Some more animals might show up.

65
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,100
It's hard. One foot fights the other.

66
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,500
- Get there, before it burns in
the bushes! - I could do it alone.

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
- Nobody's safe here.
- Are they watching me?

68
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,500
- Getting hungry.
- What's up?

69
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
- They're all scared.
- How hungry...

70
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,300
- Who'll they look out to later?
- Oh, the cracking in my head.

71
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,300
- I bet he was wounded.
- I don't run for no reason.

72
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,700
What's gonna hang
from the trees tonight?

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
- Hurry!
- We'll die in the woods!

74
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
- Don't die here!
- They're scared.

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Alright, alright. Lead them on!

76
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,300
After we get past this road,
the river isn't much further.

77
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,600
Mac! Get down on the road
and take a look.

78
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,300
You know? There's nothing so refreshing

79
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,000
as an afternoon out of doors
in enemy territory.

80
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,800
It's really too bad that the sun doesn't
burn us green instead of brown.

81
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:01,501
Camouflage!

82
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, if you see some strange faces
across the way, wave to them casually

83
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,300
and try to look as native as possible.

84
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Lieutenant!

85
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,800
Lieutenant! Come here.
Bring your binoculars.

86
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,900
- What do you want?
- I'd like you to see something.

87
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,500
Around the river bend.

88
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,750
- What? - I can't make out
exactly what it is,

89
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,600
but I think you'll be interested.

90
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,400
Come on!

91
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,900
Over there.
See?

92
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Looks like some kind
of small air strip.

93
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,900
Yes, you're right.

94
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,418
Lots of rank around.
It looks like a General!

95
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Sure.

96
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,500
A General! He is a General!

97
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Let's get back and help with the raft.

98
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,900
Mac, let's go!

99
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,600
All we need now is Huckleberry Finn.

100
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,800
- This oughtta see us through.
- Yeah, it doesn't look bad at all.

101
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,700
Should we make sure it floats?

102
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,500
Rafts always float.

103
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,200
It's unfortunate that we don't have
a fine bottle to christen it with.

104
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
We could give it a name...

105
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,500
He must have seen us!

106
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,900
If we stay here, we'll get killed!

107
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,600
It's starting to get dark.

108
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,001
Perhaps they didn't see us.

109
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,300
But it's too dangerous
to wait here until we find out.

110
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna get back?

111
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
Hurry up, let's go!

112
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,300
That plane must have landed
down that house we saw before.

113
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,000
What's the difference?

114
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,900
There must be something big
going on down there.

115
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,800
Maybe the General is having
a convention tonight.

116
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
We didn't see this on the way
to the river.

117
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,600
We've been running in a new direction.

118
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,700
Whatever they're jumping,
sure smells good.

119
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,400
Like mother's own.

120
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,300
Those guns look even more jummy
than the food does.

121
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,000
I've got an idea...

122
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,300
No matter what we do from here on,
we're much better off with some guns.

123
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,900
- You better hurry. Others maybe
around. - I'm gonna have some stew first.

124
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,900
Sidney, better grab something to eat.

125
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,600
It may be a long tima 'till our...
next feast.

126
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,000
We better eat something.

127
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,300
How's the stew, Mac?

128
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
Kinda cold, but cold stews
are alright.

129
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Cold stew on a blazing island.

130
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,300
We've just made
a perfect definition of war, Mac.

131
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
That's cocky!

132
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,400
A blazing island with a tempest
of gunfire around it.

133
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,200
Perhaps if we could...

134
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,200
- Somebody must have heard us.
- Grab those guns and let's get going.

135
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,600
- Why did you have to shoot?
- Forget it. Let's move!

136
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,650
We spend our lives running our fingers

137
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:11,400
down the lists and directories,

138
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,300
looking for our real names,
our permanent adresses.

139
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
No man is an island?

140
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,800
Perhaps that was true a long time ago,

141
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,400
before the Ice Age.

142
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,700
The glaciars have melted away
and now we're all islands,

143
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,700
parts of a world made of islands only.

144
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,800
How long are you gonna
hang around here?

145
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
We're in a fine mess now!

146
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,896
I'd give anything to trade places

147
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:27,400
with that dog we chased yesterday.

148
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,619
Seems like whenever people get in a hole

149
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,100
they get to get jealous of dogs.

150
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I admit that our prospects
aren't very cheerful.

151
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,100
But how about going back to see
if our raft is still there?

152
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,700
Look, if we were spotted, they'll have
a trap waiting for us when we show up.

153
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:58,200
It's a chance. Trying to walk out
is as risky today as it was yesterday.

154
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,000
We'll scout around the river
and make certain.

155
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,700
Then, what? Even if we find
the raft there.

156
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,950
Even if none of them
is waiting for us. Then, what?

157
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We have to sit tight until it gets dark,
and hope that we don't have a full moon.

158
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,300
We can sing old songs
if we get restless waiting.

159
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,800
What's the matter, snowcoombs?
I heard that they're cannibals.

160
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:24,000
- So even if we get caught you're
pretty safe. - Leave me alone!

161
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,100
We may be in the woods, McClellan,
but let's try to remain civilized.

162
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,500
Yeah, I suppose you're right,
Lieutenant.

163
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,200
Anyway, there won't be many days
left to be civilized in.

164
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
If we stick around
these woods much longer.

165
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,800
- She'll see us!
- Shut up!

166
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,400
Don't be afraid,
we're not going to hurt you.

167
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,300
She's quite nice.
Don't you think so, boys?

168
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,800
What are we supposed to do with her now?
I've got a wife at home.

169
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,700
I'm afraid she's become
our unvited guest.

170
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,100
I must say I've had worse guests
at better parties.

171
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,800
All right, Corby, all right.
Let's not forget where we are.

172
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,600
"Even if we're lost in the woods
let's try to remain civilized."

173
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,700
Well, we can't stay here.

174
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,000
- Shall we leave her fish here?
- There'll be plenty.

175
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,300
What are you gonna do with her,
Lieutenant?

176
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,650
Give me your belt.
You too, Fletcher.

177
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,400
Please, don't beat her!
She's scared like we are.

178
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,400
She doesn't even talk.

179
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,300
Get a grip on yourself, no one's gonna
punish her. I simply wanna tie her up.

180
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,900
Now give me your belt.

181
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,650
Let's hurry it up.
My arm's getting tired.

182
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,300
Be careful not to hurt her.

183
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,300
I hope she doesn't start screaming.

184
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,500
She's a pretty little thing.

185
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,350
Why don't we just leave her here
and get going?

186
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:32,551
Don't rush me.

187
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,315
If we can make her understand us,

188
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:36,900
perhaps she can tell us
whether they found the raft.

189
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,300
You speak Spanish?

190
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,300
I'll handle this, Sidney. I'm
quite sure she wasn't educated abroad.

191
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,700
You - see - boat?

192
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,000
Our - boat?

193
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,900
- Boat?
- Yes, that's it, boat.

194
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,300
You - see - boat?

195
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,000
Don't tell me
she doesn't understand you.

196
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,950
If she can't tell us anything,
let's let her go.

197
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:27,600
Sure, so she can run down stream
to that command post and tip our hand.

198
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,300
You kids and your ideas!

199
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,300
- Maybe she was going there in the
first place. - With the fish, you mean?

200
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,350
Sure. A general gets what he wants
for dinner, no matter what.

201
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,200
If it's fish cod or fresh strawberrys
or gold plates...

202
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:47,900
This is hardly the time
to become a revolutionary.

203
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,700
We oughtta continue to see about
the raft, but we can't let her go yet.

204
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,350
Why? What she'd do to us? If she could
understand she would have told you.

205
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,900
Mac already told you why.

206
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Sidney, you'll stay here with
the young lady until we come back.

207
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,300
Here, take this.

208
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,200
You're gonna leave me here?

209
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:17,800
Yes, I told you, to watch the girl.

210
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,900
You're gonna make me stay
and then not come back.

211
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,201
I know because of yesterday.

212
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,200
Keep calm, kid!
If we're not back by night

213
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:29,500
just get in touch with
her old man about a wedding.

214
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,400
Maybe you can settle down in a treehouse
and raise some monkeys.

215
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,800
- Leave him alone, Mac. - Remember
you promised to come back, Fletcher.

216
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,000
I want you to stay here
and keep an eye on her, because

217
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:44,901
she may prove very useful
if the raft has been discovered.

218
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,200
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

219
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,000
Just relax.
Don't get panicky.

220
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
See you later, Sidney.

221
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,100
I'm really glad they let me stay.
I'm not fooling!

222
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,800
Please, don't be afraid
to like me.

223
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,200
That's why they let me stay.
They thought you'd like me.

224
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,400
The troops are gone
and I can't go home!

225
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,100
Don't do that! Don't move away,
it's not my fault!

226
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,800
I stopped them from beating you.
Don't scowl.

227
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,500
Watch, I'll make you laugh.
Look, I'm the General.

228
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,300
Hey, watch me!

229
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,400
Attention, the General is here!
Attention!

230
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,400
Glad to have you with us, Sir.

231
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,500
Quite frankly, the situation
is desperate.

232
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,800
I don't think I can cope with it alone.

233
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Isn't funny?
Isn't it?

234
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,100
Orderly, more fat fish that
the girl caught for me.

235
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,200
The General, I'm the General.

236
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,700
You don't even smile.

237
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,300
What do you want?

238
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,100
Listen.

239
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,400
I'm lost...

240
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,000
Lost... on this terrible island.

241
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,900
If you have to hate me,

242
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:49,600
please, try to like me also.

243
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,300
They must have been reading
a magazine in that plane.

244
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,600
I wouldn't have believed.

245
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,900
Mac, better take a look
around the river bend.

246
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:19,700
Be careful.

247
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,900
We'll get to work camouflaging the raft.

248
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,750
I'm a little worried about
Sidney back there with the girl.

249
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,500
I don't like the way he's been acting.

250
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,200
You're not going softheaded and thinking
about taking her along with us tonight?

251
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,000
You're beginning to sound like Sidney.

252
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,700
No. If she can bring three friends,
perhaps.

253
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,000
But as it is, she'll remain lodged
in the forest, like we were.

254
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,900
That must be the one
that almost nailed us.

255
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,650
There he is again. It's him!

256
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:13,600
A cocky little king.

257
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,800
And me holding binoculars
like a lady watching an opera.

258
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,950
Binoculars! Soon he'll
go into his palace

259
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,100
with all his iron lap dogs.

260
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,400
If only this was a rifle sight

261
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:30,450
and I could make the red eye
between his ears.

262
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,900
Then he'd see McClellan!

263
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,400
Girls always love stories,

264
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,900
but it's so hard to finish
and wait for words...

265
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,700
You wanna hear more?
Do you?

266
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,600
Alright.

267
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,900
Then the spirit in magician's power
goes back to the island

268
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,100
and tells Miranda
that her father's dead.

269
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,700
The spirit sings how he's dead
at the bottom of the ocean.

270
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,400
His bones are coral,
his eyes are pearls,

271
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:09,800
and Miranda, her father's dead.
Dead!

272
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,500
Can't you understand anything?

273
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,500
Dead!

274
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
Dead!

275
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,200
Dead!

276
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,000
Now d'you understand?

277
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,800
All clear?

278
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,100
Everything's alright.

279
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,300
- I'd like to talk to you about
the house. - What house?

280
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,950
That house down there.

281
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,500
The one where we saw
that General yesterday.

282
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,100
Wait around, Mac. Right now I'd
like you to go back to Sidney.

283
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
I didn't like the way he was acting
when we left.

284
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,701
I'm a little concerned.

285
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
- But don't you think...
- Do as I say, will you?

286
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,800
As soon as we're through here
we'll join you.

287
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,300
I don't want anything
to go wrong back there.

288
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,500
Here, I brought you some water.

289
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,000
Now you like me, don't you?

290
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,200
I'll get you loose.
Just a minute.

291
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:13,101
You'll put your arms around me.
I know. Wait.

292
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I knew you'd like me.
Just a minute.

293
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,900
Don't run away!
Don't make me stay!

294
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
You're going to tell the General!

295
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
You're gonna tell him
I made fun of him!

296
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,700
Come back, don't tell the General!

297
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,000
I won't let you!

298
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,200
Blood... Blood...

299
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,300
No word. It's just broken
with blood.

300
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,900
What's the matter?

301
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,200
Where's the girl?

302
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,300
Answer me!

303
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,800
What have you done? Tell me
or I'll pulp you to a jelly!

304
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,100
She was tired.
She went to lie down.

305
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,100
Over there.

306
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:25,299
Don't annoy her, Mac.

307
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
Come here.

308
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,900
It wasn't my fault! The magician did it.
Honest!

309
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
Prospero the Magician!

310
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,200
First we're a bird, and then
we're an island.

311
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Before I was a general,
and now I'm a fish!

312
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,800
Hoorah for the magicians!

313
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,000
The river...

314
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,200
It's blood, Mac!

315
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,700
Cold...
Cold...

316
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,400
I'm going for a swim.
Come on in, Mac!

317
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,600
Listen to them...
It's blood!

318
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
What happened?
Where's Sidney and the girl?

319
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
The kid must have gone
out of his head.

320
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,800
When I got back, he was
just laying there.

321
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,300
The girls is dead.

322
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,700
- Over there. He shot her.
- Where is he?

323
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:23,900
He's gone.

324
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,800
He yelled something about
how the magician does it.

325
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,200
Before he was something
and now he's a fish.

326
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,600
Before I could stop him
he ran away towards the river.

327
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,000
- He kept laughing and screaming.
- We can't do anything abut it now.

328
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,100
Let's move again.

329
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,300
I'm expecting the raft to be
the best way to wait 'til night.

330
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,200
I guess there's gonna be more
elbow room than I thought.

331
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,500
Yeah.

332
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,400
And I wanna talk to you about that
house down the river and the General.

333
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
- Kill him.
- Yeah.

334
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,700
No, I won't hear anymore about it.

335
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,800
I don't know what's gotten
into you, Mac.

336
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,900
So you saw a General. So what?

337
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,500
Raft is all set.
In a couple of hours we'll be on it.

338
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Raft!
Raft, raft, raft!

339
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,100
Can't you see any further?
A General... Why, he...?

340
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,800
How many times do I have to go
over this? Must I tell you again?

341
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,500
What's one of their Generals to me?

342
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,200
He's cheap in my rate of exchange,
but our lives aren't.

343
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,400
Your rate of exchange...

344
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,800
You make me laugh!

345
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,600
- If you had any guts... - Look,
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

346
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,800
Forget about the General for a minute.
What about the plane you saw?

347
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,300
That's right!
What about that plane?

348
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,300
We've already been over this.

349
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,300
It looks like a two seater with
that small field built in the clear.

350
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,500
One of us can take the raft down
stream to the field when it gets dark

351
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
and start shooting to draw
the sentries from the house.

352
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,900
The other two can plug that guy
and get away in the plane,

353
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
while I keep 'em busy
from the raft.

354
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
- You?
- Sure, me.

355
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,700
They'd get you.
You'd never make it back alive.

356
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,400
Who else could do it the way I could?
You couldn't.

357
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,200
You'd be riding home sitting down
nice and comfortable up in a cockpit

358
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,200
looking down on what's
going on. Sure.

359
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,500
You'll recite a few tags you picked up
and everything will be alright.

360
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,400
I'll just as soon make the trip
back myself, on a raft.

361
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,700
Do you think you have any chance at all
to get away with it alive?

362
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,700
I don't know.

363
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,000
Here I am.

364
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
I'm 34 years old.

365
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:22,800
I've never done anything
important. Nothing!

366
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,500
When this is over I'll fix
radios and washing machines.

367
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,800
- They'll see.
- Good boy, Mac. That's all.

368
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,400
I don't care if they
got a million Generals.

369
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,000
There's one two miles from here.

370
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,200
If his heist is gonna keep me from
going nuts like Sidney.

371
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,200
Only in a different way,
I'm gonna pull up my own heist.

372
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,600
But why should we?
The raft's still there.

373
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:55,301
As soon as it gets dark, it can take
us all back tonight.

374
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,600
If I draw 'em down to the river,
you and Fletcher can do the job

375
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
and get away in a plane.

376
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,700
What do you say, Fletch?

377
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,300
Well, not that I wanna seem important.

378
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,600
Half the trouble in the world happens
because of what some people do,

379
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,400
but I think half the good things
happen that way too.

380
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,300
If we're gonna get away with it
it would sure be better.

381
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,700
I don't know the words to say
what I mean, but...

382
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,700
This is something for me.

383
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,500
Sure, I guess we could all probably make
it back on that thing, but...

384
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,800
When you walk and walk
through the woods and

385
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,800
then suddenly they dangle a General
in front of you like magic,

386
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,400
and you know it's only
for this once,

387
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,200
you can't turn your back on 'em.
None of us asked to be here,

388
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,100
but we all have to gamble.
It's not as if we could refuse.

389
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
We had to gamble once we crashed,

390
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,800
a General raised the stakes
and we've been so lucky.

391
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,500
Why shouldn't we put up
a little more than we have to?

392
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,050
What are you living for anyway?

393
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:10,400
To make talk? Why?

394
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,100
Why is your life so precious?

395
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,600
Why? The only reason is
to hunt for the reason.

396
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,000
But, can I stand in the way of a man
with a reason to die?

397
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,800
- You'll do it. Won't you, Corby?
- Do it for me.

398
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,900
Well, we have nothing to lose
but our futures.

399
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,900
OK, I guess we leave you now.

400
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,500
Remember, don't start for
a half an hour.

401
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
If the plane isn't still there,
we'll have time to get back to you.

402
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,900
Don't worry, it'll be there.

403
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,400
Good luck, Mac.
See you soon.

404
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,100
Try not to get your feet wet.

405
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,800
- You look out for your head.
- OK, fellow.

406
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,800
So long.

407
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,000
- Mac, I hope that sometime...
- You talk too much.

408
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,000
I guess we both do a little.

409
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,400
Sometimes, talk
is an indispensable medicine.

410
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,700
Yeah, but you get sicker later.

411
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,300
Good luck.

412
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,100
I didn't really mean what
I said before about guts.

413
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,200
Yes, you did, but only
to bother you.

414
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,400
- Take it easy, fellow.
- Yeah.

415
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,500
The plane's still there so I guess there
is no really good excuse to go back.

416
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,700
I guess not.

417
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,200
- Can you see?
- Hold it, hold it!

418
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,000
Yes, there he is.

419
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,200
What time is it?

420
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,800
We have about 10 minutes
before Mac begins. Let's hurry!

421
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,800
It's better...

422
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,500
It's better to roll up your life into
one night and one man and one gun.

423
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,800
It hurts too much to keep hurting
everyone else in every direction

424
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
and to be hurt with all
the separate hates

425
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:10,000
exploding day after day.

426
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,200
You can't help it.

427
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,800
A curse buzzes out of your mouth
with every word you say

428
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,000
and nobody alive can tell which is which
or what you mean.

429
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,400
Yeah.

430
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,500
You try door after door when
you hear voices you like behind them,

431
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,300
but the nobs come off in your hand...

432
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,800
Go in!

433
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,600
Where did you find him?

434
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
One of the men did down by the river.

435
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:15,001
He was very busy baying at the moon.

436
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,000
Dear Proteus, aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

437
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:23,401
Staying away without leave
for two whole days.

438
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,400
- Have a drink, Captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

439
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,200
You must never, never
do that again, Proteus.

440
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,900
Don't you know that there are
evil spirits without bodies...

441
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,000
roam the forest looking
for unsuspecting dogs like you?

442
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,300
And that when you open your jaws
to disturb the moon

443
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,300
they leap into your mouth
and possess you?

444
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,700
Then you could become a spy,

445
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,600
a murderer,

446
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:00,401
or even a traitor.

447
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,400
Not your dog, sir.
He knows his allegiance.

448
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,100
Have you been alert, Proteus?

449
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:11,501
Have you detected all
the distant marchings?

450
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,300
Has your wet nose become aware
of all the blood on the grass?

451
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,300
What else can you tell us
beside your puppy dog sadness?

452
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,400
Wish he could tell us where those enemy
soldiers from that wrecked plane are.

453
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,000
They've been bothersome
for the last two days.

454
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,600
They'll soon grow tired
of starving and being hunted.

455
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,000
Even Proteus grows tired of it
after two days.

456
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,200
See that Lieutenant Proteus
gets something to eat.

457
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,400
Yes, sir.

458
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,500
Nobody's gonna cry for me later
or cheer for me now.

459
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Nobody else is me.

460
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:58,101
I know that.

461
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,400
Who else but me is buried under
the chain of everything I ever did?

462
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,800
I didn't mean any of it.
It was all wrong.

463
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,000
Good riddance!

464
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,900
Oh, what a trade,
him for me!

465
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,800
What a thing to come to
at the end,

466
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,400
like building a bridge
or stealing the crown jewels.

467
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,700
Thanks, General!

468
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,400
Thanks! I'll take the tombstone
if it's really mine.

469
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,400
Waiting...

470
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,800
Waiting to kill...

471
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,800
Waiting to heal...

472
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,700
Waiting to die...

473
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Awaiting in the North
with four divisions.

474
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,400
One by one the men turned black

475
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,300
through waiting for
the last snowflake to dissolve.

476
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,300
Across the valley, our enemies
blew on their cold hands

477
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,700
until no more breath came.

478
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,000
Then they were dead.
And they knew it.

479
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,700
We were so well prepared for death

480
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,400
that the armistice was
a mutual disappointment.

481
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,850
Now he's in his cotton house,
taking up the cartridges on his maps,

482
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:57,600
full of his supper.

483
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,800
They'll get him soon.

484
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,800
A duck at a shooting gallery,

485
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,400
and I'll be the wheeler rolling
the ducks in all the bull's eyes.

486
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,800
I should talk. A clay pigeon
on a slow raft.

487
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,600
Frankly, I still become uneasy

488
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:27,400
when I find myself trapped

489
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,100
directing the courses
of frightened men.

490
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,100
I cannot quite admit that it is I

491
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:37,400
who am creating a
slaughter in this abyss,

492
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,600
or that I left the road,

493
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,600
that I ordered this and that.

494
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,300
I'm trapped.
What is a prison for me?

495
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,400
I make a grave for others.

496
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,500
To your health, sir.

497
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,800
It's the only way to finish up.

498
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,000
Alone, like the North Pole
in the middle of the night.

499
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,700
The river is helping me out of my life.

500
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,900
Sometimes, these maps...

501
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,200
Sometimes, as I look at these maps,

502
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,200
I wonder if my own grave
isn't being planned.

503
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,300
Here...

504
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,400
Or here...

505
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,300
Or here.

506
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,200
No more Sundays.
No more a thousand things.

507
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,600
I'm a little scared though.
Just a little...

508
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,900
like kissing my great grandma
when she was dying.

509
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Come on out here,
bunch of half-witted cannibals!

510
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,500
I missed him, I think
he's only wounded!

511
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,600
We have to finish him off.

512
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,700
But they stopped shooting at the river.
They'll be here any minute.

513
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,300
I surrender!

514
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,100
Come on, let's go!

515
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,001
Please, please,
we don't have any time.

516
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,800
You going back?
Can I come?

517
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,700
I won't be any bother.

518
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,000
Sure, kid.

519
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,900
Hop on,
there plenty of room.

520
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,900
You look tired.

521
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:03,500
Yeah.

522
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,000
Thanks a lot for stopping.
There was so much noise in there...

523
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,300
All right, Mac. You rest.
I'll be quiet.

524
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,700
You know?
I lost my watch!

525
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,800
Mac, don't close your eyes!

526
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,800
The trees! They're naked!
They're naked, Mac!

527
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,100
And what happened to the Sergeant?

528
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,000
I don't know, sir.

529
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,000
He might make it.

530
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,500
Sir, with your permission, I'd like
to go down to the river

531
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:23,601
and watch for him
for a while.

532
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,300
Yes, sir, the same goes for me.

533
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,500
You most certainly have
the right to it if you wish.

534
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,500
Do you think he'll come back?

535
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,900
I don't know.

536
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,600
I'm not sure yet whether
even we've come back.

537
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,800
I think we've all travelled too far
from our own private boundaries

538
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,200
to be certain about
these other things anymore...

539
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:28,601
Or come back to ourselves.

540
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,800
Part of me is glad, but...

541
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,700
Yeah.

542
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,400
I'm glad in a way too.

543
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,000
And I feel free all of a sudden.

544
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,200
But somehow I don't want
what I wanted before.

545
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,900
I know it's good. There's
nothing else I can want.

546
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,400
I'm all mixed up...

547
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,200
I wish I could want
what I wanted before.

548
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,500
Is your head bugging you?

549
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,800
No, it's something else...

550
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,300
What's that?

551
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,800
I guess I'm not...
built for this.

552
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,600
Nobody ever was.
It's all a trick we perform

553
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:44,800
when we'd rather not die...
immediately.

554
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,601
Come on!
