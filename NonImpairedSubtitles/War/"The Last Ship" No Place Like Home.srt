00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,402
we can use this as a vaccine and a cure?

25
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,939
The uninfected will be immunized, and...

26

Okay, here's the deal.

61
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,802
We are presently attempting to make contact

62
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,838
with the infectious disease lab
at Fort Detrick,

63
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,807
as it has just the facility
Dr. Scott requires

64
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,743
for mass producing the cure.

65
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,578
So far we've had no joy.

66
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,714
I'll be honest...

67
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,550
Knowing how deadly this plague
is and how fast it spreads,

68
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,085
I don't have any confidence

69
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,454
that there's gonna be any survivors, so...

70
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,823
That being said,

71
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,158
there's a reason they call it a fort.

72
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,993
And if anyone can hold their own,

73
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,562
it's our friends in the U.S. army.

I want to address the issue
that's on all of our minds.

On our way up the coast,

our ship will be passing
right by Norfolk... by home.

we could pick up

You may even get a phone call

83

if they've restored power on land.

84
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,656
It's unlikely, but I just
wanna prepare you.

85
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,492
We don't know what to expect
when we get back to the states.

00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,993
The only way to help the people we love

87
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,029
is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure

88

to a secure and workable lab.

- Landing party underway.
- [Radio chirps]

322
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,794
- Welcome to Baltimore. [Laughs]
- Hey, it's great to be here.

323
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,163
Looks like the troopers just got themselves

324
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:00,032
a couple hundred U.S. sailors.

325
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,701
A few dozen tomahawks, too.

326
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,375
Looks like a landing party arriving.

327
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:20,686
Thorwald: Including the Captain.

328
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,621
You must be Lieutenant Norris.

329
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:24,623
Tom Chandler, C.O., <i>Nathan James.</i>

330
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,392
Pleasure to meet you.
This is Lieutenant Landau.

331
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:28,894
Ma'am. Sir.

332
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:31,330
Hey. How y'all doin'?

333
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:33,432
Just fine, now that you're here.

334
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,601
We can escort you guys back to our H.Q.

335
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:41,139
Thorwald: Here comes another van.

336
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:43,275
Man:<i> Cobra 1 in place.</i>

[Engine turns off, doors close]

339
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,560
Holy shit.

340
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,828
What?

341
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:04,129
- [Voice breaking]
- Mom?

342
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,331
I had to come see for myself.

343
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:08,533
Oh, my baby girl.

344
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:10,769
It's her. It's Granderson.

345
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,906
She came out herself.

346
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,144
I am so glad to have you back.

347
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,913
Captain Chandler, thank you.

348
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,082
Thank you for returning my daughter to me.

349
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:26,251
Privilege, ma'am.
We wouldn't be here without her.

350
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,919
Take the shot.

351
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:30,989
Mrs. Granderson,

352
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:32,457
we really need to get you
back in the vehicle.

353
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:36,762
She's blocked.

354
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,865
Come. Everyone's eager to meet you.

355
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:44,870
I can take out the fat man.

356
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,739
No! You only have one shot.

357
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,675
- I want her.
- <i>Danny: Nathan James,</i>

358
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,109
<i>looks like we're having
a bit of a family reunion here.</i>

359
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,844
We're headed out with the group.

360
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,780
<i>Sending Lieutenant Norris back
with the V.B.S.S.</i>

361
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:57,015
<i>To update you on the situation
on the ground, sir.</i>

362
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,784
Roger that.

363
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,852
We'll arrange a welcome
for Lieutenant Norris.

364
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,789
Oh, and say "hi" to Mom for us.

365
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,891
Damn it!

366
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,559
I lost her.

367
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,669
Talk to your friends on the inside.

368
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,771
Find out what they're doing here.

00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,019
[Doors close]

372
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:41,227
We were fortunate to find this building.

373
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:43,162
There's only one coal-fired
plant still operational,

374
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,598
and we have a direct line.

375
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,800
Plus, strategically we're
far enough from the city

376
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,435
to avoid infection.

377
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:52,238
You'll be safe here.

378
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:54,040
Come.

379
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,787
Mom, this is amazing.

380
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:09,455
Oh, yes, but it's been a battle.

381
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:10,723
And who's the enemy?

382
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,958
Warlords, they call themselves.

383
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:14,360
And recently, they've killed

384
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,729
more people than the actual virus.

385
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:20,166
Do you know they raided
the National Archives?

386
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,667
They actually tried to steal

387
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:24,003
original copies of the Constitution.

388
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:30,476
As if that could take away
who we are as a people.

389
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,078
Captain.

390
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,148
I didn't want to broadcast about the virus

391
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:38,684
over an open radio feed, but...

392
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,120
The President told me
that you had the materials

393
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:42,888
to produce a vaccine.

394
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:45,257
Is that true?

395
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,892
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:49,495
We've actually made a little
more progress than that,

397
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:50,796
Mrs. Granderson.

398

[Inhales sharply]

399
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:55,000
We have the cure.

400
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,642
Fort Detrick was our first option, too.

401
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:05,478
They had the lab and all, but, uh,

402
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:08,614
- Thorwald got there first.
- Thorwald.

403
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:11,517
Former Baltimore P.D. turned
self-proclaimed leader

404
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:13,252
of the Warlords.

405
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:16,122
Been a real pain in our ass
since this whole thing started.

406
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:19,692
I shouldn't complain. [Chuckles]

407
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,994
I imagine you've been through
a hell of a time yourselves.

408
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:26,132
Listen, Lieutenant,
last I talked to my wife,

409
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,334
she said was taking
the family to Deer Park.

410
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:29,702
Safe zone. Heard of it.

411
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:31,937
You know if it's still there?

412
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:35,307
There was fighting,
but there are survivors.

413
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:40,146
I can get you there as soon
as we get you off the ship.

414
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:42,882
- [Click, hiss]
- Ooh! Thanks, Doc.

415
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,850
You have no idea how good that felt.

416
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,485
Well, I have some idea.

417
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,820
- Yeah.

See, these results are consistent...

421
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:58,731
Now this is the main reason
we chose this building.

422
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:02,001
[Speaking indistinctly]

423
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:06,939
We've worked for months
trying to develop a cure.

424
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,041
But now you're here.

425
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,544
[Exhales] It's heavenly.

426
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:23,422

- [Door opens]
- You're not gonna like this, boss.

428
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:59,391
My guy inside Granderson's said
the ship came back with a cure.

429
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:01,727
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.

430
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,462
Not from the U.S. Navy.

431
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:05,264
If that's true, Granderson will spread out,

432
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:08,234
go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.

433
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:10,636
We need to get our hands on the cure.

434
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:12,905
It's probably locked away
somewhere on the ship.

435
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:16,408
The only way is to take
Granderson on directly.

436
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:18,444
We have to take her lab.

437
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:24,984
Rachel: Extraordinary.

438
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:29,288
- Look at her.
- [Speaks indistinctly]

439
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,223
She's in love with a toaster.

440
00:24:31,258 --> 00:24:32,925
You still haven't made your move yet?

441
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:34,693
Oh, I've been making my move since Gitmo.

442
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,662
She ain't buying what I'm selling.

443
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:38,230
I thought once she saved the world,

444
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:40,199
- she'd let loose a little.

You won't get a signal here, Master Chief.

450
00:24:49,843 --> 00:24:51,510
The Warlords are jamming
the local frequencies.

451

They have a radio room, sir.

is still available,

I'd like to get word to my family,

[Huffs] I'm just a statistician,

- Dr. Hamada,

00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:04,200
you're using ribavirin to introduce

higher error rates to
the virus' D.N.A. replication.

In a chemical cocktail, yes.

Yes, but the pandemic virus is error-free.

597

Your treatment wouldn't have
any positive effect whatsoever.

You muster your entire crew

What you are giving the sick

is anything but a treatment...

You know this.

In the 14th century, the Black Death

684

It upended the social order

685
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:44,980
and prolonged the dark ages 150 years.

The hysteria,

to take what does not belong to them.

697
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:20,316
They are the barbarians at the gate

698

who would send us into a new dark age.

699
