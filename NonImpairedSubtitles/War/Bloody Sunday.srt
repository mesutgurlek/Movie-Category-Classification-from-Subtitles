1
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:05,343
...7-0, this is 54...

2
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:08,382
Positions 1-8-1-9, 2-0-2-1

3
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:11,869
and 2-2 and 2-3
are now complete.

4
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:15,039
The 24 is in the position...

5
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:16,536
is in the, uh, uh...

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,067
being complete in about
five minutes. Over.

7
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,305
Excuse me, folks.

8
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:34,719
Good to see you.

9
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:35,834
How are you?

10
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:36,794
Excuse me.

11
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,801
Afternoon.

12
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:43,662
Ladies and gentlemen,
Major General Ford.

13
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,384
We are marching because ever
since the partition of lreland

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,321
Catholics here in the North
have suffered discrimination

15
00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:59,021
in a Protestant dominated land.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,742
That's why we're marching.

17
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:06,605
In view of the continuing
adverse security situation

18
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:10,893
in the Province, all parades,
processions and marches

19
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:15,148
will be banned
until further notice.

20
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,569
We're marching because
the British government

21
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:18,757
promised us reform

22
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:21,097
and all we've had are excuses
and curfews

23
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:24,742
and the single issue that cuts
to the very core of civil rights

24
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,533
mass internment without trial.

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,162
That's why we're marching.

26
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,249
Anyone either taking part in

27
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:35,654
or organizing such an event

28
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:38,335
is liable to immediate arrest.

29
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:41,917
The law is the law
and must be respected.

30
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,541
So we say this
to the British government.

31
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,742
We will march peacefully
this Sunday

32
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:50,166
and march, and march again

33
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,729
until Unionist rule
is ended in this Province

34
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:55,417
and a new system,
based on civil rights for all

35
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:57,342
is put in its place.

36
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:01,235
Thank you.

37
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,893
And I would say
to the leadership

38
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:06,003
of the civil rights organization

39
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,686
any responsibility for any
violence which may take place

40
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:12,853
must rest fairly and squarely
on your shoulders.

41
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,441
Thank you.

42
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:29,488
We shall overcome,
we shall overcome

43
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,409
Some day...

44
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,310
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, see you later.

45
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:41,294
...Deep in my heart...

46
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,454
You must have jets on your feet.

47
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:03,487
My launching pad is only
three blocks away, remember?

48
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:05,283
Yeah.

49
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:08,929
Let's continue, to the Moon.

50
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,242
To the Moon.

51
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:14,851
Can't we spend a quiet evening,
like, alone?

52
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:17,948
Well, we're expecting
Professor Reaburn to notify us.

53
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:21,181
The fellas ought to all be
together in case he does.

54
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:22,526
He's grand.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,803
What's wrong with him?

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,873
He's just tossing and turning.

57
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,496
Gerry.

58
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,969
I'll get him. I'll get him.

59
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,397
I'll settle him down.

60
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:59,403
Anyway, Mum's home.

61
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:00,524
Hi.

62
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:01,545
Oh, God.

63
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:02,928
What a night, huh?

64
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:03,890
Hello.

65
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:05,329
How'd you enjoy baby-sitting?

66
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:06,605
-All right.
-You been feeding him?

67
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:07,886
Hello, wee man. Hello.

68
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:08,848
Was he good for you?

69
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,440
Aye, he was good as gold,
so he was.

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,520
Oh, see him playing up now
for me.

71
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,639
That's always the way.

72
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:14,606
Where'd youse go?

73
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,565
Up the Stardust.

74
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,932
The usual, you know,
just for a few drinks.

75
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,037
That's all I need
on a Saturday night.

76
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,596
Look, I'm just taking Hester
back down to town.

77
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,880
Right, okay. You be careful.

78
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:24,843
Aye, I'll be grand.

79
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,802
No, I mean it.

80
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:27,395
I don't want you
getting lifted again.

81
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,361
I'll be all right.

82
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,320
Ta-ra.

83
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,281
Right.

84
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,261
See ya.

85
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:36,774
Are you going next week?

86
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:38,235
Aye, may as well.

87
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,205
Be a good crack.

88
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,284
Aye, I'll be all right.

89
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:41,732
Hopefully they'll
keep the boys out.

90
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:42,692
Aye.

91
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:45,113
I'll keep them away from you.

92
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:55,001
Come around Jackie's...

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,244
No, he's not.

94
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,318
How're you doing?

95
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,725
Protestant?

96
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,164
Eddie wants you out?

97
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:04,920
Yeah, a right little turncoat.

98
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:05,884
-What?
-So he is.

99
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,477
What about the way he dogs me?

100
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,443
Keeps me young.

101
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,198
Oh, he's hardly gonna do that.

102
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:11,795
It's your sister's husband.

103
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,070
Come on! Get a move on!

104
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,232
Looks like they might
threaten us.

105
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,199
Aye.

106
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,619
You better leave me here.

107
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,563
You'll be careful tomorrow?

108
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,529
I'll be fine.

109
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:37,489
It's only a march.

110
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:38,928
And what if trouble starts?

111
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,368
There'll be no trouble.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
It's a peaceful march
for civil rights.

113
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,032
All right.

114
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:51,561
Look, I'll meet you here
tomorrow about 6:00, okay?

115
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:53,669
Right.

116
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:56,388
See you tomorrow.

117
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,670
Bye.

118
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,711
Come in, One-Seven.

119
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,127
This is One Alpha.

120
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:27,063
Uh, one of your roadblocks
further out

121
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:28,925
has reported movements.

122
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,465
Three people in the green
Volkswagen Variant 1500.

123
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:37,558
Uh, the registered number
is G...

124
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:45,237
She was winking earlier
at that guy.

125
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,518
She knows.

126
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,822
One Alpha.

127
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:53,645
Registration number Golf,
Uniform, Lima, 2-1-5-5. Over.

128
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,187
Right.

129
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,203
Get some team commanders
on base soonest.

130
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:01,553
Come on, let's get moving.

131
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,213
Let's get some pace
till where we're secure.

132
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:04,908
He's going to get a brief
from Corporal.

133
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:07,018
Sigs on me.

134
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,326
Get HQ up on the net now.

135
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,584
Move the vehicles
out of that line of sight.

136
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:19,175
Tell me where the sentries
are fully posted.

137
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,676
Okay, if there is
a sniper threat today

138
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,145
it's coming from over there.

139
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:27,879
Make sure you've
got that covered.

140
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,532
Yes, Colonel, we're currently
putting a covert O.P.

141
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,025
out on to the derelict site
down William Street.

142
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:35,398
I'll let you know
as soon as that's in place.

143
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,773
We've got the whole,
I've got the company in?

144
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:41,734
We're established.

145
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:42,813
Can you just confirm

146
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:45,472
we're gonna brief up
the troop commanders shortly?

147
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:46,621
Yeah, okay.

148
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:52,986
Is Gerry about, is he?

149
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:55,392
Ah, come on, Mary,
we have to go to Mass here.

150
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:57,335
Come on now, Mary,
open the door.

151
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,521
Keep it down, okay?

152
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,502
Ah, the wee man's asleep, is he?

153
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:01,655
Shh.

154
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:05,650
What's the crack with you?

155
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,099
Hey, the Brits are here.

156
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,101
The Pigs are everywhere here.

157
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,863
The Bogside's crawling with 'em.

158
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:12,826
Geez. Holy shit.

159
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,003
Okay, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
Okay.

160
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:15,384
Lads, I count a dozen
for APCs as well.

161
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,596
Aye.

162
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,089
But there's more at the bottom
of Rossville Street.

163
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,397
At the corner
of the Craigavan Bridge as well.

164
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:22,360
...are everywhere, hey.

165
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:25,774
It was on the radio
this morning!

166
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,308
-Shh...
-Come on!

167
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,277
Get a move on, man.

168
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,382
Oh, fuck's sake,
are your trousers too tight

169
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:31,469
or your balls too big?

170
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:32,752
Ah, you're just jealous, man.

171
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,823
Oh, sorry.
Wee man, you all right?

172
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:37,102
Aye, we'll be all right, Mary.

173
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,348
One day, Mary, he'll grow up to
be a good stone thrower himself.

174
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,312
Go on, youse.

175
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:44,271
Eh...

176
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:45,384
Where are you going now?

177
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,536
I'm going to Mass, Mary.

178
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,622
I'll be back later on.

179
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:50,699
Gerry!

180
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:54,181
Can you see any, aye?

181
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:55,628
Oh, yeah.

182
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,383
Look, look.

183
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,767
Look at this, hey.

184
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:06,661
Go on, Brits, out!

185
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:07,776
Get out!

186
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:10,052
Go on back home!

187
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:13,539
Go on, you British scum!

188
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:14,653
Get out!

189
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:17,562
Hey, we'll see you later
at the Guildhall!

190
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,906
Go back!

191
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:21,761
They better not try
and stop us today.

192
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,348
It'll take more than
rubber bullets and barbed wire.

193
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,391
Brits out!

194
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:28,537
Come on!

195
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:47,130
...troops, including members
of the parachute regiment...

196
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:48,568
Oh, shit.

197
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,779
The army... has warned

198
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,988
that time and place
to stop the march...

199
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,122
Which means that it could cover
a considerable distance...

200
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,744
Ma, can you get that?

201
00:09:57,783 --> 00:10:01,578
The Nationalist Bogside
Brigadier is in the city...

202
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:02,733
This is...

203
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:04,812
...at the no-go areas
for six months

204
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,436
the local residents
barricaded the streets...

205
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:08,882
Organizers of the march...

206
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:10,954
Jesus.

207
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,271
Morning. How are you all?

208
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:15,370
Yes, yeah.

209
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,131
Yeah, I know, I know.

210
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:18,094
Ma, Ma, Ma.

211
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,647
I can't see them now.

212
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,766
No, I will. I'll be there.

213
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:22,919
Can I get through here?

214
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,813
I just want to get
to the phone there.

215
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:25,772
Yeah, okay.

216
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,527
We're all getting ready
for the march here.

217
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:29,124
Yeah?

218
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,723
How many?

219
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,925
Any sign of the Paras?

220
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:34,889
Yeah.

221
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:37,921
What about the square?

222
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:40,644
Okay, I'll meet you
at Aggro Corner.

223
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,403
Folks...

224
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,683
I'll be with you.

225
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,125
I understand.

226
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:46,564
Just getting ready
for the march here.

227
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:48,157
Yes, right,
I know I'm going to sort it.

228
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,124
I'm going to sort it.

229
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:52,472
They've been waiting
for over an hour, lvan.

230
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,490
Well, tell them
I'm gonna see the Bishop.

231
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:55,676
-Hah!
-No, the Cardinal.

232
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:56,793
Oh, aye, the Pope.

233
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,241
Uh-huh.

234
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:02,396
They mightn't believe you,
but it's worth a try.

235
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:03,359
All right, Dad?

236
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,635
Take care of yourself.

237
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,231
I am. I'm grand, I'm grand.

238
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,198
Okay.

239
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,823
Now, it's just
a Sunday afternoon stroll.

240
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:10,388
-Have you no...?
-Don't worry about it.

241
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,356
Have you no coat, darling?

242
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:12,730
No, no, I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

243
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:13,845
I'll see youse later, okay?

244
00:11:13,884 --> 00:11:14,810
Take care of yourself, son.

245
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:15,771
I will, I will. It's fine.

246
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:16,730
Nothing to worry about.

247
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,038
Look after yourself, darling.

248
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:19,448
Sort them out,
would you please?

249
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:20,911
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,125
Mr. Cooper,
have you got a moment?

251
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,401
Uh, surgery's canceled today.

252
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:33,844
It's about my TV.

253
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:36,048
Well, it's civil rights
we're marching for

254
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:37,197
not TVs, Mr. O'Keefe.

255
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:39,123
Well, Mrs. Doherty,
sleep well last night?

256
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,399
Aye, I did that, Mr. Cooper.

257
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:41,362
Are you coming to Mass?

258
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:43,598
Mrs. Doherty,
a good Protestant like me?

259
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:44,876
March against internment.

260
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,157
Hello, folks. See you later.

261
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:47,437
March again internment.

262
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,381
There you are, son.
See you later.

263
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:01,705
There's the church,
and we're in this yard here.

264
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,819
Roger.

265
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,746
Proposed route of the march

266
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,592
is along here and then
along the street.

267
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,737
Runs that way.

268
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,337
Yes, I see.

269
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:12,613
Our job is
to catch these hooligans

270
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,745
and pinch them
between ourselves and C Company.

271
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:16,709
Yes.

272
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:17,670
Okay, so it's gonna be

273
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,108
through the wall
then down the street

274
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:21,377
and, hopefully, we'll catch them
coming straight into us.

275
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:22,939
William Street runs parallel

276
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,768
behind you guys
behind this wall.

277
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:26,144
Plan is machine-gun platoon

278
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,804
will make the breach
with their Pigs.

279
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:29,183
We'll follow through on foot.

280
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,705
It's about 150 yards
of waste ground

281
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:32,955
through the derelict buildings

282
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,261
and we'll be on William Street
and behind the marchers.

283
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,725
So, what about the, uh, stickies

284
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,457
and pyra presence
over in the Bogside?

285
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:39,508
Are we gonna...?

286
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,891
Well, they're there, and-and...

287
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,900
Do we reckon the players
are gonna be out today?

288
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:44,086
-They're bound to be.
-Okay.

289
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,685
They're absolutely bound to be

290
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,512
and we've got to be ready
for 'em.

291
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:48,954
Okay, well,
we got the guys from...

292
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:50,296
The primary...
the primary job is

293
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,256
picking up 200 or 300

294
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,012
of the Derry young hooligans,
all right?

295
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,569
Okay, and tell the lads
we want maximum aggression.

296
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,324
We want a lot of arrests today
and if the shooting starts

297
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,269
we're gonna shoot back
plenty of rounds.

298
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,231
Roger.

299
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,549
How do? Morning, ladies.

300
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,018
There you are.

301
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,948
All right, ladies?

302
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:10,157
Okay, see you later.

303
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:11,275
All right, boys.

304
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:12,777
Here, hand some of these out
at Mass.

305
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:13,898
Walk away, lads.

306
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:15,050
Walk away. Don't worry.

307
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,137
Don't be intimidated.

308
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:17,125
It's all right.

309
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,733
Aha.

310
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,515
Sorry.
Excuse us, it's all right.

311
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,478
It's okay, I know him.

312
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,819
Go on, this is a peaceful march.

313
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,194
Peaceful march
we're having today.

314
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:30,407
I hope you boys are the same.

315
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,372
Hey, lads, lads, lads.

316
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:33,291
I know him, I know him,
I know him, I know him.

317
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,567
It's all right.
He's full drunk.

318
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:36,261
I'll take him away.
Walk away, walk away.

319
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:37,226
Come on, walk away.

320
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,185
Thank you, thank you.

321
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,624
It's a peaceful march
we're having.

322
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:40,640
Hey, get ye away.

323
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:41,728
Go and get to bed, go home.

324
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,394
Sleep it off.
I'll see you later.

325
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:44,447
How are you, folks?

326
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:45,982
Don't worry. You're grand.

327
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,484
-It's a peaceful march.
-See you later.

328
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,508
No riots today.

329
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,477
Don't be intimidated.

330
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,436
Good to see youse.

331
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:51,397
I'll see youse later.

332
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:53,054
Thank you. There you are.

333
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:58,526
The Bogside is a fucking mess.

334
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:00,602
We've got to go in there,
get a grip of it.

335
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,616
We've got to teach these people
a lesson.

336
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:03,802
So make sure the guys know

337
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,499
who the leaders
of these fuckers are.

338
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:06,616
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

339
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:07,834
And let's go and get 'em.

340
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:11,220
Everyone's got to have a handle
on these key players.

341
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:13,498
I want them lifted
off the street today.

342
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:15,126
We're gonna have these guys.

343
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:16,627
That's why we're out there.

344
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,978
Make sure the guys know.

345
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,899
I wanna see all of them
in the bag.

346
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:21,043
Quite clear?

347
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,489
It's the end of our tour.

348
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,377
Let's teach 'em
a fucking lesson.

349
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,652
Let's do the business.

350
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:27,412
Let's make the CO proud of us.

351
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:29,684
I wanna show the Brigade
what One Para are made of.

352
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,865
Is that all clear?

353
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:31,831
Yeah, no problem.

354
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:32,845
Any questions?

355
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,064
Do we just go in on our own?

356
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:35,629
We're not taking anybody else
with us?

357
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,972
Support Company,
Charlie Company, that's it.

358
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,139
All right, boys? Stewards!

359
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,421
Jesus.

360
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,464
What we've got here is
a pressure cooker situation.

361
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:52,431
Kevin.

362
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:53,391
Just a minute.

363
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:54,568
Just bear with me one minute.

364
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,535
So?

365
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:56,777
So, uh, whole city's shut down.

366
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:57,796
No one's getting in or out.

367
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,428
You've got Normandy landings
down there.

368
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:00,680
That's gonna be the flash point

369
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:02,092
so I'm bringing everybody
down here.

370
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,302
The march is coming down here.

371
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,681
These guys are gonna be
right here.

372
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,024
So, nobody's getting
through here.

373
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,336
William Street is the key thing.

374
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,963
-Do we have enough stewards?
-We have enough.

375
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:10,628
Michael, will you go
and ask the other fellas

376
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,226
to come down
as quickly as possible, please?

377
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:13,988
-ls that the Provos?
-The Provos are down there.

378
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:15,234
What the hell
are they doing here?

379
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,449
Well, they're
just sniffing about.

380
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:17,697
Basically,
I think they must think

381
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,077
that the Brits have invaded
the place.

382
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,571
Oh, Jesus, I've been
down William Street.

383
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:21,989
-Really?
-Have you spoken to them yet?

384
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,134
I'm-I'm gonna have a quick word

385
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,798
with the Commanding Officer
in just a moment.

386
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:25,763
I will, I will.

387
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:26,974
-Well, I'll see you down there.
-Right.

388
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,866
Stress to those boys that we're
in control up here, will ya?

389
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,143
Yep. Yep. How do?
My name is lvan Cooper.

390
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,422
I'm a Member of Parliament
for this area.

391
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,538
-Come on, sir, back off.
-Uh, sorry.

392
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,171
You couldn't do us a favor
and move this back a bit?

393
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,158
It's just the march is coming...

394
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,127
No, you're not, mate.

395
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:37,621
You're participating
in an illegal march, sir.

396
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:38,711
Now back off from the barricade.

397
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:39,767
Back off
from the barricade, sir.

398
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,663
What gives you the right
to stop us marching in our city?

399
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:43,004
You're participating
in an illegal march.

400
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,966
Who says that?

401
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:45,241
The sooner we can march
in our own city...

402
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,292
We're just doing our job.
Back off.

403
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,024
...to the Guildhall, the sooner
we'll have civil rights.

404
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,107
We're just doing our job.
Back off.

405
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,806
Well, it's a basic principle
of democracy.

406
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,883
Northern lreland Government
has barred this march.

407
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:54,832
Right, thank you.

408
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,588
Jesus.

409
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,836
No, I can't get
through to them.

410
00:15:58,873 --> 00:15:59,800
Oh, hold on.

411
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:01,654
Mrs. Hegarty, I hope
you're joining us today.

412
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:02,866
Now, no excuses.

413
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,015
I can't. It's me Uncle John.

414
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:05,265
He's been on bucket all night.

415
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,383
Uh-huh, that's right.

416
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,350
Was it the beer, aye?

417
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:08,908
No, it wasn't.
He's sick, Mr. Cooper.

418
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,029
All right, Mrs. Hegarty.

419
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,174
Listen up. What are we gonna do?

420
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,099
We're gonna march.

421
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:15,080
Are you sure about this?

422
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:16,946
We've gotta march,
we've gotta march, Kevin.

423
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,604
I'll tell you, listen,
if we don't march

424
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,016
civil rights is dead
in this city.

425
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,976
The movement's dead.

426
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:21,958
We have got to march.

427
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,015
Sort the stewards out.

428
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:24,430
I'm gonna talk to the Provos.

429
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:25,609
-Okay. All right.
-Keep it up.

430
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:26,727
Right, gentlemen.

431
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,490
Be very careful.
Just go straight home.

432
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:31,372
There's a huge military buildup,
and they've got us surrounded.

433
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,616
Father, I'm going to miss you.

434
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,823
Yeah. Keep your eye on the...
on the young people, okay?

435
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,875
Mind yourself. Hiya, lads.

436
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,476
Listen, there's a lot
of Army around, okay?

437
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:38,442
Ah, don't worry, Father.

438
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,587
So be very careful, lads, okay.

439
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:40,836
-Listen, thanks very much.
-Okay.

440
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,368
Hiya, Gerry,
I wanna have a chat with you.

441
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,870
Listen, lads, I'll see youse,
yeah, okay?

442
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,768
Ah, youse boys wait for me,
right. I'll be up nigh.

443
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,848
How long have you been out now?

444
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,317
I'm out three weeks now, Father,
so I am.

445
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,504
So, what's the plans?

446
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:50,917
Well, I'm trying to get a job

447
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,732
but, uh, it's hard work trying
to get one with a record.

448
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,172
Things will pick up, you know

449
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:57,572
but the one thing, Gerry,
you gotta be careful

450
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,491
you don't get nabbed
rioting again.

451
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,312
I am, I'll be rioting again,
aye.

452
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,899
But, uh, there's an awful lot
of young lads down there rioting

453
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,115
on Saturdays and so on, so...

454
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:06,528
Aye, but it's just stones,
Father.

455
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:07,739
You know, it's not that bad.

456
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,558
Yeah, but Gerry,
you can't afford to be caught.

457
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:11,540
Okay, take care, Martin.

458
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:12,860
Aye, I know what you're saying.

459
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:15,229
Yeah, so how do you feel
having given yourself up?

460
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,334
I feel it's better
for the long run.

461
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:18,355
Sorry, Father.

462
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:19,324
Pray for us, Father

463
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,883
because it's gonna be
a terrible day.

464
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:21,939
We will indeed. Yeah, yeah.

465
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,085
Now, keep an eye on the young
people going home, okay?

466
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:25,170
-I will.
-Get them to go home.

467
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,617
You know, it's better
for the long run.

468
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,657
At least I've no... not worrying
about getting caught.

469
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:30,039
I don't know how I can go on
with me life.

470
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:31,731
I think you've done
the right thing

471
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:34,419
and you just can't afford
to be back down there again.

472
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:36,844
Aye, I don't want to go back,
Father, so I don't.

473
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:38,065
No, I'll not be rioting.

474
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:39,728
So, are you going
to the big march today?

475
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,227
Aye, I'm going on the march,
so I am.

476
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,894
Me and all the boys are going,
you know.

477
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,820
Yeah, well, you'd better
be very careful, all right?

478
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:45,779
Right, Father.

479
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:47,469
So, listen, I'll probably
see you down there.

480
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:48,880
All right, Father.
Watch yourself.

481
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:50,508
I'll see you later on,
all right, Father?

482
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:52,585
Okay. Yeah, you mind yourself,
and God bless. Take care.

483
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:54,119
What did he say, Gerry?

484
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,168
He just asked me
how I was getting on.

485
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,359
Up the Rah!

486
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:03,081
Here, boys, here, boys,
here, listen, here.

487
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,906
Don't want no trouble today,
now, I mean it.

488
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:07,657
There's women and children gonna
be in this march, all right?

489
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:09,252
Get out of the...

490
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,720
Yeah. No, listen, come on.

491
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:11,843
You're gonna make it worse

492
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,443
if you start
antagonizing these boys.

493
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:14,791
Just leave them alone;
join us.

494
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:15,774
It's a big day for us.

495
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:18,053
Women and children are
gonna be safe now, I mean it.

496
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:19,811
No acting the idiot.

497
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,367
Keep it calmed down.

498
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:23,519
You bastards!

499
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,151
Go home, you scum!

500
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,343
You bastard.

501
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,005
Get the fuck out, trash!

502
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,953
Just checking
you're keeping the guns away.

503
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:35,864
That's no concern of yours,
lvan.

504
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,531
You gave me your word.

505
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:39,641
Then take it.

506
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:44,895
We just want a peaceful march.

507
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:46,334
This is our day.

508
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:47,610
People are fed up

509
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:49,021
with the shootings
and the...

510
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,744
Convoy has just
come over Craigavan Bridge

511
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,756
and they've set up barricades
on William Street.

512
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,040
Right. Any sign of the Paras?

513
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:55,002
No, not yet.

514
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:55,962
Right, okay.

515
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:57,882
Any sign of anything,
let me know, all right?

516
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,823
Right? Go on.

517
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,381
Ivan...

518
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:05,783
Ivan, it's all very well for you
sitting pretty

519
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:08,204
with your wee Westminster
paycheck every week.

520
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,759
Marching's not gonna solve
this thing.

521
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,729
Watch us.

522
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:57,883
Welcome to the Eighth Brigade,
sir.

523
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:00,313
Thank you very much.
Good trip.

524
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,436
Where's Maurice?

525
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:02,686
Lieutenant Colonel Steele, sir.

526
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:03,834
Okay.

527
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,527
How are you, Pat?

528
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:08,023
I'm very well. Thank you, sir.

529
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,145
It's good to see you.

530
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:10,363
And you, sir.

531
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,798
I've had a briefing come through
from Downing Street

532
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:14,839
and the Prime Minister
really has had enough

533
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,285
of this Londonderry rebellion.

534
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,563
All right? Shall we go through?

535
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:18,525
Please.

536
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,208
Stand up.

537
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:22,193
Good man.

538
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:23,480
-Sergeant Major!
-Hello, sir.

539
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:24,443
How are you?

540
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,036
-I'm fine, sir.
-Good to see you again.

541
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:27,450
And you, sir.

542
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,173
Okay, carry on.

543
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:33,168
Cup of tea, cup of coffee, sir?

544
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:34,615
Yes, please.

545
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:35,630
Yes, thank you, Michael.

546
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,079
The briefing's ready
when you are.

547
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,085
-Excellent.
-Good.

548
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:40,752
Well, I just, uh, wanted to say,
sir

549
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,251
that the men were rather bucked

550
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:43,887
when they heard
that we were going

551
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:44,907
to be coming across.

552
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,671
Oh, good.
I'm very pleased to hear it.

553
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,723
Yes, sir.

554
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:48,876
Everything's set for today?

555
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,060
-I think so, sir, yes.
-Good.

556
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,179
Their intention, at present

557
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:53,323
is to move along William Street
all the way along...

558
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:55,183
-Past Aggro Corner?
-Well, that's right, sir.

559
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:57,104
...into the city center
and on to the Guildhall

560
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:58,598
where they'll be having
their rally.

561
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,917
As it is, we're gonna stop them

562
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:01,774
here at barrier 14
with the Raw Green Jackets.

563
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:02,919
Very good.

564
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:03,940
Uh, Coldstreams?

565
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:06,218
Coldstreams are up
on the city walls

566
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:09,318
and King's Own are the north
side of William Street.

567
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:11,974
One Para are in the Presbyterian
churchyard just here.

568
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:12,959
Very good.

569
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,654
And Three Company are
behind barrier 14.

570
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,617
If there's any trouble

571
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,078
Support Company
will break through...

572
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,509
I don't think there's any doubt
about that. There will be.

573
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:22,691
Okay, Support Company then
will break through the wall

574
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:23,938
for the Presbyterian
churchyard

575
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:26,047
through this dead ground,
break through this wall

576
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:27,996
and they, in turn...
they're gonna come round

577
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,761
and sweep round behind
all the hooligans

578
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:30,811
round about Aggro Corner

579
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,259
sweeping them
towards barrier 14.

580
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,373
At the same time

581
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:35,832
Three Company will be breaking
through barrier 14

582
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,592
and the hooligans will be caught
in a pincer movement.

583
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:39,738
Thank you, Charles.

584
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,686
I should just say, sir,
of course

585
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,118
One Para only go in
if there is violence

586
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:46,778
and then only
if there is a clear separation

587
00:21:46,815 --> 00:21:49,814
between the march proper
and the hooligan element.

588
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:51,708
Uh, do we know
who we're looking for?

589
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:52,757
Yeah, we've got OPs

590
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:54,707
at strategic points
all along the route.

591
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:55,675
Um, and they all...

592
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,490
They've all been briefed
on all the local known players.

593
00:21:58,523 --> 00:21:59,864
They've seen pictures,
have they?

594
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:00,880
-Yes. Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

595
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:02,296
-Good, very good.
-We-We have a cordon

596
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,020
of snipers here, sir,
should the lRA wish

597
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,650
to make a contribution
this afternoon.

598
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:06,833
Yes, I'm sure they will.

599
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:08,082
Do you know
where they're going to be?

600
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,047
-Michael?
-Yes, sir.

601
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,868
We are concentrating on the top
of these block of flats

602
00:22:10,903 --> 00:22:12,113
which is where we imagine
they'll be.

603
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:14,038
And possibly Glenfada Park
across the road, sir.

604
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,435
Very good. Rubber bullets--
have the men all been issued?

605
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,549
-Uh, yes, sir.
-Good.

606
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:18,766
Maurice?

607
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:19,883
Sir?

608
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:21,168
Anything I haven't thought of?

609
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,250
Uh, I suspect press placement

610
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,817
would be quite important
today, sir.

611
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,265
Yes, winning the propaganda war.

612
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:26,225
Absolutely vital.

613
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:27,337
Who's in charge of that?

614
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:29,765
Lieutenant Hector, sir, is
our Press Liaison Officer, sir.

615
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,783
There are a few points
which will, um, please you.

616
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:33,962
As per your request,
both local and national coverage

617
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:35,144
will be occurring on the day

618
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:36,841
and this will be
in the main three formats

619
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,219
of press
from the leading tabloids

620
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:40,195
additionally from the major
television companies

621
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:41,163
and radio stations.

622
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:43,366
Talk to Colonel Tugwell
about where that's going to be

623
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,159
and knock that out for me,
please, Maurice.

624
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,307
Good. Thank you. Well done.

625
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:47,939
Thank you, Michael.

626
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,123
Right, you can just carry on.

627
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:50,143
So, maybe, um...

628
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:52,191
the press will congregate
around barrier 12 itself.

629
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:53,313
Then once there...

630
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:56,483
Yes, I suspect that's probably
the best location for them.

631
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,267
Um, they've got a clear view
down Rossville Street.

632
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:00,676
Especially Generals.

633
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,531
That should give us quite a bit
of press coverage

634
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:06,619
as well as showing, uh...

635
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,993
We're gonna have to be tough
today, Pat.

636
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,931
Really tough.

637
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:18,869
If there's any trouble at all,
the Paras are to counterattack.

638
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,187
Is that clearly understood?

639
00:23:20,223 --> 00:23:22,589
Of course, Robert.

640
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:24,377
Good.

641
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:26,453
And, um...

642
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:29,175
you have my full support,
of course.

643
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:30,554
Thank you, sir.

644
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:32,496
Good.

645
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:37,464
Hello, John, Jimmy.

646
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:40,146
Should be coming round for tea.

647
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,710
Hello.

648
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,178
Hello.

649
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,802
-lvan, how's it going?
-How do, folks.

650
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,250
Good to see you.

651
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:56,744
So, they have blocked
the Belfast Road

652
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:58,509
which means we've got
about ten coaches stock.

653
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,820
All right there, boys, all set?

654
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:01,231
Right,
get those pencils sharpened.

655
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:02,192
So, it means we've got

656
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:03,817
about ten coaches
stockpiled at the border.

657
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,230
Just give me
just a wee minute, Declan.

658
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,537
How are you going
to get them in?

659
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:07,502
I've sent Jimmy up there.

660
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:08,461
He's sorting it out.

661
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:09,574
Yeah, that's fine.
It's no bother.

662
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:10,923
We can't have ten coach loads
sitting there

663
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,069
with marchers on them,
doing nothing.

664
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:13,037
Relax, relax, it's fine.

665
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:14,476
We've got them coming down
for about 1 :00.

666
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:15,456
And what about the stewards?

667
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:16,612
Stewards are fine;
that's sorted.

668
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:18,244
And we got Fenner Brockway,
which is great news

669
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:20,452
but, obviously, he's not going
to march, for the legal reasons.

670
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,147
You'll have to give me
a couple of minutes here.

671
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:23,112
I need to see Frances.

672
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,192
I'll be in in two ticks,
all right?

673
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:25,159
Okay, I'm all for you, man

674
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:26,566
but we need
to kick this thing along, okay?

675
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,028
Listen, I was supposed
to see her last night.

676
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:29,346
-Please, help me.
-Right, just a minute.

677
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:30,496
-Right, okay.
-Very quickly, please.

678
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,225
Mr. Cooper,
have you got a moment?

679
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,439
One second.

680
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:35,386
...or voting
for Simon as well.

681
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:36,857
Right, well, you go...

682
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:40,921
I'll follow you up.

683
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:43,133
Go on you on up
and sort out through six.

684
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,097
-Through six?
-Yes.

685
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,585
Right, right.

686
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,762
Where-Where were you?

687
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,938
What happened to you?

688
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,152
I had meetings.

689
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,532
I'm sorry.

690
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:55,954
We're having a nightmare
with this charge.

691
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:56,980
Of course you do.

692
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:59,441
Kevin's not entirely sure
what's going on.

693
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:01,371
I have to sort it out;
I'm sorry.

694
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:02,745
Change the record, lvan.

695
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:04,153
I'm sick of it.

696
00:25:04,187 --> 00:25:05,528
Hey, wait, hey, wait, Frances.

697
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:07,350
Listen, give me
a couple of minutes now.

698
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:08,465
I'm up to me eyes, lvan.

699
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:09,618
I have no time for this.

700
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:10,801
I know that, I know that, but...

701
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:11,887
I have no time for it, lvan.

702
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,388
Look, I'll be finished tonight
about 8:00

703
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:14,543
We'll do something then, okay?

704
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:15,663
That's just balls, lvan

705
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:17,741
'cause you'll still be sitting
in the bar at 12:00 tonight

706
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,210
Iistening to the sound
of your own voice.

707
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:20,202
You know it and I know it.

708
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:21,172
Wrong. Hold on, hold on.

709
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:22,186
Have you any expectation

710
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,398
anybody's going to turn out
for you this afternoon?

711
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:25,451
I would have thought so.

712
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,215
I think they've always
turned out for us in the past

713
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:28,298
and this is our big push today.

714
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:30,345
This is a march about peace
and a march about civil rights.

715
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:32,011
What sort of numbers
were you expecting?

716
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:33,128
Sorry, will you excuse me?

717
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:34,096
An hour to be safe.

718
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:35,055
Come on, that is not fair.

719
00:25:35,088 --> 00:25:36,016
Just one second, please.

720
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:36,975
That is not fair to say that.

721
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:37,935
Don't you talk to me about fair.

722
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:39,853
Please, Cecilia, would you
take that for me, love?

723
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:40,868
Don't you talk to me about fair.

724
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,989
I'm a Catholic girl, lvan.

725
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:43,938
You look me straight in the face
and say that again.

726
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:45,256
I know you're a Catholic girl.

727
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,201
That's the whole point
about this, for heaven's sake.

728
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:48,171
Come on, darling.

729
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:49,151
Let me tell you something.

730
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:50,143
I am up to my eyes, lvan.

731
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:51,114
You're not the only one.

732
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:52,390
I have the world's press in here

733
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,050
wanting things done
not now but yesterday.

734
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:55,071
It's about the two of us.

735
00:25:55,113 --> 00:25:56,322
Cecilia, for me, love, please.

736
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,342
Come on, Frances, darling

737
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:59,903
I know it's hard, but please--
one last big push, eh? Come on.

738
00:25:59,943 --> 00:26:01,317
Yes, just one wee second,
please.

739
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,357
Will you just take care of that
for me, please?

740
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:04,510
You're getting very late.

741
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:10,237
One second.

742
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,031
The British Army's surrounded
the entire city.

743
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,336
Well, I think that shows you
that they are very threatened

744
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,377
by the voice that we are trying
to get across here.

745
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:17,465
But is this not...?

746
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:19,446
That's about them;
that's not about us.

747
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:22,357
We're trying to have a peaceful
march against internment

748
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,286
and a peaceful march
for civil rights.

749
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:27,133
They're alleging that you're
creating a confrontation.

750
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,075
Well, what do you think
they would say?

751
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:30,839
What we need to do is
split each...

752
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:32,086
All right, sorry, folks.

753
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,051
This is Fort George.

754
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:34,011
Mm-hmm.

755
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:35,123
This is... RUC station.

756
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,504
That's in Rosemont.

757
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:39,505
So, what we do is we come in
from different routes in turn.

758
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:42,228
They come in from the south,
and come in near Rosemont.

759
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:43,410
Excellent idea, Eamonn.

760
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:44,462
No, that won't work.

761
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:45,486
It will work, lvan.

762
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:47,468
We confuse them, we get them
to spread their troops.

763
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:48,591
No, I'm saying it won't work.

764
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,808
Have you something to say here?

765
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,406
I'm saying,
"Forget about the Guildhall."

766
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,005
I've just come from there
this morning.

767
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:54,189
I've walked through there.

768
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:56,235
They're building up
a massive military presence.

769
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:58,642
If we take the lorry down there
with thousands behind it

770
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,365
we're not going to get through,
we're...

771
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:01,329
This is completely wrong.

772
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:02,889
I don't think,
I don't think it's actually...

773
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,944
I don't think it's responsible

774
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:05,162
for us to say
it's going to be fine

775
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:06,379
just because
we want it to be fine.

776
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,594
We do have to look
at the realities

777
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:09,454
that there is a very severe
dispersal problem there.

778
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,145
I am not taking a reroute.

779
00:27:11,182 --> 00:27:14,410
I am not taking a reroute,
and I'm not selling out.

780
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:16,779
-You're not what?
-It's not a sellout.

781
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:17,794
Oh, no, here, wait, Kevin.

782
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,330
Wait, excuse me,
say that again, please.

783
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,832
You're not, what,
you're not selling out?

784
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,629
Bernadette, I have been marching
in this city

785
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,356
just as long as you
and your college friends

786
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:27,110
and I have never
sold anyone out, not ever.

787
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,999
But there are 3,000
British soldiers out there

788
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:31,203
and I am not going to use
our people like cannon fodder.

789
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,540
Now, either we reroute--
turn right up Rossville Street

790
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:35,134
hold the meeting
at Free Derry Corner--

791
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:37,082
or I walk away,
and I will tell my constituents

792
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:39,100
-to walk away as well.
-You'll do what?

793
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:41,050
All the work
these people have done--

794
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,302
that's it, up in smoke?

795
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,162
Listen, we delegate two people--

796
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,228
Bridget, you can be one,
John, Eamonn can be another--

797
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,687
to walk down to the Guildhall
symbolically.

798
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:51,070
That's a good solution.

799
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,184
I just hope everybody knows
in time.

800
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:53,151
They will, they will.

801
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:54,112
All right.

802
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:55,071
Get that sorted out.

803
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:56,052
Right, um...

804
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:25,067
Is Lagan there?

805
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:26,350
It's Cooper.

806
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:38,416
On the one hand

807
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,481
you've got the Catholics pushing
for all sorts of reforms

808
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,104
with the lRA behind most of it,
and on the other

809
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:46,792
the Protestants, who, of course,
don't want to give an inch.

810
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:51,233
Morning, sir.

811
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,440
We can't afford to offend

812
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,230
the Protestant majority,
of course

813
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,015
'cause, uh, they've got
all the guns, for one thing.

814
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,739
Excuse me, sir. Tea's here.

815
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:04,959
Hello, sir.

816
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:07,070
I'll take you in
to see the Brigadier now.

817
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:11,037
Chief Superintendent Lagan, Sir.

818
00:29:11,077 --> 00:29:12,353
Hello, Frank.

819
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:13,468
Morning, Patrick.

820
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:15,581
I don't think you've met
Major General Ford

821
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,830
Commander of Land Forces.

822
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:18,754
Sir, this is
Chief Superintendent Lagan

823
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:19,768
Londonderry Division.

824
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:21,019
Sir.

825
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:23,260
Superintendent, I've heard
a great deal about you

826
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,475
from your Chief Constable.

827
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,559
It's time for us to go.

828
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,061
We're going to shake some hands.

829
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:29,524
I, um, heard from the march
organizers earlier today.

830
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,283
Sir, um, I heard from the civil
rights leaders earlier today

831
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:34,007
and spoke to them
early this morning.

832
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:35,060
Oh, really?

833
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:36,824
Yes, they're anxious
to avoid a confrontation.

834
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,518
They're not going to march
to the Guildhall.

835
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:40,497
They're going to stay
within the Bogside, they say.

836
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:42,392
Oh. So useful to have contacts
in the community.

837
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:43,702
Maurice.

838
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:46,191
Unless he's a Roman Catholic,
of course.

839
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:48,239
What's that all about, Patrick?

840
00:29:49,911 --> 00:29:51,951
Patrick?

841
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,517
What's that all about?

842
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,176
It'll be low-key.

843
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,317
Low-key.

844
00:29:58,356 --> 00:29:59,534
The Paras low-key?

845
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:00,914
Yes, I know, I know.

846
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:01,928
Excuse me, sir.

847
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:03,857
All call signs are now in place

848
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,311
and the Paras have confirmed
the cha cha.

849
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:07,498
Thank you, Charles.

850
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:09,609
The Paras aren't
a low-key regiment.

851
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,141
Listen, they're the best

852
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,387
for the kind
of mass arrest operation

853
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:15,364
that we've got
to carry out today.

854
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:16,452
You listen to me.

855
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:17,704
I know the people of Derry.

856
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,977
And you know that I've spent
the last three years of my life

857
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:21,867
trying to keep a lid
on the trouble in this city.

858
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,306
Frank, you don't need
to tell me this.

859
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:25,543
Look, why do we need to ban
this march in the first place?

860
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:27,466
Why? To keep a crowd

861
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,091
of Protestant politicians
in Stormont

862
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:31,398
hanging onto power
by their fingertips, that's why.

863
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:32,578
I mean, they're the reason

864
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:34,470
why we're in this mess
in the first place.

865
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:37,285
Look, why not
just let the march go ahead?

866
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:39,292
Look, if you want prosecutions

867
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:42,397
why not take photographs
of the ringleaders?

868
00:30:45,764 --> 00:30:47,673
Sir, the General's leaving

869
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,332
and would like a word
before you go.

870
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,279
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

871
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:53,597
Frank, I'm sorry.

872
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:55,454
It's out of my hands.

873
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,650
It's a war, Frank.

874
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,141
We're taking casualties
every week.

875
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:07,069
We've lost 43 British soldiers.

876
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:08,988
I know. I know.

877
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,223
I'm having to write
too many letters, Frank.

878
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:13,298
I'm sorry,
we have to draw the line.

879
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,152
Sir, the General is getting
quite excited.

880
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:18,356
Yes. Thank you, Sergeant Major.

881
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,154
I'm sick of being shot at,
spat on

882
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:29,610
and all the other shit
that goes with this place.

883
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:30,634
It's about time we go out there

884
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:32,017
and show these fuckers
what it's all about.

885
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,393
The reason is
'cause they get away with it

886
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:35,085
and this time they ain't going
to get away with it.

887
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:36,497
You got to get in,
you got to hit them hard

888
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,457
and get in there first.

889
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,919
Get the first one straight in.

890
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:40,205
Same as we did in Belfast.

891
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:41,385
Take no shit.

892
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:42,918
This one's just a civil rights,
though, ain't it?

893
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,171
They're all troublemakers
anyway, mate.

894
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,135
The lot of 'em.

895
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:46,344
They're all mixed in together.

896
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:48,007
Well, that's just like kids,
and that, ain't it?

897
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,475
Yeah, well,
they're mixed in with the kids.

898
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:50,827
What about that major
that died today?

899
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:51,788
Where was his civil rights?

900
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,543
And the two lads last week--
where's their civil rights?

901
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,856
I'm just saying,
they're just kids

902
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:55,971
throwing stones, that's all.

903
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:58,018
You're-You're either with us
on this or you're not.

904
00:31:58,059 --> 00:31:59,138
I'm with you, man.

905
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:00,226
Yeah, you better be.

906
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,313
I'm all right, man.

907
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,301
I'm-I'm up for it.

908
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:04,450
Everyone on the other side
of this wall

909
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:06,429
is enemy,
as far as I'm concerned.

910
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:08,773
Can't see a kid
being an enemy, though.

911
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,261
If they're in the way,
they're in the way.

912
00:32:11,301 --> 00:32:13,472
You got to stick with us
on this.

913
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:14,589
I am.

914
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:15,556
Whatever happens

915
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:16,930
we'll sort it all out
between us, right?

916
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:19,068
When we bang through that wall,
they see that wall come down

917
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,514
they'll shit themselves,
they really will.

918
00:32:20,546 --> 00:32:21,474
We'll just get out there

919
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:22,433
and just kick some arse
out there.

920
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:23,811
Show the hats how to do it.

921
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,740
So, did you go to Mass today?

922
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:33,182
Aye, love.

923
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:34,621
Aye, whose is it?

924
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:35,734
Father Bally.

925
00:32:35,774 --> 00:32:37,400
Ach, he's a nice man.

926
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,615
Aye, he is.

927
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:39,765
He was talking to me after it

928
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:41,877
seeing how I was getting on
after getting out of jail.

929
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,639
Wondering if you'd
got a job yet, I suppose?

930
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:44,623
No, I wasn't.

931
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,968
You're going to get that wee
girl into trouble, you know.

932
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:52,277
What are you on about?

933
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:53,904
You know what I mean.

934
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:55,732
Look, you're not me ma.

935
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,036
Aye, but I'm all you've got.

936
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,484
Sounds like she has horns
on her head.

937
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:04,339
But she's from lrish Street
and you're from the Bogside.

938
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:05,931
You know, at the end of the day

939
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:07,727
she's like, you know,
a Protestant.

940
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:09,834
I'm not saying I've got anything
against her, like

941
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:10,985
'cause she's a nice girl

942
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:13,164
but I just don't want you
and her to get into trouble.

943
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,273
Are you thinking
about getting married here?

944
00:33:15,312 --> 00:33:16,240
Aye, I will be.

945
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:18,573
Well, what do you think your mam
and daddy would say?

946
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:20,712
Look, leave my mam and daddy
out of it.

947
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,467
Your sister's just looking out
for you.

948
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,289
Look, you stay out of it.

949
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:26,819
Look, I'm just worried,
that's all.

950
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:28,005
You know, I worry about you

951
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:29,602
every time you go
outside the door.

952
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:31,333
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

953
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:32,744
Everybody in these flats here--

954
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,560
they worry about their children
whenever they go out at night.

955
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:36,869
Look, I'll be all right.

956
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:37,918
All I want to do is

957
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,999
to look after you
and look after Dennis

958
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,119
and defend this area

959
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,948
from the likes
of them boys there.

960
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:44,193
What do you mean,
the likes of me?

961
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,691
You know,
with working for the Brits.

962
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,522
You'd think you would have got
a decent job.

963
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:49,891
It's working for the Brits
putting that food on the table

964
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:50,939
so don't be complaining.

965
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,321
Can we not have
this conversation

966
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:53,282
at the table, please?

967
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:55,834
I suppose you think throwing
a couple of stones

968
00:33:55,874 --> 00:33:57,728
is going to solve it, son,
do you?

969
00:33:57,761 --> 00:33:59,321
Aye, well,
it's kept them out of here

970
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:00,409
for a while now, hasn't it?

971
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:04,375
If it wasn't for us, you still
wouldn't be living here.

972
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:05,790
Just remember that.

973
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:07,796
Aye, you really believe that,
do you, eh?

974
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:08,765
Aye, I do, actually.

975
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,172
Right, okay.

976
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,002
Look, Mary, I'm going to go out.

977
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:15,090
I'll see you later on.

978
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:16,212
Right.

979
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,843
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

980
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:19,288
Look after yourself, okay?

981
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,336
Are you listening to me?

982
00:34:20,378 --> 00:34:22,100
I don't want you to end up
back in prison

983
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:23,892
'cause you can't marry her
from in there.

984
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,902
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

985
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:27,469
I'll chat to you after.

986
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,350
Yeah?

987
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:36,275
Oh, yes. Hi.

988
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,965
Oh, now, Meg, I dunno.

989
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:41,647
Somewhere between ten
and a million. How's that?

990
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:44,616
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.

991
00:34:44,658 --> 00:34:46,315
All right?

992
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:48,872
-Here's your tea.
-Thanks.

993
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:49,839
Okay?

994
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:52,042
Yeah. What time are you going?

995
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:53,355
I don't know, an hour.

996
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,600
Jesus. How about you?

997
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:56,164
I'm on duty till half two.

998
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:58,146
Derry Journal
and lrish News want

999
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,115
to talk to you.

1000
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,073
What, now?

1001
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,448
No, they'll... they can wait.

1002
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:03,370
They're all right for a bit,
so they are.

1003
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:09,511
Listen, I know...
I know it's hard.

1004
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:11,780
That's just why I pissed off
at you last night.

1005
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:12,830
I know, I'm sorry.

1006
00:35:12,871 --> 00:35:14,398
-That's all right.
-That's okay.

1007
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:15,932
It's all right.

1008
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:16,922
Okay.

1009
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:21,341
Yeah?

1010
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:23,136
Frank, yes.

1011
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:26,072
Is it the Paras?

1012
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:32,639
Well, Jesus, Frank

1013
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,518
who the hell's running
this thing?

1014
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:38,772
It was Lagan.

1015
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:40,756
He says the army are
very hard-line

1016
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:42,804
and we should think
about canceling.

1017
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:47,033
No way, lvan. You can't.

1018
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:49,171
You can't cancel.

1019
00:35:49,211 --> 00:35:51,512
No.

1020
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:52,790
Geez, do you know how many times

1021
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:54,199
I think we should
just give this up?

1022
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:55,662
There isn't a day goes by
I don't think

1023
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,361
"Oh, wish I could take her
to the pictures

1024
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:59,701
or take her to see Charlie Magee
at the Stardust," you know

1025
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:01,840
and then I think, "What if
someone sees us?" you know.

1026
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:03,503
What if someone decides
to have a go at you

1027
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:04,948
because you're
this Catholic girl...

1028
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:05,909
Hi.

1029
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:07,348
Ivan, when are the stewards
coming in?

1030
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,557
Uh, we need to talk about that.

1031
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:09,904
I need to talk to Kevin
about that.

1032
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:11,629
I need to make sure
they are more disciplined

1033
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:12,877
and know
exactly what's happening.

1034
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:14,188
Who's going
in front of the lorry

1035
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:15,174
who's going behind, okay?

1036
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,712
-All right.
-lf you talk to Kevin now...

1037
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:18,608
I'll give him a ring and then
you can have a word with him.

1038
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:19,567
Okay.

1039
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,843
I'm just gonna talk to Kevin,
all right?

1040
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,828
It's all right.

1041
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:30,789
Kevin, yeah...
yeah, I've spoken to Lagan.

1042
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:32,355
He says the Paras are in town.

1043
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:34,850
Listen, the stewards must know
what they're doing

1044
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,134
when they form the line.

1045
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:37,097
Yeah.

1046
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,398
No, seriously, Kevin,
get on that now.

1047
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:40,480
Okay, bye.

1048
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:48,100
I mean, I don't know
what I would do, you know?

1049
00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:51,231
Catholic girl, Protestant
civil rights, Fenian lover?

1050
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:53,373
So that's why I'm doing it,
you know?

1051
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,267
That's why I go to the meetings

1052
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,332
that's why I go to the marches,
because, you know...

1053
00:36:58,371 --> 00:37:00,280
I think
we're worth marching for.

1054
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:03,582
Yes?

1055
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:04,697
Uh-huh.

1056
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:06,362
Yeah, I'll be down
in about an hour

1057
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:07,327
something like that.

1058
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,472
Get Bridget on to them.

1059
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:11,293
All right, yeah, give them a cup
of tea or something, Jesus.

1060
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,951
No, give them a drink,
even better.

1061
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:18,840
My father was in the EVA for
Christ's sake, you know that.

1062
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:19,923
I know, lvan.

1063
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:22,035
I marched in flute bands.

1064
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,488
Your brother was shot
by the RUC.

1065
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:31,349
So, I don't take you out.

1066
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,422
We don't go to the pictures.

1067
00:37:33,494 --> 00:37:36,494
I go to the meetings,
I go to the marches

1068
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:40,046
and all the time I'm thinking,
if I could just sort this

1069
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:42,604
you know, if just one day,
maybe soon...

1070
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,602
we can be normal...

1071
00:37:49,073 --> 00:37:51,691
and we won't have to worry.

1072
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:59,141
I know.

1073
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:36,510
Stewards, please ensure
that all people

1074
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:38,845
joining the demonstration
from the rear

1075
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,286
are channeled in safely

1076
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,766
keeping clear
of that fenced area, please.

1077
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:44,820
Thank you.

1078
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:48,755
We want everybody safe here
today. Thank you.

1079
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:51,162
Come on, folks,
sort that area out, please.

1080
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:53,910
Folks, there is a start
to a demonstration

1081
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:56,433
and there is an end
to a demonstration.

1082
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,927
If you think this is
the start to a demonstration

1083
00:38:58,969 --> 00:38:59,950
catch yourselves on.

1084
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:02,512
Stewards, I need you
down the back there, please.

1085
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,868
All right, folks?

1086
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,528
God, eh, what about this, eh?

1087
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:11,085
Willie, make sure
you've got that, okay?

1088
00:39:11,124 --> 00:39:12,465
I will, surely.

1089
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,612
All right, folks, how goes it?

1090
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,244
Ivan, will you sign this for me?

1091
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:16,362
Oh, certainly, missus.

1092
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:17,646
With love and kisses, eh?

1093
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,143
How are you feeling, lvan?

1094
00:39:19,186 --> 00:39:22,087
Oh, right at this moment...
Iike Martin Luther King.

1095
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:23,851
Is he a Catholic boy then, eh?

1096
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,277
All civil rights people
are Catholic, missus, except me.

1097
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:28,390
And I've got special
dispensation from the Pope.

1098
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,478
Eh, boys?

1099
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,564
Barney, glad you could make it.

1100
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:31,849
Aye, I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1101
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:32,867
Sure, I know that.

1102
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,185
Jim, ready for another march,
eh?

1103
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,234
Oh, aye, of course.

1104
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:37,380
Oh, lvan, it's great, great!

1105
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,434
All set?

1106
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,402
Well, absolutely.

1107
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:41,321
Would you have pulled out, lvan?

1108
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:43,721
What, and disappointed
all these people?

1109
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:45,061
You're a bastard, you.

1110
00:39:45,097 --> 00:39:48,007
Oh, no, no, Eamonn,
just a politician.

1111
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:48,258
Oh, no, no, Eamonn,
just a politician.

1112
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:49,789
Jesus Christ, look at that.

1113
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,258
What an atmosphere, boys.

1114
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,959
Look at the amount of people.

1115
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:54,045
I think I see...

1116
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:56,059
Youse marching down
with us and that?

1117
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,579
No, we're gonna hang about here
in case the Brits try anything.

1118
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,666
We'll be down later.

1119
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,528
We'll have sent them home
by then.

1120
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:03,488
Aye, right.

1121
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:05,408
Boys, they should be doing
a bit more

1122
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,368
-do you not think?
-Aye.

1123
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,709
We do all the work, Jimmy.

1124
00:40:07,744 --> 00:40:10,362
Frigging sure, after what
happened to McGilligan.

1125
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,675
Are you up for it, Jimmy?

1126
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:13,117
Up for it?

1127
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,833
I'll be up on the front line.
I'll be up on the front line.

1128
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:16,797
That's a promise.

1129
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:19,098
Brits out, Brits out.

1130
00:40:19,132 --> 00:40:20,146
What do you think, Gerry?

1131
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:21,115
-Brits out?
-Aye.

1132
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:22,609
We'll all get the Brits out
together.

1133
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:23,666
-Aye.
-Are you up for it?

1134
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,399
We're gonna move forward

1135
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,675
to give you a wee bit
of leeway, right.

1136
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:35,888
Make sure you get
all that there.

1137
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:36,941
Sure.

1138
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,837
Sweep all the way right down...
Iook at that.

1139
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:49,993
We shall overcome,
we shall overcome

1140
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:54,123
We shall overcome

1141
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,533
Someday...

1142
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:00,678
My God, they'll never
stop us now, boys.

1143
00:41:00,718 --> 00:41:04,775
...Deep in our hearts...

1144
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:06,535
The whole of Bogside is here.

1145
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:08,906
...I do believe

1146
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:15,396
That we shall overcome someday.

1147
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:20,095
...moving now. Over.

1148
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:23,680
Six-One Yankee,
the crowd are on the move.

1149
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:24,961
We have a go.

1150
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:26,590
All right, gentlemen.

1151
00:41:26,628 --> 00:41:29,475
Sergeant Major, pass it on,
the crowd's on the move.

1152
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:32,223
Pass it out to the O.P.,
the crowd's on the move.

1153
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:33,535
...that they are ready.

1154
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:34,498
Here we go.

1155
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,985
Sigs, Sigs, make sure
all call signs know

1156
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:39,445
the march is on the move now.

1157
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:42,040
-What do we want?
-Rights!

1158
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,737
-When do we want them?
-Now!

1159
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,464
-What do we want?
-Rights!

1160
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,257
-When do we want them?
-Now!

1161
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:49,082
Who'd have thought it, eh?

1162
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:53,872
Okay, stewards, keep the front
of the lorry clear, please.

1163
00:41:53,915 --> 00:41:56,020
Willie, Willie,
come here, please.

1164
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:58,032
Yeah, get the whole stream,
the whole way up.

1165
00:41:58,074 --> 00:41:59,021
Oh, I can see 'em.

1166
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:00,338
I can't see the end of it.

1167
00:42:00,377 --> 00:42:03,954
Bear in mind we are going
down a hill here...

1168
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:10,892
Come on, boys.

1169
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,842
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

1170
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:18,130
This is a great day for lreland.
Absolutely.

1171
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:25,258
...vital
that we retain our dignity.

1172
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,492
We must keep this safe,
dignified...

1173
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:31,111
...Zero, this is Six-One Yankee.

1174
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:32,492
No information...

1175
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:36,550
The crowd is now halfway down
William Street. Over.

1176
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,497
Sir they're just about here now,
sir.

1177
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,644
Seven-Six.
Crowd is waving, chanting

1178
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,170
but, uh, causing
no particular aggro. Over.

1179
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:44,135
See what I mean?

1180
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:46,055
Tell the people of Derry
they can't march

1181
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:47,679
and they'll come out in droves.

1182
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,834
Right, folks,
keep that corner area clear.

1183
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,463
We're approaching
some of the British.

1184
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:56,028
Hold your positions.
Keep your calm.

1185
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:04,096
Hello, Six-Five,
this is Six-One Yankee.

1186
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:06,105
-Crowd approaching...
-Yeah, Five-Six Bravo

1187
00:43:06,146 --> 00:43:07,607
this is, uh, Five-Niner Sunray.

1188
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:09,111
So, in your opinion

1189
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,698
we will not get a Pig
through the wall? Over.

1190
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:13,946
Roger.

1191
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:15,870
Oh, shit.

1192
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:17,112
Colonel.

1193
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,245
It's from the O.P.

1194
00:43:20,285 --> 00:43:22,172
They've just checked the front
of the wall.

1195
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:23,698
The wall
directly in front of here

1196
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:25,681
-there is a three-foot drop.
-Fuck.

1197
00:43:25,723 --> 00:43:28,788
In their opinion, when we try
and get the Pig through

1198
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:30,680
we just ain't gonna get through.

1199
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:32,817
We're gonna...
it's gonna go tits up.

1200
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:34,350
We still need to cut them off
from either side.

1201
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:35,799
I think we're gonna have to go
over the top.

1202
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:36,759
We'll have to.

1203
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,613
Okay, let's get ready
and be ready

1204
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:41,198
to cut through this wire
and go over this wall.

1205
00:43:41,237 --> 00:43:42,186
Let's get ready now.

1206
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:43,789
Okay, I'm on it. Sergeant Major!

1207
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,651
-What do we want?
-Rights!

1208
00:43:45,684 --> 00:43:47,506
-When do we want them?
-Now!

1209
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:57,608
Whoo!

1210
00:43:57,648 --> 00:43:59,174
Hey, do you think we'll have
much bother today, Jim?

1211
00:43:59,215 --> 00:44:00,143
Eh?

1212
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:01,516
So, you think we'll
have much bother today?

1213
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:02,695
Oh, no.

1214
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:05,417
Hey, we'll get a riot going,
that's for sure, like.

1215
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:06,947
There's plenty of troops
about and stuff, so.

1216
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:08,996
You're not worried
about getting caught, are you?

1217
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:11,109
Aye, I don't wanna go back
inside again, you know.

1218
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,830
Hey, you shouldn't have given
yourself up over Hester, man.

1219
00:44:13,866 --> 00:44:14,946
Oh, leave it out, okay?

1220
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,774
-You've to watch yourself, mate.
-Just enjoy the day.

1221
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:18,565
We're here for our civil rights
today, right, boys?

1222
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,549
Aye, that's right, mate.

1223
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,526
Somebody help
with these ladders!

1224
00:44:28,614 --> 00:44:31,482
Jesus, there's a lot of them,
isn't there?

1225
00:44:31,524 --> 00:44:34,076
Come on, move it! Move it!

1226
00:44:38,306 --> 00:44:43,007
We're just going right
at the corner here.

1227
00:44:43,104 --> 00:44:44,348
Give me that thing now.

1228
00:44:44,384 --> 00:44:45,813
-I need it.
-Right, right.

1229
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:52,538
-Stewards, stewards.
-Here, keep them steady.

1230
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:53,782
Stewards, stewards.

1231
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,413
Keep them there, Barney.

1232
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:56,563
Keep 'em going.

1233
00:44:56,604 --> 00:44:58,938
See that there, up there,
how provocative is that?

1234
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:03,093
Brits go home!

1235
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:05,014
Stewards, keep this...

1236
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:07,185
Don't touch it.

1237
00:45:07,223 --> 00:45:09,263
What the hell is that, lads?

1238
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:11,473
Paras!

1239
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,266
Brits out! Brits out!

1240
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:14,894
We don't want youse here!

1241
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:16,013
Zero-Six-Five.

1242
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:18,921
Recon is passing
my forward locations

1243
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:21,330
and there's a small amount
of stoning going on there.

1244
00:45:21,363 --> 00:45:22,792
-Over.
-Six-Five.

1245
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:25,168
That's the Paras getting stoned
from up here, sir.

1246
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:26,858
So, the head of...
the head of...

1247
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:28,620
Why are One Para
showing themselves?

1248
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:29,833
It's the chaps on the wall, sir.

1249
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:30,799
OPs and wire cutters

1250
00:45:30,832 --> 00:45:32,140
for when they have
to go through.

1251
00:45:32,175 --> 00:45:33,516
If the crowd sees the Paras

1252
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,459
that'll inflame the situation,
Patrick.

1253
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:36,484
Thank you, Frank.

1254
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,802
-What?
-You have to go through.

1255
00:45:37,837 --> 00:45:40,651
Head of the column
approaching Aggro Corner. Out.

1256
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:43,171
Sir, this is where we hope
they're going to turn.

1257
00:45:43,212 --> 00:45:44,673
Well, that's what they said.

1258
00:45:44,715 --> 00:45:48,607
People, we're just going right
at the corner here!

1259
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:52,128
Follow me! Let's go.

1260
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:54,022
Keep back there, folks.

1261
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:56,258
Keep moving here.

1262
00:45:57,926 --> 00:45:59,933
People, we're turning right
here.

1263
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:01,980
Turning right. Thank you.

1264
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:03,930
The march is proceeding
to the right.

1265
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:08,575
If you go that way, you'll have
no part in this demonstration.

1266
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,104
They're turning the wrong way,
lads.

1267
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:11,073
They're going right.

1268
00:46:11,106 --> 00:46:12,480
We going to get
to the Guildhall.

1269
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:13,789
We're going to the Guildhall.

1270
00:46:13,824 --> 00:46:15,679
Come on. Push through them.

1271
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:16,760
Come on, Gerry.

1272
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:23,380
Gerry, good man, good man.

1273
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:24,599
Yes!

1274
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:27,025
Let's give them hell!

1275
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:29,522
A small number
from the middle of the crowd

1276
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:32,279
are breaking away,
I repeat, breaking away.

1277
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:35,096
Running down towards
serial One-Four. Over.

1278
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:35,150
Running down towards
serial One-Four. Over.

1279
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:40,434
This demonstration is proceeding
to the right.

1280
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,160
Ivan, I told you
this would happen.

1281
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:43,506
Keep them coming this way!

1282
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,500
Follow peacefully to the right,
thank you.

1283
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,841
Keep coming this way!

1284
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,874
Just relax, man.

1285
00:46:52,914 --> 00:46:54,702
Listen, we have got
to keep the crowd going.

1286
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:56,592
If the truck keeps going
to Free Derry Corner

1287
00:46:56,624 --> 00:46:57,605
that will be the beacon.

1288
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,575
They will follow it.

1289
00:46:58,608 --> 00:46:59,949
Right, you stay here.

1290
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,925
I'm going down to the barrier.

1291
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:03,592
Okay, everyone, come on.

1292
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,801
Everyone behind the lorry.
Follow the lorry.

1293
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:08,389
Listen...

1294
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:09,770
We must stick together.

1295
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:11,080
Stick together, folks.

1296
00:47:11,115 --> 00:47:12,489
We're not splitting up.

1297
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:13,505
No trouble today.

1298
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:15,040
We're not going
to the Guildhall.

1299
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,326
Stay behind the lorry.

1300
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:18,881
We are sticking together.
Come on.

1301
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,807
Sorry, no, folks, wrong way.

1302
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,425
We're supposed to go back
to Free Derry Corner.

1303
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:25,023
Let me through there, folks.

1304
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:26,109
They're past barrier 12

1305
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,419
and are actually, in fact,
heading directly for us.

1306
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:30,591
Yeah, that's
just what we predicted.

1307
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:31,708
Yes, indeed.

1308
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,617
Well, you'd better
stand the men by.

1309
00:47:34,692 --> 00:47:36,665
Just coming down there now, sir.

1310
00:47:36,706 --> 00:47:38,561
This isn't the march, this is...

1311
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:40,119
This is the breakaway group.

1312
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:41,623
They're coming down
to barrier 14.

1313
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,388
They're trying to get
to the Guildhall.

1314
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:47,449
Yobbos, obviously trying
to cause some trouble.

1315
00:47:47,486 --> 00:47:48,566
Get out!

1316
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:51,223
Get out to fuck,
you British bastards.

1317
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:52,439
Boys, get back, get back!

1318
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:53,404
Get out to fuck.

1319
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:54,384
That's Cooper, boys.

1320
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:55,639
Out! Out! Brits out!

1321
00:47:55,676 --> 00:47:56,624
Have you got your stones?

1322
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:57,650
I've got stones.

1323
00:47:57,691 --> 00:47:59,000
Hey...

1324
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,252
For God's sake,
get all of these boys back.

1325
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,709
Excuse me. I'm lvan Cooper.

1326
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:10,960
I'm a member of Parliament.

1327
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:11,947
Will you give me some time...

1328
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,234
This is an illegal gathering.

1329
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,197
You must disperse!

1330
00:48:14,229 --> 00:48:16,651
Hey! Hey! Cut that out.

1331
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,602
You must disperse!

1332
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:19,723
Cut that out.

1333
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:20,842
Take a shot.

1334
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:22,857
Take a shot, you said?

1335
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:24,458
I'll take a shot.

1336
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:29,709
This is Nine-Zero Alpha.

1337
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:32,199
I have reports
of the crowd becoming hostile

1338
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:34,955
at Zero-14, um,
throwing bricks at center. Over.

1339
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,062
I want to know
how many yobbos are that...

1340
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:39,337
are that way
up towards the barrier from us.

1341
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:41,543
Sigs, I want to find out
from the O.P.

1342
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,467
how many we're going
to scoop up, if we go now.

1343
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:46,433
Contact the barriers
at 12 and 14

1344
00:48:46,474 --> 00:48:47,935
and tell them to be ready

1345
00:48:47,978 --> 00:48:51,752
to move those barriers fast
if we need them.

1346
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:53,572
Boys, round me, please.

1347
00:48:53,608 --> 00:48:55,614
It's kicked off
at barrier 14, right?

1348
00:48:55,656 --> 00:48:58,688
This is it, we're going
to start going in pretty soon.

1349
00:48:58,726 --> 00:49:01,093
We've got to stop
with the stones there...

1350
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:04,255
Under Section Six
of the Civil Authorities

1351
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,397
Special Powers Act
Northern lreland

1352
00:49:06,435 --> 00:49:10,623
processions and parades are
banned until further notice.

1353
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:12,894
We will enforce this ban
vigorously

1354
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:16,441
and anyone organizing
or taking part in any such event

1355
00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:19,325
is liable
to immediate arrest.

1356
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:24,471
Do we still have stoning at 14?

1357
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:25,436
We do, sir.

1358
00:49:25,468 --> 00:49:27,061
RUC man's addressing the crowd
and he's...

1359
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,091
Send in Neptune, please,
Michael.

1360
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:40,654
Ah, shit, boys, stay back.

1361
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:42,685
Stay back, boys!

1362
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,715
Get back. Forget the Guildhall.
The water's coming.

1363
00:49:53,963 --> 00:49:54,889
Come on, Jim! Jim, watch!

1364
00:49:54,922 --> 00:49:55,849
Run, boys!

1365
00:49:55,881 --> 00:49:56,808
No, Gerry.

1366
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:58,433
Gerry, come on, aye?

1367
00:49:58,472 --> 00:50:00,064
We need stones.

1368
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:01,727
You're making matters worse.

1369
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:02,845
Will you get back?

1370
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:04,160
Fuck off!

1371
00:50:04,196 --> 00:50:06,202
Go on, go on, go on.

1372
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:07,932
Go on, we're all going.

1373
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,751
Deep in my heart...

1374
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:12,758
Nice and slow.

1375
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:16,593
...I still believe...

1376
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:18,523
That's... That's much better.

1377
00:50:18,555 --> 00:50:20,409
...That we shall overcome

1378
00:50:20,442 --> 00:50:22,514
Someday.

1379
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:24,045
Give yourselves a hand there.

1380
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:29,039
That's it, folks.

1381
00:50:29,077 --> 00:50:31,377
Free Derry Corner,
that's where the meeting is.

1382
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,319
Going to Free Derry Corner.

1383
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:36,908
Get away from there, come on.

1384
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,079
Come on, this way.

1385
00:50:48,105 --> 00:50:50,372
Neptune seems to have cleared
William Street.

1386
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:52,893
The main body have disappeared
down towards Rossville Street

1387
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:54,907
Ieaving behind a hard-core
element of hooligans

1388
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:56,409
who have now gone up to 12,
up to 13

1389
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:57,824
and again,
a large element at 14.

1390
00:50:57,859 --> 00:50:59,385
This is getting bigger.
It's escalating.

1391
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:00,472
Yeah.

1392
00:51:00,513 --> 00:51:02,846
Rubber bullets at discretion.

1393
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:04,155
Come on, Gerry.

1394
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,098
I can't get caught.
I can't get caught.

1395
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:07,548
You're not going
to get caught.

1396
00:51:09,882 --> 00:51:11,059
Jesus!

1397
00:51:11,098 --> 00:51:12,591
Holy fuck. Keep going.

1398
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:14,737
They're firing at us, boys.

1399
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:16,630
You want to run for it?

1400
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:18,517
Yes, roger that.

1401
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,978
I'll give you a sitrep
when we get there.

1402
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:21,808
Out.

1403
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:23,817
It seems like the, uh,
riots are developing

1404
00:51:23,858 --> 00:51:24,937
back towards barrier 12

1405
00:51:24,978 --> 00:51:27,398
and back up William Street
towards Rossville Street.

1406
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,056
Let's go round there,
see how it's going.

1407
00:51:30,094 --> 00:51:32,296
-We are under heavy bombardment.
-And it's now kicking off at 13.

1408
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:33,379
CS gas at discretion.

1409
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:36,003
I repeat: Hostiles
within our location...

1410
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:37,634
What are you doing?

1411
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:39,461
I'm trying to use minimum force.

1412
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,731
I need to know as soon
as you got separation.

1413
00:51:57,373 --> 00:51:58,801
This is no good.
They're not moving.

1414
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:00,054
Back up...

1415
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:01,813
-No, we'll go round this way.
-No! No!

1416
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,605
We'll go round
the other way to the Guildhall.

1417
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:05,200
We're near the Guildhall.
Come this way.

1418
00:52:14,962 --> 00:52:16,041
How many yobbos?

1419
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:19,177
-300 to 400 yobbos.
-300 to 400 yobbos.

1420
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:20,142
Okay, perfect.

1421
00:52:20,174 --> 00:52:21,156
We're getting close.

1422
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:22,277
Okay.

1423
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:24,225
Right, Sigs, can you
give me the radio?

1424
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:25,576
Sergeant Major.

1425
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:28,926
Get the Sergeants in,
get the Troop Commanders in.

1426
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:32,545
Hello, Zero, this
is Six-Five Sunray speaking.

1427
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,510
We're ready.

1428
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:35,581
We want a "go" on the scoop up.

1429
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,953
We want to go now
on the scoop up.

1430
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,026
Over.

1431
00:52:47,357 --> 00:52:49,178
You all right, man?
You all right?

1432
00:52:49,212 --> 00:52:50,139
I'm choking, man.

1433
00:52:50,171 --> 00:52:52,374
You all right, man?

1434
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,337
Stay here, all right?

1435
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,351
I'm dying here.

1436
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:56,333
Hey, they're taking photographs.

1437
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:58,163
They're taking photos.

1438
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:00,880
Why are they taking photographs?

1439
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:02,061
Hey, Dennis...

1440
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,441
We have about 400
to 500 guys rioting.

1441
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:04,651
Hello, Zero.
So, they're in there.

1442
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:05,834
This is Six-Five Sunray
speaking.

1443
00:53:05,873 --> 00:53:07,563
We're getting close
to our scoop-up time, okay?

1444
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,582
The yobbos are in there.

1445
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:10,084
I want to see these
bastards lifted, okay?

1446
00:53:10,127 --> 00:53:11,817
We are ready to move now
with three call signs.

1447
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:12,781
Can we go? Over.

1448
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:14,667
Six-Five are to go nowhere.

1449
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,771
Six-Five, stay where they are.

1450
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,696
...split across
to Zero-One-Five

1451
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:21,923
and they are being stoned
by around the 15 left area.

1452
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:24,957
If we don't go in hard,
we're going to have tears.

1453
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:26,076
Do you understand?

1454
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:27,741
You get the guys
psyched up.

1455
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:29,371
Rebrief them
on the update.

1456
00:53:29,411 --> 00:53:31,198
They're not letting us go yet.

1457
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:32,477
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1458
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:35,576
Out! Out! Out! Out!

1459
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:39,227
Frances, Frances... here.

1460
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,877
Oh, good Lord...

1461
00:53:41,979 --> 00:53:43,733
Oh... a shambles.

1462
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:45,110
They broke
through the steward's line

1463
00:53:45,144 --> 00:53:46,071
and kids everywhere.

1464
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:47,030
The Brits then start up...

1465
00:53:47,063 --> 00:53:49,233
I mean, why do they...
why do they have to overreact?

1466
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,276
You know, it's a peaceful
march, for God's sake.

1467
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:52,842
'Cause they're scared.
They're scared.

1468
00:53:52,884 --> 00:53:54,606
Can you imagine
if people started to march

1469
00:53:54,642 --> 00:53:55,656
in Manchester or London?

1470
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:56,646
It's just so provoking.

1471
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:57,899
Anyway, I think we're...

1472
00:53:57,937 --> 00:53:59,823
-I think we're all right.
-It's okay.

1473
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,487
Come on!

1474
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:13,534
Let's get our wires cut!
Come on!

1475
00:54:13,574 --> 00:54:16,028
-Cut these wires.
-Cut the barbed wire!

1476
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:17,017
-Come on!
-Fucking mick.

1477
00:54:21,665 --> 00:54:23,388
Fucking contact!

1478
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:32,309
What the fuck was that?

1479
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:34,320
O.P.'s returning fire, sir.

1480
00:54:34,362 --> 00:54:37,262
That wasn't rubber bullets.
That wasn't rubber bullets.

1481
00:54:37,303 --> 00:54:38,863
That was something different.

1482
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:41,007
It's John, he's been shot!
He's dead. Come on!

1483
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:46,087
He says someone's shot.

1484
00:54:49,488 --> 00:54:51,429
What happened?
What happened?

1485
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:53,193
He's been shot.
The Army shot him.

1486
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,658
Jesus, get him up. Help him up.

1487
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:55,628
Go on, help him up.

1488
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,805
-Help him.
-Get him up!

1489
00:54:56,843 --> 00:54:57,824
You all right, Damien?

1490
00:54:57,867 --> 00:54:58,793
Oh, Jesus.

1491
00:54:58,826 --> 00:54:59,840
Damien, are you all right?

1492
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:00,808
Who done it?

1493
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:01,822
The Army shot him.

1494
00:55:01,864 --> 00:55:03,140
They shot an old man...

1495
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,636
Damien, are you all right?

1496
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:06,019
Can you hear me, Damien?

1497
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:06,980
The bastards.

1498
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:10,110
Jesus Christ, a man's been shot.

1499
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:12,542
Bastards shot my cousin.

1500
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:14,486
I can't believe
they shot me cousin.

1501
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:15,989
The boys are going in!

1502
00:55:16,031 --> 00:55:18,364
I can't believe
they shot me cousin.

1503
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:19,923
The boys are going in.

1504
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:24,111
They shot the old man!

1505
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,672
Five-Six Bravo,
confirm your situation.

1506
00:55:26,713 --> 00:55:29,394
What were the rounds
we just heard? Over.

1507
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:34,283
Okay, sir, the O.P. has
just fired five rounds.

1508
00:55:34,324 --> 00:55:36,744
They've inflicted
two casualties.

1509
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:38,672
I think it was nail bombs
or shooting.

1510
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:39,719
They're getting a lot of aggro.

1511
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,687
They got a lot of crowd.

1512
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:41,766
They're firing baton rounds,
too.

1513
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:43,268
That's one incoming!

1514
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,258
Get down off the wall.

1515
00:55:44,301 --> 00:55:45,380
We've just had one round

1516
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,946
across the guards
at the wall, sir.

1517
00:55:46,987 --> 00:55:48,710
What the hell are you doing?!

1518
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:50,022
They shot the old man!

1519
00:55:50,057 --> 00:55:52,576
It's unauthorized,
for Christ's sake.

1520
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:53,826
Get the car here!

1521
00:55:53,863 --> 00:55:56,993
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

1522
00:55:57,029 --> 00:55:58,076
They've shot the old man!

1523
00:55:58,117 --> 00:55:59,163
They shot the old man.

1524
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:00,130
You fucking bastard.

1525
00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:01,656
There's women and children
out there!

1526
00:56:01,698 --> 00:56:02,942
Get your hands off my weapons.

1527
00:56:02,978 --> 00:56:06,358
You bastards!

1528
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,503
Bastards!

1529
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:10,068
Fucking bastards!

1530
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:12,213
Fucking shot me cousin!

1531
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:13,909
Die, you bastards!

1532
00:56:13,946 --> 00:56:16,149
Go on, you bastards!

1533
00:56:16,185 --> 00:56:17,494
Fucking shot me cousin.

1534
00:56:17,528 --> 00:56:19,567
Go on, bastards!

1535
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:21,744
Brits out! Brits out! Brits out!

1536
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:24,780
I think it's time
for the Paras to go in.

1537
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,501
They've got a lot of aggro
just the other side of the wall.

1538
00:56:27,538 --> 00:56:28,617
They've got some kids
over there.

1539
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:29,582
Okay.

1540
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:30,989
We should get them
down off that wall.

1541
00:56:31,024 --> 00:56:32,267
We're not going
to get across there

1542
00:56:32,303 --> 00:56:33,415
if they've got
that wall covered.

1543
00:56:33,486 --> 00:56:34,892
-We've got to get out of here.
-Okay...

1544
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:36,680
I don't think we'll get
the Company across safely.

1545
00:56:36,716 --> 00:56:37,795
We'll do it with the vehicles.

1546
00:56:37,835 --> 00:56:39,329
So, we're gonna ax this totally?

1547
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:40,777
We're not going over the wall?

1548
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:42,303
No, we'll do it in the vehicles.

1549
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:44,831
Support Company in the vehicles,
"A" and "C" on foot.

1550
00:56:44,871 --> 00:56:47,684
Change of plan--
we're not going over the wall.

1551
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:50,651
We're gonna go up James Street
through barrier 12

1552
00:56:50,692 --> 00:56:53,025
where the Light Air
Defense Regiment is

1553
00:56:53,058 --> 00:56:54,486
download at James Street

1554
00:56:54,529 --> 00:56:57,844
and do a scoop up with Charlie
Company at Aggro Corner.

1555
00:56:57,887 --> 00:56:59,609
We're moving in two minutes.

1556
00:56:59,646 --> 00:57:02,066
Inform the O.P. now
that there's a change of plan.

1557
00:57:02,109 --> 00:57:04,376
We're taking the Company
through barrier 12.

1558
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:05,338
Yes, sir.

1559
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,093
We're taking the whole Company.

1560
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:09,648
Hello, Zero. This is
Six-Five Sunray speaking.

1561
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:11,595
We've got to go now
on the scoop up

1562
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:13,393
or we're gonna miss them. Over.

1563
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,053
Colonel, the lads want to go.

1564
00:57:15,092 --> 00:57:16,106
We're ready to go.

1565
00:57:16,147 --> 00:57:20,050
Hold on, hold on.

1566
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:20,943
-Who's this?
-Six-Five Para, sir.

1567
00:57:20,977 --> 00:57:22,383
Six-Five. No. No, wait.

1568
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,724
Yeah, he reckons he can pick up

1569
00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:25,416
some of the hooligans
from there. Over.

1570
00:57:25,454 --> 00:57:26,402
No, we wait.

1571
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,964
Six-Five, tell your Sunray
to wait, hold his position.

1572
00:57:29,004 --> 00:57:31,752
Fucking people at Brigade!

1573
00:57:31,786 --> 00:57:34,206
All right, tell One and Three
to move forward

1574
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:36,070
to the barriers now, on foot.

1575
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:39,004
We'll go to 12 in the vehicle.

1576
00:57:39,046 --> 00:57:40,255
We'll move now.

1577
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:41,569
Okay.

1578
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:43,423
All right, Sergeant Major,
let's move now, let's go!

1579
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,312
Hello, Zero, this is
Six-Five Sunray speaking.

1580
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:48,191
We are moving forward
to the barriers now.

1581
00:57:48,224 --> 00:57:51,899
We've got to go. Out.

1582
00:57:51,933 --> 00:57:53,874
Right. Let's go.

1583
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,475
Move! Move it!

1584
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:56,442
Go on!

1585
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:58,382
Move! Get in! Get in!

1586
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:13,422
-Hoods on!
-Yes!

1587
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:14,567
Canisters load!

1588
00:58:14,607 --> 00:58:16,874
Check your gear.

1589
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,891
Come on!

1590
00:58:17,934 --> 00:58:19,078
Let's go!

1591
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:20,839
Hello, Zero, this is Six-Five.

1592
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,881
My Sunray has deployed his units
slightly...

1593
00:58:22,922 --> 00:58:24,165
On whose authority?

1594
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,207
...in preparation for any orders
you might have. Over.

1595
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:27,807
Whose...?
Why have One Para moved?

1596
00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:28,926
Six-Five, this is Zero.

1597
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:31,746
Hold your position. Out.

1598
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,812
I want to... I want to know
where this has come from, Mike.

1599
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,126
It'll be coming
from their Sunray, sir.

1600
00:58:36,162 --> 00:58:37,655
Can we tell them
to wait at the barriers

1601
00:58:37,696 --> 00:58:39,190
until we give the word?

1602
00:58:39,232 --> 00:58:40,409
...some more gas put down

1603
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:42,551
to about a hundred yards
beyond the flats...

1604
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:45,173
-I'll push my way through here.
-Go on, lvan.

1605
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:46,999
-See you in a bit, okay?
-lvan, I'll go up, too.

1606
00:58:47,035 --> 00:58:48,310
You come up.
I'll see you up there.

1607
00:58:48,346 --> 00:58:49,425
-Aye, okay.
-All right, folks.

1608
00:58:49,465 --> 00:58:50,479
Let us through there.

1609
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,407
Let's hear it,
ladies and gentlemen

1610
00:58:52,439 --> 00:58:54,827
a nice round of applause,
please, for, uh...

1611
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,178
God Almighty.

1612
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,901
Let's go, Sigs.

1613
00:59:08,557 --> 00:59:10,378
Mike, go up to the barrier

1614
00:59:10,412 --> 00:59:12,931
and tell the gunners
to move it now.

1615
00:59:12,971 --> 00:59:14,944
Hello, Zero, this is Six-Five.

1616
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:17,155
We're ready to go now. Over.

1617
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:18,467
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1618
00:59:18,503 --> 00:59:20,989
Oh, fucking hell.
Come on, let's move.

1619
00:59:21,029 --> 00:59:22,621
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

1620
00:59:22,661 --> 00:59:24,034
Come on!

1621
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:26,968
Put your hands together and
give a big warm Derry welcome

1622
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,008
to Eamonn McCann...

1623
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:31,094
Bridget Bond...

1624
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:32,247
...have started to thin out.

1625
00:59:32,286 --> 00:59:33,431
We need to get over there...

1626
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,501
...Bernadette Devlin...

1627
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,426
...and a man who really needs
no introduction

1628
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,846
so I won't give him one:
lvan Cooper!

1629
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,921
Well, we've marched a long way
together here, folks.

1630
00:59:47,957 --> 00:59:50,955
So, I think
I'll get this started.

1631
00:59:50,995 --> 00:59:52,074
Look at this fucking lot.

1632
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:54,087
Just waiting for the off, boys.

1633
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:55,850
It's been a difficult day

1634
00:59:55,888 --> 00:59:58,341
but a glorious one
here in Derry.

1635
00:59:58,381 --> 01:00:01,227
All of us wending our way
down the hill together.

1636
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,146
Men, women and children
marching.

1637
01:00:03,178 --> 01:00:07,878
Mrs. Hammer, I haven't seen you
march like that since '68.

1638
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:10,049
But, uh...

1639
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:12,899
Iet's not forget,
in all this confusion

1640
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:15,713
that we face a choice
as a society.

1641
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:17,240
Not about what we want.

1642
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:19,353
We all know what we want:
Radical change.

1643
01:00:19,392 --> 01:00:21,279
The dismantling of Stormont

1644
01:00:21,311 --> 01:00:24,658
and an end
to Unionist domination.

1645
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,485
Yeah, find out
if call signs One and Three are

1646
01:00:30,522 --> 01:00:31,666
in position and ready to move.

1647
01:00:31,704 --> 01:00:33,459
Hold in your position.
We are not clear, okay?

1648
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,423
Barrier all right?

1649
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:37,868
The choice is
about how we achieve it.

1650
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:40,874
Between violence
and nonviolence.

1651
01:00:40,915 --> 01:00:44,361
At where, barrier 12, barrier 14
or at Aggro Corner?

1652
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:47,498
If we are going to give a future
to the children of this city

1653
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:49,605
the young lads up there--
there they are

1654
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:51,783
we all know
they're rioting away there.

1655
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,063
They do it every day--

1656
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,651
if we are gonna give
those boys there a future

1657
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:58,143
we have to show them
that nonviolence works.

1658
01:00:58,184 --> 01:01:00,604
Go on, you scumbags!

1659
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:03,102
Let's get out!

1660
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:07,579
If we don't, it won't be
just stones they're throwing.

1661
01:01:07,682 --> 01:01:10,996
Because civil rights
isn't the soft option...

1662
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,315
not when the bricks fly

1663
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:15,000
and the police
and the Army batons charge down.

1664
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:17,272
It's not easy keeping
to the nonviolent road

1665
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:19,510
when other people say,
"This isn't working.

1666
01:01:19,547 --> 01:01:21,650
Let's get the guns out
and take revenge."

1667
01:01:21,689 --> 01:01:24,437
Fucking shot my cousin!

1668
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:27,600
But if you believe
in the civil rights movement

1669
01:01:27,638 --> 01:01:30,603
with all your heart
and your soul, as I do...

1670
01:01:30,675 --> 01:01:31,819
Why on earth aren't they
going in?

1671
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,352
Hello, Zero, this is Six-Five.

1672
01:01:33,394 --> 01:01:35,946
If we don't go now,
we're gonna miss them.

1673
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:36,998
If you believe

1674
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,681
in what Gandhi and Martin
Luther King believed in

1675
01:01:40,718 --> 01:01:43,683
with a passion, as I do,
then in the end

1676
01:01:43,723 --> 01:01:48,837
with one single united march,
we shall overcome.

1677
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,049
Thank you.

1678
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:57,885
We're gonna have to go,
aren't we?

1679
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:00,343
Sir, you have as much separation
as you're gonna get.

1680
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,106
Yeah. Thank you, Charles.
Thank you.

1681
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:03,255
You cannot send them now.

1682
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,181
You've got thousands
of marchers out there

1683
01:02:05,213 --> 01:02:06,739
and you've no idea
where they are.

1684
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:07,860
Let me handle this.

1685
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,306
Look, you've won,
for God's sake.

1686
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:10,266
You've stopped the march.

1687
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:11,226
You've won.

1688
01:02:11,258 --> 01:02:12,185
Don't do it, Patrick.

1689
01:02:12,218 --> 01:02:13,297
Don't do it.

1690
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,303
Load that battle gun, mate!

1691
01:02:23,346 --> 01:02:26,192
Stick one of them rubber bullets
straight into 'em

1692
01:02:26,257 --> 01:02:27,532
when we get out there.

1693
01:02:27,568 --> 01:02:29,192
Come on, come on.

1694
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:39,616
Six-Five wishing to move now,
sir.

1695
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,963
Yes, thank you.

1696
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:45,274
...will be seen today,
disbursed with the crowd.

1697
01:02:45,316 --> 01:02:46,592
Michael...

1698
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:51,512
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bernadette Devlin.

1699
01:02:51,553 --> 01:02:56,056
We are a part of a worldwide
movement for civil freedoms.

1700
01:02:56,094 --> 01:03:01,012
We are protesting
against internment of people.

1701
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:02,959
Tell Wilford it's
just one company

1702
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:04,244
to pick up the yobbos

1703
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,614
and no running battle
up Rossville Street.

1704
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:08,555
Coming through
to barrier 14, sir?

1705
01:03:08,598 --> 01:03:09,677
Yes. Did you log that?

1706
01:03:09,717 --> 01:03:11,123
I'll do it on the secure link.

1707
01:03:11,156 --> 01:03:13,064
Thank you.

1708
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:16,840
Six-Five, this is Zero. Come in.

1709
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,789
Six-Five, Wilco. Out.

1710
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:20,717
Okay, you're on, let's go. Move!

1711
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,203
All call signs,
this is Five Niner.

1712
01:03:23,244 --> 01:03:24,389
Prepare to move.

1713
01:03:24,428 --> 01:03:26,314
Move, move, move, move!

1714
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:27,753
We're going in, boys!

1715
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:30,402
Let's go, let's go, come on!

1716
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:32,542
We're away.

1717
01:03:32,582 --> 01:03:33,826
Hey, guys, don't fuck about.

1718
01:03:33,862 --> 01:03:34,941
Don't fuck about.

1719
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:35,908
Straight in there.

1720
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:36,889
We're gonna hit 'em hard.

1721
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:38,044
We know who we're picking up.

1722
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,130
Go on, One Para.

1723
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:42,430
Go and get them, and good luck.

1724
01:03:42,464 --> 01:03:45,495
You scumbags!

1725
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:46,712
Here they are, here they are!

1726
01:03:46,813 --> 01:03:47,674
Fucking hell, Gerry.

1727
01:03:47,773 --> 01:03:49,681
Get out of here.

1728
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,846
There they are.

1729
01:03:56,919 --> 01:03:58,641
...against these people.

1730
01:03:58,678 --> 01:04:00,684
What's going on down there?

1731
01:04:00,725 --> 01:04:02,186
Christ, lvan, they're coming in.

1732
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:04,787
Stand your ground, people.

1733
01:04:04,787 --> 01:04:06,030
Stand your ground, people.

1734
01:04:06,065 --> 01:04:07,406
We have a right to be here.

1735
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:08,368
Bastards!

1736
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,374
Fuck's sake.

1737
01:04:10,415 --> 01:04:11,494
Ah, fucking hell!

1738
01:04:11,534 --> 01:04:14,020
Fucking bastards!

1739
01:04:14,061 --> 01:04:15,009
Look at 'em.

1740
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:16,327
There's thousands of them.

1741
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:17,572
Free Derry?

1742
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:18,592
Stand by.

1743
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:21,566
Fucking Free Derry.

1744
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,265
Go! Go!

1745
01:04:27,652 --> 01:04:30,684
Let's get a search team!

1746
01:04:30,722 --> 01:04:33,917
Let's go in there.

1747
01:04:33,952 --> 01:04:35,860
Sergeant Major, let's get
a search team in there.

1748
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:39,516
Jesus Christ, it's the Paras!

1749
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:48,178
Help! Help!

1750
01:04:50,997 --> 01:04:52,851
Get those fucking bastards!

1751
01:04:59,056 --> 01:05:00,365
We have to stop here!

1752
01:05:00,399 --> 01:05:02,307
They're covering the whole wall.

1753
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:06,571
Up in those blocks of flats.

1754
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,079
Jesus, get down, get down!

1755
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,394
Watch yourselves, boys.

1756
01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:16,989
Get down.

1757
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:18,719
Let's move in!

1758
01:05:21,154 --> 01:05:22,909
The shit's hitting the fan now.

1759
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:24,439
Get back on our side
of the barricade.

1760
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,559
Stand your ground.

1761
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,019
It's only rubber bullets, and
they're firing above your heads.

1762
01:05:28,062 --> 01:05:28,988
We will not be moved.

1763
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:30,613
Ivan, I don't like the look
of this.

1764
01:05:30,652 --> 01:05:31,731
Get the fuck out! Get out!

1765
01:05:31,772 --> 01:05:34,290
Get out, you lazy bastards!

1766
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:44,529
They're firing live rounds!

1767
01:05:44,564 --> 01:05:45,491
This is not a hoax!

1768
01:05:45,523 --> 01:05:47,562
Get down! Get under cover!
Get under cover!

1769
01:05:47,601 --> 01:05:49,226
Keep going, behind the lorry!
Come on!

1770
01:05:49,264 --> 01:05:51,401
Get under cover!
Get under cover!

1771
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,917
Go on, you Protestant fuckers!

1772
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,092
Ah, don't tell me mammy.

1773
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:02,076
Shoot me, you bastards!

1774
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:04,127
Shoot me!

1775
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:05,443
Get down, people.

1776
01:06:05,478 --> 01:06:07,299
Get down! Get down! Get in!

1777
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:09,437
Tell them to stop shooting.

1778
01:06:09,476 --> 01:06:11,133
In the flats, there's a contact
by the left flank!

1779
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:12,348
-Left, where? Where?
-By the flats!

1780
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:13,313
That's all I can hear!

1781
01:06:13,346 --> 01:06:16,246
Fucking hell,
get your head down, will you?

1782
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,427
What the fuck are you doing?!

1783
01:06:39,025 --> 01:06:43,245
Somebody move that way!

1784
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:45,546
Back, back, back. Go on.

1785
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:47,619
In between the lines!
Move back!

1786
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,895
Go, go, go, go, go, folks, go!

1787
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,784
We need to get the kids
off the barricade!

1788
01:06:51,817 --> 01:06:53,442
Jesus Christ, someone
tell those folks to get down!

1789
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,868
Lads, get down!

1790
01:06:57,893 --> 01:06:59,680
Behind the barricade!
He's got a weapon!

1791
01:07:01,443 --> 01:07:03,198
Jesus, they've shot a man!

1792
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:05,598
Can you help him?

1793
01:07:05,632 --> 01:07:08,445
Get down! They're shooting
live bullets! Get down!

1794
01:07:09,853 --> 01:07:12,088
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1795
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:20,785
They've got a weapon!

1796
01:07:20,823 --> 01:07:22,577
There's no gunman
on the barricade!

1797
01:07:22,614 --> 01:07:23,758
There's nothing there!

1798
01:07:23,797 --> 01:07:25,454
I can't see any fucking targets!

1799
01:07:25,492 --> 01:07:26,440
No, sir, there's...

1800
01:07:26,483 --> 01:07:28,140
There's no targets!

1801
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:31,022
My God, they're shooting
children on the barricades!

1802
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:33,902
Jesus Christ,
what are they doing?

1803
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,013
Christ, stop it!

1804
01:07:35,053 --> 01:07:36,230
They're shooting them
in the back!

1805
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:37,413
They're just picking them off!

1806
01:07:40,651 --> 01:07:43,584
Only aimed shots.

1807
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,184
What are we firing at?

1808
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:48,228
I can't see any fucking targets!

1809
01:07:51,939 --> 01:07:54,937
Oh... oh, they've just shot
that young lad down!

1810
01:07:54,977 --> 01:07:55,904
You fucking bastards!

1811
01:07:55,968 --> 01:07:58,106
Come on, you're going
to have to get him out.

1812
01:07:58,143 --> 01:08:00,051
Get him out! Keep going!

1813
01:08:00,094 --> 01:08:01,337
Come on, Gerry!

1814
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,896
Get off the barricade!
Get off the barricade!

1815
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,758
Get off the barricade!

1816
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,621
They're shooting
at the barricade!

1817
01:08:24,654 --> 01:08:26,083
They're shooting at youse!

1818
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:27,467
What's his name?
What's his name?

1819
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:28,482
Michael Kelly.

1820
01:08:28,524 --> 01:08:29,472
Michael, you're okay.

1821
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,131
We're going to have to get
out of here.

1822
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:34,405
They're gonna come for me,
Hamish.

1823
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,846
They're moving
off the barricade!

1824
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,766
They're going round
to the courtyard.

1825
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:38,746
Let's go! Come on!

1826
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:40,218
Cease-fire.

1827
01:08:40,261 --> 01:08:42,648
-Cease-fire.
-Cease-fire.

1828
01:08:42,691 --> 01:08:44,097
Cease-fire.

1829
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:45,242
Let's get out!
Let's get out!

1830
01:08:45,282 --> 01:08:47,517
They've just called
a cease-fire.

1831
01:08:47,552 --> 01:08:49,722
We have to get away.

1832
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,572
They're coming for me, Hamish.
They're coming for me, Hamish.

1833
01:08:52,605 --> 01:08:54,295
They're going to come for me,
Hamish.

1834
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:57,329
They just called a cease-fire!

1835
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:02,614
Cease-fire!

1836
01:09:12,753 --> 01:09:15,685
They're shooting people!

1837
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:16,970
I have to go. I can't stay!

1838
01:09:17,005 --> 01:09:17,932
I have to go!

1839
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:19,044
Jesus!

1840
01:09:19,084 --> 01:09:20,425
I have to go. I can't stay!

1841
01:09:20,459 --> 01:09:21,539
They're shooting at peop...

1842
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:22,506
-Wait!
-Please, let me go!

1843
01:09:22,538 --> 01:09:23,465
Young fella!

1844
01:09:23,498 --> 01:09:24,424
Jesus, don't shoot!

1845
01:09:24,457 --> 01:09:25,601
I'm not armed!

1846
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:29,183
Don't shoot! We're...

1847
01:09:29,221 --> 01:09:30,366
Fuck! Let's get out of here!

1848
01:09:30,405 --> 01:09:31,898
Dave, I'm going...

1849
01:09:31,941 --> 01:09:35,005
I've been shot!
I've been shot!

1850
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:37,179
Oh! I've been shot!

1851
01:09:37,217 --> 01:09:38,329
Call an ambulance!

1852
01:09:38,368 --> 01:09:40,058
Jesus Christ, come on!

1853
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,857
Oh, look at that steward there.

1854
01:09:44,892 --> 01:09:47,312
No! What is he doing?!

1855
01:09:48,761 --> 01:09:50,189
They've hit him!
They've hit him!

1856
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:52,500
He's got an armband on!

1857
01:09:53,591 --> 01:09:56,142
No, get back, Barney!

1858
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,903
Barney, no!

1859
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,208
Oh, no, no, no!

1860
01:10:00,242 --> 01:10:01,834
Barney, no!

1861
01:10:01,873 --> 01:10:02,920
No, I've got to go to him.

1862
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,861
Please, lvan, no!

1863
01:10:05,903 --> 01:10:07,941
Stay. Stay back!

1864
01:10:07,982 --> 01:10:11,656
Jesus! Ivan, come back!
Get down!

1865
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:13,315
Get back, get back!

1866
01:10:13,354 --> 01:10:16,352
Get back! No!

1867
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:18,757
Stay back, back,
Barney, for God's sake!

1868
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:21,598
Barney!

1869
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:23,326
God... Jesus Christ!

1870
01:10:25,442 --> 01:10:26,848
God.

1871
01:10:26,881 --> 01:10:30,010
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1872
01:10:34,493 --> 01:10:37,338
Barney?! Barney?! Barney?!

1873
01:10:50,611 --> 01:10:51,755
Ivan!

1874
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:59,400
Zero, this is Nine-Four.

1875
01:10:59,437 --> 01:11:03,875
A sitrep at 16-15,
uh, on William Street.

1876
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:05,604
Uh, seven people caught
by Six-Five

1877
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,102
are in the area
of Rossville Street...

1878
01:11:07,144 --> 01:11:08,420
They've gone in.

1879
01:11:08,455 --> 01:11:10,559
The Pigs are in this area, sir.

1880
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:11,645
...two shots.

1881
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:13,691
I repeat: Two shots
at one of our patrols

1882
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,640
on the city wall,
at 16: 14 hours. Over.

1883
01:11:15,683 --> 01:11:16,762
They've gone all the way in.

1884
01:11:16,802 --> 01:11:18,045
Six-Five, this is Zero.

1885
01:11:18,081 --> 01:11:20,184
Repeat: Request immediate
sitrep. Over.

1886
01:11:20,224 --> 01:11:23,898
Zero, this is Six-Five.
The, uh, two sub-units moved in

1887
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:25,820
got involved in a firefight.

1888
01:11:25,884 --> 01:11:29,395
Uh, shots appeared to come
from the Rossville flats.

1889
01:11:29,434 --> 01:11:32,531
The two sub-units have
now gone secure in that area.

1890
01:11:32,568 --> 01:11:35,250
And two civilians are lying
wounded or dead--

1891
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:36,463
we're not sure yet--

1892
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:38,508
in the area
of Chamberlain Street.

1893
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:40,652
Who shot them, we don't know.
Over.

1894
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:45,451
Right, get him up.

1895
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:48,937
Come on! Get down!

1896
01:11:48,974 --> 01:11:50,151
This man is dying!

1897
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:51,301
Go on, get him in.

1898
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,267
Get him in!

1899
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,614
Steady on so, here.
He's fucking bleeding.

1900
01:11:55,657 --> 01:11:56,834
Shot badly.

1901
01:11:56,872 --> 01:11:58,464
Put him down.

1902
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:02,778
Is there a doctor around?

1903
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,281
Somebody call a doctor!

1904
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:08,315
Stand still!
Stand still!

1905
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:11,134
Keep your hands up!
Keep your hands up!

1906
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:14,556
Stop it!

1907
01:12:14,589 --> 01:12:17,457
Put your hands on your heads!

1908
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,629
Brian, Phil, we'll take these!

1909
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:23,152
Right, put your hands
on your heads!

1910
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:25,362
Okay, does anyone
know this man's name?

1911
01:12:25,398 --> 01:12:27,088
Oh, it's Willy. I know Willy.

1912
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,913
Willy, this is your doctor here.

1913
01:12:28,948 --> 01:12:30,192
How are you?

1914
01:12:30,228 --> 01:12:33,074
You're okay, Willy.
Just relax there for me.

1915
01:12:33,106 --> 01:12:36,333
Tell me mammy I'm sorry.
Tell me mammy I'm sorry.

1916
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:38,505
Okay. He's been hit here, folks.

1917
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:40,483
Does anyone know
this man in the corner?

1918
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:41,637
His name is Jim.

1919
01:12:41,676 --> 01:12:43,137
Can you hear me, Jim?

1920
01:12:43,179 --> 01:12:44,705
Mammy, I'm sorry.

1921
01:12:44,746 --> 01:12:46,501
He's not breathing.

1922
01:12:46,538 --> 01:12:47,911
Is he all right?

1923
01:12:47,945 --> 01:12:49,798
Tell me mam...
Mammy, I'm so sorry.

1924
01:13:41,638 --> 01:13:45,913
Barney!

1925
01:13:45,956 --> 01:13:48,376
They shot my son.

1926
01:13:48,418 --> 01:13:51,678
They shot my son.
They shot my son.

1927
01:13:51,712 --> 01:13:54,264
Oh, Barney!

1928
01:14:16,336 --> 01:14:17,830
Let's get these bodies moved!

1929
01:14:17,872 --> 01:14:18,799
Right, men!

1930
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:20,456
Let's go!

1931
01:14:25,387 --> 01:14:27,938
And move! Fucking move!

1932
01:14:30,088 --> 01:14:31,680
Move!

1933
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:33,889
Move. Why don't you
bloody move it?

1934
01:14:33,926 --> 01:14:34,972
Sergeant Major!

1935
01:14:47,773 --> 01:14:48,950
All fucking mad.

1936
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,394
How many rounds you get down?

1937
01:14:50,427 --> 01:14:52,281
Oh, fuck me--
I had to change magazines.

1938
01:14:52,314 --> 01:14:53,840
I took a guy out
by the phone box

1939
01:14:53,881 --> 01:14:56,051
and there was one crawling away
and I got him.

1940
01:14:56,088 --> 01:14:57,014
Lovely, sorted, mate--

1941
01:14:57,047 --> 01:14:58,769
I just went in
with the first two rounds.

1942
01:14:58,806 --> 01:15:01,073
Well, I reckon I had four
or five rounds, actually...

1943
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:02,385
How many rounds have you used?

1944
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,467
I reckon I've done a mag.

1945
01:15:03,507 --> 01:15:05,131
...shed loads.
I had to change me mag.

1946
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:06,892
What the fuck did you do?

1947
01:15:06,928 --> 01:15:09,349
...adrenalin was pumping
our nerves.

1948
01:15:09,392 --> 01:15:11,016
I saw it.
I saw you shoot civvies.

1949
01:15:11,055 --> 01:15:13,093
You was there, Lom--
you see what we done.

1950
01:15:13,132 --> 01:15:14,757
All civvies are terrorists,
mate.

1951
01:15:14,796 --> 01:15:16,322
Terrorists?
I never even saw a gunman!

1952
01:15:16,363 --> 01:15:17,573
Keep an eye out on the flats.

1953
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,103
They were shooting.
They were there.

1954
01:15:19,145 --> 01:15:21,086
You know what happened;
you were there with us.

1955
01:15:21,128 --> 01:15:22,272
Aye, I saw what happened.

1956
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:23,903
Listen here, listen here,
be quiet.

1957
01:15:23,942 --> 01:15:26,013
We went round there,
we see loads...

1958
01:15:26,053 --> 01:15:27,961
there was
about a hundred people.

1959
01:15:28,004 --> 01:15:29,432
-We see a gunman.
-At least, at least.

1960
01:15:29,475 --> 01:15:31,328
We see a gunman,
we went left and right flanks

1961
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:32,309
and we took 'em out.

1962
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:33,562
You know what happened, right?

1963
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,527
Get the story right

1964
01:15:34,559 --> 01:15:35,704
'cause this is bound
to come over.

1965
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:36,855
Yeah. Yeah, I'm happy with that.

1966
01:15:36,926 --> 01:15:37,819
Okay?

1967
01:15:37,885 --> 01:15:39,411
Get O.C. mortars over here now.

1968
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,817
Okay, give me a sitrep,
and then I'll come down.

1969
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:43,541
Firstly,
why have you got no comms?

1970
01:15:43,578 --> 01:15:45,104
Why is there no radio operator?

1971
01:15:45,145 --> 01:15:47,511
They both want an interview
with you, right now.

1972
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,451
Okay. I'll be down there
in 15 minutes.

1973
01:15:49,494 --> 01:15:52,209
I've got, uh, bodies on the
barricade-- three at least dead.

1974
01:15:52,276 --> 01:15:54,991
Um, there was a revolver man
there, fired some shots at us.

1975
01:15:55,027 --> 01:15:56,367
Good. Have we got the weapon?

1976
01:15:56,402 --> 01:15:57,961
-No, sir.
-We have no weap...

1977
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,585
I want to get a clearing patrol
down there now.

1978
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:02,182
We need to secure that area.

1979
01:16:02,222 --> 01:16:03,650
We need to get the weapons

1980
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,579
off the shooters
on the barricade.

1981
01:16:05,612 --> 01:16:06,538
Right, sir.

1982
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:07,498
Company Sergeant Major.

1983
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:08,773
Sir.

1984
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:11,394
I've got to go and see
the general and the TV cameras.

1985
01:16:11,464 --> 01:16:14,277
We've just fired a fucking
horrendous amount of ammunition.

1986
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,389
We've got to know why

1987
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:17,087
and we've got
to have some weapons.

1988
01:16:17,124 --> 01:16:18,749
Right, sir.

1989
01:16:21,538 --> 01:16:22,650
Sir.

1990
01:16:22,689 --> 01:16:24,182
What's the situation
on the barrier?

1991
01:16:24,224 --> 01:16:26,492
Picked up three, uh-- three...

1992
01:16:26,527 --> 01:16:30,070
Looked, looked fucked, sir.
Gray as hell. Uh...

1993
01:16:30,108 --> 01:16:32,496
So we have three dead confirmed?

1994
01:16:32,603 --> 01:16:33,682
Three dead, three confirmed.

1995
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:35,314
Let's get them back
to the RMP to confirm

1996
01:16:35,353 --> 01:16:37,206
Did you find any,
anything on them? Any weapons?

1997
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,646
Nothing. No, no weapons there
at all, sir.

1998
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:39,856
Have you searched the barricade?

1999
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:41,006
You've searched the barricade?

2000
01:16:41,045 --> 01:16:42,670
As quick as we could, sir, yeah.
The pockets.

2001
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:44,017
-There's no hidden weapons?
-Nothing.

2002
01:16:44,116 --> 01:16:44,977
-Empty cases?
-Nothing.

2003
01:16:45,075 --> 01:16:45,936
-Fuck's sake.
-Okay.

2004
01:16:46,035 --> 01:16:48,041
We fired three rounds... um...

2005
01:16:48,081 --> 01:16:49,487
Okay, who were you engaging?

2006
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,112
No one, sir. I was firing at...

2007
01:16:51,151 --> 01:16:52,524
What do you mean, "No one"?

2008
01:16:52,558 --> 01:16:54,564
There was...
The crowd was advancing, sir.

2009
01:16:54,669 --> 01:16:55,945
I had... I had no backup.

2010
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,190
I had to move the crowd.

2011
01:16:57,227 --> 01:16:59,942
"C" squadron were... arresting,
uh, guys further back.

2012
01:16:59,978 --> 01:17:01,832
They-They were all
just coming at us.

2013
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:03,325
I had to move them back, sir.

2014
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:05,438
So you put down rounds
to warn the crowd?

2015
01:17:05,478 --> 01:17:06,405
A warning shot?

2016
01:17:06,438 --> 01:17:07,365
To move the crowd.

2017
01:17:07,397 --> 01:17:08,825
Okay, we will talk
about that later.

2018
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:10,296
People are alleging
on the Bogside

2019
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:12,671
that the Army went in today,
firing indiscriminately.

2020
01:17:12,705 --> 01:17:14,133
Let's get this absolutely clear.

2021
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:16,630
One Para went in
and came under fire.

2022
01:17:16,703 --> 01:17:19,962
They did not fire back
until they were fired at.

2023
01:17:19,997 --> 01:17:22,167
I believe we fired three rounds

2024
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:25,201
after receiving something
between ten and 20.

2025
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:27,606
Three rounds? It seems,
that seems a very low figure.

2026
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,192
I mean, I've personally seen
three dead bodies here today.

2027
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,756
Well, of course,
they may very well not

2028
01:17:31,797 --> 01:17:33,105
have been killed
by our soldiers.

2029
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:34,187
We have three dead bodies.

2030
01:17:34,228 --> 01:17:35,634
There were another
three casualties

2031
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:36,594
inflicted by mortars...

2032
01:17:36,627 --> 01:17:38,480
All right, that's all right.
That's all right.

2033
01:17:38,513 --> 01:17:40,715
Colonel, General Ford is saying
it's absolutely urgent

2034
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:42,605
that you speak to him now
down at barrier 12.

2035
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:43,566
You must go.

2036
01:17:43,598 --> 01:17:45,004
I think most of the gunmen are
up there.

2037
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:46,181
I'm gonna go back to the general

2038
01:17:46,221 --> 01:17:47,430
and the press
with the three dead.

2039
01:17:47,468 --> 01:17:48,808
You've got to find
some justification.

2040
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:50,151
-We're working on it now.
-All right.

2041
01:17:50,186 --> 01:17:51,112
I'm securing here.

2042
01:17:51,145 --> 01:17:52,257
I'll report
back to you as soon as.

2043
01:17:52,296 --> 01:17:54,847
Seven-Six. I can see
some photographers

2044
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:56,413
at the Rossville flats.

2045
01:17:56,454 --> 01:17:59,747
They're taking photographs
of a civil rights banner

2046
01:17:59,844 --> 01:18:01,403
covered in blood. Over.

2047
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:02,369
Michael.

2048
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:03,329
Sir.

2049
01:18:03,361 --> 01:18:04,702
Just get them
out of the Bogside.

2050
01:18:04,737 --> 01:18:06,677
Uh, Six-Five, Roger.
I'm doing that now. Over.

2051
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,646
Just get them out now.

2052
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,336
Uh, Six-Five, this is Zero

2053
01:18:09,406 --> 01:18:11,347
requesting immediate pullback.

2054
01:18:11,388 --> 01:18:14,866
Repeat, requesting immediate
pullback, please. Over.

2055
01:18:18,456 --> 01:18:19,502
Very good, sir.

2056
01:18:19,544 --> 01:18:21,615
Six-Five out.

2057
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:23,987
Five-Zero,
this is Six-One Delta.

2058
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:27,630
Uh, the ambulance has just gone
across the diamond

2059
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:31,177
and is now moving
along Ferry Quay Street. Over.

2060
01:18:36,141 --> 01:18:38,049
...there is still a body

2061
01:18:38,091 --> 01:18:41,318
Iying just south
of the Rossville flats.

2062
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:42,760
Zero, this is Six-One Yankee.

2063
01:18:42,792 --> 01:18:43,904
One ambulance just now crossing

2064
01:18:43,944 --> 01:18:45,470
the Great Albion Bridge
from west to east.

2065
01:18:45,511 --> 01:18:47,485
And you call that minimum force?

2066
01:18:47,526 --> 01:18:49,565
Another ambulance has
just crossed the bridge

2067
01:18:49,668 --> 01:18:51,396
the other way. Over.

2068
01:18:51,396 --> 01:18:51,483
the other way. Over.

2069
01:18:51,588 --> 01:18:53,921
You've solved the situation
before with regular troops.

2070
01:18:53,954 --> 01:18:54,881
Why the Paras today?

2071
01:18:54,914 --> 01:18:56,669
Because I think the situation
in Londonderry

2072
01:18:56,704 --> 01:18:58,077
has got completely
out of control--

2073
01:18:58,112 --> 01:18:59,388
two policemen shot
last Thursday

2074
01:18:59,423 --> 01:19:00,797
81 incidents in
the last few weeks.

2075
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:02,934
Something had to be done
to reinforce law and order.

2076
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,498
But why was it considered
necessary to use, uh

2077
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:05,880
Iive ammunition
instead of rubber bullets?

2078
01:19:05,979 --> 01:19:06,839
Who made that decision?

2079
01:19:06,938 --> 01:19:08,726
I'm sorry, but the aggression
was brought to us.

2080
01:19:08,761 --> 01:19:11,094
It was quite clear that our men
were attacked on the barriers

2081
01:19:11,128 --> 01:19:13,265
by the hooligans who got
out of control in the parade...

2082
01:19:13,302 --> 01:19:14,414
And yet no soldiers were hit.

2083
01:19:14,453 --> 01:19:15,565
...throwing bricks and stones.

2084
01:19:15,604 --> 01:19:17,491
Sir, was there a need
to kill innocent civilians?

2085
01:19:17,523 --> 01:19:18,929
My understanding is
absolutely clear

2086
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:20,871
that the Paras were fired on
and returned fire.

2087
01:19:20,913 --> 01:19:22,341
-Were any...?
-Both high-velocity

2088
01:19:22,384 --> 01:19:24,041
and low-velocity bullets
were used.

2089
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:25,355
Were-Were-Were any soldiers hit?

2090
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,331
-Uh, not to my knowledge.
-Not to your knowledge.

2091
01:19:27,373 --> 01:19:28,681
When can we have a statement by?

2092
01:19:28,716 --> 01:19:30,602
We will give you a statement
as soon as we can.

2093
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:31,582
Colonel Tugwell.

2094
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:41,533
Uh, Five Niner, Roger.

2095
01:19:41,572 --> 01:19:42,946
That's it, Sergeant Major.

2096
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:44,953
They're pulling us
out of the Bogside.

2097
01:19:44,994 --> 01:19:45,921
Simon!

2098
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:48,734
Guys, they're pulling us out.
Lead on.

2099
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:49,715
Move out!

2100
01:20:05,045 --> 01:20:07,183
There seemed to be
a very large number

2101
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,291
of casualties today,
Colonel Wilford.

2102
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:10,955
You must understand that, uh

2103
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:13,261
we've only just finished
this operation.

2104
01:20:13,297 --> 01:20:16,524
We do not know exactly, uh,
what happened, at this stage

2105
01:20:16,558 --> 01:20:19,077
but there are certainly
three people killed.

2106
01:20:19,116 --> 01:20:21,057
Don't you think
you might have used

2107
01:20:21,099 --> 01:20:22,375
excessive force today?

2108
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,994
Well, what is force
in a situation like this?

2109
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,300
If they fire on us,
we're gonna fire back

2110
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:29,340
and they know that
perfectly well.

2111
01:20:29,382 --> 01:20:31,769
But you think
the operation was justified?

2112
01:20:31,813 --> 01:20:32,794
Of course.

2113
01:20:32,836 --> 01:20:35,868
Do you have no regrets at all
about the operation today?

2114
01:20:35,906 --> 01:20:36,833
Absolutely none.

2115
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:39,068
-None whatsoever?
-None whatsoever.

2116
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:40,958
-Please...
-He's all right.

2117
01:20:40,991 --> 01:20:42,931
-...tell them I'm sorry.
-We're bringing him out now.

2118
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:44,914
They've done that. Get him out.

2119
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:45,938
We're going now.

2120
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:46,906
Going out, you know.

2121
01:20:46,939 --> 01:20:49,174
Go, go, go, go,
get the fuck out of here.

2122
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:50,321
Come on, get him in.

2123
01:20:50,361 --> 01:20:52,749
Come on, lads.

2124
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:53,718
Come on! Get him in.

2125
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:54,895
All right, come on, lads.

2126
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,972
Hang on, hang on,
you're all right, hang on.

2127
01:20:57,013 --> 01:20:58,256
-Gentlemen.
-Steady, steady.

2128
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,468
-Gerry?
-You're all right.

2129
01:20:59,507 --> 01:21:00,433
Go, go, go.

2130
01:21:00,466 --> 01:21:01,643
Go on, boy. Go with him.

2131
01:21:01,681 --> 01:21:02,793
You go. Go on.

2132
01:21:09,964 --> 01:21:10,891
Hang on there, son.

2133
01:21:10,923 --> 01:21:11,937
You're gonna be all right.

2134
01:21:11,979 --> 01:21:13,058
Can you hear me?

2135
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:15,137
Just try to keep easy there,
boy.

2136
01:21:15,177 --> 01:21:17,118
You're gonna be all right now.

2137
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,239
Look at me.

2138
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:19,489
Oh, fuck, a roadblock!

2139
01:21:19,526 --> 01:21:21,347
Okay, just stay calm, stay calm.

2140
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:22,657
You stay calm.

2141
01:21:22,692 --> 01:21:25,919
Oh, Jesus Christ, the Brits
are fucking everywhere today.

2142
01:21:25,955 --> 01:21:27,099
Come on, get out the car!

2143
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,064
Get out now!

2144
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:29,405
We've got an injured man!

2145
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,381
We've got to get this man
to hospital!

2146
01:21:31,422 --> 01:21:33,177
We just wanna get him
to hospital.

2147
01:21:33,214 --> 01:21:34,141
He's been shot.

2148
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:35,579
You're fucking up!

2149
01:21:35,612 --> 01:21:36,691
Go up against the wall!

2150
01:21:36,731 --> 01:21:38,672
Move on!

2151
01:21:38,714 --> 01:21:41,102
This one's dying, mate.

2152
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:43,314
Scratch one player.

2153
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,243
Ah, he's not carrying, Sarge.

2154
01:21:47,285 --> 01:21:48,331
By the fucking wall!

2155
01:21:48,372 --> 01:21:49,616
I won't tell you again!

2156
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:50,698
Stop looking around!

2157
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:51,982
Wait there by the wall!

2158
01:21:52,017 --> 01:21:54,798
Do it!

2159
01:22:00,044 --> 01:22:03,141
Come on, get through,
get through!

2160
01:22:03,178 --> 01:22:04,606
Come on!

2161
01:22:14,435 --> 01:22:16,474
All right.

2162
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:17,626
Yeah, lvan Cooper, MP.

2163
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,094
Member of Parliament
for this area.

2164
01:22:19,136 --> 01:22:20,063
Ivan Cooper.

2165
01:22:20,096 --> 01:22:21,240
Please, I just need
to get through.

2166
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:22,206
I'm calling on the families now.

2167
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:23,383
Where are you going, mate?

2168
01:22:23,422 --> 01:22:24,851
Ivan Cooper, Member of
Parliament for this area.

2169
01:22:24,893 --> 01:22:25,841
Please, I need to get through.

2170
01:22:25,885 --> 01:22:27,291
I've already spoken
to some of your superiors.

2171
01:22:27,323 --> 01:22:28,305
You can't go through there,
mate.

2172
01:22:28,347 --> 01:22:29,524
I've spoken to your superiors
already.

2173
01:22:29,562 --> 01:22:30,838
Please, can you let me through?
Thank you.

2174
01:22:30,873 --> 01:22:32,694
I've spoken to your superiors.
I'm a member of Parliament.

2175
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:35,061
Do we have no list...?

2176
01:22:35,094 --> 01:22:38,605
You-You have no idea
of casualties yet?

2177
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:40,301
Jesus Christ.

2178
01:22:40,339 --> 01:22:41,680
Excuse me.

2179
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:47,782
Excuse me...

01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:53,257
How many are in there, Father?

2183
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:54,697
Six here, there's six here.

2184
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:56,158
God Almighty.

2185
01:22:56,201 --> 01:22:57,607
There's six here.

2186
01:22:57,641 --> 01:22:59,265
Listen, you can't
just leave them

2187
01:22:59,303 --> 01:23:00,829
Iying like bits of meat here!

2188
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:02,364
There's no room!

2189
01:23:14,078 --> 01:23:15,767
Frances, there's
six bodies down there.

2190
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:16,917
I don't know who they are.

2191
01:23:16,989 --> 01:23:18,035
None of them are Barney.

2192
01:23:18,075 --> 01:23:19,635
-They're not Barney.
-Paddy Doherty?

2193
01:23:19,674 --> 01:23:21,266
Excuse me,
I've been in here already.

2194
01:23:21,305 --> 01:23:23,987
-I'm a member of Parliament.
-We've been through it already.

2195
01:23:24,023 --> 01:23:25,168
There are six down there.

2196
01:23:25,207 --> 01:23:28,205
-None of them are Paddy Doherty.
-Not Paddy Doherty?

2197
01:23:28,245 --> 01:23:29,870
They're not Barney McGuigan.

2198
01:23:29,908 --> 01:23:32,460
That's eight.
Don't know how many there are.

2199
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:33,960
Ivan, lvan.

2200
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:35,462
Have you any word
about Michael Kelly?

2201
01:23:35,505 --> 01:23:36,431
Michael Kelly?

2202
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:37,837
I'm gonna... I'm trying
to find out all that now.

2203
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:38,798
Michael Kelly.

2204
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:39,942
Ivan, help me find
me brother Jacky.

2205
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:40,907
Who? What's his name?
Jacky who?

2206
01:23:41,005 --> 01:23:42,084
Jacky Duddy.

2207
01:23:42,124 --> 01:23:43,269
Okay, Jacky Duddy,
Michael Kelly...

2208
01:23:43,307 --> 01:23:45,193
Michael McDaid, if you can do
anything about Michael McDaid.

2209
01:23:45,226 --> 01:23:46,599
Michael McDaid. I'm trying
to find out, okay?

2210
01:23:46,634 --> 01:23:47,561
Dirty bastards!

2211
01:23:47,593 --> 01:23:48,770
If you can,
get the numbers down.

2212
01:23:48,809 --> 01:23:50,182
Do we have a list yet?
Do we have it?

2213
01:23:50,216 --> 01:23:51,589
Kelly, Kelly,
is there an Andy Kelly?

2214
01:23:51,623 --> 01:23:53,116
I'm trying to find out, okay.

2215
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:58,199
13.

2216
01:24:00,673 --> 01:24:02,330
There's 13 dead...

2217
01:24:02,368 --> 01:24:03,447
13 dead.

2218
01:24:03,487 --> 01:24:04,861
...14 wounded.

2219
01:24:04,894 --> 01:24:05,908
How many?

2220
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:08,217
Are they male or female?

2221
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,355
I've the list. I have the list.

2222
01:24:10,395 --> 01:24:11,539
Are they male or female?

2223
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:13,463
We're gonna have to start
letting people know.

2224
01:24:13,529 --> 01:24:15,251
Everyone take a family
and let them know.

2225
01:24:15,287 --> 01:24:16,334
Where are those Duddy girls?

2226
01:24:16,438 --> 01:24:19,568
Murdering bastards!

2227
01:24:19,605 --> 01:24:27,718
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2228
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:34,537
Look after the Duddy girls.
I'm so sorry.

2229
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:36,991
Oh, no! Oh, no!

2230
01:24:37,033 --> 01:24:38,276
Where's that man?

2231
01:24:38,313 --> 01:24:40,035
Excuse me, please!

2232
01:24:40,072 --> 01:24:41,597
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Michael Kelly's away.

2233
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:43,198
Michael Kelly's gone.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2234
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:45,985
Please, please, please,
please, stay back, stay back.

2235
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,440
Show some respect
for the dead, please.

2236
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:49,497
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2237
01:24:49,538 --> 01:24:53,213
Jesus, lvan.
What are we gonna do?

2238
01:24:53,247 --> 01:24:54,523
My wife...

2239
01:24:57,085 --> 01:24:58,393
Those bastards...!

2240
01:25:02,905 --> 01:25:04,628
Oh, no...!

2241
01:25:04,664 --> 01:25:08,851
No...

2242
01:25:36,804 --> 01:25:38,145
They shot my da!

2243
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,993
Miss Fuller! Fuller...

2244
01:25:45,023 --> 01:25:46,582
Give him a seat, Fuller.

2245
01:25:46,622 --> 01:25:48,409
This is a nightmare...

2246
01:25:59,574 --> 01:26:03,314
Where the fuck are ya?

2247
01:26:03,347 --> 01:26:05,135
Where the fuck are they?

2248
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,358
They don't know.

2249
01:26:11,694 --> 01:26:13,187
Fuck off, would you?

2250
01:26:41,114 --> 01:26:43,186
And, uh, uh...
so, I took my brig right

2251
01:26:43,225 --> 01:26:46,093
uh, through to Glenfada Park,
uh, to cut off the crowd

2252
01:26:46,199 --> 01:26:49,426
and when we got round there,
there was... there was masses.

2253
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:51,565
There was about 100 people
round there.

2254
01:26:51,604 --> 01:26:54,090
Uh, straight away,
I saw one guy who looked...

2255
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,616
who was about to throw a bomb
in my direction.

2256
01:26:56,656 --> 01:26:57,604
Are you sure of that?

2257
01:26:57,647 --> 01:26:58,508
Definitely, sir.

2258
01:26:58,607 --> 01:26:59,948
Uh, I took immediate action.

2259
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:01,061
I dropped to one knee

2260
01:27:01,102 --> 01:27:03,467
and took, uh, a well-aimed shot
to the shoulder

2261
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:05,158
and the-the shot hit the nail...

2262
01:27:05,195 --> 01:27:07,430
the guy with the nail bomb,
in the shoulder.

2263
01:27:07,466 --> 01:27:10,976
As I came round the corner,
two gunmen shot across me

2264
01:27:11,079 --> 01:27:14,819
and I identified, I think
it was a-a short M-1 carbine.

2265
01:27:14,853 --> 01:27:16,096
Yeah.

2266
01:27:16,132 --> 01:27:18,040
I dropped to one knee,
took three aimed shots.

2267
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:19,391
Petrol bomb was thrown...

2268
01:27:19,426 --> 01:27:21,530
Ianded about ten,
15 yards away from us.

2269
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,739
Uh, no one was hurt.

2270
01:27:23,775 --> 01:27:26,043
Then there was
a second one already lit.

2271
01:27:26,078 --> 01:27:28,727
I shouted to him to stop,
stop, put it down...

2272
01:27:28,764 --> 01:27:30,170
fired a couple of shots.

2273
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:31,283
He went down.

2274
01:27:31,323 --> 01:27:32,566
Can't say if it...

2275
01:27:32,602 --> 01:27:34,291
Fired a couple of shots?
How many shots?

2276
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:35,408
Four, sir.

2277
01:27:35,448 --> 01:27:37,934
Four? And you hit him?

2278
01:27:37,975 --> 01:27:39,883
Best of my knowledge, sir, yes.

2279
01:27:39,925 --> 01:27:41,386
How many rounds did you fire
at him?

2280
01:27:41,428 --> 01:27:43,281
Uh, 22, sir.

2281
01:27:43,315 --> 01:27:45,256
22 rounds?

2282
01:27:45,298 --> 01:27:46,442
Sir.

2283
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:48,170
How did you fire 22 rounds?

2284
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:50,923
That's more rounds
than they issue you with.

2285
01:27:50,959 --> 01:27:52,746
Quick, come on...

2286
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:53,958
Move, come on.

2287
01:27:53,997 --> 01:27:55,905
Get round this other...

2288
01:27:59,177 --> 01:28:02,045
Get round the other side
and tape it.

2289
01:28:04,486 --> 01:28:05,533
Quick, before anybody sees us.

2290
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:07,066
Get down there.

2291
01:28:08,419 --> 01:28:09,793
Go on, move.

2292
01:28:12,065 --> 01:28:16,253
Can we get some explosives
experts over here, please?

2293
01:28:16,286 --> 01:28:18,489
Hello, Zero,
this is Four-One Alpha.

2294
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:21,371
We've got suspected nail bombs
at my location.

2295
01:28:21,403 --> 01:28:24,119
Send Felix now.

2296
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:27,342
Zero, this is Five-Four Arthur.

2297
01:28:27,383 --> 01:28:30,796
Um, one dead person, who was
returned to this location

2298
01:28:30,837 --> 01:28:32,723
has a nail bomb in his pocket.

2299
01:28:32,756 --> 01:28:36,070
We request Felix to come down
and sort it out. Over.

2300
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:41,322
One round returned
as the gun was spotted there

2301
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:45,131
but no hits claimed. Over.

2302
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:03,478
Where did they come from?

2303
01:29:09,085 --> 01:29:10,872
We should go fucking home.

2304
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,212
No problem, no problem.

2305
01:29:16,249 --> 01:29:17,557
You're okay, guv.

2306
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:05,174
Lomas, come.

2307
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:11,823
Shut the door behind you.

2308
01:30:18,385 --> 01:30:19,661
At ease, Private.

2309
01:30:19,696 --> 01:30:22,116
Sit down.

2310
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,262
I'm W2 Norton.
This is Sergeant Bridge.

2311
01:30:24,302 --> 01:30:25,991
We'll be taking your statement.

2312
01:30:26,029 --> 01:30:28,067
CSM is here for your benefit.

2313
01:30:28,108 --> 01:30:29,034
In your own words

2314
01:30:29,067 --> 01:30:30,528
could you please tell me
exactly what happened?

2315
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:33,186
I could see through
the front of the Pig

2316
01:30:33,224 --> 01:30:35,873
that there was a, um,
a rubble barricade

2317
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:39,257
somewhere in front,
at the end of Rossville Street

2318
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,949
with about thousands
of people behind it

2319
01:30:41,987 --> 01:30:43,742
all screaming and shouting.

2320
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:47,353
We, um, stopped and debussed
just outside the barrier.

2321
01:30:47,391 --> 01:30:50,259
I went on to the right-hand side
of the road

2322
01:30:50,301 --> 01:30:54,096
opposite the, um, Rossville
flats, which was to our left.

2323
01:30:54,139 --> 01:30:56,690
As we were going up
the right-hand side

2324
01:30:56,729 --> 01:30:59,989
there was, um, some sort
of commotion on the left

2325
01:31:00,023 --> 01:31:03,250
where-where we assumed
a contact had taken place.

2326
01:31:03,285 --> 01:31:05,771
Then my, uh,
section commander shouted

2327
01:31:05,812 --> 01:31:08,428
that there was a sniper
on the barricade

2328
01:31:08,465 --> 01:31:10,569
and, um, he-he-he returned fire.

2329
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:14,500
Private Lomas, did you,
at any time, see the target?

2330
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:22,887
I did, um, swing my rifle

2331
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:25,602
to bear around the corner
of the wall

2332
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:27,263
and that's when we saw

2333
01:31:27,302 --> 01:31:30,333
what I believed to be
a-a gunman firing...

2334
01:31:30,371 --> 01:31:33,304
holding a firearm
towards our direction.

2335
01:31:33,346 --> 01:31:36,312
My platoon commander shouted
that he saw 50

2336
01:31:36,352 --> 01:31:39,449
possibly more of the rioters
on the barricade

2337
01:31:39,486 --> 01:31:42,386
break right towards
the Glenfada Park area

2338
01:31:42,429 --> 01:31:45,623
and ordered my section
to go towards that area

2339
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:47,545
and cut them off.

2340
01:31:47,577 --> 01:31:52,560
When we, um, entered the park,
there was a lot of confusion.

2341
01:31:52,598 --> 01:31:54,451
We saw a lot of people

2342
01:31:54,485 --> 01:31:59,435
and, um, l-I didn't witness
the beginning of the firefight.

2343
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:02,221
At what point was the cease-fire
order given, please?

2344
01:32:02,256 --> 01:32:05,123
Before or after the shootings?

2345
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,498
The cease-fire was given

2346
01:32:10,539 --> 01:32:15,042
after the last shots were fired
in Glenfada Park.

2347
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:20,379
Private Lomas, in your opinion,
were all the rounds fired

2348
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:22,874
in accordance
with the yellow card?

2349
01:32:29,535 --> 01:32:32,402
Yes, sir.

2350
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:36,337
Well, of course, the, uh,
the loss of life is, um

2351
01:32:36,378 --> 01:32:40,816
is greatly to be regretted,
but I cannot help but think

2352
01:32:40,856 --> 01:32:45,196
that we responded to a-a-a
very difficult situation...

2353
01:32:45,237 --> 01:32:47,308
and, at least,
Londonderry tonight, uh

2354
01:32:47,347 --> 01:32:49,451
would seem to be quiet,
which suggests

2355
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:52,140
that we've moved one step
in the right direction

2356
01:32:52,209 --> 01:32:54,062
of the recreation
of law and order.

2357
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:56,198
Now, the main point
I want to make is

2358
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:57,895
that have I seen nothing today

2359
01:32:57,965 --> 01:33:00,930
that reflects in any way
with discredit on our forces

2360
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:03,271
who have behaved, as ever,
with restraint

2361
01:33:03,305 --> 01:33:05,377
and, I believe,
great professionalism.

2362
01:33:05,416 --> 01:33:08,164
So, please, uh, convey my thanks
to the men, Pat.

2363
01:33:08,198 --> 01:33:11,230
Uh, you, of course, will be
in charge of the inquiry--

2364
01:33:11,268 --> 01:33:13,754
um, issues of timing,
when the Paras went in,

2365
01:33:13,794 --> 01:33:15,038
things of that nature.

2366
01:33:15,074 --> 01:33:16,895
Uh, my role on the day,
of course

2367
01:33:16,929 --> 01:33:18,389
was purely as an observer.

2368
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:20,340
Have you anything to add?

2369
01:33:22,046 --> 01:33:24,695
No, sir. No.

2370
01:33:24,732 --> 01:33:26,771
Congratulations.

2371
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:30,070
The war against the lRA
will go on.

2372
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,012
Thank you, gentlemen.

2373
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:44,295
If you want me, sir,
I'll be out here.

2374
01:33:44,335 --> 01:33:45,960
Thank you, Michael.

2375
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:43,492
If you just give us a moment.

2376
01:34:46,121 --> 01:34:49,152
People... people, please.

2377
01:34:49,191 --> 01:34:52,352
People, please, could you
just give us a moment?

2378
01:34:52,389 --> 01:34:54,297
If you just have a seat quietly
for a moment

2379
01:34:54,339 --> 01:34:56,574
we'll issue you
with a full statement presently.

2380
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,332
And we will take
some questions afterwards

2381
01:34:58,368 --> 01:35:00,789
if you'll just please bear
with us.

2382
01:35:03,581 --> 01:35:05,587
Just have a seat there
for a moment.

2383
01:35:15,702 --> 01:35:17,195
Thank you.

2384
01:35:20,978 --> 01:35:25,285
Uh, this afternoon, 27 people
were shot in this city.

2385
01:35:31,084 --> 01:35:35,718
13 of them lie dead tonight.

2386
01:35:35,753 --> 01:35:41,347
They were innocent.
We were there.

2387
01:35:41,381 --> 01:35:44,281
This is our Sharpeville.

2388
01:35:44,324 --> 01:35:49,023
This is our Amritsa Massacre.

2389
01:35:49,056 --> 01:35:55,065
A moment of truth
and a moment of shame.

2390
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:01,969
And, uh, I just want to say this
to the British government:

2391
01:36:02,073 --> 01:36:06,925
You know what you've just done,
don't you?

2392
01:36:06,966 --> 01:36:12,047
You've destroyed
the Civil Rights Movement.

2393
01:36:12,082 --> 01:36:13,488
And you've given the lRA

2394
01:36:13,553 --> 01:36:17,740
the biggest victory
it will ever have.

2395
01:36:17,775 --> 01:36:20,806
All over this city tonight

2396
01:36:20,845 --> 01:36:27,813
young men, boys...
will be joining the lRA

2397
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:31,229
and you will reap a whirlwind.

2398
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:32,676
Thank you.

2399
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:34,977
Mr. Cooper, what do you say
to those people

2400
01:36:35,011 --> 01:36:36,156
that might be joining

2401
01:36:36,195 --> 01:36:38,681
and what message do you want
to give to them?

2402
01:36:38,722 --> 01:36:40,728
I feel very ill-equipped

2403
01:36:40,768 --> 01:36:44,181
to do any preaching to them
after today.

2404
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:59,339
The names of the dead are
as follows:

2405
01:36:59,381 --> 01:37:05,040
Patrick Joseph Doherty,
age 31...

2406
01:37:05,073 --> 01:37:10,917
Gerard Vincent Donaghy,
age 17...

2407
01:37:22,758 --> 01:37:28,471
...John Francis Duddy, age 17...

2408
01:37:28,514 --> 01:37:32,189
Hugh Pius Gilmore, age 17...

2409
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:46,222
...James Gerard McKinney, 35...

2410
01:37:46,263 --> 01:37:51,475
William Anthony McKinney, 26...

2411
01:37:51,507 --> 01:37:55,466
Kevin Gerard McElhinney,
age 17...

2412
01:38:02,701 --> 01:38:06,593
...Bernard McGuigan, 41...

2413
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:13,602
Michael Martin McDaid, 20...

2414
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:16,734
Michael Gerald Kelly, 17...

2415
01:38:24,127 --> 01:38:29,622
...William Noel Nash, 19...

2416
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:33,814
James Patrick Wray, 22...

2417
01:38:33,849 --> 01:38:37,840
John Pius Young, 17.

2418
01:38:39,765 --> 01:38:41,619
Have the families of the dead
been informed?

2419
01:38:41,652 --> 01:38:44,236
They have... they have been,
uh, notified at this point, yes

2420
01:38:44,274 --> 01:38:46,793
and, uh...

2421
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:47,760
Actually, gentlemen

2422
01:38:47,792 --> 01:38:49,679
I think that probably
the best thing is

2423
01:38:49,774 --> 01:38:51,268
we adjourn just for a moment.

2424
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:52,902
We have some distressed people.

2425
01:38:52,941 --> 01:38:55,787
So if we can have a little
sensitivity just until we...

2426
01:38:55,819 --> 01:38:56,833
I think we can, uh...

2427
01:38:56,874 --> 01:38:58,118
Wait until you get outside.

2428
01:38:58,154 --> 01:38:59,615
She was saying, "Where's Jack?"

2429
01:38:59,657 --> 01:39:00,866
Wait till you get outside.

2430
01:39:00,904 --> 01:39:02,757
Don't say anything
till you get outside.

2431
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,164
I'm sorry,
can you just step aside

2432
01:39:04,198 --> 01:39:05,757
for one minute, please?

2433
01:39:05,797 --> 01:39:07,356
What am I going to say
to Barney's family?

2434
01:39:07,395 --> 01:39:08,474
There is nothing you can say.

2435
01:39:08,515 --> 01:39:10,008
What am I going to say
to Barney's kids?

2436
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:12,056
There's nothing
any of us could say.

2437
01:39:12,096 --> 01:39:13,557
...yourselves.
You all saw it.

2438
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,541
You saw it, you saw it.

2439
01:39:15,582 --> 01:39:17,337
And I would say...
I would say to yourselves

2440
01:39:17,373 --> 01:39:18,388
to British journalists

2441
01:39:18,429 --> 01:39:20,882
go home to your people,
to your government

2442
01:39:20,924 --> 01:39:23,475
and tell your people
what was done in their name

2443
01:39:23,513 --> 01:39:24,919
on the streets of Derry today.

2444
01:39:24,953 --> 01:39:26,894
The paratroopers
moved in last night

2445
01:39:26,936 --> 01:39:30,512
and waited in the streets
of Derry to mow us down.

2446
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:34,159
And I would just like
to say this on behalf of us

2447
01:39:34,195 --> 01:39:37,967
the families of the victims
and the victims

2448
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,191
that we will not rest
until justice is done.
