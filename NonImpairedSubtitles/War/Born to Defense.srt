00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,754 
You want to argue? 
More daring? 

160 
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,054 
Go! Come on! 

161 
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,207 
Xiao Jie, a very good beat! 

162 
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,162 
Ladies and Gentlemen, we invited him to 
pub to drink a few glasses go? 

163 
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:50,356 
Be! 

164 
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,868 
Okay, let's go! 

165 
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,916

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,195

Across the room, let's go! 

167 
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,111 
Sit! 

168 
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,089 
Hi, John! 

169 
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,630 
What do they drink? 
-Beer! 

170 
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,720 
Beer? Four beer! 

171 
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,199 
It turns out that the pub is like this. 

172 
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:58,595 
Often not the same 
like this. 

173 
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,514 
We Americans love women, 
like boxing. 

174 
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,279 
Female boss to glean some 
as pull stations. 

175 
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,309 
Is not the money? 

176 
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,096 
Just you, your playing! 

177 
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,143 
He was a child. 

178 
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,912 
We jump right? 
-Being. 

179 
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,438 
Boss, for more beer. 

180 
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:37,598 
Look at this sister. 
Do you know what this is? 

181 
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,992 
Come, you're doing? 

182 
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:43,897 
What are you doing ...? 

183 
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,354 
Look at this. 
Are you crazy? 

184 
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,310 
Do so! 

185 
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,837 
See, look at the other guy and see! 

186 
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,947 
Hey buddy, you need to put it away,

00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,912 
Do you know English? 
He said what? 

191 
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,951 
He insulted him, because he 
Japan they castrated. 

192 
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,833 
-Mother! 
-Hey! 

193 
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:23,668

Without them I dropped the atomic bomb 
them you have me for a long time. 

201 
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,192 
You just said what, OAT men? 

202 
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,755 
He said, if they do not drop the bomb 
atom, we have a long time ago. 

203 
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:48,553 
More like my flat? 

204 
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,396 
Get off him! 

205 
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,151 
View our atomic bombs, you

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,038

If you can stand 3 minutes,

212 
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,912 
Assholes,

213 
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,951 
His mother, anywhere! 
-State Kiet, targeting?

Mark said it. 

216 
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,151 
This is not the first time again. 

217 
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,800 
-You can take a closer look! 
You have to be careful! 

218 
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,199 
To buy one you win! 

219 
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,279 
Aging parents, we are the Chinese, certain

226 
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,395 
If you are afraid, get out of here. 

227 
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,635 
Go to your mom! 

228 
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,957 
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! 

229

-Okay! 
-Be careful! 

232 
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,436 
Wait for a while, you hear me!

235 
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:45,233 
At this, the man OAT!

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,431

Stand up! Come on!

Very good! Very good! 

240 
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,069 
My friend, down he went, 
you can do it! 

241 
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,753 
Hey, you play style fuck? 

242 
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,398 
-Do you see? That's not fair. 
-Okay. 

243 
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,952 
Boxing is not your feet. 

244 
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,061 
Can only be used manually? 

245 
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,101 
Very good! State Jay beat very good! 

246 
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,249 
He bitch! 

247 
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,155 
-He did not see the man, he used the elbow? 
-Come here! 

248 
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,071 
He filed ah, elbow 
not used. 

249 
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,917 
Why? Elbows should not be used? 
Then press? 

250 
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,509 
Beat! State Jay! 
Sign it! 

251 
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,720 
Why would you throw him? 
So is a violation! 

252 
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,550 
Infringement? 

253 
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,548 
Not used, not the elbow, 
legs are not, so how do I beat this? 

254 
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,940 
Just beat the law! 
Type the law! 

255 
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,431 
So I took my gloves? 

256 
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:07,510 
Gloves are not considered, 
will not be issued. 

257 
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,770 
Do not take off? 
I do not fight anymore! 

258 
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,479 
Did not he say 
do not use your feet? 

259 
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,869 
Now there are two sides 
can use the leg. 

260 
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,051 
He bitch! Sign it! 

261 
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,949 
1, 2, 3, 4 ... 

262 
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,148 
Xiao Jie, hit go! 

263 
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,839 
Billy, stand up! 

264 
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,869 
Fuck you! 

265 
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,070 
Do well. 

266 
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,410 
1, 2, 3, 4 ... 

267 
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,099 
Are you okay? 

268 
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:20,395 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ... 

269 
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,384 
Jay, you are well on the State, 
beat very good! 

270 
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,989 
I do not know, sir, 
at home I love you so much. 

271 
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:45,411 
-Dollar? 
-Changes! 

272 
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:46,152

00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:52,044 
Than not. 

276 
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,118 
Here, give it to him. 

277 
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,128 
For me? How about you? 
Part enough for us then. 

278 
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:57,993 
Well, we go now, bye! 

279 
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,871 
Law!

280 
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,356 
- Buy me! 
- Buy me! 

281 
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:09,827 
Do not eat? 

282 
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,161 
Here, go buy something to eat. 

283

287 
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,160 
Stop pushing! Stop pushing! 
Only for the children, not for adults! 

288 
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,952 
Do not be crowded ... 

289 
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,556 
Great song! 
-What? 

290 
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,352 
Incidentally, go me! 
Come this way! 

291 
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,391 
In her not to go around. 

292 
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,320 
He did not listen, it happens. 
Today, American children burned away. 

293 
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,072 
Told what to do, 
I joined! 

294 
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,075 
What? What? 

295 
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,156 
You can take part! 

296 
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,596 
Capo, have little enough money to

297 
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,074 
Come on, he's sitting in the car, 
let me pull. 

298 
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,400 
Changing my computer? 

299 
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,914 
Rest assured, brother. 
I hear you, do not go wild. 

300 
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,554 
Then he pulled the car, 
I reject your behind. 

301 
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,877 
Okay, the other lost. 
Stop at this place. 

302 
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,019 
-This, to pay for it. 
-Thank you. 

303 
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,487 
Capo, I see this ... 

304 
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,112 
What is so broken? 
-Still no, this damaged already. 

305 
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,715 
This also failed, you see

306 
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,037 
He said sounds simple, too. 

307 
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,993 
If not by the end of the war, with the release 
they do not buy this car everywhere. 

308 
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,828 
Well, he goes to buy some

-Come on, put your hands. 
He's fun. 

315 
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,800 
Want to ride it? 
-Yes. 

316 
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,798 
Come on, take off your coat. 
Now is the right time. 

317 
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,837 
Why? He sees something that looks! 
Fast sled! 

318 
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:42,852 
Take it now! 

319 
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:55,891 
Please, you have to return home. 

320 
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,950 
Come on, just a kiss. 

321 
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,693 
No, please. 

322 
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,910 
What is it? Why do you continue to find 
stare at him? 

323 
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,382 
Does it matter? 
I can tell you that. 

324 
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,858 
Come on. Drag car 
go faster. 

325 
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:15,448 
I say that? He did not hear? 

326 
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,543 
Come on! 

327 
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,876 
Hey, slow down there, 
Hurry up! 

328 
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,480 
Do not listen to? 
-Please do not. 

329 
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,925 
What do you do? 
-Come on. 

330 
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,342 
No! Leave me alone! 
Leave me alone! 

331 
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:32,510 
Stop it! Hands off! 

332 
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,352 
I've never seen any girl 
vile as you. 

333 
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,422 
Come back here! 

334 
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,703 
Son of a bitch! 

335 
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,214 
What the fuck are you doing? 

336 
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,634 
Animals! 

337 
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,872 
Lady, travel? 

338 
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,272 
What is it? 

339 
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,510 
Where he put money 
old Zhang helped me. 

340 
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,029 
He knew my brother? 

341 
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,880 
Well, I used to ride 
her brother. 

342 
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,589 
If he is sick, money 
hold to the doctor. 

343 
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480 
So from now on I will 
suspend him. 

344 
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,516 
I was at No. 8 Vu. 

345 
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:30,867 
-Do you see the end of America? 
Not that. 

346 
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,994 
What's going on? 
-I paid him. 

347 
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,039 
State Jay! 

348 
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:36,062 
-Possess saw United finish? 
Not that. 

349 
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:36,949 
She will leave. 

350 
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,700 
What? He immediately went to look for him, 
I give an assessment of the hospital. 

351 
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:40,293 
Be! 

352 
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,730 
United efficiency,

Come on! 

355 
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,277 
Why the rush? 
Why not return to the bar? 

356 
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,007

00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,594 
This, you fight quite there. 

358 
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,913 
Why do not you fight me? 

359 
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,865 
Make him afraid. 

360 
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:13,043 
Aunt trying to take. 

361 
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,390

00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,710

363 
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,113

00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,190 
Slowly but surely! 

369 
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,949 
My car! 

370 
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,470 
Back to me! 

371 
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,076 
Back to me! 

372 
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,987 
You want trouble? 
-I am sorry. 

373 
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:11,156 
Get out of here. 

374 
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,771 
Wipe again, you see. 

375 
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:18,417 
Boss. 

376 
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:20,399 
Do you see some asshole 
The last time? 

377 
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:22,311 
Who told you? 

378 
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,960 
This struggle of man 
with me last time. 

379 
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,518 
What happened? 

380 
00:36:25,896 --> 00:36:29,599 
His mother, little bastard 
get my car, and destroy it. 

381 
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,080 
Is it? 

382 
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,877 
The car is 
my brother. 

383 
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,676 
You come here, come here to sit. 

384 
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,911 
A few days to make 
do not do anything then. 

385 
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,632 
Here brought two beers. 
Sitting. 

386 
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,396 
He filed well, we are his people, 
little money he had taken. 

387 
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:56,153 
No 

388 
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,590 
He produced, depending on the parents, 
foreign count on your friends. 

389 
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,915 
You do not forget 
brother's life. 

390 
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,075 
But I ... 

391 
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,873 
He took away, I admired 
he is a son of Han ... 

392 
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,036 
This is a bit of my mind. 

393 
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,471 
Boss, I will make him 
a few days. As i ... 

394 
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,873 
Oh, he did what gas? 

395 
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,354 
The owner, if he 
do not agree ... 

396 
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,470 
This number does not take us. 

397 
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,080 
If so ... 

398 
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,914 
So, the 

399 
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,030 
But trouble. 

400 
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,796 
Suffering like? 

401 
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,231 
People tell me to find 
people beaten. 

402 
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,633 
To treat them 
within two or three days. 

403 
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,355 
If you agree, ... 

404 
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,230 
Bear attack? 

405 
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,669 
Yes, you see ... 

406 
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560 
Easy so do not say 3 days 

407 
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,640 
10 days is not a problem. 

408 
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,880 
Do not fight back. 

409 
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,394 
So what? Boss, 
The speech act. 

410 
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,479 
When to start? 

411 
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,034 
Okay, as usual,

412 
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,800 
Alright.

00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,949 
Up. 

414 
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,593 
Assholes! 

415 
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,436 
Hey, black car for me! 
What is it? 

416 
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,569 
Temple car for me! 

417 
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,709 
What the fuck? 

418 
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,149 
It's not boy beaten body, 
they fight back? 

419 
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,796 
State fraternity well, you just do not know the rules. 
Beaten not fight back. 

420 
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,353 
I have to settle with him. 

421 
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,554 
What do you do? Do not hit me! 

422 
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,149 
You do not need to fight back. 
He also fought back because I met disaster. 

423 
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,112 
Do not hit me! 

424 
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,676 
I do not anymore! 

425 
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:15,400 
Now she was alone late! 

426 
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,193 
He went they would 
take my life away. 

427 
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,958 
They will also destroy 
my pub! 

428 
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:24,468 
I beg you, 
trade you my love. 

429 
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,756 
I have good intentions 
duties. 

430 
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800 
You have the money to fix the car. 

431 
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,791 
Now you are alone. 

432 
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,159 
Not harm me? 

433 
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,159 
Do not fight it! 

434 
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,630 
He also fought back, 
I would be lost. 

435 
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,303 
Wake up, dammit! 

436 
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,359 
Do not have anything else! 

437 
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,917 
You beat! 

438 
00:41:04,302 --> 00:41:04,996 
You beat! 

439 
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,598 
You beat! 

440 
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,593 
-Okay. Listen, that's enough. 
-Come here! 

441 
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,150 
Brothers and sisters, you okay? 

442 
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,919 
Do not blame me no good, 
you do not have to come back here again tomorrow. 

443 
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,393 
What has happened 
I would not worry at all. 

444 
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,670 
No, I promise, 
certain to come. 

445 
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,437

446 
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:24,312 
Thank you. 

447 
00:42:24,347 --> 00:42:25,568

449 
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,335 
-Yes, he will. 
Are you sure? 

450 
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,320 
He promised that. 

451 
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:32,555 
Okay, he's very good, 
See you tomorrow. 

452 
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,750 
Thank you! 

453 
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,001 
Who is this? 
It is me. 

454 
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,030

Sitting. 

456 
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:55,232 
-Are you okay? 
-No. 

457 
00:42:58,435 --> 00:43:03,574 
Conversation today I have seen it all, 
I see that you do not have to work again. 

458 
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:05,890 
Take people's money, 
at risk for it. 

459 
00:43:05,925 --> 00:43:08,107 
I have already spoken 
can not forget? 

460 
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:10,776 
Furthermore, I can be involved 
to his boss? 

461 
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,364 
Is it true? 

462 
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:14,036 
He is not required 
a good man. 

463 
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,837 
He along with Billy cooperation with one another, 
get you hooked. 

464 
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:17,662 
Why? 

465 
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,175 
My eyes to see, 
lying to you? 

466 
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,876 
Tomorrow you do not need. 

467 
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,400 
I gotta go, I have to 
destroy the pub again. 

468 
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,863 
You lose the Navy. 

469 
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:45,332 
Admiral, what? 

470 
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:47,600 
This male bitch, 
Whether he wins or loses 

471 
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,034 
also do not need to spend money 
for rent and defeat. 

472 
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:02,578 
Xiao Jie, listen to me 
not hit. 

473 
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:04,085 
He assured, I do not mind. 

474 
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,514 
I have to give him a lesson. 

475 
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:07,592 
Welcome brotherhood. 

476 
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,691 
He was here, he said, to keep the promise. 

477 
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:12,492 
How are you? Today 
can? 

478 
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:13,238 
Do not act. 

479 
00:44:14,242 --> 00:44:16,246 
I teach them a lesson done, 
will return to teaching. 

480 
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,606 
You're wrong, 
Do not be confused otherwise. 

481 
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:20,960 
Asshole is not there? 

482 
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:24,141 
You look very tasty today. 

483 
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:26,730 
But I do not think you can 
resist punching. 

484 
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:27,160 
Here! 

485 
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,296 
Told her not to be 
said business. 

486 
00:44:30,331 --> 00:44:31,280 
Come here! 

487 
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,508 
He is ready, sir? 

488 
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,436 
Fuck you! 

489 
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,799 
Today I'm not fighting you! 

490 
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,795 
You beat him. 

491 
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,650 
Do you remember me? 
We have never met each other. 

492 
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,754 
You will fight with me, 
not Billy. 

493 
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,470 
Today the beat 
not Billy, but he. 

494 
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,123 
Why do I have to fight him? 

495 
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:56,114 
What do you say to 
beat him, sir? 

496 
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,232 
He has disgraced their uniforms I, 
and I can not ignore it. 

497 
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:02,352 
-You are a good fighter ... 
He said: Billy lie to you ... 

498 
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,072 
... loss sanctuary 
troops. 

499 
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,997 
Now he hit ... 

500 
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,359 
Give him what style. 

501 
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,960 
Up there 
defeated. 

502 
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,554 
But he said the absolute 
did not hit him. 

503 
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:14,672 
You do not have to fight with him, 
you will lose! 

504 
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,520 
If you do not want, 
I will tell everyone ... 

505 
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,112 
He said if he did not dare 
beat ... 

506 
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,960 
he will tell 
all the ... 

507 
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,473 
He is a yellow dog. 

508 
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,478 
He also said the tail 
equal in population. 

509 
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,748 
We do Chinese people! 

510 
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:31,577 
Not a dog! 

511 
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:33,396 
Chinese people are not dogs! 

512 
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,873 
Then prove it. 

513 
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,495 
She asked him to prove 
for him to see. 

514 
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,671 
Come here! 

515 
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,360 
Men than women. 

516 
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,440 
Admiral Hansen 
representative for the United States Navy. 

517 
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,919 
He is who he is. 

518 
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,518 
So let's cheer for him. 

519 
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,955

No hitting, no hitting, 
Do not be beat! 

536 
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,950 
What do you need? 

537 
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,148 
Wait, wait ... 

538 
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,035 
1, 2, 3, 4 ... 

539 
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,188 
Take the box here!

548 
00:52:00,213 --> 00:52:01,352 
Looks like fighting Kiet State

00:59:54,055 --> 00:59:54,590

-What is Evil? 
You eat salt more than pay for the meal. 

623 
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,188 
He ate too much salt

624 
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,229 
Do not talk much anymore, go! 

625 
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,998

On the road like this

01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,551 
Capo, day 
direct way of speaking. 

628 
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,795 
This time he was not clear in black and white 
to fight. 

629 
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,193 
Did you know he has saved me. 

630 
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,355 
He is the savior of children there. 

631 
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,129 
I can not thank him instead of you, 
even beat him. 

632 
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:23,168 
He depends on what 
who beat him? 

633 
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,752 
He says what he has 
to beat him? 

634 
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,836 
It is my daughter, 
like? 

635 
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,168 
She is your daughter? 

636 
01:00:28,723 --> 01:00:29,720 
Does this mean that he 
will beat him? 

637 
01:00:31,014 --> 01:00:32,443 
I remember now. He ... 

638 
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,192 
You do not have to go. 

639 
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:37,437 
Before the war, 
he returned from the dead. 

640 
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,311 
For what? Do not want 
see his daughter? 

641 
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,280 
Then he said 
his daughter's death. 

642 
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,508 
I think so. 

643 
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:45,959 
It turns out you lied to me. 

644 
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:48,753 
I do not claim him? 
Just because she is a prostitute. 

645 
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,233 
Enough said? 

646 
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,157 
Prostitute? 
A prostitute who does not? 

647 
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,470 
Do not forget, he is now a prostitute 
still take a family field. 

648 
01:01:01,414 --> 01:01:05,200 
You scream, cry, 
you scream out loud. 

649 
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,035 
Time around all know my daughter 
prostitute, I did Damn. 

650 
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,912 
Damn? Damn 
children are not? 

651 
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,195 
Ass man! 

652 
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,520 
Yes, I pass gas 
also by his teaching. 

653 
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,954 
I pass gas, I admit. 

654 
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,355 
You can not claim? 
Do you recognize? 

655 
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,516 
Old're ... 
-He? 

656 
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,913 
Old Turtle, right? 

657 
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,324 
She was confused, e-mail a request. 

658 
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:32,680 
You quail now, you are what 
who dare to teach me. 

659 
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,398 
Quail, quail now! 

660 
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,200 
Go, go now! 
Do not ever come back! 

661 
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:43,469 
Well, you go, then I have carried the litter 
invited me in, I do not bother! 

662 
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:01,127 
See the children run away? 

663 
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,239 
When I was little, my dad also likes 
take me to the beach. 

664 
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:22,470 
At the time, take a shell 
nice ... is very excited. 

665 
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,599 
My father is very angry with me. 

666 
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,315 
Mad at me what? 

667 
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,280 
Nor could he. 

668 
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,510 
Prices do not go 
this way. 

669 
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,120 
If there is no war, 

670 
01:02:43,777 --> 01:02:44,953 
If your mother was not dead, 

671 
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:47,878 
Well as you can. 

672 
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,672 
No, he thought, 
he got me started. 

673 
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,750 
Great song! 

674 
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:06,791 
Great song! 

675 
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,399 
Capo, children want 
negotiate with him. 

676 
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:13,623 
Non-payment of said 
not back then? 

677 
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,758 
He was good to me like that, 
I am not a parent, not the house. 

678 
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,279 
Not here it goes? 

679 
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:22,354 
Children want 
by the master. 

680 
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,315 
I do something good, 
not dominate him. 

681 
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,751 
Great song, I love it. 

682 
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,953 
Why? 

683 
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,434 
Also he is not good, if not fighting 
with you, I do not have to come out some day. 

684 
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,600 
If you do not have to go out a few days, 
I do not know him. 

685 
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,875 
If you do not have to go after him, 
I do not ... 

686 
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,199 
Then attach blame him? 

687 
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,032 
I must thank you. 

688 
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,440 
She was very beautiful. 

689 
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,271 
Her big round eyes 
bowl. 

690 
01:03:56,488 --> 01:03:57,675 
Her nose is very high. 

691 
01:03:58,635 --> 01:03:59,520 
Bid is higher than the display cake. 

692 
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:02,193 
Her mouth ... 

693 
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,193 
Small as peas. 

694 
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,191 
Posts kiss already? 

695 
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,719 
Her body ... 

696 
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,429 
Of schedule. 

697 
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,833 
But ... 

698 
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:17,911 
But what? 

699 
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,949 
He was a prostitute. 

700 
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,954 
In fact he was just as 
conditions that lead. 

701 
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,353 
If there is no war. 

702 
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,953 
Wild Infantry code interference. 

703 
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,520 
He did not 
humble prostitute. 

704 
01:04:32,406 --> 01:04:33,200 
But ... 

705 
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,786 
... He promised me 
the second is not. 

706 
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:41,118 
Extreme left, extreme left. 

707 
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,154 
No doubt he is a terrorist asshole. 
He also became violent bastard. 

708 
01:04:50,276 --> 01:04:55,076 
Come away, my daughter in this world who 
has voluntarily prostitute rights. 

709 
01:04:56,078 --> 01:04:59,875 
He really wants to be good 
then give him a chance. 

710 
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:02,798 
True, very true, 
opportunity. 

711 
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:06,276 
Capo, when you take him 
to start? 

712 
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:08,041 
Depending pay. 

713 
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,231 
He was outside, 
let me take him. 

714 
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,424 
Capo, I see. 

715 
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,612 
Good, very good, you 
want to play with me? 

716 
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,273 
Want to play me? 
Great song! 

717 
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:32,828 
See you dare kidding me? 
Great song! 

718 
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,472 
Are you crazy? 

719 
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,669 
Instant death! 

720 
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,314 
Capo, put! 
-Get out, get the hell out! 

721 
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,876 
I did not go. 

722 
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,070 
Capo, would you say 
not kept his word? 

723 
01:05:43,877 --> 01:05:47,894 
Why do you forgive a daughter 
that his daughter? 

724 
01:05:48,709 --> 01:05:51,200 
You know, I also 
just as stubborn. 

725 
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,192 
I think ... why 
He lives of working women? 

726 
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:56,143 
He did not know what to think? 

727 
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,833 
If you are still 
such bigotry. 

728 
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:01,347 
Then he can live alone 
all his life! 

729 
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,073 
Dad! 

730 
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,350 
Dad! 

731 
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,629 
State Jay! 

732 
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:35,521 
I am here. 

733 
01:06:45,149 --> 01:06:46,331 
Do not be sad otherwise. 

734 
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,929 
We still 
do not eat it. 

735 
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,019 
Yes, uncle, he turned 
this home ... 

736 
01:06:55,831 --> 01:06:57,155 
Still air, 
table does not fall over. 

737 
01:06:57,515 --> 01:06:58,483 
Let me clean. 

738 
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,872 
Well dad, so I will buy 
less alcohol, buy some vegetables. 

739 
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:05,802 
Well, I went. 

740 
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:07,841 
Swiss-State! 
-Yes? 

741 
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,513 
I do not forget ... 
-Paul chickens. 

742 
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,671 
-What do you buy? 
Give me a bottle of wine sorghum, chicken stew. 

743 
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,948 
-Add chicken buoy 5 questions. 
-Be! 

744 
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,089 
Sister! Come here! 

745 
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:25,723 
Get off me! 

746 
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:29,393 
Get off me! 

747 
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,752 
That's not the Zhang-old daughter? 
-Yes. 

748 
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,669 
Old Uncle told Zhang. 
I tried to stop them. 

749 
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,196 
Come quickly! 

750 
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,837 
Old School! Old School! 

751 
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,556 
Old School! 

752 
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,120 
What's going on? 
His daughter had been taken by the U.S. military, will soon go save it! 

753 
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:53,836 
Come on! 

754 
01:07:56,164 --> 01:07:56,972 
Let me out! 

755 
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,349 
What is it? 
-If my daughter? 

756 
01:08:01,384 --> 01:08:03,698 
Earlier by American soldiers 
he drove away. 

757 
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:04,549 
Come on! 

758 
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:07,355 
That must be done? 
We went to the police. 

759 
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,764 
Go fast, go fast! 

760 
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:12,150 
Saved! Let me out! 

761 
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,742 
Let me out! 

762 
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,350 
You are driving a kind? 

763 
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,435 
Chase! 

764 
01:08:26,782 --> 01:08:27,508 
Woe! 

765 
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:37,984 
This way. 

766 
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,112 
Saved! 

767 
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,929 
He's here. 
Hey you! 

768 
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,610 
You are here, why you 
want to run away? 

769 
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:19,773 
Time to catch you later, 
bitch! 

770 
01:09:21,893 --> 01:09:26,235 
I told you. I tell you 
do not play with me ... 

771 
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,918 
Get off me! Get off me! 

772 
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:34,991 
Come on! 

773 
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,555 
Capo, did you copy that? 
Do not worry about him, come to save the State of Sweden. 

774 
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,033 
Go on! 

775 
01:09:45,912 --> 01:09:47,227 
Stand back! 

776 
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,550 
State of Switzerland? 

777 
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,327 
The last time we did not 
not convincing, is now complete! 

778 
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:00,667 
Where is he? 

779 
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,668 
They Damn 
I kill them from you! 

780 
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,996 
Do not beat my dad! 

781 
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,350 
Daddy! 

782 
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,830 
Great song! 

783 
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,010 
Daddy! 

784 
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,310 
Swiss State! 

785 
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,006 
Swiss State! 

786 
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,276 
Great song! 

787 
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,750 
Great song! 

788 
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,948 
My God! 

789 
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,519 
All you have to do? 

790 
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,114 
Where we do not, 
by Billy boy. 

791 
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,071 
-Stop talking, shut up! 
A man Billy. 

792 
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,266 
-Let go of me! 
No, they are on the other. 

793 
01:11:59,301 --> 01:12:01,333 
On the floor there 
some people, follow me! 

794 
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:03,978 
How to catch them, 
not me. 

795 
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,696 
Sub-element, it is time to open it. 

796 
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:19,010 
If you still dare to cause trouble 
they create again. 

797 
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:27,679 
Stand. 

798 
01:12:28,194 --> 01:12:29,489 
Looking for trouble 
correct? 

799 
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,073 
Sub-element, you go to fight the enemy for 8 years. 
I was also at war eight years ago. 

800 
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,269 
You open it. 

801 
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,197 
What is the 
U.S. ask them. 

802 
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,355 
Asked me what to do? 

803 
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,532 
Old Mouth? 

804 
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,354 
He assured, really 
not a problem. 

805 
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,773 
No problem. 
Want to smoke? Smoking. 

806 
01:13:11,481 --> 01:13:12,829 
The U.S.? 
-Yes. 

807 
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:14,759 
Thom also. 

808 
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,116 
Large, they have 
investigate the matter last night. 

809 
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,600 
That is a misconception. 

810 
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,354 
It will not affect 
China and U.S. relations. 

811 
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,152 
Please. 

812 
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,005 
Please. 

813 
01:13:48,727 --> 01:13:49,820 
Goodbye. 

814 
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,108 
Hey! 

815 
01:13:52,604 --> 01:13:53,868 
Why do people let them go? 

816 
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,712 
They are killers. 

817 
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,557 
Why let them go 
so easily? 

818 
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,318 
This is the king of what law? 

819 
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,669 
What kind of police it? 
Flood Damn! 

820 
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,979 
Let me go! 

821 
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,845 
Let me go! 

822 
01:14:06,027 --> 01:14:07,239 
Let me go! 

823 
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,515 
-Rack him, smoking. 
Give me a cigarette. 

824 
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,993 
-More cigarettes. 
-Let me go! Let me go! 

825 
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,229 
Rack him, we go. 

826 
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,269 
Let me go! Let me go! 

827 
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,356 
Let me go! Let me go! 

828 
01:15:17,691 --> 01:15:19,268 
Shogun hear, 
not your fault. 

829 
01:15:19,303 --> 01:15:22,359 
Crazy old man, I say 
with you and I do? 

830 
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:24,962 
-He tripped and fell! 
-Shut up! 

831 
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,075 
That is enough. 

832 
01:15:27,115 --> 01:15:29,891 
Stop you. Tell him that 
occur. 

833 
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,951 
Woe! Come on! 

834 
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,484 
You hold the other end! 

835 
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:41,272 
Can? 

836 
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,243 
Started! 

837 
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,776 
Again. 

838 
01:15:45,089 --> 01:15:46,631 
In general, we 
need help! 

839 
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,008 
What is this? 

840 
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,278 
What bitch that men, there

841 
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,635 
He's hiding somewhere.

01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:18,951

-Do! 
-Listen I ask, where is he?

What is this? Help!

01:17:08,703 --> 01:17:10,729
