1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:03,896
La fabrique


2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:08,191
The Henrys Team: aspirat, beotienne,
do_Ob, Funi, karim HelenScott,

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,591
kiry, khillaree, mytom,neuceu, olaola. Cheerleader: Blek l'Andouille

4
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:19,069
My lords,

5
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,159
I do confess to you that,
although I've lain

6
00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:24,458
with the Queen almost every
night these past weeks,

7
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,621
my conscience will not permit me
to consummate this marriage

8
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:30,213
because I feel there is some
impediment to it.

9
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,562
I have done as much as any man
to move the consent of my heart

10
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:38,774
and mind, but the obstacle
will not out of my thoughts.

11
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:43,484
Perhaps the truth is that
there existed a precontract

12
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,217
between the Duke of Lorraine's
son and the Princess after all,

13
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:49,442
from which she was never
released, and so therefore

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,714
I am really married
to another man's wife.

15
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:56,831
My lords,

16
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,480
I leave it to you to investigate

17
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:02,205
whether or not
my scruples are justified.

18
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:06,909
Your Majesty.

19
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,909
My Lord, you must find some way

20
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:24,951
to relieve His Majesty's conscience.

21
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:31,656
I tell you, Charles,

22
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:36,044
God will not grant me any more children
if I continue in this marriage.

23
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,546
Was she such a maid that
she didn't know what to do?

24
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:47,530
Not telling a woman what she
must expect on her wedding night is...

25
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:51,322
like sending a sailor
to sea with no biscuit.

26
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:55,053
I will force Cromwell to bring about
a dissolution of the marriage.

27
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:58,237
I went ahead with it for the sake
of the realm and now even

28
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:59,691
that reason is forgot.

29
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:04,515
The Emperor and the King of France
are at each other's throats again

30
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,276
and both have come courting.

31
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:08,899
Who needs Cleves?

32
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:13,204
My Lord Cromwell.

33
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,070
Was the match not his idea?

34
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,158
Princess Mary is here.

35
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:32,872
Princess, if you please.

36
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:42,495
I have received a letter
from a cousin of mine.

37
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,996
He is Duke Philip of Bavaria.

38
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,266
Philip'd like.

39
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:50,249
To come to England
and pay court to you

40
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,570
Why?

41
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,341
He has heard many things
about you, Princess Mary.

42
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:58,192
Many good things.

43
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,010
I suppose he's a Lutheran,

44
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:03,408
like you?

45
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:06,753
He is charming

46
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,980
and very good looking.

47
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:12,295
I think you might like him a little.

48
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:14,280
What shall I tell him?

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,170
Tell him...

50
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:24,074
Tell him he may come if he
pleases and if the King wishes.

51
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,555
But not to expect anything.

52
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,042
Father?

53
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,707
Gregory!

54
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,878
What on earth are you doing here?

55
00:04:57,003 --> 00:05:00,281
Well, I noticed you forgot
your pills at the apothecary.

56
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:02,807
I didn't want you to be in pain.

57
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:07,302
Sit down.

58
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:16,722
What are you working on?

59
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:20,091
I'm preparing bills for Parliament
on the medical profession.

60
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:22,522
And I'm trying
to persuade His Majesty

61
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:25,197
to appoint councillors based
upon merit,

62
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,891
and nothing else.

63
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,747
You look tired, father.

64
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,472
How is His Majesty?

65
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:38,182
He's fine.

66
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:40,335
His leg bothers him;

67
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,835
it gets sore. He gets irritable.

68
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,385
Is that why he strikes you
on the head sometimes?

69
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:51,435
I resent the King nothing,

70
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,716
but others seek to undermine me,
since I was born so low

71
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,291
and they so high...

72
00:05:58,428 --> 00:05:59,428
And

73
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:01,199
for other reasons too.

74
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:05,619
Think not on that.

75
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:10,329
Look after your own dear wife,
and the child in her belly.

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,036
Love them as you love God
and His Holy Word,

77
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,268
and all shall be well.

78
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,054
I'm sorry you failed to
capture that traitor

79
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,972
Reginald Pole, Sir Francis.

80
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:32,765
The King detests him above all men.

81
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,990
However,

82
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,854
he has other matters
on his mind now.

83
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,872
When I last spoke to His Majesty
he confessed he was,

84
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:44,902
- in some ways, tired with his life.
- His life or his wife?

85
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:50,203
They are much the same thing.

86
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,265
Can he not find distraction,

87
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,034
as he has always done before?

88
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,121
Easily.

89
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,073
But he is more jaded than before.

90
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,652
The usual remedies won't suit.

91
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,002
Something more...

92
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,331
extreme...

93
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,007
might tempt him.

94
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,736
In this matter at least, Your Grace,

95
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,833
I shall not fail the King.

96
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,549
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

97
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,255
Sir?

98
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:33,959
Princess Mary, I hope
you can forgive my impetuosity.

99
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:38,263
I know we should have been
formally introduced, but...

100
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,596
I couldn't wait.

101
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,479
You are Duke Philip?

102
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:46,888
May I kiss your hand?

103
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,610
I hope I might
see you again, my Lady.

104
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:02,021
With my cousin the Queen
present, of course.

105
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,982
I had thought to leave court
tomorrow for the country.

106
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,239
I may delay my leaving,
if it pleases you.

107
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:15,548
For a day or so.

108
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:28,171
My sweet Francis, I missed you!

109
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,096
Handsome as ever.

110
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,845
We haven't seen you for ages.
What have you been doing?

111
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,445
- Trying to kill someone.
- Did you manage it?

112
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,603
Not yet.

113
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:45,272
I suppose you've come to look
over my little darlings?

114
00:08:48,212 --> 00:08:50,727
Only after I've feasted
my eyes on you, my dear Lady.

115
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:54,507
Go along.

116
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:57,238
We have some new ones, I think.

117
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,680
Pretty little things.

118
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,433
I sometimes find it hard to
believe that whoever bore them

119
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:06,556
did not feel bothered
or obliged to raise them.

120
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,337
- Most of them were bastards.
- But

121
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:13,149
aristocratic bastards, my sweet boy.

122
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:16,261
Aristocratic bastards.

123
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,118
Make a dress for our doll.

124
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,143
- Who do you think he is?
- I don't know.

125
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,865
- He's been in a sword fight?
- Do you think he was?

126
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,990
Sir?

127
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:06,411
I have found someone
to amuse the King.

128
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:07,873
Who is she?

129
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:11,357
Miss Katherine Howard. She's a distant
relation to the Duke of Norfolk.

130
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,851
Her background is...
How shall I say?

131
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,363
Not entirely conventional.

132
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,966
I assume she's young and pretty.

133
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:23,572
See for yourself, my Lord.

134
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:27,703
You may come in now.

135
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,407
These are the excellent people
I told you of:

136
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,867
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk,

137
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,867
and the Earl of Hertford.

138
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,976
- Your Graces.
- How old are you?

139
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:50,252
Seventeen.

140
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,492
I wonder who taught her to count.

141
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,612
Tell us something about
yourself. Your family. So on.

142
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:00,267
My mother died when I was little.

143
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,335
My father remarried,

144
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,309
but I didn't know his wife really.

145
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:08,614
I was sent to live in the household
of the Dowager Duchess.

146
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:11,266
That would be the Dowager
Duchess of Norfolk?

147
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:14,546
- The widow of the second Duke
- I suppose so, my Lord.

148
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:16,413
I didn't see her much.

149
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:21,117
There were other children there,
from lots of marriages.

150
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,227
We ran a little wild.
There was some fun in it.

151
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:28,481
Well, sweet Katherine,

152
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,660
I think the fun is
just about to start again.

153
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:35,483
What do you think, Your Grace?

154
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,028
I think,

155
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:43,689
I think she looks fit for a king.

156
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,234
Did you talk to him?

157
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,359
To Philip?

158
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:51,614
A little. Yes.

159
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:54,962
I believe he is a very
intelligent young man.

160
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,710
I couldn't tell.

161
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,174
And extremely good-looking.

162
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,264
He likes you a great deal.

163
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,667
He doesn't even know me.

164
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,721
We've nothing in common.

165
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,380
Your Majesty, Duke Philip
asks for an audience.

166
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,085
I don't want to see him.

167
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:15,242
Then go in there! Quickly.

168
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:25,783
Ah, Philip.
My dear cousin.

169
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:26,908
Majesty.

170
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,192
How do you find this country?

171
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,251
I like it very much.

172
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,753
I could most happily live here.

173
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,466
So, you've met Princess Mary?

174
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:46,080
It was only for a moment,
but I relive that moment

175
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:47,875
over and over again in my mind.

176
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,860
I was told before that she was
charming, intelligent,

177
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,747
well-read, gracious.
The true heir of Katherine of Aragon.

178
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,766
A true Princess.

179
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,778
But nothing prepared me
for her beauty.

180
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,492
But a beauty that comes from inside.

181
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,125
To me, she is the most beautiful
creature on God's earth.

182
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:34,814
The Council has acted upon
Your Majesty's request.

183
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,518
We demanded written evidence
of the Queen's envoy

184
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:41,609
about the pre-marriage contract
to the Duke of Lorraine's son.

185
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:45,746
They provided it, but the papers
seem to suggest that,

186
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:49,283
instead of the usual formula,
"per verba de futuro",

187
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,702
the actual wording
on the document reads

188
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:54,485
"per verba de presenti",

189
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,770
which is a binding contract

190
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:02,063
- which renunciation cannot undo.
- So it does seem

191
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:05,038
that Your Majesty has reason
to be optimistic.

192
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,605
The King has noticed you.
He may ask to see you.

193
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:37,243
What shall I say to him?
What should I do?

194
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:39,631
Just be yourself.

195
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,131
Who is that girl?

196
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,255
That is Katherine Howard.

197
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,058
She is a relation
to the Duke of Norfolk.

198
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:54,724
She has only just come to court.

199
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:06,394
Bring her to me.

200
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,145
Majesty.

201
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,386
Majesty, Miss Katherine Howard.

202
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:20,877
Thank you, Charles.

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Katherine.

204
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,061
Your Majesty.

205
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,332
Please, be seated here.

206
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:54,614
- Are you married?
- No, Your Majesty.

207
00:15:58,697 --> 00:15:59,706
Can you read?

208
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,542
- Enough to write a letter.
- Who writes to you?

209
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:05,511
Nobody.

210
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,465
Do you have many houses?

211
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:40,288
- Ouch!
- What is it?

212
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:42,485
You stepped on my foot.

213
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,138
Philip, I'm so very sorry!

214
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:48,366
I do apologize. I'm so sorry.

215
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:50,916
Philip, I'm so sorry!

216
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,013
- I thought...
- You didn't step on my foot.

217
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:00,516
How could you? Your feet
don't even touch the ground.

218
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:05,343
I wanted a moment alone with you.

219
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,051
I...

220
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,511
You're crying.

221
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,885
Only because I'm so happy.

222
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,095
Would you like me to kiss you again?

223
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,448
Do you know where
this ring comes from?

224
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:06,499
It once adorned the shrine
of Thomas Becket at Canterbury.

225
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,900
The whole shrine
glittered with jewels,

226
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,975
left by princes and pilgrims.

227
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:13,978
But this ring...

228
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:17,564
This ring was the most
valuable gift of all.

229
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:20,263
A King of France left it

230
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,765
as an offering
to save his mortal soul.

231
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,089
May I touch it?

232
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:22,663
Good night, Princess.

233
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,323
Good night, Your Grace.

234
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:50,055
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell,
how is work proceeding

235
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:51,984
on my palace at Nonsuch?

236
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:54,369
I am pleased to report
that it is almost complete,

237
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,062
and will be ready for your
personal inspection come July.

238
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:06,001
I want to give a gift of land
to Mistress Katherine Howard.

239
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:08,306
There is some we recently
confiscated from a felon

240
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:11,726
if I remember correctly.
With two large houses upon it?

241
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,599
I wish to grant the whole
to Mistress Howard.

242
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,191
Majesty.

243
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,023
I hear the Council found a flaw

244
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:26,993
in the Queen's precontract.

245
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:31,162
It was not such a flaw
that it could not be overcome

246
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:33,535
by the Queen's personal repudiation.

247
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:35,100
There must still be grounds.

248
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:39,465
Before God, I think she is not
my lawful wife.

249
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,305
Whatever people say, Mr. Cromwell,

250
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,606
either to your face
or behind your back,

251
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:58,641
you are still my first minister,

252
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,812
whose love and loyalty

253
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:03,568
I have no cause nor reason to doubt.

254
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:08,456
If there is anything
important to be done,

255
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:10,488
I know who best to do it.

256
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,467
Majesty.

257
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:31,389
- Mr. Cromwell!
- Mr. Cromwell, sir!

258
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,226
- Mr. Cromwell!
- Mr. Risley.

259
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,742
- Give it to Mr. Risley
- We're doing our best.

260
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:42,517
We'll do our best for you.
Very good, very good, very good.

261
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:46,071
- Mr. Risley! Thank you sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

262
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,747
- The meeting with the French Ambassador?
- It was...

263
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,645
...very interesting, Your Majesty.

264
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,474
He told me that
the King was not averse to opening

265
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:01,249
secret negotiations with us,

266
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:05,426
with a view to disengaging the French
from their alliance with the Emperor.

267
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,418
Good.

268
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,395
The Ambassador also suggested to me

269
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,315
how much Anglo-French
relations would improve

270
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,522
if Lord Cromwell no longer
stood as an obstacle to them.

271
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,415
Mistress Howard?

272
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:15,179
The King would like
you to accept a gift.

273
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:27,414
It's lovely.

274
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,174
You must thank His Majesty.

275
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:35,695
You can thank him yourself.

276
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:48,664
Your Majesty.

277
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:15,745
Come.

278
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:23,203
Bishop Gardiner.

279
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,700
Just the man we needed.

280
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,370
Now, we may begin.

281
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,738
Gregory? What is it?

282
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,120
It's a boy.

283
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,131
It's a boy. I have a son.

284
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:54,911
Thanks be to God...

285
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:03,523
Prince Edward, Your Majesty.

286
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:11,327
My son.

287
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:14,363
My son.

288
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,422
Gentlemen, I call this council
meeting to order

289
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,432
Cromwell, do not sit there.

290
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:40,726
That is no place for you.
Traitors do not sit among gentlemen.

291
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:42,196
My Lord Cromwell,

292
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,630
you are arrested for treason.

293
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,447
I am no traitor.

294
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,196
I ask you, on your consciences,
am I a traitor?

295
00:28:58,396 --> 00:29:01,613
Yes! Traitor! Traitor!
- Traitor! Traitor!

296
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,992
Traitor! Traitor!
Traitor!

297
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:09,739
I am no traitor!
I am no traitor!

298
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:15,044
I'm no traitor!

299
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:24,697
I'm no traitor!

300
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:43,137
Princess Mary, do sit down.

301
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:46,510
I have some... some news.

302
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,071
Duke Philip has been
sent back to Bavaria.

303
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,553
Your father, the King,

304
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,967
sent him away. I am so sorry.
I cannot explain.

305
00:30:08,394 --> 00:30:09,844
No need to explain.

306
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,060
It is of little matter.

307
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,789
The Duke was charming

308
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,827
but I would never have married him.

309
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:26,173
He is a Lutheran
and I am a Catholic.

310
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,561
My lords, I am come here...

311
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:06,531
to introduce a bill of attainder

312
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:10,589
against Thomas Cromwell
on a charge of treason.

313
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:14,622
Lord Cromwell,

314
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:18,295
whom His Majesty
has raised from a very base

315
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:21,843
and low degree, and enriched
with manifold gifts,

316
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:25,716
is proved to be
a most false and corrupt

317
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,592
traitor and deceiver.

318
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,150
Being a detestable heretic,

319
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:38,104
he has utterly disposed to set

320
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:40,388
and sow common sedition

321
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:43,576
among Your Majesty's
loyal and loving subjects.

322
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,865
As the vice-regent for religion
supposed to oversee reform,

323
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:54,004
Cromwell has, without
His Majesty's knowledge,

324
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:58,461
licensed heretics
to preach and teach.

325
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:00,902
My lords,

326
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,316
we have evidence that
on the night of March the 31st,

327
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:07,446
in the parish of St. Peter the Poor,

328
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:10,335
Lord Cromwell did arrogantly defend

329
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:12,155
these heretic preachers.

330
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:14,932
He said if the King...

331
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:17,829
should turn against reform,

332
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:19,562
he would not turn.

333
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:21,949
And if the King did turn,

334
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:26,028
and all his followers,
then he would stand fighting

335
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:28,940
in the field with his sword
in his hand, against the King

336
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,115
and against all his followers.

337
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:33,992
And he took out
his dagger, and he said,

338
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,262
"Or let this dagger
thrust me to the heart,

339
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:39,540
"if I would not die
for that quarrel.

340
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,067
"And if I should live a year or two,

341
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:44,587
"then it will no longer be
in the King's power

342
00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:48,423
any more to resist or hinder
our reformation. "

343
00:32:48,865 --> 00:32:50,758
And he swore a great oath!

344
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,356
Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

345
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:03,054
Is it true that you loved
this man, Sir Richard?

346
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,274
As a friend.

347
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:07,700
But I chiefly loved him for
the love I thought I saw him bear

348
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,070
towards the King above all others.

349
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,865
But now, if he be a traitor,
then I am sorry

350
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:16,067
that I ever loved him
or trusted him,

351
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:17,885
and I am very glad

352
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:20,814
that his treason is discovered
in time.

353
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,001
Traitor!
Traitor! Justice!

354
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,595
I trust, Madam,
you are happy and well treated?

355
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:46,544
I have no complaints whatsoever.

356
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:51,487
Everywhere I go, I am treated
with great respect

357
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,497
and kindness from everyone.

358
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,679
I'm glad.

359
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,395
You are not eating.

360
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:16,895
Your Majesty...

361
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,502
I... I wondered...

362
00:34:20,676 --> 00:34:24,226
I am sending you away for a
while, to my palace at Richmond.

363
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:27,618
For your health,
and for your pleasure.

364
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:33,683
Thank you, Your Majesty.

365
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:46,656
I have some urgent business
to attend to.

366
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:48,077
Madam.

367
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:03,263
The Council considers it sufficient,
as Head of the Church,

368
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,400
that you can have
the bishops annul your union.

369
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:08,497
But...

370
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,823
it would be more diplomatic

371
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:14,691
if you should find proof that
the marriage was never consummated

372
00:35:15,134 --> 00:35:18,680
and that Your Majesty never
truly consented to it.

373
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:23,216
Send a deputation to Mr. Cromwell.

374
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:26,975
Demand of him written evidence
supporting my annulment.

375
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:30,397
Doubtless he'll remember
how often I spoke to him

376
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:33,180
of how my nature
abhors that woman...

377
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:52,134
Mr. Cromwell.

378
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:53,796
Your Grace.

379
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,456
The King orders that
you write him a letter,

380
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,138
describing how he found
Anne of Cleves,

381
00:35:59,263 --> 00:36:01,594
what passed between you
on that subject,

382
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:04,369
and whether he told you
he had consummated

383
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:07,325
his so-called marriage or not.

384
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:10,964
He also orders you to describe

385
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:13,382
the impediments to the marriage,

386
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:17,003
and whether knowing them
you still arranged it.

387
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:22,257
His Majesty charges that,

388
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,399
as you will answer God
on the dreadful day of judgment,

389
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:31,124
and also upon the extreme danger
and damnation of your soul

390
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:32,499
and conscience,

391
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:36,890
to write down exactly what you know.

392
00:36:38,122 --> 00:36:40,822
I will most gladly do
as the King commands.

393
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,360
I trust to his pleasure
and satisfaction.

394
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:48,576
I desire more than anything else
the King's comfort,

395
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:52,092
and would most willingly die for it.

396
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:58,406
I wondered if you could see
your house from that window?

397
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,584
The fact is, Mr. Cromwell,

398
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,817
that only two hours
after your arrest

399
00:37:10,725 --> 00:37:13,225
the King dispatched
his Treasurer there

400
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,952
to take away your goods.

401
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:21,024
The rabble came out
to cheer them on.

402
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:26,690
It was a pretty sight, I hear.

403
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:32,982
Guard.

404
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:56,817
"Finding Your Majesty not as pleased

405
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,137
"as I trusted to have done,
I was so bold

406
00:37:59,314 --> 00:38:01,664
"to ask you how you liked the Queen.

407
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:03,985
"Your Majesty soberly answered,

408
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:06,699
"As you know, I liked her
not well before,

409
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:09,080
"but now I like her much worse.

410
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:11,648
"I have felt her belly
and her breasts

411
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:14,082
"and thereby, as I can judge,

412
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:16,098
"she should be no maid.

413
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,382
I left her as good a maid
as I found her!"

414
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:25,805
At the end.
What does he say at the end?

415
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:32,786
"I beseech Your Majesty most humbly

416
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,267
"to pardon my rude writing
and to consider that I,

417
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:40,078
"a most woeful prisoner,
am ready to take the death,

418
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:43,993
when it shall please
God and Your Majesty. "

419
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,765
<i>Yet the frail flesh incites me</i>

420
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,259
<i>continually to call
to Your Grace for mercy</i>

421
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,255
<i>and grace for my offences,</i>

422
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:01,388
<i>and thus Christ save,
preserve, and keep you...</i>

423
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:04,919
<i>Written at the Tower this Wednesday,</i>

424
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:09,533
<i>... the last of June with heavy heart
and trembling hand</i>

425
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,160
"of Your Highness' most heavy
and miserable prisoner

426
00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:14,925
and poor slave. "

427
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:19,852
He's written something
right down at the bottom.

428
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:28,515
"Most gracious prince,

429
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:33,340
I cry for mercy, mercy.

430
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:37,726
Mercy. "

431
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,447
Will Your Grace be
on Tower Hill tomorrow?

432
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:19,072
Try to keep me away.

433
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:21,389
I can vouchsafe to Your Grace

434
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:24,949
his final end will be
the most ignominious ever.

435
00:40:25,168 --> 00:40:27,794
So I have heard, Your Grace.
So I have heard.

436
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,481
What is he talking about?
Tell me.

437
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:32,518
Cromwell is set to appear
on the same scaffold

438
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:35,126
as Lord Hungerford...
otherwise known as Mad Walter,

439
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:38,137
who has been sentenced to death
for various offences

440
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:40,589
such as sodomy, raping his daughter,

441
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:44,265
and paying magicians to predict
the date of the King's death.

442
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:47,773
He won't have to pay them
to predict the date of his own.

443
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,140
Then Cromwell will be humiliated.

444
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:56,518
The false churl who was
so ambitious for others' blood!

445
00:40:56,643 --> 00:40:58,950
Ah, that is not our only device.

446
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:02,795
Tom and I have conceived
some more sport

447
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,720
at His Lordship's expense.

448
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:07,816
What kind of sport?

449
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:09,988
Patience Edward.

450
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:12,881
Patience.

451
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:21,373
Let's have another beer.

452
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,520
Sorry, there; I've forgotten
your name, fellow.

453
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:29,089
- What is it again?
- Gurrea, sir.

454
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:33,059
Gurrea. D'you have the pox
or is it gone, 'urrea?

455
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:39,513
It's a big day tomorrow.

456
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:41,836
I ought to be abed.

457
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:45,439
A last pint! I'm paying.

458
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,308
And then let's drink
to old friends, huh?

459
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:54,418
Two more pints, my good man!

460
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:28,615
Master Gurrea,

461
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:32,294
I trust you're feeling
clear-headed this morning.

462
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:45,598
Madam, the Earl of Hartford is come.

463
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:53,117
My lords.

464
00:42:54,553 --> 00:42:57,653
Madam, it is my duty to
inform you that Parliament,

465
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,294
the convocations
of Canterbury and York

466
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:03,533
have found your marriage
to the King to be invalid

467
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:07,841
on the grounds of your
precontract with Lorraine,

468
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:10,482
His Majesty's lack of consent
to the marriage,

469
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,332
and its non-consummation.

470
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:17,998
The marriage is thus declared
null and void,

471
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:20,667
and from henceforth
it is the King's pleasure

472
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:23,042
that you call yourself his sister.

473
00:43:26,928 --> 00:43:28,178
Do you consent?

474
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:35,715
In which case,
I can tell you that the King

475
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,917
has settled upon you
a handsome annuity

476
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,842
of 4,000 pounds per annum,

477
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:42,816
as well as the manors
of Bletchingly and Richmond,

478
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:45,867
and also Hever Castle, so long
as you remain in England.

479
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:50,914
And since His Majesty confirms
that you are still a maid,

480
00:43:51,906 --> 00:43:54,356
you are free to marry
whom you choose.

481
00:43:57,859 --> 00:43:58,859
Please...

482
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:02,248
tell the King that...

483
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:09,098
I hope I will sometimes
have the pleasure

484
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:11,073
of his most noble presence,

485
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:14,853
and beseech the Almighty to send
him long life

486
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,930
and good health.

487
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:32,007
Oh, my Lady.

488
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:36,896
Father!

489
00:45:05,764 --> 00:45:06,864
Good people,

490
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,167
I am come here to die,

491
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:18,607
and not to purge myself,
as some may think I should.

492
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:24,190
I am by law condemned to die
and I thank my Lord God

493
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:26,993
that has granted me
this death for my offence.

494
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:30,169
For since I came of age
I have lived as a sinner

495
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:32,990
and offended my Lord God,

496
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:35,101
for which I ask Him heartily
for forgiveness.

497
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:38,437
Get it over with! For Christ's
sake, get it over with!

498
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:44,536
I have also offended my Prince,

499
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,795
for which I ask him hearty amnesty.

500
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:55,407
I heartily desire you to pray
for the King's Grace

501
00:45:56,881 --> 00:46:00,431
and that he may long live with
you in health and prosperity.

502
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,450
and that after him his son,
Prince Edward,

503
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:07,275
may long reign over you.

504
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:13,985
There it is.

505
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,359
Nonsuch Palace.

506
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:23,065
My Fool told me it didn't exist.

507
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:40,411
Gentlemen,

508
00:46:40,893 --> 00:46:43,243
you should all take warning from me,

509
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:46,197
who was, as you know, from
a poor man made by the Prince

510
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,550
into a great gentleman and that I,

511
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:52,154
I not contented with that,
not with having the kingdom

512
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:53,429
at my orders,

513
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:56,349
presumed to a still higher state.

514
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:04,007
My pride has brought its punishment.

515
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:19,203
Lord, grant me that when these
eyes shall lose their use,

516
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:21,528
the eyes of my soul may see Thee.

517
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:26,330
God Lord and father, that when
this mouth shall lose his use...

518
00:47:26,455 --> 00:47:27,380
Kill him!

519
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:29,119
... that my heart
will say unto Thee:

520
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:31,857
Father, into your hands
I commend my spirit.

521
00:47:32,594 --> 00:47:34,611
Come on now!
Take his head off!

522
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,432
Pray for the Prince

523
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:42,083
and for the Lords of the Council

524
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:45,742
and for the clergy
and for the people.

525
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:50,289
Now I beg you again that
you will pray for me.

526
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:54,444
Pray, if possible, cut off
the head with one blow...

527
00:47:57,462 --> 00:47:59,312
that I may not suffer much.

528
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:07,945
Chop it off!

529
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:11,349
Your Majesty.
