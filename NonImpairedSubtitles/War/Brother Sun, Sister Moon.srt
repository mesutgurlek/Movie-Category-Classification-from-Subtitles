1
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,290
François!

2
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,628
Francesco!

3
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,167
François?

4
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:05,270
François. François.

5
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:07,435
He's ill!

6
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,239
What's happened to
you? Speak to me.

7
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,576
He's come back from the war
because he's ill.

8
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,913
He's not a coward! He...

9
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:16,713
- My dear son.
- Come on!

10
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:18,879
Come, come.

11
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:10,395
Francesco, please!

12
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,093
Come on!

13
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,567
We've been riding
all night, too.

14
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,298
- All night?
- Yeah, on a girl,

15
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:17,862
not on a horse.

16
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,566
And tomorrow,
we'll be riding to battle.

17
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,802
We must be mad.

18
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,377
Is it true
if we win the battle,

19
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,707
we get all the girls we want?

20
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,543
Of course!
That's what wars are made for.

21
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:27,048
Kill the enemy
and get the ladies!

22
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,016
It's getting late.

23
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,053
Let's go home and prepare.

24
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,621
Wars are serious business.

25
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,122
Such profundity, Bernardo.

26
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,056
Why?

27
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,722
Why?

28
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,094
Bernardo.

29
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,699
What a pity.

30
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:50,795
It's over.

31
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,842
Yes. It's a pity...

32
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,210
but I hope we'll live to see
another dawn like this.

33
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,314
The last night of our youth.

34
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,458
Do you realize that?

35
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:15,555
We tried so desperately
to make it never end.

36
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,394
We should've stopped the sun
from rising.

37
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,236
Come on, Francesco!

38
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,364
Wait!

39
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,574
Leave me alone.

40
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,810
Please.

41
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,331
Brothers!

42
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,339
Brothers!

43
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:52,785
Lepers.

44
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:57,831
Yes. Lepers.

45
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:00,463
No!

46
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,335
I don't want to feed them!

47
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,203
Get them off!

48
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,838
No, no,
no, no, no...

49
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,073
No, no, no, no, no!

50
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,583
Oh... you're not dressed yet?

51
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,518
What have you been doing
up until now, eh?

52
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,852
Pica. Pica!

53
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:29,864
Will you please stop
all this sissified nonsense?

54
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,399
The boy's going off to war.

55
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,332
Besides, I don't understand
a damned word.

56
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,300
Why do you two always want

57
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,360
to leave me out of everything?

58
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,270
Don't speak French
when I'm around.

59
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:39,273
How many times...

60
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,503
If you wanted a wife
who speaks like you,

61
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:42,635
why didn't you marry

62
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,111
some thick-headed
butcher's daughter?

63
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,147
Bravo, François, bravo.

64
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,215
Forgive me, Father.

65
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:55,788
Forgive me, Father.

66
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,019
Hey, wait, we must talk.

67
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:00,028
What shall we do with
all the money we'll make

68
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:01,028
out of this war?

69
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:02,530
Have you thought of that?

70
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:05,066
Ah... I see.

71
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,832
A true son of his father,
eh, Pica?

72
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,066
We are going to be late
for mass, Monsignor.

73
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,439
Ah, they'll wait.

74
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,444
Listen, Francesco...
out of the way, out of the way.

75
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,343
Francesco, w-when you're
in Perugia,

76
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,349
don't forget Ugoni's storerooms
behind the marketplace,

77
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,282
near the main tower.

78
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,478
He's as rich as the pope.

79
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:25,521
There's everything there.

80
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,987
Yes, yes, leave it to me.

81
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,182
Ooh, and Francesco.

82
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,485
What else?

83
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,618
Remember the triptych I told you
about for the cathedral?

84
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:32,854
It'll save us a fortune
in indulgences.

85
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,019
Yes.

86
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:50,137
Yes, war is beautiful.

87
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:15,504
This is my death mask.

88
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,766
Go forth, sons of Assisi.

89
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,461
God is with you!

90
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,882
Francesco!

91
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,258
Francesco!

92
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,869
Francesco!

93
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:41,201
Flowers in the
meadow softly sway

94
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:48,206
And all the little birds
sing merry May Day

95
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:53,415
Rabbits in the orchard
sport and play

96
00:12:53,489 --> 00:13:00,486
And all the little creatures
smile and are gay

97
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:06,024
My little boy,
sing out your joy

98
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:10,367
I am near, my dear

99
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:13,499
My darling, do not fear

100
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:16,704
Love is all around you

101
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:26,722
Comforting with gentle lullaby
to make your heart sing.

102
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,031
What's he doing up there?

103
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:56,627
Oh, that's Bernardone's son.

104
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,810
Francesco!

105
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,180
Get down.

106
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,155
Francesco!

107
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,390
Francesco!

108
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,484
Francesco.

109
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,854
Francesco, what is it?

110
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:19,493
Francesco, my sweet, Francesco,

111
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:20,967
what's happening to you, eh?

112
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:23,971
You can tell me.

113
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,836
We've always understood
each other.

114
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:28,843
We...

115
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:32,540
We've always
been close, you and...

116
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:38,845
Let me help you, my darling.

117
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:09,445
Well, sit down, sit down.

118
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:10,779
Take a drink.

119
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:13,116
Yes, business is booming.

120
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,985
Life's back to normal at last.

121
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,614
Yeah, talking about business,

122
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,625
I have some fine stuff
to show you

123
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,787
that you won't find
anywhere but here.

124
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,557
Well, not anymore, that is.

125
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:23,791
Look at this tapestry.

126
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,059
It comes from Provence.

127
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,623
That's beautiful, isn't it?

128
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:28,465
Feel the texture
of this material.

129
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,506
Now, I'd like you to compare
this with one from Venice.

130
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,064
Ah! This one here.

131
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:34,802
Look at your hands.

132
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,810
Look at your hands!

133
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,140
Forgive me.

134
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,681
If I find one finger mark
on any of my silks,

135
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,149
I'll beat you
till you're black and blue,

136
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,152
you dirty little pig!

137
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,517
Ah!

138
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:49,250
These servants are
just like animals.

139
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,315
How's your son? Better now?

140
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,724
Oh, yes, thank God.

141
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:56,025
He's cost me a fortune
in masses to our blessed Mary,

142
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,656
but the worst is over now.

143
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,825
Now, there we are.

144
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,026
Oh, he's begun to get up,

145
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:02,764
and one of these Sundays,
you'll see him with us at mass.

146
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:03,770
Yes, please, please.

147
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,897
Take it into the light.

148
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,995
Do you remember me?

149
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,540
I'm Clare.

150
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:29,081
People say you're mad.

151
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,988
Do you know that?

152
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:37,355
When you went off to war,

153
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:41,334
they said you were fine
and intelligent.

154
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:44,895
But now you're mad, because...

155
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:48,170
because you sing like the birds,

156
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:53,806
and you chase after butterflies,
and...

157
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,941
and you-you look at flowers.

158
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:05,593
I think you were mad before,
not now.

159
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,024
Am I disturbing you?
I'll go...

160
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:22,507
You see?

161
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,306
He talks with her.

162
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,212
Thanks be to God.

163
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:29,113
That's obviously what
was wrong with him.

164
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,674
The boy needed a woman, eh?

165
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:31,719
Oh.

166
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:34,914
You look at things
so clumsily, Monsignor.

167
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,458
His heart is waking.

168
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:38,959
Well, you can call
it what you like,

169
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:41,120
but if you ask me,
that lad's after a woman.

170
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,790
That's why he's been
acting strangely.

171
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:47,357
What a lovely creature Clare is.

172
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,630
Hmm. Not much
of a catch, though.

173
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:51,569
Her father won't even
give enough dowry

174
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,629
to pay for a wedding.

175
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,197
Still, if that's what
Francesco wants,

176
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:56,267
we'll find enough money for
both of them, hey, Pica?

177
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:57,743
And you know what?

178
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:58,608
Yes.

179
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,045
I'm going to put him
to work again.

180
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:01,139
But...

181
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,343
No buts. You've mollycoddled him
long enough.

182
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,680
- But, Monsignor...
- Shh, shh, shh.

183
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,278
Besides, Francesco's always
been very good at business.

184
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:08,379
He likes it.

185
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,980
He does.

186
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,286
He takes after me.

187
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,417
Always has done.

188
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,896
Come, come.
You shall see.

189
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:22,937
I followed your advice,
Francesco,

190
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:24,232
to the very letter.

191
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:27,673
I bought and bought and...
and bought.

192
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:30,905
And now, we prosper.

193
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,277
Oh, I may curse the war
for having given you this,

194
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:36,579
uh, this fever,
but-but for business,

195
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:38,642
it was a blessing.

196
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,752
Come, come.

197
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:42,983
You shall see.

198
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,625
What you're going to see now

199
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:48,754
will send the blood
coursing through your veins.

200
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:50,660
Better than all those
potions and medicines

201
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:53,599
the women give you.

202
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:54,862
Eh?

203
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,665
Go, go.

204
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,300
Look at that, eh, Francesco?

205
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,877
Look.

206
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,640
You see this? See?

207
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,910
And to think people
speak badly of war.

208
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,650
Come, come.
I'll show you.

209
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:16,354
You know how it started,
eh, Francesco?

210
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:18,221
With the war supplies.

211
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:19,385
And then, after the war,

212
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,189
the soldiers came
to sell their loot.

213
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:23,526
And then the wights who'd been
looted by the soldiers

214
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:25,122
came selling whatever
they had left

215
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,325
in order to rebuild,

216
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,527
practically giving
away things for nothing.

217
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:30,161
I'll show you,
I'll show you.

218
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,365
Look at these.

219
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:34,704
Look.

220
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:37,710
Francesco, see these, huh?

221
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:40,145
Family heirlooms, hmm?

222
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,183
Titled people.

223
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:44,081
On their knees, they were.

224
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,551
Cost me less than nothing.

225
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:49,453
And this is not all.
It's just the beginning.

226
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,014
And there's so much more
than that.

227
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,584
Now we have enough money
to manufacture and sell

228
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:56,756
with nearly 200 workers...
dyers, weavers.

229
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:58,025
Well, see for yourself.

230
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,862
It belongs to you, too,
Francesco.

231
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:00,958
Don't forget that.

232
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,969
God bless the master
of this house

233
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,377
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo

234
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,813
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay

235
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,909
Now milady, lady of

236
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,051
He be handsome, she be fair

237
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:24,182
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay

238
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:26,853
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay

239
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:29,556
Bring them buttons
and bells and bows...

240
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,529
A penny a rhyme
will do me fine

241
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:39,869
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo

242
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,739
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay

243
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,745
Tuppence a rhyme,
I told you so...

244
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,020
God bless the master
of this house

245
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,923
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo

246
00:27:57,992 --> 00:28:00,256
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay...

247
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:27,639
Yes. Yes.

248
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:58,335
He invited them, if you please,
out for a stroll,

249
00:30:58,406 --> 00:30:59,873
just like that.

250
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:01,532
He simply led them
into the sunshine,

251
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:04,612
and they sat there
all afternoon.

252
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,613
Nobody did a stroke of work.

253
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:07,705
Oh.

254
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,850
And that-that... that simpleton,

255
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:12,716
that-that idiot boy...
he just... he just looked on.

256
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,516
He doesn't get it from me.

257
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,216
There's never been
a history of insanity

258
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,121
in my side of the family.

259
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,524
I've had enough of
your high and mighty ways.

260
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:24,690
You're not in noble
Provence now, madam,

261
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,131
and you'll not play the
great lady in my house!

262
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:29,260
You've ruined that boy!

263
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,338
You've pampered him
and spoiled him

264
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:34,239
with your Frenchified
airs and graces.

265
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,402
He's nothing more
than a cringing idiot.

266
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,604
Something's got to be done,
for God's sake,

267
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,910
but not by you!

268
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,419
You are a stupid, thick-headed,
vulgar animal,

269
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,817
that's what you are.

270
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,256
Don't you understand
what Francesco needs?

271
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,897
He's desperate.

272
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,625
Oh, Jesus, when I think
of my own youth,

273
00:31:58,733 --> 00:31:59,995
I feel like flaying him alive.

274
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,069
That's typical of you.
Treat him like...

275
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,628
like one... like one of
your clerks who comes to you

276
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,002
whenever you stamp.

277
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:12,312
But, but, but Francesco's
not like that, Monsignor.

278
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,712
- No?
- No, no.

279
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,247
And what's more,

280
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:17,614
all the fathers and
mothers of Assisi

281
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,552
envy us such a son.

282
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:24,319
So... so sensitive,
so intelligent.

283
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:25,791
Ah.

284
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:32,328
This is the, uh,
envy of Assisi, huh?

285
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,201
Now you've gone far enough!

286
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,401
No, Monsignor.

287
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:43,637
No son of mine,

288
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,339
do you understand,
however mad,

289
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:48,006
is gonna behave like this.

290
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,073
Have you no respect for me,
huh?!

291
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:55,316
You will obey me in everything!

292
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,759
And if you do not,
I will crush you

293
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:02,352
- within an inch of your life!
- No!

294
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,658
Is that clear?

295
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,426
Is that understood?

296
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,628
And... And starting
tomorrow morning,

297
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,228
you'll come with us to mass,

298
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:15,969
even if I have to drag
you there like a dog!

299
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,978
Come on, sit up.

300
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:16,920
No!

301
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,897
No!

302
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,157
No...

303
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,673
No.

304
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:02,108
It's... It's mine!

305
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:04,782
This one.

306
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,046
All of it!

307
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,052
And this.

308
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:08,179
Out of the way!

309
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:09,620
Where is he?
Where is he?!

310
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,588
It will never make you happy!

311
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,218
Throw it all away!

312
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:15,592
Burn it, my brothers,
all of it.

313
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,533
You...

314
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:23,934
But he doesn't realize

315
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,369
what he's doing, Monsignor.

316
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,100
Be patient.

317
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,607
Father...

318
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,270
Father, I want
to share my joy with you.

319
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,313
Our treasures are
in Heaven, Father,

320
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,472
not here on Earth.

321
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:36,209
Don't be a slave to these.

322
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:37,614
Throw it all away.

323
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,820
Do as I do.

324
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,878
It's so simple.

325
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:43,287
Be free.

326
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:45,816
Father... no...

327
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,622
No!

328
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:56,661
Oh! Stop it!

329
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,499
Stop it!

330
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:01,438
You lunatic!

331
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:07,511
No. No, my brothers.

332
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:09,481
Don't touch that.

333
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,916
Throw it into the gutter.

334
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:14,784
Throw it all away!

335
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:17,585
It will only make you miserable.

336
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,626
Look at my poor father.

337
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,183
Quiet, you idiot.

338
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:24,130
Call the guards.

339
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:25,495
See how he struggles.

340
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:30,136
I want to see him hang
in the public square!

341
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:31,796
It's Pietro di Bernardone.

342
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:33,066
His son's gone mad.

343
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,835
What is all this commotion?

344
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,843
Di Bernardone's son,
he's gone berserk.

345
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,845
Has he only
found that out now?

346
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,507
Oh, anyway, you'd
better alert the guards.

347
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:45,608
He's out of his mind.

348
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:57,723
What's the matter
with you, Bernardone?

349
00:41:57,798 --> 00:41:59,493
Have you gone
mad as well?

350
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:03,264
I want justice,
and I want it here, now,

351
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:05,532
in front of all Assisi.

352
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,336
Well, it would be helpful
to know the charge.

353
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:11,276
What has the justice
of men to do with me?

354
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:12,812
God is my only judge.

355
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,873
Well, unfortunately, He isn't
around to help us out.

356
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:20,886
Why not go to Bishop Guido, hmm?

357
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:25,151
Do you think I'm going
to interrupt my meal

358
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:27,693
because of some sordid
family squabble?

359
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:28,750
What heresy.

360
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:29,886
Your Grace...

361
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,157
Oh, tell them I'm out.

362
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:32,789
Say I'm praying or something.

363
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,663
But the whole town
is down there.

364
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:36,633
They insist that
the church intervene.

365
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:38,467
It's becoming
an outrageous scandal.

366
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:39,539
I really believe...

367
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:40,631
Guards!

368
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,168
I've only just got over Lent,

369
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:46,712
and here you all are
imposing another on me.

370
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,678
But, Your Grace...

371
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,875
Have it kept hot.

372
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,247
God's teeth!

373
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,685
Can a man not be left alone
to dine in peace

374
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:56,016
in his own home?

375
00:42:58,926 --> 00:43:01,861
The bishop's coming.

376
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:04,728
Pietro di Bernardone,

377
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:05,856
this will not do.

378
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:09,130
How dare you disturb us
when we are in the middle

379
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:10,568
of saying our office.

380
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:12,128
What's the matter with you, man?

381
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:13,434
Have you lost your senses?

382
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,532
It's not my fault, Your Grace.

383
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:17,668
It's him...
that lunatic there.

384
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,616
Yes...

385
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,085
it's me.

386
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,424
My soul is in your hands.

387
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,526
What?

388
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,034
Are you trying to cause trouble?

389
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:43,763
Is that what
you're trying to do?

390
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:45,998
Is this some damned plot
to rob the church

391
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,370
of its authority?

392
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:50,672
That's nothing to what
he's done to me, Your Grace.

393
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:53,006
I mean, God only knows,
I've always given him the best.

394
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,411
I, I, I brought him up.

395
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:55,914
I, I... I clothed him.

396
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:56,813
I...

397
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,476
I mean, you ask anyone.

398
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,746
They'll tell you.

399
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,447
He's never wanted for anything

400
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:02,921
since the day he was born.

401
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,252
But today,

402
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:07,351
he threw all my belongings
out of the window!

403
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:09,589
And he even opened
my strongbox!

404
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:11,221
Oh!

405
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:12,959
Thrown to a mob of cutthroats
like himself

406
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:13,965
down in the street.

407
00:44:17,037 --> 00:44:21,406
Years of hard work
and self-sacrifice

408
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:25,172
just... just tossed away.

409
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:36,052
Then what is the answer
to these accusations?

410
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:38,819
Surely you are sufficiently
intelligent

411
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:41,452
to understand
that Holy Mother Church

412
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:45,965
must punish those who subvert
the established order.

413
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:49,799
A man such as you is a...
is a menace to society.

414
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,804
He's either criminal or...

415
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:54,067
Or someone seeking the light.

416
00:44:57,478 --> 00:45:01,039
Someone in darkness.

417
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,481
I was in darkness.

418
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,919
But Brother Sun
illuminated my soul.

419
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:13,858
And now,
I can see so clearly.

420
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:17,226
Just as you did the day
you chose the sacred vestments

421
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,559
you are wearing now.

422
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:26,797
Are you seeking holy orders?

423
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,508
Me?

424
00:45:30,577 --> 00:45:33,637
No. No.

425
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:36,147
I'm not worthy.

426
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:39,652
Then what do you want?

427
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:45,589
I want to be... to be happy.

428
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,789
I want to live like
the birds in the sky.

429
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,195
I want to experience
the freedom and the purity

430
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,461
that they experience.

431
00:45:54,535 --> 00:45:56,503
The rest is of no use to me.

432
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:00,003
No use.

433
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:01,938
Believe me.

434
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,978
If the purpose of life
is this loveless toil

435
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:07,605
we fill our days with,
then it's not for me.

436
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:10,080
There must be something better.

437
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,744
There has to be.

438
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,754
Man is...

439
00:46:14,822 --> 00:46:16,813
is a spirit.

440
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,619
He has a soul.

441
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:22,024
And that, that is what
I want to recapture...

442
00:46:22,095 --> 00:46:23,289
my soul.

443
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:27,623
I want to live.

444
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,965
I want to live in the fields.

445
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,504
Stride over hills.

446
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:34,302
Climb trees, swim rivers.

447
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,969
I want to feel the firm grasp
of the earth beneath my feet

448
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,606
without shoes,
without possessions.

449
00:46:41,682 --> 00:46:45,174
Without those shadows
we call our servants.

450
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,984
I want to be a beggar.

451
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:49,988
Yes.

452
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,651
Yes, a beggar.

453
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,320
Christ was a beggar,

454
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,330
and his holy apostles
were beggars.

455
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,593
I want to be as,
as free as they are.

456
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:01,895
But, Your Grace,

457
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,437
even beggars show respect
for their fathers.

458
00:47:06,673 --> 00:47:08,971
I'm not your son anymore.

459
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,010
What?

460
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:15,310
What is born
of the flesh is flesh.

461
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:23,547
What is born
of the Spirit is spirit.

462
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:27,960
I now...

463
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,620
am born again.

464
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:21,572
Father, I give you back
everything that belongs to you:

465
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,617
Your clothes...

466
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,209
your possessions.

467
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,989
Your name, too.

468
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,303
There are no more fathers.

469
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,941
There are no more sons.

470
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,141
And everyone who has left
houses, or brothers,

471
00:48:56,216 --> 00:49:00,880
or sisters,
or fathers, or mothers,

472
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:02,353
or children,

473
00:49:02,422 --> 00:49:04,515
or fields,

474
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:06,752
for the sake
of our heavenly Father

475
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:10,194
will receive a hundred times
more in the life to come.

476
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:12,560
Cover him.

477
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,498
Cover him up.

478
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:06,302
Hey, come and see!

479
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:10,536
Look at the crusader.

480
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:32,287
Bernardo di Quintavalle?

481
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:34,628
Welcome.

482
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:36,931
Welcome home.

483
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,938
As I am presenting
the keys of the city

484
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:49,948
to the emperor,
it would hardly be

485
00:52:50,016 --> 00:52:51,847
very bright of me
to present them

486
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,317
from the rear, would it?

487
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:55,684
Besides, this is not
a religious ceremony.

488
00:52:56,723 --> 00:52:57,951
My dear governor,

489
00:52:58,058 --> 00:52:59,821
Otto of Brunswick
is going to Rome

490
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:01,884
to be crowned emperor
by His Holiness.

491
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:03,860
How can you possibly say

492
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,421
this is not
a religious ceremony?

493
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:10,435
God moves in mysterious
ways, my dear secretary,

494
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:13,836
and He has arranged,
on this occasion,

495
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:15,807
that I move forward.

496
00:53:15,876 --> 00:53:18,106
Ah! This is...

497
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:19,803
pure blasphemy!

498
00:53:19,913 --> 00:53:21,437
What? Do you suggest you are

499
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:24,176
in direct communication
with the Word of God?!

500
00:53:33,693 --> 00:53:34,751
Sylvestro.

501
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:36,328
Come here, Sylvestro.

502
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:37,589
Paolo.

503
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:40,633
Something really
marvelous has happened.

504
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:41,599
Guess what.

505
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:42,600
What?

506
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:43,658
Bernardo's back.

507
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:46,870
Yes! He rode in
through the gates

508
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,929
half an hour ago.

509
00:53:48,008 --> 00:53:49,942
He looks... fantastic.

510
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,272
Yes.

511
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:53,335
...and I will make
the speech of welcome.

512
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,280
Let's not discuss it further.

513
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,942
Everyone will have
his assigned place.

514
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,883
But, but you are here.

515
00:53:59,953 --> 00:54:00,885
Mm-hmm.

516
00:54:00,954 --> 00:54:02,581
Streets ahead of me.

517
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:06,990
He couldn't have arrived
at a more appropriate time.

518
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,550
Let's meet tonight
and celebrate.

519
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:09,925
Giocondo, you arrange it.

520
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,928
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

521
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,899
Hey! Bernardo!

522
00:54:22,976 --> 00:54:25,171
How do you like your chicken?

523
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:28,178
Leg? Or breast?

524
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,310
The only one of us
that's stayed the same.

525
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:33,317
It's all show.

526
00:54:33,386 --> 00:54:34,910
He's trying to go
back to his youth.

527
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:36,853
Why else would he
choose this place

528
00:54:36,923 --> 00:54:39,357
to celebrate your return
from the crusade?

529
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:45,590
Crusades are nothing
to sing about, I assure you.

530
00:54:45,665 --> 00:54:48,259
Oh, come on, Bernardo,
you're, you're famous.

531
00:54:48,335 --> 00:54:49,597
You're a war hero.

532
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:52,934
I say, you must have slaughtered
thousands of Muslims.

533
00:54:53,006 --> 00:54:53,995
What?

534
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:55,541
How many, at a rough guess,

535
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:57,303
would you say that you killed?

536
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:00,377
Too many.

537
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:02,381
Oh.

538
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:03,882
Where's Francesco?

539
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:06,214
Oh, uh...

540
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:08,413
He doesn't live in Assisi
anymore, Bernardo.

541
00:55:08,488 --> 00:55:09,546
I gathered that, but...

542
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:10,850
What's happening?

543
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:12,323
Where is Francesco?

544
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,225
Oh, you're not still talking
about him, are you?

545
00:55:15,295 --> 00:55:17,229
We told you, he's mad.

546
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:18,389
What do you mean, he's mad?

547
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:20,092
Don't take any notice
of him, Bernardo.

548
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:21,133
He's pissed, as usual.

549
00:55:22,802 --> 00:55:24,895
But Francesco isn't mad,
is he, Paolo?

550
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:25,903
No.

551
00:55:25,972 --> 00:55:27,940
He's not mad.
He's... He's changed.

552
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:28,975
He is mad.

553
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:31,237
A raving bloody lunatic.

554
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:33,973
Only a lunatic will believe
that God Himself

555
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:36,572
had come down from heaven
to talk to him.

556
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:37,946
Right?

557
00:55:38,018 --> 00:55:40,578
Listen, God has spoken
to lots of people sometimes.

558
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:41,915
How interesting.

559
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:44,286
And I suppose you think
that God personally decided

560
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:45,517
that San Damiano should be

561
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,583
the first church
in His rebuilding program.

562
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:50,822
San Damiano...? Rebuil...?

563
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:54,993
Is that where he's living?

564
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:56,626
Well, y-yes, I, I suppose so.

565
00:56:01,808 --> 00:56:03,105
Is he all right?

566
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:08,341
Surely... Surely to God
one of you went along

567
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:09,541
to-to see him,

568
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:13,107
speak to him.

569
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:15,746
You must have done something.

570
00:56:15,822 --> 00:56:18,552
Look, he...

571
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,388
He is our oldest...

572
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:24,989
...and dearest friend.

573
00:56:30,837 --> 00:56:33,362
He might need our help,
for God's sake.

574
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,898
Bernardo, listen to me,
not Giocondo, he's drunk.

575
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,171
Francesco's not mad.

576
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:40,837
Maybe he's very sane indeed.

577
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,939
But you are a hero
of the crusades.

578
00:56:43,016 --> 00:56:44,984
You can't afford
to have your name

579
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:46,245
associated with his.

580
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,411
- What?!
- None of us can.

581
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:54,593
Francesco's been a great
friend to us all, but...

582
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,824
quite simply, we have
nothing in common anymore.
