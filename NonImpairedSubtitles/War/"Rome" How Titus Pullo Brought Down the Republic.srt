How Titus Pullo Brought Down
the Republic

2
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:45,876
Three more gone this morning.

3
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,189
Outcasts and idiots.

4
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:52,276
They all get restless.

5
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:55,334
With the fighting done,
they want to be home with money in their pockets,

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,348
not sitting in this dismal cold and wet.

7
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:00,501
None of the good men have run.

8
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:01,422
Nor will they.

9
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,306
Nor will they follow you to Rome.

10
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:05,525
Not yet.

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,692
Time is running out.

12
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:11,057
We cannot wait here forever.

13
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:14,634
This is a very precarious position.

14
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,968
What happens in January*
when your term runs out

15
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:18,969
* Roman magistrates' office begin in January.
That's why this month became the first of the year:
before the reforme in 133 b.C., the first month of the year was March,
cause it was the begining of the war season.

16
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,734
and we're still sitting here ?

17
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:27,926
The business of motivating men to fight
is a tricky matter, Posca.

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,006
I would not expect a slave to understand the subtleties.

19
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,966
I trust an education in these subtleties will begin shortly.

20
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:42,379
500000 ?
What's this ?

21
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,834
I put Mark Antony up for election
as people's tribune.

22
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,482
There were a lot of votes needed buying.

23
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,676
Mark Antony for people's tribune ?

24
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,180
But he is...

25
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,243
You may speak.

26
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:58,267
I had understood the tribune to be a sacred office

27
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:00,401
with the power of veto over the Senate.

28
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:01,164
So it is.

29
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:04,290
An office of great dignity and seriousness.

30
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,970
Perhaps you're right.

31
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:11,296
We shall send Strabo along to
make sure Antony behaves himself.

32
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,193
How far now ?

33
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,434
Three hours at pace.

34
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,346
Ah-Hi !
Here I come, girls.

35
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,894
I'm going to drink all the wine, smoke all the smoke*

36
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:33,969
* Of course, Pullo doesn't talk about tabaco, still unknown in Europe,
but about eucalyptus, pear or other plants (pipe and rolled leaves).

37
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,266
and fuck every whore in the city.

38
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:38,512
Show some dignity.
You're under the standard.

39
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:38,752
Well, talk to him.

40
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,274
He's not under the standard.

41
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,196
Three hours away from a wife
he hasn't seen in eight years.

42
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,334
- The man's terrified.
- Surely a reunion is a happy event.

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,962
- Talk of something else.
- Terrified.

44
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:55,067
What if she's lost her teeth ?
What if she's gotten skinny ?

45
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:57,170
What if she's been letting
other men between her legs ?

46
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:57,708
Silence !

47
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:27,245
Long live, you Mark Antony !
Mark Antony, our protector !

48
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,461
They love him, eh ?

49
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,541
No matter.

50
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:37,992
We are all men of substance.

51
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:41,215
Let them have the love of the plebs and the proles*.

52
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:41,216
* Pleb (people) is the opposite of the patriciate (the aristocracy).
Proles are, among the plebs, the ones who own nothing but their children.

53
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,200
This won't take long, will it ?

54
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,300
We can hope, dominus. *

55
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:55,301
* Dominus = Master

56
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,467
- Vorenus, you may dismiss the men.
- Sir.

57
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:01,300
And then you may dismiss yourself until I send for you.

58
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,273
Have some fun.

59
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,521
But first, take the boy back to Atia.

60
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,351
Get your reward, eh ?

61
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,717
Boy, tell your lovely mother I will see her later.

62
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:14,797
Let's get this over with.

63
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,779
You, leave this house this moment.

64
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,100
I will not.
Octavia is my rightful wife.

65
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:36,860
You defy Caesar ?

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,243
A fig for Caesar !

67
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,834
By the five Furies,
if I were not a genteel woman,

68
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:44,400
I would have you flayed and
hung from a bracket at the door !

69
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,968
- Castor ?
- Domina ?*

70
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:45,969
*Domina = Mistresse

71
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:46,907
Fetch the dogs !

72
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,040
Insolent wretch !

73
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,968
I tell you, my honey,
you are well rid of that one.

74
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:57,669
I hate you.

75
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,843
I hate you ! I hate you !

76
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,154
Silly girl.

77
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,130
I'm only trying to do my best for her.
Why can't she see that ?

78
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,130
She is young.

79
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,348
- Master Octavian !
- Baby boy !

80
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,395
My poor rabbit !

81
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,219
So thin.

82
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,016
Was it very horrible ?

83
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,868
Of course it was, I can't even imagine.

84
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,467
We shan't even talk about it.

85
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,968
We should just put it totally out of our minds.

86
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,901
You're back safe at home now.

87
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,467
But who are those ?

88
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:45,801
You are to be very good to them, mother.

89
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,234
They are particular friends of mine.

90
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,734
Friends ?
In what particular ?

91
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,968
These are the men that took me from captivity.

92
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:56,033
First spear centurion Lucius Vorenus.

93
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,435
And legionary Titus Pullo.

94
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:03,033
So, we embrace you.

95
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,200
Good fearsome specimens you are.

96
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:08,067
I wonder it took you so long to subdue
those odious Gauls.

97
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,000
There was a great many of them... ma'am.

98
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,814
Great many...
Very good.

99
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,267
We'll be away then, sir.

100
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,787
But you must be rewarded before you go.

101
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,601
- Castor, bring me my purse.
- That won't be necessary.

102
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,567
Will it not ?
I don't want to break any regulations...

103
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,100
They shall stay and eat, mother.

104
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,000
Of course ! There shall be bread
and meat put out in the kitchen.

105
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:25,240
I mean, they shall eat with us.

106
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:28,634
Obliged, sir, but I must go to my wife.

107
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:32,167
Your wife has waited eight years.
She can wait a little longer.

108
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,133
Caesar has given them honorary horses,

109
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,867
and they ride with the standard.

110
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,838
It's perfectly acceptable to eat with them.

111
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:39,817
Splendid idea.

112
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:44,767
It's symbolic.
We shall all dine together as equals.

113
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,400
- What's that ?
- Oh, it's just your sister.

114
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,701
- Is she all right ?
- Women's troubles.

115
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:56,968
Nothing a good leeching won't cure.

116
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,182
Jupiter Fulgor*, we ask you to guide

117
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:08,183
* Jupiter Fulgor = Jupiter who throws lightening

118
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:08,543
and protect this man,

119
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,646
Marcus Antonius, newly elected tribune of plebs,

120
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,311
champion of the people.

121
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:17,921
How many dead altogether ?

122
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:22,245
I don't know.
I lost count ages ago.

123
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,300
Lots though.

124
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,576
And you, Lucius ?

125
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,366
309 fighting men.

126
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:28,637
I don't keep count on civilians.

127
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,662
You're very exact.

128
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:30,919
The war temple requires

129
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,813
an exact number when you make an offering.

130
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,106
That's a lot of wine and goats.

131
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:39,667
The priests offer a discount when you pass 100.

132
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:40,308
Priests !

133
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:41,695
Crooks, many of them !

134
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,275
I just talk direct to whatever god
I'm doing business with.

135
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:45,494
Bugger the priests !

136
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:50,181
Too few people can be bothered to do things
the proper, all-Roman way.

137
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,534
- I commend you, Lucius.
- Vorenus is a strict Catonian.

138
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,367
Believe in the divinity of the republic.

139
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:57,952
If Cato believes the same, then...

140
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,984
I suppose I am a Catonian.

141
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:02,311
But Cato represents the rights of the nobility.

142
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,694
Surely a plebian like yourself would like
to see some changes made.

143
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:09,498
It should remain as it was
at the founding of the republic*.

144
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:09,499
* Kings were droven away in 509 b.C,
250 years after the legendary foundation of the city by Romulus.

145
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:10,618
Why should that change ?

146
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,260
Because the Roman people are suffering.

147
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,253
Because slaves have taken all the work.

148
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,639
Because nobles have taken all the land,

149
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,488
and the streets are full of the homeless and the starving.

150
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, I had no idea my son was such a firebrand.

151
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,200
The nobles say that Caesar is a war criminal.

152
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,434
They say that he wishes to march on Rome
and make himself king.

153
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,251
That is sacrilege.
No man of honor would follow him.

154
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,578
Well, I'm no man of honor then,

155
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,953
'cause I say that Caesar should ride in here

156
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:37,009
with elephants and squash Pompey and Cato and anybody else that wants it.

157
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,886
Never mind the law.
That's what I say.

158
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,521
You say that because you govern your reason

159
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,001
no better than you govern your tongue.

160
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,665
Forgive me, it's my fault for mixing politics and wine.

161
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,183
More tench ?

162
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:49,252
A dormouse perhaps ?

163
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:50,314
Thank you, I won't.

164
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:52,232
Don't mind my saying it, but...

165
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,998
you two make unlikely friends.

166
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:57,667
We are not friends.
I am his superior officer.

167
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,201
By virtue of rank, if nothing else.

168
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,700
That is enough from you !

169
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,600
Please forgive our vulgar ways, madam.

170
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,501
We are not fit for your presence.

171
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:10,000
Not at all.
I've enjoyed your company immensely.

172
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,934
It's been most refreshing.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And with your permission, we shall...

174
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,202
...leave you.

175
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,101
Do come and visit us again.

176
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,234
Octavian needs reliable friends.

177
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:24,134
He may depend on you, I trust.

178
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,667
As you say, madam.

179
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,014
- Say again ?
- I did not speak.

180
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,733
I go this way.

181
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,534
My home is behind the street
of the cloth dyers, if you...

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,867
Go with Fortune, sir.

183
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,000
The cleaner brothels are in the Suburra*,

184
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:50,001
*  Working-class quarter of Rome, where most of lupanars were.

185
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,367
next to the venereal temple.

186
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,700
Niobe.

187
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,700
You're alive.

188
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,067
What child is that ?

189
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,200
Answer me.

190
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:50,134
What child is that ?

191
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:53,434
He's your grandson.

192
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,134
Speak sense, whore.

193
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,733
Wait, now.

194
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,667
Your grandson... The son of your daughter.

195
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,301
- My daughter is only...
- She's 13, near 14.

196
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:07,434
- A son by who ?
- Crito, a drover's boy.

197
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,767
His name is Lucius.

198
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,867
Niobe, stop.

199
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,534
I order you to stop !

200
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,600
Your father's home.

201
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,534
Girls, this is your father.

202
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,834
Daughters, I'm very pleased to find you
healthy and good looking.

203
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,667
A benefice you favor your mother, eh ?

204
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,034
Now you see how ugly your father is.

205
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,334
Come here.

206
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,967
She's not simple, is she ?

207
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:56,900
Greet your father properly as you've been taught to do.

208
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,600
Your pay stopped coming a year ago.

209
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,401
The paymaster said you must be dead.

210
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,367
They said they don't make mistakes.

211
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,434
Damned fools !
I'll have it seen to.

212
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,234
A bit of a surprise to see me then ?

213
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,534
A bit surprised to be called "whore."

214
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,301
That was... wrong.

215
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,800
I am sorry for it.

216
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,267
- A whore in front of everybody.
- I said sorry.

217
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,101
- Is it as you like it ?
- Less salt next time.

218
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,898
So, how did you manage for money ?

219
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:39,134
My sister Lyde and her husband helped us out.

220
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:43,134
Well, you won't need their help anymore.

221
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:48,800
The big phallus is off a Suevi I killed in the Rhinelands...

222
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,367
A very strong and fierce people.

223
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,600
Nice.

224
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:58,834
My official spoils I've put into slaves.

225
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,101
They're at the market.

226
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,767
I should clear 10000 denarii.

227
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:06,800
That's good news.

228
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:56,167
By grace of Roma, for twelve moons hence,

229
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:59,501
thou art tribune of plebs.

230
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:02,401
About time.

231
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:05,568
- I need a drink.
- Indeed, sir.

232
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,567
Perhaps after the meeting.

233
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,367
Cicero.

234
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:13,301
My dear Atia, a pleasure.

235
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,500
Forgive us for imposing at such a ludicrous hour.

236
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:17,681
Not at all, I adore it.

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,634
The secrecy, the intrigue...
It's most thrilling.

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,782
Comprehend, woman,

239
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:24,212
this meeting is invisible.

240
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:27,197
Be assured, Cato, I do not see you.

241
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:33,534
General Antony, we are...

242
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,934
Oh god, your beauty is painful.

243
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,767
You are the crucifix of Venus.

244
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,368
Let me die in your arms.

245
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:45,240
'Sist, Antony.

246
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:49,034
- Good evening to you all.
- General Antony.

247
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,606
Tribune Antony, if you please.

248
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,600
You're inside the sacred precincts of Rome,

249
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,322
but yet you wear the bloody red cloak of a soldier.*

250
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:57,323
In time of peace, Romans wear the toga.
The soldiers cannot be inside the city.

251
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,407
Quae bruta figura !*
(*What a moron !)

252
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,528
It completely fell from my mind.

253
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,227
I'm most extremely sorry.
Will you forgive me,

254
00:17:04,228 --> 00:17:05,628
friend Cato ?

255
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:10,367
Atia, please, will you take this and burn it ?

256
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:11,647
That's not necessary.

257
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:13,318
Is it not ?

258
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,749
Bene.* Then let's stop all this blathering

259
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:16,750
*Bene = Good

260
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,025
and get down to business.

261
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,301
Blathering, you say ?

262
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:23,134
What a congerie of heroes !
Such vim !

263
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:25,016
I feel like Helen of Troy.

264
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,840
Would you adjourn to the courtyard ?

265
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:28,933
Speak, young Marcus.

266
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,535
What have you to tell us ?

267
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:34,021
I have been delegated by Caesar
to negotiate a compromise.

268
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:35,977
Caesar wishes to avoid bloodshed.

269
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:39,548
He wishes to be seen as a man of reason and probity.

270
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,701
Therefore, when his present term
as governor of Gaul has ended,

271
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:46,296
he is willing to accept command of a single legion province.

272
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,603
Illyria*, by preference.

273
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:48,604
*Illyria is Western Crotia and Slovenia.

274
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,120
I don't understand.

275
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,515
Command of a province...

276
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
So he will have legal immunity.*

277
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:54,901
*A magistrate cannot be judged before the end of his office.
If Caesar is still on duty with a new legion in Illyria,
he has one year more to prepare his defense - or march on Rome.

278
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,586
So that none of you rascals

279
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,761
can go dragging him through the courts.

280
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,392
We're here to discuss the terms

281
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:04,064
of Caesar's resignation.

282
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,900
He could have avoided prosecution

283
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,944
by accepting a few years banishment.

284
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,532
Banishment for what ?

285
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,308
For fomenting a tyranny,

286
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,301
illegal warfare, theft,

287
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,134
murder, treason !

288
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:20,295
And what shall be your punishment, Pompey,

289
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,999
for betraying a friend,

290
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,914
for deserting the cause of your people,

291
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:26,707
for allying yourself with these so-called noblemen ?

292
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,233
What punishment for you ?

293
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:29,538
Impudent whelp !

294
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:34,268
The man's term of office ends in two weeks.

295
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:35,494
We say six months.

296
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:36,849
Two weeks !

297
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,149
He sits alone in Ravenna

298
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,004
with one mutinous skeleton of a legion

299
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,544
and he dares to dictate terms to me ?!

300
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,481
Caesar has many more legions than the 13th.

301
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,387
On the far side of the Alps.

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,990
Winter does not last forever.

303
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:54,577
Spring comes, snows melt.

304
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,028
- That's a threat !
- I assure you, it is no threat.

305
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,492
Snows always melt.

306
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,412
If he does not get a province ?

307
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:06,267
Caesar will take all measures required

308
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,667
to protect both his interests

309
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,434
and those of the Republic.

310
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,971
I am grieved and surprised.

311
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:16,804
I had hoped we would have a rational negotiation.

312
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:20,074
If that is his last word, we shall go.

313
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:26,249
Then we have no more business.

314
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,100
Caesar is bluffing.

315
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,367
He wishes to appear supremely confident.

316
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:33,959
Evidently he is desperately weak,
weaker than we'd thought.

317
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:37,597
This is a last ditch attempt
to frighten us into making concessions,

318
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,706
while he still has the semblance of an army.

319
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,201
He's weak, Cicero.
Dying.

320
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,622
Is that not when all the proverbs tell us to be wary ?

321
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,744
Does not the dying serpent bite deepest ?

322
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,070
Let's play.

323
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,425
Where are you from, friend ?

324
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:11,901
13th.

325
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,399
Better you keep that quiet.

326
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:16,526
This is deep Pompeian territory.

327
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,560
So, we're all Romans, eh ?

328
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,224
Come on, ladies, hear me now.

329
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:33,867
Furies and river gods for five.

330
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,467
<i>You will be pleased to hear</i>

331
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:25,376
<i>that general Antony was as blithely arrogant</i>

332
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,306
<i>and provocative as one could hope for.</i>

333
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:33,090
<i>And Pompey and Cato were deeply offended</i>

334
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,350
<i>by your negotiating position.</i>

335
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:39,208
Wise men and Graces on four !

336
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,393
Those Graces don't like you, I think.

337
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,482
They piss on your face.

338
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:46,064
They piss on my face ?

339
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,642
They piss on my face ?!

340
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,921
Calm, brother.

341
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,277
Man has an ill way with him.

342
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,006
He's lost a lot of money.
He means no offense...

343
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,534
- Do you ?
- None at all.

344
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,434
Twin river gods* over two.

345
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:04,435
*Twin rivers are Tigris and Euphrates.

346
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:06,633
Come on, you mumping cunnies !

347
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,900
Graces...

348
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,534
over four.

349
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,034
How do you feel now, soldier ?
Feel good ?

350
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,421
Who is this man ?

351
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:44,853
Run and get a doctor !

352
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,550
I don't want people dying in my house !

353
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,889
Do as I say, woman !

354
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:15,288
There will be copious pus...
First putrid, then wholesome...

355
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,112
And mayhap fits of the spleen,

356
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:20,432
but that will be all to the good.

357
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,767
A purging of the malignancy will follow.

358
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:25,635
This is brass.

359
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:29,506
Come.

360
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:32,001
When will he wake up ?

361
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,497
Today, tomorrow, maybe never.

362
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,400
You might try an offering to Spes.*

363
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:41,401
*Spes = allegoric goddess of the Hope

364
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:43,363
A white rabbit often works.

365
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,034
I'll send my boy tomorrow to check the dressings.

366
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:51,815
What misery !

367
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,820
It's only blood.
It'll wash.

368
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:56,748
Where are you going ?

369
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:57,767
I have business.

370
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,367
Business ?
What business ?

371
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,629
I understand that you are upset, but I will ask you

372
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,367
do not question me in that tone.

373
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:12,853
Tone.

374
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:14,667
My father's cock !

375
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,501
How's that for tone ? !

376
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:21,479
50, 50.
55.

377
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:24,768
55, 55.
60.

378
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:26,789
60, 60...
Sold !

379
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:30,484
40.
40, 40, 45.

380
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:33,234
45, 45, 45.
50.

381
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:37,118
50.
50, 50.
55.

382
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:41,568
This is bona stock, but it's all skin and bone, eh ?

383
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,201
You want a good price.

384
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:47,335
Let us feed them up,
put some fat on them.

385
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,833
Couple weeks of easy living,
and these puppies will sell like duck hearts.

386
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,834
Is that expensive, fodder and storage ?

387
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:56,646
No ! You'll recoup feed and storage double.

388
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,353
Beautiful, neh ?
A real showman.

389
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:09,274
I am no judge of the sand,

390
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:11,468
but sure, anyone can see

391
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:16,112
he is rare large and aggressive.

392
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:21,547
When the Senate meets tomorrow,

393
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:25,501
Scipio will propose an ultimatum be put to Caesar.

394
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:28,828
I ask you as a friend to support the proposal

395
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:31,674
and to enjoin your many friends to do the same.

396
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:34,863
I have not so many friends as all that.

397
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:37,195
The moderates follow you like sheep.

398
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,656
Your vote is critical.

399
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,068
The ultimatum is ?

400
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,568
Caesar's term of office is over.

401
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:44,649
He must immediately disband his men,

402
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:46,970
resign his command,
and return for trial...

403
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:50,782
Else be considered
an enemy of the Senate and people of Rome.

404
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,108
But he cannot accept that.

405
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:54,534
Not without dishonor.

406
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,321
Once declared hostile, he has nothing to lose...

407
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:58,685
He will fight at any cost.

408
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,753
You are declaring war !

409
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:04,222
Caesar will not have to accept or refuse the terms,

410
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:08,426
because Mark Antony will immediately use tribune's veto.

411
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,905
But then, what is your purpose ?

412
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,902
If the Senate votes against him,

413
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:14,105
Caesar will finally understand

414
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,850
that he is alone against all.

415
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:20,034
Of course, anything but an overwhelming vote

416
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,829
encourages Caesar to think he still has friends and hope.

417
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:31,838
I am no friend to Caesar, nor any tyrant,

418
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:33,890
but I cannot vote for a proposal

419
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:37,205
I do not wish to see realized.
It would be highly irreligious.

420
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,344
I have made a vow to Jupiter.

421
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:42,471
Unless I get the full backing of the Senate tomorrow,

422
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:45,384
I and all my legions will sail for Spain

423
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,524
and leave you gentlemen to your own defenses.

424
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:00,167
This is he ?
Crito ?

425
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:02,966
He's a good boy

426
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:03,973
from good family.

427
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,406
Good enough to seed a child of the Vorenii

428
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:08,566
who fought at Magnesia and Zama* ?

429
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:08,601
*Zama  (202 b.C.) and Magnesia (180 b.C.) are important battles won by Romans against Carthage and Seleucid empire.

430
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:10,322
I don't rightly know, sir.

431
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:12,236
You don't rightly know ?!
Do you know that this girl

432
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:13,596
is my property ?

433
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:14,734
That you should have asked my permission

434
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,714
before you coupled with her ?

435
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:19,195
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I am within my rights

436
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,146
to kill you here and now.

437
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:22,029
Papa, please.

438
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,530
Don't you start sniffling.
You should have thought of this

439
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:25,886
before you spread your legs.

440
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,336
They meant you no disrespect.

441
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,807
What they did was only natural.

442
00:29:29,842 --> 00:29:31,490
They're young and they love each other.

443
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:32,167
That's no excuse.

444
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:35,027
His mother's family are well-found
in Ostia for many generations,

445
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:37,723
and his father is a successful drover.

446
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,780
They have a house in the Southern crossroads.

447
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:43,243
A house built from cattle dung no doubt.

448
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,010
It's very hygienic, sir.
There's no smell.

449
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:50,867
There's money in droving, at least.

450
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,334
Good money, sir.

451
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:55,445
I'm on the Capua run mostly...

452
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,429
That's 5000 head a week sometimes, sir.

453
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,334
He cannot be but what he is.
When are you a man* ?

454
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:01,335
* Boys become men when they wear the virilis toga, when they're 17.

455
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:04,334
- Next month, sir.
- Next month.

456
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:10,101
Very well, you may marry my daughter.

457
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:14,967
Assure your good people that
the dowry will be appropriate.

458
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,153
He really is a good boy.

459
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:27,718
You should be pleased.

460
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:31,834
My daughter's virginity has been taken

461
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:37,106
and my first grandson, spawned
by an ill-favored prole.

462
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:38,425
How can I be pleased ?

463
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,022
- He makes her happy.
- She's an idiot then.

464
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,273
What a brute you are !

465
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:23,537
The Senate will hear Metullus Scipio.

466
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,900
Speak ! Speak !

467
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,326
Conscript fathers*,

468
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:29,068
*Title to talk to the Senators
(Patres "fathers" because the Senate was in older days a board of old men,
and conscripti because they are "registered" on a list)

469
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,167
I propose a formal motion.

470
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:33,700
Unless Gaius Julius Caesar

471
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:37,601
immediately lays down his command,

472
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,828
disbands his legions

473
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,333
and returns to Rome for trial,

474
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:46,873
this sacred assembly will declare him a public enemy

475
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:48,986
of the Senate and people of Rome !

476
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:53,337
After which time it will be the duty

477
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:57,292
and the obligation of every Roman to do him harm

478
00:31:57,327 --> 00:32:00,131
or to kill him if they are able !

479
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,819
A motion is proposed.

480
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,337
Those in favor, make it known.

481
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:52,501
The motion is carried by clear numbers.

482
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,867
Antony !

483
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:59,568
Veto the motion !

484
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,290
Stand up !

485
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,134
Veto the motion !

486
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:09,366
I demand the floor !
I demand the floor !

487
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:10,580
Give him the floor !

488
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:11,981
I veto the motion !

489
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:14,334
Tribune vetoes the motion !

490
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,865
Scipio's motion against Caesar...

491
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,937
It doesn't stand, does it ?

492
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:23,697
Stands.

493
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:25,581
Entered in the annals.

494
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:30,326
Despite that tribune raised his veto ?

495
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:34,788
Not heard, not fully admitted.

496
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:36,476
No weight.

497
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:39,233
The motion stands.

498
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,740
Let me be clear with you.

499
00:33:41,775 --> 00:33:43,409
I do not wish

500
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:45,910
that a motion as important as this

501
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:48,317
should stand on a mere trick of procedure.

502
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:50,508
Trick, you say ?

503
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:53,367
This is a religious matter.

504
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:56,100
There are no tricks in religion.

505
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:02,167
Session was not formally ended, correct ?

506
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:06,367
- Correct.
- So, when we reconvene,

507
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:09,201
it will formally be the same  session.

508
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:15,034
Then tribune Antony may use veto on the motion.

509
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,076
That is so.

510
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:25,524
Juno Inferna !*

511
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:25,525
*Means "Juno from the Underworld".
Other name for Proserpina, Pluto's wife, who rules the underworld.

512
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,496
Senile old fool,

513
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:29,744
only say so to begin with ?

514
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:34,083
Mark Antony must not be harmed
or hindered in any way.

515
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:34,688
- But...
- In any way !

516
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:37,471
It is vitally important that he be allowed

517
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:38,553
to veto the motion.

518
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:39,560
If he does not,

519
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,894
Caesar is declared a traitor.

520
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:44,415
Then he has no choice but to oppose me openly,

521
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,467
which means civil war.

522
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:47,562
Antony must not be harmed !

523
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,531
Dominus !
Good news !

524
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:52,458
The Senate will reconvene tomorrow.

525
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:55,098
Formally, it is the same session,

526
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,026
so you may yet exercise your veto on the motion.

527
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,808
Unless Pompey tries to stop me.

528
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,442
True, he may very well try.

529
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,490
Rally the men together.

530
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:09,067
Vorenus...

531
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:10,809
All of them.

532
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:14,934
Run and hide.

533
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:18,079
Run and hide.

534
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,301
The 13th are coming

535
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:24,633
and your men are all dead !

536
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:28,718
I put extra nutmeg in, as you like it.

537
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,164
Marry me, goddess.

538
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:33,526
What ?
A porcine object like you ?

539
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,867
Besides, I am already wed,

540
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,710
thanks be to evil spirits.

541
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:40,405
You are wrong, friend-wife.
He is a good man, your man.

542
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,648
A good man you say ?

543
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:44,917
For years and years, I'd lie awake at night

544
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:46,656
and beg all the gods to send him home.

545
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,646
I'd hear of this battle or that battle and...

546
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,514
I'd see him, clear as a glass,

547
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:54,693
lying dead and bloody in the mud somewhere.

548
00:35:58,449 --> 00:35:59,944
I was lonely.

549
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:01,721
I was so lonely.

550
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:03,857
For eight years I wept.

551
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:06,320
Every day, the girls asking:

552
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:07,820
"When is papa coming home ?

553
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:10,525
Is it today ?
When ?"

554
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,320
And now he's home,
and I wish he was in Gaul.

555
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,464
He's a cold, mean brute.

556
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,944
Not one loving word

557
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:20,236
to me or his daughters,

558
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,714
not once since he has been home...

559
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:24,201
He has no skilled hand with the women.

560
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,087
But in all these years I fought with him,

561
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:28,508
he never took a woman.

562
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:31,490
"Pullo", he'd say to me,
"Pullo, my old friend,

563
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:33,949
I have a wife back home,
Niobe is her name

564
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,630
and she's worth more to me
than all the women of Gaul."

565
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:40,698
I thank you for your kind words,
but I know you lie.

566
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,496
He's no friend of yours.
He told me so.

567
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,900
Why ?
He has a... an ill-temper, him.

568
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:49,763
He'd say anything.

569
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:55,028
Antony needs every man.

570
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,284
If you can walk,
we rendezvous at the house of Atia.

571
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,581
This is all I have left.

572
00:37:06,582 --> 00:37:08,738
There will be more when I sell the slaves.

573
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:12,767
Get the girls indoors and stay indoors
until you know it's safe.

574
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:22,067
It saddens me that you are unhappy,

575
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:24,755
because I have a deep affection for you.

576
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,677
When I return, we will talk.

577
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:44,348
Well, this is a merry do.

578
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,657
Octavia, my honey, look alive at least.

579
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:53,763
Poor Antony must think himself dead
and swimming in Lethe* water.

580
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:53,764
* Lethe = river in the underworld.
The souls of the dead people drink its water to forget their past life.

581
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:56,868
Talk to the poor man,
ask him questions.

582
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,434
One would think she'd been raised by Germans.

583
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,771
General Antony,

584
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:03,914
does my mother's screaming irritate you ?

585
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:06,734
Excuse me ?

586
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:08,615
When you and my mother are in coitus,

587
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,947
there is a deal of screaming.

588
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:13,333
I find it extremely irritating.

589
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,724
I wondered whether you did also.

590
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,899
Or perhaps you like it ?

591
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,722
A testament to your skills.

592
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:21,741
So spiteful, and for what ?

593
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:24,674
You shame only yourself.

594
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:50,587
She has you exact.

595
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,297
We show our strength.

596
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:57,058
We show them who owns the forum,

597
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:58,997
but we do not touch them.

598
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:01,180
Antony must not be touched !

599
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:02,833
- Kill them all, I say.
- None of that !

600
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,901
Pompey's strict orders.

601
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,879
Him who starts trouble will be on a cross at nightfall.

602
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,376
So no blood !

603
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:21,455
Make a lane there !
Make a lane there, I said !

604
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:23,047
Come on, you bastards !

605
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:52,604
Rally to me.

606
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,030
Rally to me.

607
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,959
Rally to me !

608
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:08,148
No blood !

609
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:28,378
You have what you wanted, Cato.

610
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,742
Caesar has no choice now.

611
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:32,673
Come the spring,

612
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,394
he will cross the Alps with his legions

613
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,246
and march on Rome.

614
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:48,546
Five dead.

615
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,098
Three from flux,
two from fighting.

616
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,108
Ten under medics.

617
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,252
Eight absent, believed fled.

618
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,967
- Sir.
- Fighting strength: 236 head.

619
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:58,911
Seventh cohort.*

620
00:40:58,912 --> 00:40:58,912
* 1 legion = 10 cohorts.
1 cohort = 6 centuries (480 soldiers, except the first cohort who has 800 soldiers).
So 1 complete legion = 5120 soldiers

621
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:02,342
12 dead:
six of flux, six of fighting.

622
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,820
Three on the medics.

623
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,260
Three absent, believed fled.

624
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:08,567
Fighting strength: 242.

625
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:12,402
Soldier, how far behind you is Mark Antony ?

626
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,000
No more than an hour, sir.

627
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:20,663
- Sound assembly !
- Sir !

628
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:23,601
By order of the Senate,

629
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:26,034
Gaius Julius Caesar

630
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:29,177
is declared an enemy of Rome.

631
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:31,066
All good citizens are bound

632
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,286
to do him harm

633
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:33,770
if they are able.

634
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:53,704
I've got him.

635
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:58,249
After all these years,

636
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:00,272
Pompey surprises me.

637
00:42:02,034 --> 00:42:04,795
I had hoped to provoke some kind of aggression, sure,

638
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:07,469
but to try and kill a tribune* ?

639
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:07,470
*The tribune of the people is sacrosanct.
If someone (whoever he is, citizen, magistrate, patrician...) tries to kill him,
he's cursed and everybody can kill him to spare the city the stain.

640
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,071
In the forum ?

641
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:13,300
The man's found some hard black iron in his soul.

642
00:42:13,436 --> 00:42:17,057
I'm sure it was yonder demented little worm Cato
who put him up to it.

643
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,505
It's excellent, this.

644
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:21,534
So, what next ?

645
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,414
Let's see what the men have to say.

646
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:28,265
Don't do that !

647
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,562
You look just right as you are.

648
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:35,732
Like Leonidas at Thermopylae*.

649
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:35,733
*Leonidas is a Spartan king, commanding an army during wara againt Persians' king Xerxes.
He, his 300 Spartan soldiers and 700 Theban made heroic last stands in 480 b.C.
and their sacrifice helped Athens to prepare the battle of Salamis, which put a term to the war with the full victory of Greek cities.

650
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,650
Attention !

651
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,800
Any of your people I can mention ?

652
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:48,977
Titus Pullo.

653
00:42:48,978 --> 00:42:51,786
Took the head off the first man that came at me.

654
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,105
Soldiers,

655
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,330
Pompey and the Senate

656
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,434
have formally declared

657
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:08,012
that Gaius Julius Caesar

658
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:10,077
is an enemy of Rome.

659
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:11,626
No !

660
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,779
They have declared that I am a criminal.

661
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,431
They have declared, in effect,

662
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:20,600
that all of you also are criminals !

663
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,706
No !

664
00:43:22,707 --> 00:43:25,687
The tribune's veto was not exercised.

665
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:28,160
Peoples tribune Mark Antony

666
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:30,729
and 50 men of the 13th

667
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,669
were assaulted by 1000 head of Pompeian scum.

668
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,301
No !

669
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:42,733
A tribune of the plebs

670
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,301
assaulted on the steps

671
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,625
of the Senate house !

672
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,260
Can you imagine a more terrible sacrilege ?

673
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:54,226
Our beloved Republic is in the hands of madmen.

674
00:43:54,227 --> 00:43:55,747
This is a dark day,

675
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,301
and I stand at a fork on a road

676
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:01,851
like a burden surrounding in my arm to the Senate

677
00:44:01,894 --> 00:44:05,331
and watch the Republic fall
to tyranny and chaos !

678
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:07,640
Or, I can go home

679
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:09,920
with my sword in my hand

680
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:11,874
and run those maniacs

681
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,999
to the Tarpeian* rock !

682
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
*Murderers and traitors were flung from this cliff near the Capitoline hill until the end of the Republic.
Its name come from Tarpeia, a Vestal, who, for golden bracelets, betrayed Rome
by opening the gates to the Sabine army.
The Sabine soldiers crushed her to death with their shields.

683
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:14,401
Yeah ! Yeah !

684
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:26,178
Legionary Titus Pullo, step forward !

685
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:33,090
Titus Pullo !

686
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,054
When 50 brave men of the 13th
fought Pompey's 1000 in the forum

687
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,877
and saved the tribune,

688
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,013
it was legionary Titus Pullo who drew first blood !

689
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:53,334
Here is 500 denarii !

690
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:57,337
Very grateful, sir.

691
00:44:57,338 --> 00:44:59,451
Are you with me, Titus Pullo ?

692
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:01,497
Will you come with me to Rome ?

693
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:02,991
Yes.

694
00:45:03,092 --> 00:45:04,937
Yes, sir !
Certainly !

695
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:07,431
Titus Pullo is with me !

696
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:09,176
And you ?

697
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:10,517
Are you with me ?!

698
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:12,414
Yeah ! Yeah !

699
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:09,446
You're awake.

700
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:10,546
Water ?

701
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:14,000
We're moving.

702
00:46:16,998 --> 00:46:19,327
The whole legion, sounds like.
Where to ?

703
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:22,181
It's a river.

704
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,505
What river ?

705
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:28,686
This is the Rubicon.

706
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:29,328
Stay calm.

707
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:32,281
This is rebellion and treason,

708
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:33,679
and I am no traitor !

709
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,834
It's too late now. We're across.
We're in Italy.

710
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,389
You're a rebel whether you like it or not.

711
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,557
Caesar

712
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:40,364
Caesar, what have you done ?

713
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:41,680
He had no choice, had he ?

714
00:46:41,681 --> 00:46:43,881
Pompey did try to kill Mark Antony after all.

715
00:46:43,882 --> 00:46:46,167
You of all men should not dare make that argument.

716
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:47,073
How's that ?

717
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,619
You know who was being attacked.

718
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,545
I don't know what you mean.

719
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:55,452
It doesn't matter now.

720
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:57,173
We are all dead men anyway.

721
00:46:57,174 --> 00:47:00,475
We'll be hanging from crosses in the Appian Way
before the week's out.

722
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:02,141
We'll be all right.

723
00:47:02,142 --> 00:47:04,381
- Have some more water.
- Better to die of thirst.

724
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:05,404
Don't be foolish.

725
00:47:05,685 --> 00:47:06,695
Drink.

726
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:13,989
Caesar is in Italy !

727
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:16,929
What ?

728
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:17,856
It cannot be !

729
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:21,271
Caesar is in Italy !

730
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:25,045
Have you heard ?

731
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:26,405
I heard.

732
00:47:46,174 --> 00:47:47,680
What's going to happen ?

733
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:49,413
War is going to happen.

734
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,990
Who's my greedy little piglet ?

735
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:16,007
