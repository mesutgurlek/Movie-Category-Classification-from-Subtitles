1
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,366
Excuse me.
This is Park Lane House?

2
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,448
<i>The assignments are ready, Major.</i>

3
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:46,125
<i>No, no, no. Fill in all 15 forms
and resubmit... in triplicate.</i>

4
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,784
<i>- My name is Stuart. I have an appointment with Professor Mair.
- Captain Stuart, sirl</i>

5
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,189
The professor is expecting you, sir.
Come this way, sir, if you please.

6
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,133
<i>- Turn seven, miss.
- All right, Sergeant Major.</i>

7
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,480
<i>Professor Mair, sir.</i>

8
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,814
Excuse me, sir.

9
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,887
I think there's some...
somebody at the door.

10
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,923
Mmm. Ask him to come in.
Come in!

11
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,924
<i>Captain Stuart, sir.</i>

12
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,358
All right, Sergeant Major.

13
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,362
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

14
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,398
You better sit down.

15
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,673
Yes, Taylor. I think you're right.

16
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,913
- I think you're right.
- Thank you, sir.

17
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,883
Professor Taylor's my star pupil with fuses.

18
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,886
Eh, Taylor?

19
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,388
Well, what can we do for you and Strang?

20
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,890
Well, sir, it's a bit top secret, sir.

21
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,053
Oh. Leave us, will you, Taylor?
We'll go on with that later.

22
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,187
- Unless you want to get home.
- Oh... Oh, no, sir.

23
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:29,064
- Quite sure your wife won't mind?
- No, sh-she'll be all right, sir.

24
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,667
<i>Taylor, put the light on, will you?</i>

25
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,436
SoJerry's dropping
a new secret weapon, is he?

26
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,012
So secret...

27
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,241
we don't know what it is...

28
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,840
or whether he is dropping it or not.

29
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,485
- You got one with you?
- I wish I had.

30
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,022
What I really want, sir,
is a bit of expert guessing...

31
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,065
and some expert advice on how to handle it
when we get our hands on one.

32
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,136
Sammy Rice is your man.

33
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,707
That you, Susan?
Send Sammy up, will you?

34
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,004
- He's gone, Professor Mair.
- Pity.

35
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,841
- Shall I try to round him up?
- Yes.

36
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,279
I'm sending a Captain Stuart down.

37
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,715
Try and get him together
with Sammy tonight, will you?

38
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,878
- I'll try.
- And send up old Taylor.

39
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,956
Straightaway.

40
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,752
Professor Mair wants you, Taylor.

41
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,559
<i>- Can I come in?
- Captain Stuart?</i>

42
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,230
I'm just ringing Mr. Rice's flat.

43
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,308
Thank you.

44
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,442
There's always something wrong
with this line.

45
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,237
One more chance.

46
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,152
<i>Check here for a bottle ofbrandy. Okay, guv?</i>

47
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,887
I don't care if he is Free French. You gotta pay
cash like everybody else. The Lord Nelson.

48
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,455
- Hello. Is Mr. Rice there?
- Oh, is that you, Miss Susan? Yes, he's here.

49
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,555
<i>- He's there.
- Where?</i>

50
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,828
- I'll take you.
- I say, that's awfully nice of you.

51
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,995
It's not far out of my way.

52
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:49,666
- Don't let him go, Knucksie. I'm picking him up.
- Trust me.

53
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,472
When can we discuss that, Mr. Moran?

54
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,513
- We'll get around to it.
- Oh!

55
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,181
- I'm dry, Mr. Moran.
- Hey, steam engine's dry. Miles.

56
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,651
<i>- "Propriétaire. "
- Hey, Knucksie.</i>

57
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,660
<i>Yes.</i>

58
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,094
<i>- Hey, Dolly.
- Okay, let's have a drinkl</i>

59
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,097
Message for ya.

60
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,671
<i>She says you're to wait.</i>

61
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,110
How's the foot?

62
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,509
<i>- Which one?
- The tin one.</i>

63
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,809
I saw you kicking at it just now.

64
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,183
Yeah. Well, I've gotta do something.
I can't take it off in here, can I?

65
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,553
- Tried dope?
- You won't give me the dope I need.

66
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,389
No more whisky for you, Mr. Rice.
Not in my bar.

67
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,464
<i>- You can't take whisky.
- No, don't go, Knucksie. Stay and talk.</i>

68
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,465
Mr. Rice, how can I?

69
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,535
Knucksie, whisky or conversation.

70
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,195
One or the other,
or I start to break the place up.

71
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,373
Miss Susan will be here in a minute.

72
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,443
Coming.

73
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,292
<i>Pardon, mum.</i>

74
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,393
Captain Stuart, Mr. Rice.

75
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,397
- Drink?
- Well, uh...

76
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,592
- I know her tipple.
- Bitter for me.

77
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,101
- The usual, Knucksie, and a bitter.
- Right.

78
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,743
- Mair sent him on to you.
- Oh.

79
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,042
What's it all about?

80
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,989
I'm sober.

81
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,450
It's a bit hush-hush.

82
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:54,057
All right.
How about my flat?

83
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,134
I'll make you some coffee.

84
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,822
- Well, put me in the picture.
- Yes.

85
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,054
I know it's all a lot of rot, but, um...

86
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,790
Is, uh... Is this what you want?

87
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,235
Yeah.

88
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,070
Well, what's happened is
a kid's been killed in an explosion.

89
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,506
Found a dart
and hit it with a hammer?

90
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,874
We don't think it was quite like that.

91
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,218
We think the kid may have
simply picked it up...

92
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,220
or perhaps only touched it.

93
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,313
Well, why all the cloak-and-dagger stuff?

94
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,449
Accidents do happen in wartime.

95
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,620
- It's hardly in our line.
- We don't think this was an accident.

96
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,164
It's the fourth this week.

97
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,427
And always afterJerry planes
have been over.

98
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,503
You mean they're dropping booby traps?

99
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,540
- Looks like it.
- And always kids?

100
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,838
Three kids and a man.

101
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,574
Hmm.

102
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,550
That's odd it should have been kids
three times out of four.

103
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,622
I expect the blasted things are
mocked up as teddy bears or candy bars.

104
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,626
- More?
- No, thanks.

105
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,821
Jerry has a lovely mind.

106
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,568
- No witnesses or survivors?
- No.

107
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,335
- What, nothing at all?
- Well, we did find something.

108
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,342
Oh, come on. Spill it.

109
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,580
After the last incident.

110
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,309
It was in the area of the explosion.

111
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,754
Oh?

112
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,196
- Sammy!
- What?

113
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,233
- Who knows what's in it?
- I do.

114
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,826
Soup. Or coffee.
It's a thermos.

115
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,462
- That's right.
- Oh! I need some coffee.

116
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,640
It fooled a lot of people.

117
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,044
Not you.
It's a Jerry type thermos.

118
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,778
Probably fell out of the aircraft when they
jettisoned the other thing, whatever that is.

119
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,912
- Well, there's only one thing to do if you want me in on this.
- I do.

120
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,617
Get me in early. Next time it happens,
send me a wire. I'll come, wherever it is.

121
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,456
Thanks.
I'll take you up on that.

122
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,190
Well, I better be moving.

123
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,266
Come back to the local
and have a drink.

124
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,267
No, I must go.

125
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,963
I'm sorry. I don't keep any stuff here.

126
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,165
We're keeping this one for, uh...

127
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,174
V- day.

128
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,074
- No, really, I've got to get back.
- All right. I'll get your coat.

129
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,150
- Can I take you home?
- You have.

130
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,310
Oh.

131
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,081
<i>I live across the hall.</i>

132
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,393
I could put you up
on the settee if you like.

133
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,828
Thanks. I'd sooner get out of town.

134
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,333
- The raids get me down.
- Oh, you get used to 'em, like toothache.

135
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,426
<i>I hate toothaches.</i>

136
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,938
Well, there's nothing like taking a nice
quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves.

137
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,242
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

138
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,576
<i>- Mind how you go down the stairs.
It's a bit dark there. Good-bye, old man.</i>

139
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,645
- Nice chap.
- Mmm.

140
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,427
Oh, dear.

141
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,338
<i>- You know, it's awful about the children.
- Mmm.</i>

142
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,879
<i>Well, if we can get hold of one
of those things and have a look at it...</i>

143
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,574
<i>we can see what it was like
and we could broadcast a warning.</i>

144
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,582
But, Sammy, how would you tackle it?

145
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,584
Oh, damn.

146
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,250
<i>You'll have the warden after you.</i>

147
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,827
Is it hurting?

148
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,907
Not more than usual.

149
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,142
Why don't you take it off?

150
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,316
<i>- Have you taken your dope?
- No.</i>

151
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,718
Problem.

152
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,990
This dope the doctor gives me
doesn't do my foot any good.

153
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,032
It makes me feel bad.

154
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,232
<i>That noble remedy,
on the other hand...</i>

155
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,309
doesn't do me any good either.

156
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,072
But at least it leaves me not caring
whether it hurts or not.

157
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,740
Would you like a whisky, Sammy?

158
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,144
Mmm. I would.

159
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,423
Why don't you take the thing off?

160
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,755
- You know that helps.
- No.

161
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,064
You do when you're alone.

162
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,639
Why will you keep it on when I'm here?

163
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,482
It's all right now.

164
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,898
<i>Ohl Look. Look.</i>

165
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,567
<i>- Can we have another?
- Yes, sir.</i>

166
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,442
<i>- Ready with another one, Jack?
- Yes, okay.</i>

167
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,277
<i>Fire!</i>

168
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,564
- You reducing the charge?
- Yes, we'll put it down to 60 grams this time, sir.

169
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,193
- Think that'll be better? - I
think so. Yes. - How's your shoulder?

170
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,975
- What is the, uh, muzzle velocity?
- 1,500, sir.

171
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,345
Now I suppose you people will send in a report
saying the Reeve's gun is a marvelous weapon.

172
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,510
- Depends on the figures.
- Stop playing with figures, my boy.

173
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,519
- Learn something about soldiering.
- Fire.

174
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,451
- He's on the target all right.
- Yes, in 20 seconds.

175
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,258
<i>- What we need is 10 rounds a minute.
- Fresh target.</i>

176
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,664
- You don't like the Reeve's, I gather.
- Heaven make me patient.

177
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,895
- Have you ever fired at a tank?
- Not in anger.

178
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,804
Well, they move, don't they?
They crawl about. They-They zigzag.

179
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,933
- They don't like being shot at.
- You think the Reeve's is difficult to handle?

180
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,638
<i>- Are you ready?
- I think the sort of chap we have to use...</i>

181
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,181
<i>- couldn't get a moving tank in his sights in a week.
- Firel</i>

182
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,711
<i>- Good man.
- Come on. I've seen enough.</i>

183
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,524
Can't quite understand your outfit.
What do you call yourselves?

184
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,595
I don't think we call ourselves anything.
We're just Professor Mair's research section.

185
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,596
- Well, who do you come under?
- Nobody.

186
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,599
Professor Mair's got a lot of contacts, of course.
He's an old friend of the minister's.

187
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,601
I know that, but you haven't got
any establishment...

188
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,297
or terms of reference or anything...
anything old-fashioned like that?

189
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,874
Not as far as I know.
We just tackle any job we're given.

190
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,205
You know, this thing's spreading.
The country's crawling...

191
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,210
with this and that
chap's research outfit.

192
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,772
They don't belong to anybody.
They don't report to anybody.

193
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,580
- Do you?
- No.

194
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,780
No responsibility and lots of power.

195
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,858
It's not right, you know.
It's not right.

196
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,124
- Got any service personnel?
- Yes. A few.

197
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,290
<i>I don't know how it's done.</i>

198
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,369
Figures!

199
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,112
- Morning, Crowhurst.
- Morning, sir.

200
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,149
Morning, Mr. Rice, sir.
Mr. Waring's been agitating for you, sir.

201
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,150
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

202
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,228
Hello, Madeleine?
Hello, darling. Sammy's just got in.

203
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,889
No. No, it's hardly out of my way at all.

204
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,125
I'll get it. Yes, of course I will.

205
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,203
Till, will you stop that filthy row,
for Pete's sake. Hello, darling?

206
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,636
It's Till on that ghastly robot of his.

207
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,139
- There's an extraordinary thing here, Sammy.
- Really, darling?

208
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,177
- Has the Reeve's report come in yet?
- On your desk. Yes, darling.

209
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,846
Sammy.

210
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,113
<i>- Yes?
- You know those penetration of armor plate figures that E.W.E. Sent us?</i>

211
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,120
<i>Yes.</i>

212
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,124
Well, there's a positive correlation between
penetration and the height of each man firing.

213
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,627
Easy. The taller the man, the more rarefied
the atmosphere, and the less the air resistance.

214
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,630
<i>- All right, darling.
- You think that might be it?</i>

215
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,529
Would be if they hadn't all been lying down.

216
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,364
Oh, they were lying down, were they?

217
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,768
<i>- Yes.
- Oh. How much do you want of it. Hmm?</i>

218
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,309
<i>- How on earth did you manage to get their heights anyway?
- Thought they might be interesting.</i>

219
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,540
<i>How do you spell it?</i>

220
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,343
Spell it, darling.

221
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,350
Yes?

222
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,352
No, of course I've got time.

223
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,615
How was the Reeve's?

224
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,716
Oh, so-so.
Let's get the figures out, Tilly, and we'll see.

225
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,387
- I'd better have a complete analysis.
- Aha.

226
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,397
Sorry, darling. I must go now.
Tea's up. Bye.

227
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,436
Well, I'll be...

228
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,371
- What's the idea of the partition?
- Inner sanctum.

229
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,968
- "R.B. Waring" on the outer door. "State your
business to the secretary," et cetera.

230
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,038
<i>- How'd he fiddle the permit?
- Don't ask me.</i>

231
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,288
Is he inside?

232
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,951
With four telephones and furniture
to match and a third of my window.

233
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,028
Hmm.

234
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,893
Pretty mean.
Free for lunch?

235
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,828
- Busy day?
- You bet.

236
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,133
Not a moment has been wasted from
R.B. Waring's point of view.

237
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,466
- He'll be bagging a carpet next.
- He's got one.

238
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,545
<i>Come in.</i>

239
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,249
Oh, hello, Sammy. Want me?

240
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,251
No, but I've got to have you.

241
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,455
Well, you've gone very grand.

242
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,751
Well, I got fed up with
working off kitchen tables.

243
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,418
Look at the conditions you all
work under. It makes me wild.

244
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,259
Well, it was darn nice of you to get yourself
all this stuff for my sake... and Susan's.

245
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,562
Go on, you bitter old devil. You know
you don't care where you work, but the...

246
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,568
sales side has to impress people.

247
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,604
Our Sue will tell you that.

248
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,731
<i>You'll be carrying an umbrella next.</i>

249
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,309
You know, Sammy...

250
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,310
young Sue's a remarkable woman.

251
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,505
This is a beautiful job.

252
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,413
Beautiful.
But I need three copies at once.

253
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,042
<i>One for the minister,
one to Professor Mair and one to me...</i>

254
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,350
<i>all marked "most secret,"and there's
a note to go with the minister's too.</i>

255
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,448
As quick as you can.
How long will that take?

256
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,188
Three hours,
if I don't go to lunch.

257
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,560
<i>Well, must you?</i>

258
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,463
<i>- Girls do eat.
- Well, can't you send out for something?</i>

259
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,536
I tell you what I'll do.

260
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,764
I'll buy you some tulips for your desk.

261
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,864
<i>- Yellow ones?
- Enormous yellow ones.</i>

262
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,944
All right.

263
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,283
There's a good girl.

264
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,987
You see, Sammy?
Everybody's got a price.

265
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,990
Now tell me about the Reeve's.
Good show?

266
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,890
- Oh, moderately.
- What did you think of it?

267
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,659
- Till will need a few days on the figures.
- Oh, figures. How'd you like it?

268
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,328
- Plenty of snags.
- Oh, it's not perfect yet. Needs cleaning up. That's easy.

269
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,873
<i>- Holland took against it too.
- Well, luckily the thing's been sold above Holland's level.</i>

270
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:53,206
<i>- Sold?
- Yes, I made the old man take me round to see the minister, and I put it across to him.</i>

271
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,872
- He's all steamed up.
- What'd you sell it to him on?

272
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,314
What the stars foretell for this week...
or just intuition?

273
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,819
- No, the idea's right.
- It may be, if the figures say what we want.

274
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,448
- They'll have to. After what I told his nibs.
- What do you mean they'll have to?

275
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,858
Now look here, Sammy.
Don't let yourself be impressed by soldiers.

276
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,195
I've noticed that whenever we disagree
with the military we're always right...

277
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,736
except that they have to use the stuff
and trust their lives to it and we don't.

278
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,704
Medals have an emotional appeal
for you, Sammy.

279
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,332
Now mark my words.
Nobody gets medals for having brains.

280
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,343
- Holland has brains.
- Oh.

281
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,346
- Ganglia. Antennae. I wouldn't put it higher than that.
- And he knows his job.

282
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,646
Oh, Lord, how sick I am of these people
who know their jobs.

283
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,686
Except you and me, Sammy.

284
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,756
Except you and me.

285
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,528
<i>Look. Look.</i>

286
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,137
Morning, Lascomb.
Hello, Dibley. How are you?

287
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,255
Morning. How are you?

288
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,825
- Morning, Mr. Pinker. Very well, thank you.
- Good. Waiter.

289
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,486
- Yes, sir?
- Is the saddle still on?

290
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,962
- Yes, sir.
- Right, I'll have it, and, uh...

291
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,965
oh, a thick soup,
pint of Hollistry, please.

292
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,934
- Very good, sir.
- Hello, Sammy.

293
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,936
Hello, Pinker. Sit down.

294
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,030
Well, how's everything going
with the back room boys?

295
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,633
- Have we won the war yet?
- Nobody tells me anything.

296
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,805
Well, I think I've made
a substantial contribution today.

297
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,816
- Godshall is going.
- You fired him.

298
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,211
Body was riddled with bullets.

299
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,625
You know, we need
a new permanent secretary.

300
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,598
Higgins is a dear good soul,
but there's a war on.

301
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,635
- Well, why don't you just fire him too?
- He's on the list.

302
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,399
I'm having a drink with, uh...

303
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:05,840
with the minister's principal
private secretary's cousin tomorrow.

304
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,912
I shall drop a little poison in his ear.

305
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,042
- Gangster stuff.
- No orchids. Master Higgins.

306
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,783
- That boy Waring.
- Well, what about him?

307
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,017
- Moving in very high society suddenly.
- Yes.

308
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,754
And old man Mair.
I hope he isn't going political.

309
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,853
That was a good outfit of yours
when it started.

310
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,932
Well, what's wrong with it now?

311
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,471
Is the Reeve's gun any good?

312
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,267
- What do you know about the Reeve's?
- I know Mair and Waring saw the minister about it.

313
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,345
I suppose you were under the table.

314
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,437
You'd be surprised.

315
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,142
Look. You like old Mair, don't you?

316
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,582
- Mmm.
- Yes.

317
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,154
- I'm very fond of him.
- Grand old man of science and all that.

318
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,452
But have you ever thought where your section
would be if there was a change of minister?

319
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,526
Why? Are you gonna have him fired too?

320
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,926
Does, uh, Mair want a knighthood?

321
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,590
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- Well, then who wants what?

322
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,759
Come on. It's pretty obvious
that somebody wants something.

323
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,327
Who's the ambitious boy? Waring?

324
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:11,398
You're all right. Everybody knows that.
You're the brains of the outfit.

325
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,569
Waiter. The bill.

326
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,472
Bertha, give the bill to
my civil service friend, will you?

327
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,950
Yes, Mr. Rice. John.

328
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,021
- What are you getting at?
- Sammy...

329
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,182
I want you to meet
a very important man... tonight.

330
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,023
Uh-uh. Not tonight.
Never on a Wednesday night.

331
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:35,429
I have a very important conference
every Wednesday night at the Hickory Tree.

332
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,198
<i>- Waiter!
- Sir?</i>

333
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,995
Oh, never mind.

334
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,487
- I thought you were never coming.
- I didn't leave the office until 8:00.

335
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,228
- What's wrong, Sammy?
- Nothing. But you know how I hate being alone.

336
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,538
- Well, did R.B. Cough up the tulips?
- Oh, yes. He's a man of his word.

337
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,134
- What did you do with them?
- Put them on my desk.

338
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,770
What else should I do with them?

339
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:00,715
Couldn't find it in your heart to slap his face
sometime when he does that stuff, could you?

340
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,380
- I can't afford luxuries.
- You could get another job.

341
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,753
Would you rather I did?

342
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,826
He doesn't paw or anything.

343
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,952
I should hope not.

344
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,030
So should I.

345
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,997
But, you see, darling,
he doesn't know about us.

346
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,488
Sue...

347
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,585
you could have
such a good time without me.

348
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,797
<i>I take things from you
with both hands.</i>

349
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,338
<i>I always have...</i>

350
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,407
and I always will.

351
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,644
I keep kicking this foot of mine, and...

352
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:05,204
when I have a bad patch,
I like someone to flutter around...

353
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,784
so that I can be
a perfect swine to them.

354
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,590
And you seem to like it.

355
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,854
But one of these days
you're going to get tired of it.

356
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,293
<i>And when you do...</i>

357
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,595
<i>I want you to be able to put the whole thing
in the wastepaper basket...</i>

358
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,897
<i>and forget about it in 10 seconds.</i>

359
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,533
Wouldn't it be silly to break up
something we both like doing...

360
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,204
only because you think I don't like it?

361
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,272
<i>Yes.</i>

362
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,581
You've got it all worked out
in the way women always have.

363
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:46,680
They don't worry about anything
except being alive or dead.

364
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,783
And being dead to them
means beginning to smell.

365
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,698
Yes. You take it,
and you make what you want of it.

366
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,934
I don't know why we trouble
to come out at all, Sue.

367
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,510
Let's have an economy campaign
and stay in for a few weeks.

368
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,011
I'll take you up on that.

369
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,844
Hello. I say, our last economy
campaign's not finished yet.

370
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,182
I could have told you that.

371
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,187
- Quick. Talk to me.
- Why? Who is it?

372
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,587
It's Gillian. She's an incendiary bomb.

373
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:24,219
"'I never nursed a dear gazelle,
to glad me with its soft black eye. "' Um...

374
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,526
- "'And when it came to know me well... "'
- "'... and love me, it was sure to die. "'

375
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:31,898
<i>Why, Suel Fancy meeting you here
after all these years.</i>

376
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,903
Well, I am surprised.

377
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,905
How are you, darling?

378
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,066
Darling, this is Norval.

379
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,044
Norval, do come here.
You must know each other.

380
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,672
- Norval, this is Sue.
- How do?

381
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,217
How do you do?
Mr. Rice.

382
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,218
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

383
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,447
What a piece of luck,
dropping on you, darling.

384
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,547
I simply dragged Norval here.

385
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,491
<i>You see, he's a simply whizzer dancer...</i>

386
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,690
<i>and has the foulest contempt for any
ordinary two-footed person like little me.</i>

387
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,359
Susan's the best dancer I know.

388
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,529
It would be good for you to dance
with anyone as good as Susan, you snake.

389
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,301
- Care to?
- I don't think so. Thanks.

390
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,866
Oh, but, darling.
Darling, you must dance with Norval.

391
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,912
Dancing with Norval is an experience.

392
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,245
<i>He's marvelousl He isl Really.</i>

393
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,513
Go on, Sue. One shouldn't miss
experiences like that.

394
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,057
- I don't dance.
- Not at all?

395
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,064
I'm a long-distance sitter-out.

396
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,614
They make a perfect pair, don't they?

397
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,260
Why don't you dance, Mr. Rice?
It's very easy.

398
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,135
- Too old and too lazy.
- It'll be nice for Susan.

399
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,039
- A lot of things would be nice for Susan.
- But you ought to dance.

400
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,043
Why?

401
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,943
Men and women are all the same
when they dance.

402
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,313
Crowhurst! Crowhurst!

403
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,322
Soldier!

404
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,450
Come on, Sammy. We've only got a few minutes.
I've sent Rose out for some whisky.

405
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,327
You know, there isn't even a drink in the place.
Old Mair couldn't sell life insurance to a ghost.

406
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,763
- I'll ring you back.
- Don't tell me the commission's coming.

407
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,062
Commission? What commission?

408
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,501
The minister's coming.
He'll be here at any minute.

409
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,506
The old man's bringing him.
Now you've got to put on a show, Sammy.

410
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,633
Find something he'll understand.

411
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,875
- You gonna have the cap in, sir?
- Yes, I think so.

412
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,075
- A bit queer, isn't it, sir?
- He won't know any different.

413
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,724
Do you think it'll, uh,
amuse the m-m-minister, sir?

414
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,268
Sure to. Probably never
heard of a photoelectric cell.

415
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,100
Uh, sh-shall we clean up, sir?

416
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:25,664
No. Put out all the fuses you've got.
The more the merrier.

417
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,674
- What's that for?
- Mair's office. My tulips.

418
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,413
- This one too.
- I've mocked up that phony experiment for you, Sammy.

419
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,456
Oh, thanks. Till, come and be the minister.
Ask some intelligent questions.

420
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:43,049
Oh. That looks very nice, Mr. Rice.

421
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,129
Uh, what, uh, is it?

422
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,925
Now this, Mr. Minister, is part of
some experiments we're carrying out...

423
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,263
- to produce a new gas by a
process of distillation. - Mm-hmm.

424
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,963
Now I can quite easily demonstrate
its efficacy for you by...

425
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,166
placing a piece of ordinary
cotton wool in this bowl.

426
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,335
Oh, come on, Tilly.
Play up. Take an interest.

427
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,642
<i>And then you will see that by the addition
of just one drop of this liquid...</i>

428
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,239
it becomes instantly combustible.

429
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,512
Ooh! I say. He ought to love that.

430
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,146
It's a shame we haven't a few paper chains
and a bunch of mistletoe for the old boy.

431
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,190
Hey! Here they come!

432
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,688
<i>Uh, this way, Minister.</i>

433
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,199
<i>Very good. You know,
you get a bottle of wine there.</i>

434
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,997
<i>I always think that helps nowadays.</i>

435
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,597
Ah. Good morning, gentlemen.

436
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,141
So these are the back room boys, eh?

437
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,679
- Yes. This is where all the work is done.
- Yes. Not very luxurious, is it?

438
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,544
Still, I always say the barer the room
the better the work.

439
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,083
- I must remember that.
- It was the best we could get.

440
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,052
Oh, that looks nice.
What's that?

441
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,352
- That, uh, well...
- Sammy, what is this?

442
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:50,484
Oh, this, Mr. Minister, is part of a series
of experiments we're conducting...

443
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,725
to produce a new gas,
uh, by a process of distillation.

444
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,857
I can demonstrate its efficacy
for you quite easily...

445
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,699
by placing a piece of ordinary
cotton wool in this bowl.

446
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:05,765
And, uh, then you'll see that by the addition
of just one single drop of this liquid...

447
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,311
Uh, I shouldn't stand
quite so close, if I were you, sir.

448
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,905
Uh, it becomes immediately combustible.

449
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,008
- Oh, that's funny.
- Oh, well, I expect you'll get it right soon.

450
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,288
That's better.

451
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,522
- Uh, do you mind, Minister?
- No, no. Carry on. Carry on.

452
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,696
- Professor Mair's research section.
- Is that you, darling?

453
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,670
Is that you, Joe?
I want to talk toJoe.

454
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,740
Wrong number.

455
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,011
- Oh, that's a Cambridge spark galvanometer.
- Oh, Cambridge. Yes.

456
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,912
Oh, and that little monster...
is that another invention of yours?

457
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,747
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
That's an electric calculating machine.</i>

458
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,151
- Does sums, sir.
- Oh, really, really.

459
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,223
Oh, well, we must give it something to do.

460
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,090
Uh, divide, uh, 5162 by, um, eight.

461
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,992
That's 645.25, sir.

462
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,158
Oh, yes, but you mustn't keep a dog
and bark yourself, you know.

463
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,292
<i>Check it up. Check it up.</i>

464
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,004
Oh, I say. That's really first class.

465
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,010
I must have a go at this.

466
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,239
Uh, now then, let's give it
something really difficult.

467
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,247
- One by 17.
- Is that difficult?

468
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,317
Oh, well, we can soon see.

469
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,221
You have to clear it first, sir.

470
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,852
You set up one there,
and you bang out 17 there.

471
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,760
Press that, sir.

472
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,173
0588...

473
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:48,041
- .05, sir.
- .05882352941.

474
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,046
Wonderful.

475
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,878
- And all from one.
- Extraordinary.

476
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,077
I wonder if you'd mind
writing that down for me.

477
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,313
I should like to take it home to my wife.

478
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,549
They like it so much, you know,
if you take a real interest.

479
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,558
- There you are, Minister.
- Oh, thank you very much.

480
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,754
I wish you could invent me something
that would write speeches. Good ones.

481
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,854
Ah, yes.
Or answer questions in the House for you.

482
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,230
Yes, that'd be even better.
Well, it's been most interesting.

483
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,361
Thank you so much, gentlemen.
Most interesting.

484
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,372
Uh, oh.

485
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,442
I was with the prime minister last night.

486
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,172
I thought perhaps you'd
like to know he's, uh, very confident.

487
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,181
I'll tell you another place
where they give you a very good meal.

488
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,275
- Now, if you mention...
- Oh, no. This way, Minister.

489
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,354
Yes, yes, yes.

490
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,064
- Hello?
- Hello, darling!

491
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,037
- Hello, Madeleine, darling.
- Joe, was that you just now?

492
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,040
No. Of course it wasn't me.

493
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,610
A minister of the crown...

494
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,408
and he's never seen
a calculating machine before.

495
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,924
- I saw Pinker at lunch.
- He's a gremlin.

496
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,557
- Says the minister's on his way out.
- Nonsense.

497
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,112
<i>Let them off first, please.</i>

498
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,612
What if he does go?

499
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,687
<i>Pretty obvious, isn't it?</i>

500
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:48,293
- You know, if the minister goes, the old man goes.
- Well, you don't have to go too.

501
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,197
But I like working for him. It wouldn't
be the same working for anyone else.

502
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,327
You could do it as well
as anyone else... better.

503
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,669
<i>- I couldn't run a fruit machine.
- Oh, you say so. I say you could.</i>

504
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,372
Darling, I'm sorry.

505
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,120
Let's stand.
I can't sit any longer.

506
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,406
I must have a drink.

507
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,408
Ask me to have a drink, woman.

508
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,569
Have a drink, Sammy.

509
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,648
Whisky?

510
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,050
No, thanks, Susan.
I'll have some of my nice medicine.

511
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,525
Sammy.

512
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,952
Darling.

513
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,589
Do you want dinner?

514
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,893
Do you?

515
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,406
Let it ring.

516
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,493
Hello, Snowball.

517
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:24,346
<i>It's like a nasty, vicious little man.</i>

518
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,423
<i>It's like Pinker.</i>

519
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,427
Who cares?

520
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,623
<i>Oh, Sammy, it might be Stuart.</i>

521
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,670
Oh, blast.

522
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,735
Blast and blast.

523
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,406
- Yes?
- Telegrams.

524
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,416
- Yes.
- Telegram for Rice.

525
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,782
- Yes.
- Message reads:

526
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:01,324
"Bala, B-A-L-A, North Wales,
as soon as you can.

527
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,325
Signed Stuart. "

528
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,260
- Shall I repeat that?
- No, thanks. You've done the damage.

529
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,923
- Pardon?
- Granted.

530
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,661
Oh, Sue.

531
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,740
Where on earth is Bala?

532
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,016
That's the place up there, sir.

533
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,403
Mr. Rice, Dr. Ellis.

534
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,202
Very glad to meet you, Mr. Rice.
Very glad indeed.

535
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,143
Who is he?

536
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,509
- Field gunner.
- Pretty young.

537
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,139
Only 19, Mr. Rice.

538
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,343
<i>Poor boy. Poor boy.</i>

539
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,216
Is he badly hurt?

540
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,257
Lord, yes.
The only wonder is he's still alive.

541
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,922
He's as near dead as a human being
can be and still be alive. Yes, indeed.

542
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,727
Has he told you anything yet?

543
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:27,201
He was conscious for two minutes last night
and another few seconds this morning.

544
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,637
- Were you with him all night?
- Only thing to do.

545
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:36,874
- Any chance, Doctor?
- No, no. He's fading out. Just fading out.

546
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,282
Extraordinary he's lasted so long.

547
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,353
Extraordinary thing,
the human body.

548
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,287
<i>- Yes, indeed.
- How much has he told you?</i>

549
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,024
The thing was lying in the heather.

550
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:56,428
It was a cylinder about 18 inches long
and a few inches in diameter.

551
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,130
It looked just like a big flashlight.

552
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,968
Some of it was black
and some bright red.

553
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,704
I didn't get that bit very clear,
but it was certainly plastic.

554
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,780
Did he pick it up?

555
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,849
He hasn't said yet.

556
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,419
I don't think he heard my questions.

557
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,649
He said he first wanted
to leave it alone and report it.

558
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,990
The rest of his battery
were waiting for him on the road.

559
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,497
And then he was afraid
he'd be laughed at as a sissy.

560
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,561
Go and turn in. I'll watch.

561
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:39,073
What do we ask him,
if we get the chance?

562
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,645
Sooner or later we'll get one of
these things to play with.

563
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,116
We must know
some of the things not to do.

564
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,709
Did he pick it up
or put his hand near it?

565
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,847
And if he picked it up,
was it by the end or by the middle?

566
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,091
Here you are, Captain Stuart.
Quickly.

567
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,193
Look, old man. Did you pick it up?

568
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,307
Did you pick it up?

569
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,381
Try to tell us. It's very important.

570
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,047
Did you pick it up, old man?

571
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,659
Can I do any harm now?

572
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,491
- No.
- Peterson, open your eyes and listen to me!

573
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,426
<i>Did you pick the thing up,
or did you not?</i>

574
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,930
Come on now. Tell me.
Did you pick it up?

575
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,907
- Come on. Speak up, man.
- Yes.

576
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,239
<i>You did?</i>

577
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,575
<i>By the end or by the middle?</i>

578
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,920
By the end or by the middle?

579
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,818
Sir...

580
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,400
- I think he's dead.
- Aye. He's gone.

581
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,597
You got something
of what you wanted?

582
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,673
Excuse me.

583
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,202
Go with him, Mr. Rice.
He... He's had enough.

584
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,607
<i>Aye. Enough indeed.</i>

585
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,814
Hello, Sammy.

586
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,475
Hello, Sue.
Got good ears, haven't you?

587
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,610
Got to have anything,
you better have them good.

588
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,950
How'd you get on?

589
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:10,186
Drew a blank. No sleep, no soap,
no towel, no breakfast.

590
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,319
- I'm just going to make tea.
- Good.

591
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,397
Stuart all right?

592
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,933
- Why? Interested?
- I like him.

593
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,526
- He's got guts.
- And bright blue eyes.

594
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,401
<i>And two feet.</i>

595
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,475
Now you're six years old.

596
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,747
Don't like it.

597
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,154
- Is Taylor in yet?
- Oh, he's just come in, sir.

598
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,226
Good.

599
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,420
Out, you. Excuse me, sir.

600
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,521
- Could I have a word with you in confidence?
- Of course.

601
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,532
It's about Taylor, sir.

602
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:54,195
He's been very idle lately. I'm afraid we're
gonna have a bit of trouble with him, sir.

603
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,205
- Trouble with Taylor?
- Trouble at home, sir.

604
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,468
Oh, I see.

605
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:03,535
- You mean his wife.
- I thought I ought to report it, sir.

606
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,673
- Are you sure that's what it is?
- Why, it's all over the place.

607
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,650
Drink and men and so on.

608
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,153
You know, Taylor's
a very innocent chap, sir.

609
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:15,282
Mmm. I saw her once.

610
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,485
Must say, she didn't look much like
the vicar's daughter.

611
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,494
Just what I said to myself, sir.

612
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:22,258
I took one look at her,
and I said, "Hello. "

613
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,004
Sidney, Sergeant Major Rose
would like a word with you.

614
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,082
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

615
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:46,654
Taylor. I'd like your opinion
as a fuse king.

616
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,927
Y- Yes, sir.

617
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,928
<i>Sit down.</i>

618
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,021
- Thank you, sir.
- If you wanted to blow me up...

619
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,032
and you were going to use, um...

620
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,069
that as a booby trap,
what sort of fuse would you use?

621
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:05,068
Oh, there are s-s-several
things I could do, sir.

622
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,744
A simple clock, of course.

623
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,343
It might go off
while I was out of the room.

624
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,610
Hmm. W-Would you be
I- likely to touch it, sir?

625
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,689
I might.

626
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,624
It could be arranged...

627
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,787
so that the I...

628
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:31,493
lifting of the lid operated the fuse, sir.

629
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,502
That could be either...

630
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,936
ooh, electrical...

631
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,476
or m... me... mechanical
or c-chemical.

632
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,239
Yes, but suppose I won't lift the lid.

633
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,717
Well, what I should do...

634
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:52,150
is use a t-t-trembler, sir.

635
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,691
That'd work as soon as you
m- m-moved the box.

636
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,387
Otherwise, a-a pho... photoelectric cell.

637
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,432
Only, of course, this thing
w- wouldn't be large enough.

638
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,864
Could you fix it so that you could throw it
through the window and it'd go off later?

639
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:12,237
Uh, could you fudge up a photoelectric fuse
in a thing a little larger in size...

640
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,209
that'd work any way up
and not be damaged by dropping it?

641
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,212
W- Way up. Yes.

642
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,248
Damage is no problem.

643
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:24,082
S... Space a little doubtful.

644
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,350
I see.
All right. Thank you, Taylor.

645
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,923
Any... Anything else, sir?

646
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,191
Yes. Is there anything wrong with you?

647
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,529
<i>I understand you're having
a certain amount of trouble at home.</i>

648
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,531
<i>- Y-Yes, sir.
- Your wife's not happy?</i>

649
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,076
That's right, sir.

650
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,236
Anything I can do?

651
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,314
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

652
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,610
<i>- Thank you, sir.
- You sure?</i>

653
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,685
Yes.

654
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,516
Uh, quite s-s-sure, sir.

655
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,217
- Well, unless, uh...
- Unless what?

656
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,491
Well, if... if you w-w-wouldn't mind, sir...

657
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:12,593
if I could get away
a f-few minutes early s-sometimes.

658
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:16,331
Sh-Sh-Sh-She's all on her own,
you see, sir, and...

659
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,408
if I could...

660
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,511
get away a bit early, sir.

661
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:26,013
Yes, of course.
I'll tell Sergeant Major Rose.

662
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,415
- Today?
- Oh, n-no, sir.

663
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:35,590
N- Not on a W... Wednesday, sir.

664
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,206
<i>Sue?</i>

665
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,243
I'm darned if I will.

666
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,102
At the third stroke...

667
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:39,801
it will be 7:53 and 10 seconds.

668
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,730
What's the use?

669
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,642
<i>Sammyl</i>

670
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,783
Oh, Sammy.

671
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,927
Thanks for all your help!

672
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,600
Where are you going, Sammy?

673
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,089
I did try to ring up.
There's something wrong with the line.

674
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,591
- Oh, to hell with the line!
- You didn't drink any, did you?

675
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,662
No, I didn't drink any.

676
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,401
I thought we agreed
never to work late on Wednesdays.

677
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,335
But, darling, it's Tuesday.

678
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,202
- Tuesday?
- Tuesday, the 23rd of March.

679
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,502
I ought to know. I've typed it all day.

680
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,578
Taylor said it was Wednesday.

681
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,847
- What day is it?
- Day? Monday.

682
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,509
- But yesterday was Monday.
- Why ask then?

683
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,819
Where were you going, Sammy?

684
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,522
I don't know.

685
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,565
A woman?

686
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,566
Maybe.

687
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:01,937
How about me?

688
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:28,025
Gentlemen, I have called this meeting
on the minister's instructions...

689
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,156
to clear up the position
of the Reeve's gun.

690
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,258
<i>- There have been extensive
demonstrations and experiments.</i>

691
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,803
<i>The question is now
what have those experiments shown...</i>

692
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,805
and what are we going to do about it?

693
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,875
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

694
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,945
Now you talk and I'll listen.

695
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,917
Professor Mair?

696
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,578
The Reeve's gun, Mr. Chairman...

697
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,816
is one of the most promising
developments I've seen...

698
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,791
from some points of view.

699
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,794
But that's only an opinion.

700
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:03,730
<i>I should like to hear other people
before being dogmatic.</i>

701
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,825
Um, we don't like the Reeve's,
Mr. Chairman.

702
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,767
You don't?

703
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,498
<i>No.</i>

704
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,508
It has a lot of snags
from the user point of view, and, uh...

705
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,670
we don't think it has sufficient
advantages to offset them.

706
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,804
That's an infernal noise going on here.

707
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,884
One could do with a course of lip reading
at these meetings.

708
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,510
Well, of course,
that's just the question.

709
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,455
What is the balance of advantage
and disadvantage?

710
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,627
Mr. Chairman.

711
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,288
It might be of interest to the meeting
to hear the views...

712
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,096
of the National
Scientific Advisory Council...

713
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,194
for which I have the honor
to be chairman.

714
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,932
Please.

715
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,235
The National Scientific Advisory Council...

716
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:48,333
For which he has the honor to be chairman.

717
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,004
Is the body officially deputed
by the cabinet...

718
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:55,050
to offer advice
on all major scientific issues.

719
01:00:55,151 --> 01:01:00,111
There are so many overlapping
and uncoordinated research organizations...

720
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:05,024
it was felt that science should speak
with one authoritative voice.

721
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,790
I need hardly add that our opinion
upon the Reeve's gun...

722
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:10,695
was not requested
until very late in the day.

723
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,201
Having been requested, however, my colleagues
and I approached this development...

724
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,203
purely as scientists.

725
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,001
As if everyone else had approached it
as income tax inspectors.

726
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:23,204
<i>A select committee was formed,
and every facility was afforded us.</i>

727
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:26,907
<i>- Our conclusion was that,
scientifically speaking...</i>

728
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,577
It was not a sound conception.

729
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,917
Not at all a sound conception.

730
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,252
<i>In fact, I go further...</i>

731
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,225
<i>and say that no scientist
could possibly feel happy...</i>

732
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,921
<i>about many of the principles involved.</i>

733
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,998
<i>I'm interested to hear that, Mr. Chairman...</i>

734
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:48,867
<i>because from our unscientific point of view,
that's what we thought.</i>

735
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,202
Just what scientific principles
do you think are unsound?

736
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:55,402
We're talking about
different sorts of principles.

737
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,945
We didn't like it
because it had user snags.

738
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,379
Yes.

739
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:04,977
Perhaps Mr. Brine could tell us who were
his colleagues on this select committee.

740
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,319
Professor Charn, Dr. Golder
and Dr. Peace.

741
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:12,686
One crystallographer...

742
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,229
one vital statistician...

743
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,234
one embryologist and, uh...

744
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,736
Dr. Brine is, of course, one of the best-known
organic chemists in the kingdom.

745
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,171
<i>Good. Now we know where we are.</i>

746
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,607
<i>No love lost between these back room boys.</i>

747
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:33,011
By the way, your committee did see
the gun firing, I take it.

748
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,084
We were not actually present
at the trials.

749
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,277
But you saw the gun fire?

750
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:40,082
You didn't just look at it
as a piece of furniture?

751
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,089
Scientific fellows, of course.

752
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,625
No, we did not see the gun firing.

753
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,354
Well, well.

754
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,457
Oh, never mind.

755
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,973
Mr. Chairman, I'm not a scientist...

756
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,235
but my reading
of the figures that I've seen...

757
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:03,801
shows that in practice we don't get
those advantages that are being talked about.

758
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:07,474
<i>I think Colonel Holland
is taking altogether too gloomy a view.</i>

759
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,920
Perhaps, Mr. Chairman,
you would allow Mr. Rice and my staff...

760
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,989
to read his summary of the figures.

761
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,081
<i>Please.</i>

762
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:19,161
These figures are averages
of firings at 85 yards.

763
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,428
Carry on the blackout, sir?

764
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,058
<i>The propellant type throughout
was cordite mark nine.</i>

765
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,194
<i>Charge weight in pounds:2.75.</i>

766
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,738
<i>...1,980.</i>

767
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,967
<i>Penetration in inches:2.087.</i>

768
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:37,671
<i>Charge weight in pounds:3.5.
Muzzle velocity in feet per second:2, 183.</i>

769
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,873
<i>Penetration in inches:2.28.</i>

770
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,212
<i>With moving targets,
average range: 90 yards.</i>

771
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,311
<i>Lightest charge weight:2.75 pounds.
Average time per round: Eight seconds.</i>

772
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:50,222
<i>Heaviest charge weight: Four pounds.
Average time between rounds:22 seconds.</i>

773
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,988
Small charge...
small penetration, minimum interval.

774
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:56,292
Large charge... greatest penetration,
maximum interval.

775
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:05,731
The summary will, of course,
be circulated.

776
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,402
I should like to ask Mr. Rice
what it all adds up to.

777
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,945
Why, I think Professor Mair's already
given the view of the section.

778
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:12,912
And you share that view?

779
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,246
<i>- Oh, come. It's scarcely a fair question, is it?
- Why not?</i>

780
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,685
Well, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Rice is one
of Professor Mair's junior officers.

781
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,758
Quite. I don't think you can ask Rice
to argue with his chief, Holland.

782
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,727
Mr. Chairman, I want to be quite frank.
We don't like this gun.

783
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,354
We're told those figures show
that we're wrong.

784
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:32,263
Professor Mair suggested that his expert
should give us the figures.

785
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,804
<i>Surely I'm entitled to know
what those figures mean.</i>

786
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,102
<i>After all, this is an important matter.</i>

787
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:43,406
<i>It is not the prestige of a particular
department that is involved...</i>

788
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,776
but men's lives.

789
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:50,717
If the Reeve's gun is accepted,
sooner or later men will have to fight with it.

790
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:55,280
If we've been too optimistic,
they'll be the sufferers. We shan't.

791
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:06,261
Well, well, Mr. Chairman.
No one wants to hide anything.

792
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:10,169
If Colonel Holland would like Mr. Rice's views,
I have no objection at all.

793
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,935
Well, Mr. Rice?

794
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,806
I agree with Professor Mair
that the idea is excellent.

795
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,609
And the weapon?

796
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:28,018
I don't think it's right yet.

797
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,685
Would you be happy to see it
accepted in its present form...

798
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,531
on those figures?

799
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,669
<i>No, I shouldn't.</i>

800
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:48,309
<i>You must realize that you can have ideas
that'll win the war four times over...</i>

801
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,471
but it still won't do anybody any good
unless you can sell them.

802
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,777
<i>We're not in a university department now.</i>

803
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:57,717
No, nor in an advertising agency,
where you belong.

804
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,449
Now, look here, Sammy. You may think you're a great
big scientist and I'm just a commercial stooge...

805
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,617
but the plain fact is, if you make
a mess of things, I have to clear it up!

806
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:08,185
And the equally plain fact is the stuff you build
a reputation on comes chiefly out of my head!

807
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,960
I'm not a politician or a salesman,
but neither am I a kid of 10!

808
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:29,682
Not 10, Sammy, eight.

809
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:32,379
Ten is what you are
when you're not cross.

810
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,387
Good Lord! It's 4:00.
Miss! Oh, miss!

811
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,562
<i>Pot of tea for two, miss.</i>

812
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,563
It's ready.

813
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,032
<i>Did you hear Sammy
calling me an advertising agent?</i>

814
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,332
As you were both shouting at the tops
of your voices, I could hardly help it.

815
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:54,102
Oh, no. He was.
I was calm, cool and good-tempered.

816
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,043
You know, Sue,
I'm a much misunderstood man.

817
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,944
I'm not appreciated.
That's my trouble.

818
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,017
I appreciate you.

819
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,213
Both of you.

820
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,572
That's number one.
Do you want number two?

821
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,547
Number two is Pinker and Waring
are dining together tonight...

822
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:41,122
at your club.

823
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,987
- But Pinker's backing Brine.
- That's number three.

824
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:47,654
- Brine will take over the section.
- What? That thug?

825
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,663
Want to bet?

826
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:51,733
Will you resign if he does?

827
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,730
It hasn't happened yet.
I'm not sure.

828
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,966
Well, I am. You won't.

829
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,270
You'll let all this happen,
and when it has...

830
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,607
you'll see there won't be any section
if you go.

831
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,977
So you'll hang around hating it and
expecting everybody else to be sorry for you.

832
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,313
- Stop grousing.
- I won't!

833
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,319
You've gotta see yourself for once
as Pinker and R.B. See you.

834
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,616
They're just using you!

835
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,317
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yes!

836
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,020
You can't expect me to come in with Pinker
to get Mair out.

837
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:22,859
- You can't stop them!
- Maybe not, but I needn't exactly help them.

838
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,832
You could run the section yourself.
Even Pinker says so.

839
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,837
But you just won't face things.

840
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,170
You go on being sorry for yourself
with everything in the world to live for.

841
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,607
<i>But what's so special
about only having one foot?</i>

842
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,269
<i>Shut up, you little...</i>

843
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:40,007
You can't be a professional footballer.
So what?

844
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,550
You think what you're doing
is good and honorable and loyal?

845
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:45,051
Well, it isn't.
You just haven't got the guts!

846
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:49,316
- Will you shut up?
- Every word I said is true.

847
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,985
Oh, Sammy, you're such a fool.

848
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:56,895
Why don't you pull yourself together, Sue?
You're making an ass of yourself.

849
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,592
Why, Mr. Rice!

850
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,560
- Sitting here all by yourself!
- No, Susan's with me.

851
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,632
- But she's gone.
- Right.

852
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,963
There's no good looking at me like that,
Mr. Rice.

853
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:36,936
We met her leaving,
and she'd been crying.

854
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:39,132
You can't fool an old campaigner.

855
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,175
Mike, let me have the bill.

856
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,619
Next time you just decide to go home
when we're out together...

857
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,699
I'd be obliged if you'd tell me.

858
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:30,682
I've been thinking, if you really think
I'm such a poor sap as you said tonight...

859
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,818
we'd better get out of each other's way.

860
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,532
The same thought had occurred to me.

861
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:44,902
Why can't you get tough
with anyone but me?

862
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:48,067
Why can't you get tough with Waring?
He gives you cause enough.

863
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,806
You can't quarrel with R.B.
He won't keep it up.

864
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,348
Why should he decide who quarrels?
Why shouldn't you?

865
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:58,216
I'm no good at rows. I loathe them.

866
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,254
<i>Why?</i>

867
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:02,256
Well...

868
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:05,683
Don't you?

869
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:10,761
Not particularly.
Sometimes I like them.

870
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:18,472
Look, Sammy. This is it.

871
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,042
You've gotta make up your mind...

872
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:25,978
whether you're gonna spend the rest of your life
being someone it's just too bad about or not.

873
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,031
Last one, Mr. Rice.

874
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:57,271
- It's half an hour till closing time.
- Closing time for you right now, Mr. Rice.

875
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:02,506
What do you mean, Knucksie?

876
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:06,748
I mean that I like you and Miss Susan
too much to let you get stinking in my bar.

877
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,551
That to Miss Susan...

878
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,819
and that to you, Knucksie.

879
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,895
Two and fourpence.

880
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,945
Your change.

881
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:36,910
Look here, Mr. Rice.
Take a walk home.

882
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,283
Walk will do you good.

883
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,259
You know,
the trouble with you, Knucksie...

884
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:50,194
is that you're a sob sitting...

885
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,698
- pint pushing...
- Caution! Caution, my friend. Ladies here.

886
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,048
Publican.

887
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:12,646
<i>- What is he doing?
- Anyone ever give you a sick ear, Knucksie?</i>

888
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,781
Not without paying cash for it.

889
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,328
You go home.

890
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,897
All right.

891
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:28,498
- Sir.
- Shut up.

892
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,629
That's just what I will do.

893
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,230
Go home.

894
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:36,573
And you can keep your gut-rot stuff.

895
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:40,445
I got my own drink.

896
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,279
- It's home.
- That's right. That's right.

897
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:46,877
# Knucksie wouldn't give me
another drink #

898
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,014
#Another drink #

899
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:52,992
# Knucksie wouldn't give me
another drink ##

900
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,630
That's right!

901
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,830
Hmm. My own drink.

902
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:10,001
# Dum-da-di, dum-dum-da-di #

903
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,833
Sue?

904
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,305
Sue!

905
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,744
Snowball?

906
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,064
My own drink, see?

907
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,273
All mine.

908
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,210
Flowers!

909
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,420
Just a touch.

910
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,494
Well, get out of it!

911
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,114
Get out and stay out.

912
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:15,728
Woman, you can ring
till you're blue in the face.

913
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:20,868
Hello? Hello? Riverside 9090?

914
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,903
Hello? Hello?

915
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,448
Riverside 9090?

916
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:32,884
Is Mr. Rice there?
Captain Stuart calling Mr. Rice.

917
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,252
Hello! Hello!

918
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:38,918
Riverside 9090. Hello?

919
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:42,829
Hello. Riverside 9090.

920
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,365
- Huh?
- What?

921
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:48,561
- Hello?
- Wait a minute.

922
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:52,606
Speak up. Captain Stuart,
I've got your Riverside number.

923
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,767
Good. Hello, Sammy.

924
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:58,676
Look, I've got two of them.
Now listen, old man. I have got two of them.

925
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,714
- What?
- One, two.

926
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,444
- I'm at Chesil Bank near...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

927
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,520
You come from Waterloo.
You got it clear?

928
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,387
I'm gonna have a bash at the first one.
You can have a go at the second, if you're lucky.

929
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:12,426
Now, are you listening, old boy?
Because it's very important.

930
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,654
- I've got two.
- Wait a minute, Stuart.

931
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:17,357
What? Oh, hurry up.

932
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:52,699
What is it, Stuart?

933
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:16,223
You'd better wait till I get there.

934
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:19,782
Nothing doing.
We can't do a Laurel and Hardy, old boy.

935
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:24,525
If anything goes haywire on the first bomb, one of
us wants to be left to get a spanner on the second.

936
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:28,000
Don't be so cocky.
Wait till I get down.

937
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,435
I've got a lot of things to suggest.

938
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,440
Fine. You can try them on number two.
Number one's mine.

939
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,204
After all, I found them.

940
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,575
What are the trains?

941
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,241
5:30 a. m. You'll have to
get up early, you lazy hound.

942
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,318
See you for breakfast.

943
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,977
Stuart!

944
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:51,082
Stuart, be careful, for the love of Mike,
and good luck.

945
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,161
Same to you.

946
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:55,491
I say, hope you won't need it.

947
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,422
<i>- Mr. Rice?
- Yes.</i>

948
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:26,483
Oh, my name's Pearson, sir. I've got a car here
to take you on to Colonel Strang.

949
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:45,141
- Back to the beach.
- Has Captain Stuart done anything yet?

950
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,381
Oh, yes.

951
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,981
Rotten business.

952
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,454
I thought you knew, but, of course,
you couldn't. You were on the train.

953
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:01,926
- Is he dead?
- Oh, yes. Yes, killed instantly.

954
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:06,694
Apparently they thought he'd done it,
and then something went wrong and it went up.

955
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:33,227
Mr. Rice, sir.

956
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:37,092
How are you?
My name's Strang.

957
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,167
All right, Don. Thank you.

958
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,964
Do you know this part of the world?

959
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:48,406
No.

960
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,876
But you've heard of Chesil Bank,
I suppose.

961
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,573
Yes, I've heard of it.

962
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,877
Now, well, there it is, you see?

963
01:20:57,786 --> 01:21:00,254
<i>The lagoon there's called the Fleet...</i>

964
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:04,382
<i>and that shallow over there
is Portland Bill.</i>

965
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:09,263
Are you a fuse expert?

966
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,457
I've done a lot of work
on experimental fuses.

967
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,466
Hmm.

968
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:17,004
Dick Stuart told me last night that he
arranged with you that he should try it first...

969
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,266
then if anything went wrong,
you should have a go.

970
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,365
- Is that right?
- Yes.

971
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:25,139
Yeah. He says it's all very fine.

972
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,738
But, you know,
we've got plenty of people here...

973
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,818
chaps like young Don Pearson,
who brought you up...

974
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:34,548
only too anxious to go out there
and give that thing a few good clouts...

975
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,681
with a hammer and chisel.

976
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:39,385
Only I don't think it happens to be
that kind of a job.

977
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,630
I've been in on this with Stuart
from the start.

978
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:50,034
We had a fairly definite plan
mapped out.

979
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,663
If I could have his notes,
I think I'd be all right.

980
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:54,901
Yes.

981
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,672
But, you see, I'm not worrying about you.

982
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,906
I'm worrying about me.

983
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:02,575
I let you do it, you go out there
and blow yourself to blazes...

984
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,845
what's your family gonna say, hmm?

985
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:06,921
<i>Your boss, heaven knows who.</i>

986
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:12,023
No family.
Professor Mair knows all about it...

987
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,596
and heaven can wait.

988
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:19,666
I've got a list of things here I'd like.

989
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,707
Yes.

990
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,378
All right.
You'd better hear Stuart's notes.

991
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,641
Well, would you like to tell me
how he worked?

992
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:39,584
He used a field telephone
all the time he was working...

993
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,249
explaining what he was doing
and all sorts of other things.

994
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:47,385
I'm afraid it's a bit of a jumble.
I... I haven't had time to sort it all out.

995
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:50,293
The things I saw and things he said.

996
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,798
I have to read it all back to you
as it happened.

997
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:54,869
Oh, they're your own shorthand notes,
are they?

998
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,404
- Of course.
- Why, of course?

999
01:22:57,505 --> 01:23:01,202
- Nobody else could read them back.
- Oh, I see.

1000
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:03,539
All right. Let's go, shall we?

1001

01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:06,387
Here they are, Sarge.

1060
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:22,431
Telephone!

1061
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:24,505
<i>- All right, lad?
- Fine.</i>

1062
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:33,112
- All set?
- Stethoscope.

1063
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,114
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1064
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:40,012
You'll find it'll play out quite easily, sir.
Drop your head when you want to speak.

1065
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,055
- Right.
- Shall I carry the bag, sir?

1066
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:45,592
- No, give it to me.
- You can see the flag, sir. Good luck.

1067
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:47,593
- Good luck.
- Good luck, sir.

1068
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:50,163
- All the best, sir. - Good
luck, old man. - All right.

1069
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,435
It's a bigger sea running
than this morning.

1070
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,748
Further down the coast,
there's a good stretch for surfing.

1071
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:14,049
- You ever done any of that?
- Yes, but not for 10 years.

1072
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:28,734
Stop.

1073
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,430
All right.
Shall I take it now?

1074
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:34,201
Are you gonna start
with the same tests that Stuart did?

1075
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,107
Yes. There's always the chance
this one might be different.

1076
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,577
That's what I thought.

1077
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:42,514
Well, you sure you can manage?

1078
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,585
Suppose I'll have to.

1079
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:48,549
Yes. Well, good luck.

1080
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:53,425
Good luck, my boy.

1081
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:29,921
Make way.

1082
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,999
- All right here?
- Yes.

1083
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:39,871
I'm just testing the wire. Give me a wave
if you can hear me, will you?

1084
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:43,808
Testing wire, sir.
I hear him loud and clear.

1085
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:46,944
Right.

1086
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,121
I'm burying the earthing rods.

1087
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:06,063
I'm now going to test it for metal.

1088
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:28,150
Says, "These pebbles are the devil.

1089
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,656
"I slipped and nearly clouted it.

1090
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,360
I'm trying now for heat. "

1091
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:04,123
He's out of the trench.
He's about halfway up to it.

1092
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:24,809
"I am placing stethoscope beside bomb. "

1093
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:33,816
- No ticking, sir.
- Look, all these wires are a bit of a nuisance.

1094
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:36,151
I'm gonna take this thing off,
put it on the ground...

1095
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:38,885
and speak into it
when I have something to say.

1096
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:55,235
First of all, I'll try and get the clamps
on the bomb to hold it...

1097
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:57,777
and then work on it with the wrenches,
just like Stuart did.

1098
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:03,447
He'll be in trouble with the clamps
on those pebbles.

1099
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:06,349
He's got the clamps
and the pipe wrenches out.

1100
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:14,226
He says, "I've got the jaws in line.
Now I'll tighten them. "

1101
01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:18,994
Says, "This is trickier than I thought.

1102
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,796
They're bound to pull the bomb a bit
when they grip. "

1103
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:23,803
Well, here goes.

1104
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:28,868
Crikey!

1105
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:38,116
Well, that's got the first one on.

1106
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,278
It moved a bit, but, uh...

1107
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,357
as you all gather, nothing happened.

1108
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:45,857
I'm sweating like a pig.
I must mop off.

1109
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:03,836
Now for the second clamp.

1110
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:06,243
I'm going to move some of these pebbles.

1111
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:16,822
You dare.

1112
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:19,518
"I'm putting on the second clamp.

1113
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,453
"Much easier.

1114
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:25,532
"Okay, it's on.

1115
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:29,102
"Now for the wrenches.

1116
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:34,772
I'm going to unscrew the cap
exactly as Stuart did. "

1117
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:55,521
Says, "Very difficult.

1118
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:59,461
Should have waited a bit
before starting again. "

1119
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:04,196
Says, "Too much whisky.
Could do with one now. "

1120
01:34:23,257 --> 01:34:25,725
Done it! Done it, sir!

1121
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:08,627
Yes, it's just as Stuart says.

1122
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:10,704
The clock mechanism is in the head.

1123
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:13,205
There's a long lead coming out of it...

1124
01:35:13,307 --> 01:35:16,504
with two flat bits attached,
which may be insulators.

1125
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:22,344
In the top of the body there's a simple
trembler tongue lying between terminals.

1126
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,519
I'm earthing them.

1127
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,462
And this is where Stuart went wrong.

1128
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:46,466
I can see the hole
going down into the body.

1129
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:51,468
And as Stuart says,
the long lead seems too long.

1130
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:55,948
Now what?

1131
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:58,314
Says, "I think I've got it.

1132
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,885
"There's a shorter and a longer lead.

1133
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:07,958
"The shorter lead
winds right up into the clock...

1134
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:10,326
so that no lead is left showing. "

1135
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,491
That's what fooled Stuart.

1136
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:16,365
I can just see the ends of the insulators.

1137
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:22,106
The lead which Stuart found
must go to a second trembler fuse in the body.

1138
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:24,109
It's a double booby trap.

1139
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:27,009
"Jerry certainly is no gentleman.

1140
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:32,118
I am going to look for another way
into the body. "

1141
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:41,728
Yes. There is another way in.

1142
01:36:43,998 --> 01:36:47,297
There's a cap on each end...
only one's obvious, and the other isn't.

1143
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:52,397
Well, I suppose this is where I go to work
with the pipe wrenches again.

1144
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:55,566
"I am now going to unscrew
the second cap.

1145
01:36:57,511 --> 01:37:01,675
Stand by.
This is where we came in. "

1146
01:37:01,782 --> 01:37:03,477
Steady.

1147
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:11,918
Wait a minute.

1148
01:37:12,026 --> 01:37:14,392
Christmas, this may not be so easy.

1149
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:21,496
If the second trembler's in the body,
then it's all right to unscrew the cap.

1150
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:24,833
But if it's in the cap, then unscrewing it
will send the whole thing up.

1151
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:28,375
So I've gotta make up my mind whether
to hold the body still and unscrew the cap...

1152
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:31,069
or hold the cap still
and unscrew the body.

1153
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:35,274
"Three-to-one
that it's the cap I have to unscrew.

1154
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:38,584
Any takers?"

1155
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:42,955
He's got the pipe wrench
on the other end.

1156
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:53,965
I must do it. I must!

1157
01:37:54,068 --> 01:37:55,797
He's all in.
He'll never make it.

1158
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:08,104
<i>I must.</i>

1159
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:10,911
If that wrench slips, he's had it.

1160
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,528
- He's down.
- Stand clear!

1161
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,034
Hold on, Rice! I'm coming!

1162
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:34,040
Interfering son of a...

1163
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:40,675
- I think you've done enough.
- Stay where you are.

1164
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:52,826
There is a second trembler.

1165
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:58,721
And I've only got to bang it
to send the whole thing up.

1166
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:42,870
Satisfied?

1167
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,877
Sorry.

1168
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:48,910
- It was a personal matter.
- Yes.

1169
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,984
Yes, I know all about that.

1170
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:54,220
Dick Stuart just the same.

1171
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:58,923
Well, and what do we do now?

1172
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:04,464
Oh, you just get your chaps up
and steam the charge out.

1173
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:06,533
That's all, is it?

1174
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:10,102
That's all.

1175
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:30,023
- Got everything you want?
- Yes, thanks.

1176
01:40:30,124 --> 01:40:32,592
Book, bun, sandwiches.
Did the mess sergeant give you a drink?

1177
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:34,888
Yes. And I think I'll go
and put my feet up.

1178
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:37,964
Yes, I should if I were you.
You've earned it.

1179
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:41,967
Well, good-bye, my dear fellow.

1180
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:46,700
Look here. Anybody ever has
any doubt about what you can do...

1181
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:51,744
with your hands, your arms
or any other part of you...

1182
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:53,813
you send them along to me,
do you see?

1183
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:20,273
<i>Hello. Who's that?</i>

1184
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:22,865
Uh, Taylor, sir.

1185
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:25,410
Oh, hello, Taylor.
Anybody still here?

1186
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:28,845
- Mr. Till and Miss Susan, sir.
- Right.

1187
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:32,407
- Excuse me, sir. Could... Could I... Could I trouble you for a moment?
- Of course.

1188
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:36,250
I... I understand that the fuse work
is being transferred away from here, sir.

1189
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:39,018
Mmm. Professor Mair's
taking it back to his own lab.

1190
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:43,426
He very kindly said he'd take me along
with him, sir, to carry on the fuse work.

1191
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:45,828
That's what they told me.

1192
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:49,232
Oh. They... They won't let me, sir.

1193
01:41:49,336 --> 01:41:51,304
What do you mean
they won't let you?

1194
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:55,603
Well, they said because he can't have
uniformed men with him, sir.

1195
01:41:56,877 --> 01:41:59,937
- I'm to go back to general duties.
- That's ridiculous.

1196
01:42:00,981 --> 01:42:03,040
Yes, sir.

1197
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:07,246
But I... I can't leave home
just now, sir...

1198
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:09,322
not with the way things are.

1199
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:13,685
I'd rather do anything.

1200
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,932
I don't know, sir.

1201
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:22,635
Can't go. I just...

1202
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:26,568
Taylor. Leave this to me.

1203
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:31,110
Don't worry, and don't do anything rash.

1204
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:33,179
I promise you it'll be all right.

1205
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:38,983
Well, thank you, sir.

1206
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:42,214
Now get along home.
There's a good chap.

1207
01:42:57,771 --> 01:42:59,762
- Evening, Crowhurst.
- Evening, sir.

1208
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,106
- Hello, Till.
- Hello.

1209
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:07,442
- How'd you get on?
- Oh, all right.

1210
01:43:07,548 --> 01:43:09,345
- Good.
- Any news?

1211
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:11,349
Holland phoned twice.

1212
01:43:11,451 --> 01:43:13,817
Madeleine phoned seven times.

1213
01:43:13,921 --> 01:43:16,981
There's a rumor Mair's out
and Brine's in.

1214
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:18,990
- Anyone ask after me?
- Susan.

1215
01:43:19,092 --> 01:43:21,083
- She did?
- I didn't tell her though.

1216
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:23,163
Good old Tilly.

1217
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:46,485
- Hello.
- Hello.

1218
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:51,116
Well?

1219
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:55,685
Colonel Holland wants you to go
to the War Office as soon as you come in...

1220
01:43:55,796 --> 01:43:57,764
no matter how late.

1221
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:01,365
Room 583.

1222
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:05,431
What do you want?

1223
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:07,507
I want you to go.

1224
01:44:09,643 --> 01:44:11,611
<i>Don't knock. Come in.</i>

1225
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:16,908
Sorry to be late, sir. I've been out on a job.
I didn't get your message till I got back.

1226
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:19,315
All right. Don't waste words.
Sit down.

1227
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:22,481
Sit down, sit down.

1228
01:44:22,589 --> 01:44:24,352
What did you make of Strang?

1229
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:30,226
- He's all right.
- Yeah, he feels the same about you.

1230
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:36,329
Now then, it may or may not
have escaped your notice...

1231
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:39,428
that up till now
we have been losing the war.

1232
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:43,942
<i>Nevertheless, it is the intention of
His Majesty's government that we shall win it.</i>

1233
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:47,343
And contrary to the impression
conveyed by the popular press...

1234
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:50,439
it will be won by the army,
the navy and the air force.

1235
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:55,421
In that order.

1236
01:45:06,867 --> 01:45:10,860
Now then, the army is to have
its own research section.

1237
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:13,531
The man in charge
will have a free hand, equipment...

1238
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:17,337
<i>- Personnel?
- Anything. We want results.</i>

1239
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:21,107
<i>Of course, you'll, um...
you'll have to be in uniform.</i>

1240
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:23,444
<i>Otherwise you'll never get anything.</i>

1241
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:25,518
<i>We'll make you a major or something.</i>

1242
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:30,252
- Well, what do you say?
- I accept.

1243
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:32,382
You do?

1244
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:35,586
- I never thought you would.
- Nor did I.

1245
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:43,466
- Well?
- Well?

1246
01:45:45,305 --> 01:45:47,933
I want to talk to you.

1247
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:50,942
- All right.
- Hickory Tree?

1248
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:54,412
Lord Nelson?

1249
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:58,151
Home?

1250
01:46:01,988 --> 01:46:04,513
- One thing I don't like.
- Only one?

1251
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:08,060
- Your coming back on condition.
- What condition?

1252
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:10,857
- That I went to the War Office.
- Come on in.

1253
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:33,119
Oh, Sue.

1254
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:48,090
Even the whisky.

1255
01:46:50,437 --> 01:46:52,405
Have a drink, Sammy.
