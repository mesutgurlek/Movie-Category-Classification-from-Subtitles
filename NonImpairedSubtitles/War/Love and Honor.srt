1
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:26,861
Morning. In less than 48 hours, a man
his first trip to the moon bet ... 

2
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:29,006
with the hope to land. 

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,822
While tensions over the war
continue to escalate in Vietnam ... 

4
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:37,892
the eyes of the world at Cape Kennedy
directed where they work round the clock ...

5
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,251
to Apollo 11 to prepare
before launch. 

6
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:44,682
After a four-day journey through space,
astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ...

7
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:50,743
planned to set foot on the moon,
late Sunday evening, July 20. 

8
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,957
Quality over Quantity (QoQ) Releases
Love and Honor (2013)

9
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:16,824


10
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:15,323
Hey, Joiner.
Is not it time for a snack?

11
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,290
What did he do now?

12
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,248
Seems that our friends again
have a surprise ready.

13
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,519
Handsome seen.

14
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,549
All right, thanks, Joiner.

15
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,052
Thank you, Joiner.

16
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,185
How does he do it anyway?

17
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,228
Tell Jane that she must stop her teachers
to poles and a surprise packet to send.

18
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:56,024
Shut up you ever?
- Make sure they Cheez Whiz sends.

19
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,744
Thanks, Joiner.

20
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:01,981
Come on, do you ever wonder story.
- Where was I again?

21
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:07,995
You were in the ferris wheel with Miss Ohio, in a
exciting satin dress, tiara, the whole rigmarole.

22
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,145
Come on now.
- Yes, of course.

23
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,730
We're in 't rad, she looks at me,
I look at her, and so.

24
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:16,717
Just as we did above ...

25
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,261
that bastard falls silent.

26
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,083
So what, they always fall silent.
To let people off and boarding.

27
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,589
No, I mean really stop.
A gear broken or something.

28
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:29,782
Here I am, with Miss Ohio,
at the top.

29
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:33,084
Looking down at all the lights down.
An open sky above us.

30
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,743
A crowd of people below.

31
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:41,987
Yes, tell more.
- She looks me straight in the eyes.

32
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:45,619
And it feels very intensely.

33
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:51,725
Before I know, her scarf, does her
dress and her hands all over my body.

34
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:53,385
That's it.

35
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,296
I'm home a thousand times
in a wheel before.

36
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,223
Why me never.
- Of course.

37
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:02,618
They were your own hands on your body.

38
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,639
Not funny, not laugh.

39
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:14,541
What is the purpose of nightwatchman?

40
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,059
The claymore's are drawn. These will be
deal with creeps walking around.

41
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,975
HQ, here Jolly-2.

42
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,781
We'd like a large pepperoni pizza
with extra cheese and do it fast, you want.

43
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:41,328
Come on. That was funny.
Not even a smile?

44
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:47,766
Wright, would you just shut up once.

45
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:20,364
HQ, here Jolly-2.

46
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,215
Requests reinforcement.
We are under fire.

47
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:36,307
I'm out of ammo.

48
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,590
Ammo.

49
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:44,085
Okay, guys?
- It was about time.

50
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,775
Stay awake.

51
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,825
We now <i> countries. </ i>

52
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,502
LZ is secure.
- Hurry up.

53
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:55,311
Hold on, gonna be okay.
Doc, you really should go.

54
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:57,145
On the count of three,
a ... two ...

55
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,997
Okay buddy?
- All good.

56
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,588
Suddenly arrested.

57
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:40,889
Bulletproof? Really.

58
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,630
What about Burns?

59
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,238
They transported him to Da Nang.
If he stabilized, he may go home.

60
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,350
And you?
Is it?

61
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,354
Oh, fuck.

62
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,711
Makes no sense.

63
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:13,202
Well, there were fewer letters and packages.

64
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,870
But she had her exams and final exams.

65
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:20,960
Michigan is a big change
from high school in Indiana, you know.

66
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:24,686
But this?

67
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,603
That's not Jane.

68
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:32,008
We had it all planned.
We had our plan.

69
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:35,292
You think there's someone else ...
- Do not say it.

70
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:45,274
I'm sorry for you, dude.
- What should I do now?

71
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,931
A new plan.

72
00:10:03,928 --> 00:10:09,267
HONG KONG KAI TAK
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

73
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,287
Listen carefully.

74
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:17,441
You know how to do it,
but I'll say it anyway.

75
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:22,398
Everything you say and everything you do,
reflected in each of us ...

76
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:24,312
and our entire country.

77
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:28,956
So remember gentlemen,
get drunk, fall in love ...

78
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,206
whatever you want, but ...

79
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:34,922
a week from today, at 8:00
you can find no better return.

80
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,845
Is that clear?

81
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,739
I said, is that clear?

82
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,625
Dismissed.
Check it.

83
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:50,813
Well, first stop, Madam Whos. For a
price you get it gal, the drink and the room.

84
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,044
This is home.
- Whores and drink, that is him!

85
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,566
From there we distribute, we do
exploration and if the situation permits ...

86
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:01,450
as the chicks somewhere else much better,
we change places.

87
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,959
Joiner really need a professional.

88
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:08,023
Where is he?
- You mean Joiner?

89
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,908
Let's go find him.
- You guys go on, I find him so.

90
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:14,391
He is likely to call themselves
fools making.

91
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:16,399
I follow you immediately.

92
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:26,034
What are you planning?
- I'm going back to Jane to see.

93
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:33,297
Jane is gone.
You can not just take a plane back ...

94
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:35,824
in the middle of a war
because you miss your girl.

95
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:40,880
You have surely heard Johnson?
About a week to 8:00, I'm back.

96
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:44,681
Soldiers fly free.
- This is no joke, dude.

97
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:49,654
So close I came to my death.

98
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:51,974
An inch thick.

99
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,004
I have a second chance, and I'm really not
blow by a week in Hong Kong to fuck.

100
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,235
I get it already So ??you go in its place,
the rest of your life ruin.

101
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,498
Deserteer and you go for the ax.
That will forever be in your file.

102
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:06,348
I'm just a deserter
if I'm not back in time.

103
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,510
You were dumped.
This is not fun and that touches you.

104
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:14,886
I am sorry But believe me when I tell you,
there are a million other girls ...

105
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:18,193
with all the same limb
in all the same places.

106
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,499
But there is only one Jane.

107
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,397
It's just a girl.

108
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:29,927
A girl, I'm sorry but I have to
say it again, because it does not penetrate ...

109
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:32,877
no longer wants to be with you.

110
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:37,654
Until next week.

111
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:55,063
Come here.

112
00:12:57,032 --> 00:13:00,571
<i> T minus 15 seconds.
Control to the cockpit. </ I>

113
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:02,965
<i> Twelve ... eleven ... ten ... </ i>

114
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,342
Mark my words.

115
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:08,547
You'll never forget where you were
like those guys on the moon.

116
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:09,824
Yes.

117
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:13,462
<i> Two ... a ... zero. </ i>

118
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:14,510
DEPARTING FLIGHTS

119
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,138
Can I sit at the window?

120
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,830
What are you doing here?
- Soldiers fly free.

121
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:27,315
I really mean it, you should get off the plane.
- I can not my buddy in the lurch.

122
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,497
Not to mention that if someone accomplish this
gets and it can tell, I 't have.

123
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:36,725
This is not a stunt.
- They're going to get what when they hear this.

124
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,949
Do you thirsty? I'm thirsty.

125
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:48,857
Stop it.

126
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:54,553
Every day there is a,
only if you survive it.

127
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,523
So many nights in ambush,
not knowing who attacks ...

128
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:03,018
not knowing if it's your last night.

129
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:09,861
If I had known that it would be so ...

130
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:14,875
Here, among the clouds, with two
of the most beautiful angels I ever saw.

131
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:22,298
Then there was Uncle Sam
allowed to keep all my medals.

132
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:24,912
This is more than sufficient to pay.

133
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,459
Duty calls.

134
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:34,037
We'll talk more later.
- Good.

135
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:44,382
I must say, Wright,
You're a slick.

136
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:47,333
Oh, it was nothing, really.
I made just for my buddy.

137
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:50,284
He thought it might be like
with two stewardesses.

138
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,199
You're welcome, really.
- She was scared.

139
00:14:53,244 --> 00:14:55,541
The blonde or brunette?

140
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:58,452
Jane.

141
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:03,523
It was easier for her to
so to do, than to worry ...

142
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,933
I may or may not come back alive.

143
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:10,165
If I let her see that I'm okay,
that nothing will happen to me ...

144
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:12,349
turns them on.

145
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:15,484
I just want you to be prepared ...
- We promised each other ...

146
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,006
that we were not officially engaged
until I was back. We wanted 't risk it.

147
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:25,468
But ...
I think they might need.

148
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:30,046
Something to hold on to it.
That together we can strongholds.

149
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,022
I'm gonna ask her to marry.

150
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:42,813
That's awesome, dude.

151
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,061
Great idea.

152
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:51,039
<i> Ladies and gentlemen, Apollo 11 is out
the atmosphere and all systems are good. </ i>

153
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:55,384
<i> I know also the crew good luck
wishes for their historic journey to the moon. </ i>

154
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:17,832
Look at that statue.
I call it the stone dick.

155
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,451
Summarize your guy? Because it's just ...
- Yeah, right. I take him!

156
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,935
How you doing, sweetheart?

157
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:34,837
A dinner will not work right?

158
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:37,958
It would be the next right.
- Fuck you, baby killer.

159
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,614
Pardon?

160
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:41,933
Never mind.

161
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:46,867
What happened to,
thanks for your service to the fatherland.

162
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:16,433
Hey, big guy.

163
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:19,548
Can we?

164
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:25,317
Are you sure you're good here?

165
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:28,290
This is 215 Four Street.

166
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,999
I know the address from outside.

167
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:38,841
Handsome, Meredith.

168
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,977
Students should know that if they
deposit their funds at the Continental Bank ...

169
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,373
that their money into financing the war.

170
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,555
May I give it up?
- Just do it.

171
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:57,869
Guys?

172
00:17:57,914 --> 00:18:02,026
If you are recruiting,
then you are in the wrong place.

173
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:05,413
No, I'm looking for Jane.

174
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,706
I'm sorry, this is not Jane.

175
00:18:12,911 --> 00:18:15,164
That's quite suddenly.
Well then.

176
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,690
Is it too spicy or?

177
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,077
Daltons.

178
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,003
Hi there, Janie.

179
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,482
Oh, my God.

180
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,419
Surprise.

181
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,189
What have I missed it.
- I was so worried about you.

182
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:50,458
I can not believe I got you in my arms.
- Dalton, what's going on?

183
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:53,535
I thought you had to be in Vietnam?

184
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:02,600
Damn it!
This always happens now.

185
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,228
I'm ten minutes away and miss anything?

186
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:09,195
Hello there. Private First Class,
Mickey Wright, and my buddy Dalton Joiner.

187
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,539
And who is this lovely lady?

188
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:16,136
I'm Candace.
Pleasant introduction, soldier.

189
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:23,381
Joiner soldier in Vietnam came
Juniper to see.

190
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:27,039
Or Jane, depending on who you ask t.

191
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,754
Juniper?

192
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:33,465
Should not you two go somewhere else?
As the bed in?

193
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,451
I can not believe
Juniper 's boyfriend.

194
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:38,468
In Vietnam than later.

195
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:47,005
Please advise, you see two guys in army uniforms
and you think that we are the enemy or something, right?

196
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,793
No, not at all.
We know that you have been fooled by ...

197
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:55,287
Nixon, Kissinger, Westmoreland,
like the rest of America.

198
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:58,924
It's not your fault that you are unskilled.
- Excuse me?

199
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,884
Error informed.
- Error informed?

200
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:06,303
I'm sorry, but unless you yourself were,
you have no idea what war is.

201
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:08,962
Do take it easy.
- No, it's okay. And Joiner and I ...

202
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,899
we have been there.
Damn six long months.

203
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,280
We know that the war is bullshit, right?

204
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:17,100
Maybe they what our eyes
held or we're just old fashioned ...

205
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:21,442
but we really believed that to 'Nam go,
a correct decision.

206
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,380
Joiner surrendered even voluntarily.
- Nobody will blame you something.

207
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:27,962
Maybe not, but you should
respect what this guy did.

208
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:33,567
He had the courage to it with his own eyes
that what they told us was bullshit and lies.

209
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,925
What did he do?
He got up and went away.

210
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:39,079
Just so.

211
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:42,580
Go ahead, call me uneducated,
Error informed if you want.

212
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,761
But I tell you, I'm really proud
I have followed him in battle.

213
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:49,412
I followed him home.
Protesting.

214
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:57,850
Why did you not tell me?

215
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:04,692
This is a great story.

216
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:09,676
Where do we start?
- With Jane maybe.

217
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:12,270
Juniper or Jane.

218
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:18,121
Old fashioned apple wine.

219
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,737
You know, this was a good idea.
Are you crazy?

220
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:24,443
Paardenpis.
Have you seen those candy-girl?

221
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:27,200
Deserters.
What are you doing?

222
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,243
Relax, you're a hero.
All you have to do is go up those stairs ...

223
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:34,068
and good fucking.
- If they know, they hang us high and dry.

224
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:36,188
I think it's a firing squad.
- I'm serious.

225
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,200
It's bad enough that we have deserted.
- Wait, you said ...

226
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:40,301
Forget what I said.
You said we were deserters.

227
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:42,506
This is not about a few days locked up.

228
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:46,119
This is about big things, martial.
- Who's to know?

229
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:49,504
Over a few days we returned.
Besides, we are among friends.

230
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,333
We are heroes, dude.

231
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:55,486
Do you ever after,
for you again telling bullshit?

232
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,827
No, not really.

233
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:02,900
Listen, soldier.
You have 72 hours to let you crazy fuck.

234
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:04,963
Dismissed.

235
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,045
Go on up.

236
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,268
A few days ago I did not
that we would get up alive.

237
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:54,363
If I had known that it would be so.

238
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,718
Here in this place with ...

239
00:22:57,763 --> 00:23:00,710
the most beautiful angel I ever saw.

240
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,592
Then I found out a long time cut.

241
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:13,282
I am sorry

242
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:16,576
Did you like the nicest angel?

243
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:19,752
Yes.

244
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:21,860
Well then.

245
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,228
It was just a joke.

246
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,795
How are you?

247
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,348
What happened there?
Were you injured?

248
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,859
It's nothing.

249
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:46,805
Just a scratch.

250
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:53,249
What is that thing that Juniper?

251
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:57,934
It's just a name.

252
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:05,159
Do you know how scared I was?

253
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:09,675
The next call from my parents ...
- I know.

254
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,158
I know.

255
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,279
It's good.

256
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:24,144
You must not be afraid.

257
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:41,134
I am sorry

258
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,434
I did not mean to scare you.

259
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:47,366
I was one of your articles to read.
Pretty good.

260
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:49,895
Thank you.

261
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:55,560
No, I do not drink, actually.
- Really?

262
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,033
Yes.

263
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,820
And I thought
that all reporters were drunks.

264
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:05,495
I want you to know that I think
what you did was great.

265
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:10,558
Would you tell me what it is you succeeded?

266
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:15,551
We walked away.
- We walked?

267
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:23,609
We were exploring.
I and Joiner at the border of Laos.

268
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:29,200
We got to talking about the war,
what that meant and what is not.

269
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:33,869
And Joiner says what
if we were lost in combat?

270
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,921
I am the radioman, so ...

271
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:41,494
I give a few false positions,
and say that we are the bad guys chasing.

272
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:44,739
You call the Vietnamese people so?

273
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:48,705
I refer anyone who is trying to kill me.

274
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,691
Right. Also good.

275
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:56,036
And when we gave nothing by,
complete silence.

276
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:01,800
Showed that the leave was easy.
Return home ...

277
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:04,294
that was a different story.

278
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,815
Janie ...

279
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,988
It's Juniper.

280
00:26:24,746 --> 00:26:27,763
When we were in Thailand would receive
we swapped our M-16s into cash ...

281
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:30,863
and we bought a Eurasian pilot to,
to bring us to Singapore.

282
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:34,733
Actually turned out to be a nice guy,
smuggled us to Tran and Au ...

283
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:38,216
from there it was easy.
- That is so cool.

284
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:43,753
Why do you still wear your uniforms?

285
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:46,904
Joiner wanted Jane not scare.

286
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:56,139
Look ...
- Yes.

287
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:58,603
Peter and I ...
- Yeah, I get it already

288
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:05,060
We want to write an article about your
for our next edition.

289
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,173
Shoot me is not enough,
now you want me for a firing squad bring?

290
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:17,425
I promise you that we do not
real names will be used.

291
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,605
And it is not printed until you're gone.

292
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,456
We want the story about how it really is there.

293
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,874
The truth.

294
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:32,931
Sleep is a sleep on.
Good?

295
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,808
Well then.

296
00:27:37,604 --> 00:27:39,057
Goodnight.

297
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:08,131
What do you suggest?

298
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,465
I'm a deserter.
Do you remember?

299
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:14,793
You look ridiculous.
- I must do it.

300
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:18,132
I have to ask her today.
- Do it.

301
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:21,900
Continued from where you were, right?

302
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:27,137
It was ... otherwise.

303
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,124
Awesome.

304
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:31,617
Well, do not exaggerate.

305
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:33,609
I got a ring.

306
00:28:35,002 --> 00:28:39,211
Dalton looks not too weird?
- Never crazier than this.

307
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,888
A new uniform, soldier.

308
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:46,335
Some of us go to South U.
We will make our own public park.

309
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,053
Will you even look.

310
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,437
Sounds great.
- Come on.

311
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:59,459
Look there, buddy.
Shoot with focus.

312
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:01,414
Do you have enough money?

313
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,157
Yes. Thank you.

314
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:07,807
Do you think I have a chance to make that Candace?

315
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:13,573
Honestly, no.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

316
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:15,402
Come on, guys, let's go.

317
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:21,554
I need to do some quick,
but I follow you, okay?

318
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:24,270
What you have to do quickly?

319
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,600
Do not worry about it.
I'll find you.

320
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,688
You always do.

321
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:35,556
Quickly do what?

322
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:37,802
What then?

323
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,998
You had her as well say
that you went to buy a ring, but ...

324
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:44,631
quickly do what is good.
- What was I supposed to say?

325
00:29:44,676 --> 00:29:47,683
Is all right.
- Thank you.

326
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:53,288
Stay out of trouble.
- What is there to like?

327
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:59,247
Candace, I have an important question for you.
- Yes?

328
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:02,878
Where can you find a good burger?

329
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:07,771
<i> The former president promised that
we have a man on the moon would have. </ i>

330
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:12,041
President Kennedy was still alive
so he could see his dream come true.

331
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:16,660
I actually once a letter
recovered from him, handwritten.

332
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:22,237
He thanked me, but considering I only
Was 14 I could not 't Peace Corps.

333
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:27,374
When I was 14, was my only concern
how I could fuck.

334
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:31,693
I had better not say.

335
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:37,768
And is you have succeeded, or?

336
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,999
Eventually.

337
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:46,300
Assume that they are not much you eat there?
- Once a zeerat eaten?

338
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:52,688
No, I do not usually eat rats.

339
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:57,130
So you do not drink, no drugs
and you do not eat rats.

340
00:30:57,592 --> 00:31:01,410
Have fun there with you not, right?
- Will or not.

341
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:06,225
Zeerat's army food. You have not lived unless
you've eaten ham with white beans.

342
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:09,265
Yeah, that sounds delicious.

343
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,863
When you're at it Peace Corps
gone when you were older?

344
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:17,352
There were more important issues at home.
- Your parents?

345
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:19,141
Vietnam.

346
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:23,070
I have worked on Bobby Kennedy's campaign.

347
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:27,850
I think if they did not shoot him
the war would be over now.

348
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:31,383
I know if not.
- Why do you say that?

349
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:36,765
Is just hard to imagine that
anyone can just stop.

350
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:40,751
It's hard to imagine them to
the moon, but they do it anyway.

351
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:44,336
Thank you.
- Are you sure you want anything?

352
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:48,112
No.
I'm already sick by looking at him.

353
00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:52,129
Thank you.
- That's just nasty.

354
00:31:52,174 --> 00:31:55,407
Will you really eat all that?
- Eventually.

355
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:33,742
Stop calling up conscripts.

356
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:37,129
These people do not work?

357
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:41,799
Let's see, to begin her work
or anti-war protest.

358
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:44,506
That's not a difficult decision.
- Of course.

359
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:47,023
As long as it pays the bills daddy.

360
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,124
Peter seems to be a concerned citizen.

361
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:55,099
He is passionate to say the least.

362
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:58,899
Passionate about to stop the war?

363
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,122
Among other things.

364
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,346
As ...

365
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:13,906
So it is up to you,
what you wanna do.

366
00:33:21,545 --> 00:33:25,416
The longer we let it go their lunatics,
the worse it will be.

367
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:30,294
I do not know.
I think this is naturally passes.

368
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,021
STUDENTS AGAINST WAR

369
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,797
WITHDRAW FROM VIETNAM

370
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:46,778
No more war. 

371
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:52,427
Put down your weapons, buddy.

372
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:07,802
Power to the people.

373
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,730
Power to the people.

374
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,768
He goes up there.

375
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:17,199
I think we'd better disappear.
- Come on, man.

376
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:20,699
In the war fighting and protesting
in the same week. How cool is that thinking?

377
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:22,734
I mean it.
- Let's go.

378
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:24,981
Come on.

379
00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:32,818
Power to the people.
We have the power, burlap.

380
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,618
I'll tell you something.

381
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:41,664
While everyone at the moon ...

382
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:44,654
look no further for the truth.

383
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:50,341
Apollo 11.
All single distraction.

384
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,551
It's a circus.
A circus organized by the army ...

385
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,709
our thoughts get away
of the killing in Vietnam.

386
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,862
Say no to Walter Cronkite and
the other media ring leaders there in Houston.

387
00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:08,420
And who cares anything about it
of the dead count in Saigon?

388
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:12,805
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ...

389
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:14,988
who are they anyway?

390
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:20,184
They are no more than a few clowns
billions in a circus.

391
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:23,693
Wake up!
Would you talk about real heroes?

392
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:28,316
I'm talking about brothers who lost their lives
risked for something they believed.

393
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,405
Look no further.
For we have here and now heroes.

394
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:36,797
That is correct.
I'm talking about two U.S. soldiers ...

395
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:41,894
who one day woke up in Vietnam
and decided that it was enough.

396
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:48,159
Two U.S. soldiers and the heart
had the courage and conviction to say ...

397
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:51,032
hell no, we will not stay here.

398
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,479
What did they say?
- We continue here.

399
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:00,569
We remain here.

400
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:06,092
Deserters?
Not in my service.

401
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,201
What did they say?
- We continue here.

402
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,844
Come on, guys.

403
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:15,850
Agents, make the street Fri
I repeat, make the street Fri

404
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:17,616
Spread the crowd.

405
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,164
Come on.

406
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,492
Jane, come on.

407
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:26,350
Have you not do.
We have rights!

408
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,589
Jutes, go home.

409
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:41,115
We have rights!
Free speech.

410
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,768
First Amendment.
Beware of my pants, man.

411
00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:00,379
Jane, no.

412
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:05,508
Come.

413
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,825
Come, we must go.

414
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:13,592
<i> Please, spread immediately. </ i>

415
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,183
<i> Please, go home. </ i>

416
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:21,036
Please, stop.

417
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,534
Please, stop.

418
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:33,581
Come on, dude.
I got you.

419
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,166
Well, come on.

420
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:51,978
Is it?
- Yes.

421
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:01,720
That part should not write.
- I just have.

422
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,883
Would someone tell me
what that meant?

423
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:22,029
Everything all right?
- Yeah, great.

424
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,499
I'm sorry, Ray was too excited,
he just went for it.

425
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,749
Sometimes things get worse
before they get better. - Oh, what.

426
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:35,655
A lot of kids who throw some stuff
who had nothing better to do.

427
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,970
That is exactly why our best weapon,
the truth is.

428
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:42,373
Guys like you can a difference.
Listen to me.

429
00:38:42,418 --> 00:38:47,425
Your story will people open their eyes to
what's really going on in that jungle there.

430
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,381
Good, at first,
I have not seen any jungle.

431
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:54,643
They are rice fields, forests and trails.
Running around in circles, every day all day long.

432
00:38:54,935 --> 00:39:00,639
Second, find it regrettable to say, but
you keep the war against with your newspaper.

433
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,965
Do you want me here just eliminate it?

434
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:15,694
Yes.

435
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,758
That was fun.

436
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,970
Anytime.

437
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,320
Joiner, listen up.
Your friend has it wrong.

438
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:34,661
People read about you and soon there will be others
as you do not want so badly to Vietnam.

439
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,607
That's exactly how you can stop this war
and your friends can get home safely.

440
00:39:41,414 --> 00:39:45,234
Say goodbye, Joiner.
Tomorrow we're here.

441
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:56,180
What?

442
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:05,414
Do you need anything?

443
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:08,418
A kiss, perhaps?

444
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:12,233
No, I'm not going to sleep.

445
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:18,815
What you did for Isaac,
was really great.

446
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,996
Least I could do.

447
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:24,609
I'm on your sofa.

448
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,362
Look what I eat.

449
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:42,429
Properly.

450
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:48,412
Goodnight.
- Good night, Candace.

451
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,766
You know, Peter thinks you're a hero, Dalton.

452
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:17,565
That does everyone here.

453
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:21,006
They want you to stay with us.

454
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:25,236
Here?

455
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:29,906
That's just crazy.
- No, no.

456
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:33,225
That's not.

457
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,401
Peter can write the story,
if you're in Canada and ...

458
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:39,744
we can give you a false
identity provide ..

459
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,127
a new name ...
- No, Jane.

460
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:45,492
I do not want another name.

461
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:49,150
I want my service serve.
Back to home ...

462
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:52,953
to Hammond, as we had planned.
- You serve out service?

463
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:55,646
You are a ...
- No.

464
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,642
I am not a deserter.

465
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:09,507
What?

466
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,960
I've got free time.

467
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:16,076
What the army is concerned ...

468
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:17,916
we are in Hong Kong.

469
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,279
But everyone thinks ...
- No matter what the rest think.

470
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:29,023
Those idiots do not even know
what they're talking about.

471
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:35,246
Those idiots are my friends.

472
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,422
I am sorry

473
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:43,361
You can not go back.

474
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:47,938
You're already here, you can not.

475
00:43:10,636 --> 00:43:13,078
Will you marry me?

476
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:19,179
Where as I can afford ...

477
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:23,016
we buy something better,
I promise you.

478
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:33,152
You will find 'm not pretty.
- No.

479
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:36,977
I find it beautiful.

480
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,586
Do you like the watchman?

481
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,747
Did you already asked?

482
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,911
We're getting married.

483
00:44:12,376 --> 00:44:14,873
That's awesome, dude.
Congratulations.

484
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,219
Thank you.

485
00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:20,733
We should celebrate.
Before we go back.

486
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:26,418
What?

487
00:44:29,196 --> 00:44:31,386
Thank you ...

488
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:36,082
you come with me, and everything else.

489
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:42,642
I just care for my size.
- It was pretty crazy to me.

490
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:45,765
And even crazier for you, so ...

491
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:49,136
I really appreciate that.

492
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:56,847
Go back to your fiancée.
Is okay.

493
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,783
You will find it terrible.
- No. It's good.

494
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:21,185
But I tell you, we need the names
to make it real.

495
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,247
We can not make.
No, I'm talking Mickey promised.

496
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,768
Awesome.

497
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:34,942
Nice sound to the beginning of the day.

498
00:45:34,987 --> 00:45:36,910
Two o'clock in the afternoon.

499
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,699
Have you fat for this thing?
- We have somebody who restores.

500
00:45:40,744 --> 00:45:43,807
Yes?
Then you have to dismiss it.

501
00:45:43,852 --> 00:45:46,100
The bearings are dry.

502
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:50,280
Let 's now but even walk.

503
00:45:54,131 --> 00:45:56,608
Awesome.
Thank you.

504
00:45:56,834 --> 00:46:01,858
What can I say, I'm good with my hands.
- Yeah, I can see that.

505
00:46:06,614 --> 00:46:09,961
You must not leave or something?

506
00:46:10,006 --> 00:46:13,590
No, not really, Peter.
These two are getting married.

507
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:18,517
Right? Let them see the ring.

508
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,694
Come on, let's see?

509
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:32,025
Congratulations.

510
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:35,385
Where are we doing this last party?

511
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:50,526
Let's go dancing.

512
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,621
Can not we just ...

513
00:46:53,014 --> 00:46:55,167
Mission accomplished.

514
00:46:55,212 --> 00:47:01,508
Yes, we still have no date, so ...
- Oh, details. Do well once just?

515
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:03,913
It's a party.

516
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:40,236
You went down on me.

517
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:43,909
Try this,
'll Hanoi thoughts disappear.

518
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:47,058
Joiner is the only guy in Vietnam
which it never did.

519
00:47:47,103 --> 00:47:48,430
What?

520
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:52,292
Come on, let's go.

521
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:00,882
Leave that to her.

522
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:13,221
No, no.

523
00:48:16,866 --> 00:48:22,828
Why do those other poor suckers remains
in the same way as you did?

524
00:48:23,341 --> 00:48:28,743
Because if they catch you,
they shut you up in Leavenworth, therefore.

525
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:32,479
Good, but not better lock
than a bullet in the head?

526
00:48:32,524 --> 00:48:34,885
Yes, maybe today.

527
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:40,602
But what if they ever release? Who gives you
work, or do something with you to do?

528
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:44,215
Nobody.
You might as well be dead.

529
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,726
You find that funny?
- I do not know, dude.

530
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,491
I can only say that I prefer
become trapped, then those useless war.

531
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:56,457
Yes? Say that once again
if you notice you've got orders.

532
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:58,397
Right.

533
00:49:00,262 --> 00:49:02,518
Want to dance?

534
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,502
With pleasure.

535
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,771
Why do you always wear the radio?
- I asked.

536
00:49:21,963 --> 00:49:27,002
I would not be able to walk ahead as Joiner.
I'm not so lucky girl home.

537
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:30,667
Vietnam ...

538
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:33,099
a big trap.

539
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:36,860
That you learn from the first time
you have foot drop.

540
00:49:42,953 --> 00:49:45,773
Would you tell me what happened?

541
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:50,016
Look at that.

542
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:55,198
Just inhale and hold,
glass empty drink and then blow.

543
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:58,755
At Captain Joe!

544
00:50:00,884 --> 00:50:02,434
Persevere.

545
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:13,509
Soldier Dalton Joiner.
Came to her.

546
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:32,394
On my first day I meet
a large E-4 of Tennessee.

547
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:36,023
Everyone called him Moonshine.

548
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:41,164
He comes to me and says, "Hey boy, do yourself
a favor, would you voluntarily as radioman.

549
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:44,394
You're in the middle of the platoon, the safest place.

550
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:49,741
And I think I'm a loser or whatever,
with that heavy thing.

551
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:56,694
And then bang.

552
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:06,370
The man in front kicks in a trap.
It was Moonshine.

553
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,857
I called the evacuation helicopters, but ...

554
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,513
by the time they were there,
he was dead.

555
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:21,174
Eleven days and he was allowed to go home.

556
00:51:33,379 --> 00:51:37,784
Joiner went forefront.
We have not walked into a trap.

557
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,824
Now look at my buddy there.

558
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:57,964
Go away tomorrow.

559
00:51:58,872 --> 00:52:00,996
We have to go.

560
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:06,743
I want you to take it somewhere,
before you leave.

561
00:52:07,196 --> 00:52:09,196
Where to?

562
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:13,225
A quiet place ...

563
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:16,480
a nice place.

564
00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:20,698
You need that.

565
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:28,823
I must tell you that I
already see something beautiful.

566
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,594
Do not touch her!

567
00:53:16,711 --> 00:53:20,663
Nobody touches my girl.
Do you hear me? Nobody.

568
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:24,889
It's all right.
Nothing special, he just plays around a little.

569
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,343
Calm down.

570
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:32,121
She's a man, dude.
It is nobody's property.

571
00:53:37,074 --> 00:53:41,846
Quiet.
- Get up, you idiot hippie Tippie. Come on.

572
00:53:41,891 --> 00:53:44,810
Hold on.
What did you do?

573
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:48,938
I?

574
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,177
He sat with his hands on you.

575
00:53:53,287 --> 00:53:57,032
What's wrong with you, Jane?
- Stop me if you like.

576
00:53:57,077 --> 00:54:00,795
With what to call it?
- Jane, Janie ...

577
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:03,260
I'm not anymore.

578
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:08,826
What are you talking about?

579
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:14,380
Just go.

580
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:16,782
Just go, Dalton.

581
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:39,847
All you fools,
can all fuck off.

582
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,491
Aside.

583
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:49,808
War and hell have already helped him.

584
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,325
Well, go ahead further.

585
00:55:04,102 --> 00:55:08,658
<i> We are now only twelve hours away
of the first moon landing. </ i>

586
00:55:12,546 --> 00:55:15,501
Are you sure you do not need?

587
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:17,728
Go.

588
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:24,164
Are you succeed, mate?

589
00:55:36,048 --> 00:55:40,147
I surrender, right?
- It's okay. I'm here for Candace.

590
00:55:40,365 --> 00:55:43,211
How are you with, Dalton?
- Just great.

591
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:46,122
What do you think?

592
00:55:47,907 --> 00:55:52,696
Are you hungry or ...?
- Mickey Wright has always hungry.

593
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:58,252
I did not think you'd come back yet.

594
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:01,973
Then you seem to know me well.

595
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:20,392
Are we there yet?

596
00:56:20,437 --> 00:56:24,174
Come on.
Just keep walking.

597
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:27,891
No, not until you tell me
how Peter's.

598
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:32,854
What are you talking about?
- You know.

599
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:37,081
And?

600
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:42,300
If what Peter was,
do you think I would be here with you?

601
00:56:46,854 --> 00:56:49,221
You're very clever, you know?
- Really?

602
00:56:49,266 --> 00:56:51,923
I'm a moose that is ten miles away.

603
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:57,059
You mean some girls
really fall for that beautiful angel story?

604
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:00,577
Some.

605
00:57:01,977 --> 00:57:04,274
Okay, close your eyes.
- Why?

606
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,698
Just match them.
- Good.

607
00:57:06,743 --> 00:57:08,848
It's a surprise.
- I do not like surprises.

608
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:11,039
Trust me.

609
00:57:11,242 --> 00:57:15,222
Well then.
Start walking.

610
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:18,033
Your hand is on my ass.
Was that your intention?

611
00:57:18,336 --> 00:57:20,256
Keep walking.

612
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:23,564
Yet a little further.

613
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,336
Properly.

614
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:29,942
You can open your eyes now.

615
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:39,580
A quiet, beautiful place.

616
00:57:41,065 --> 00:57:44,057
You should have told me to come in costume.

617
00:57:44,058 --> 00:57:47,165
That was the surprise ruined.

618
00:57:51,241 --> 00:57:52,748
Thank you.

619
00:58:12,925 --> 00:58:15,114
Crashed.

620
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:49,485
One small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind. 

621
00:58:57,851 --> 00:59:02,413
It looks beautiful from here. 
- It looks as beautiful from everywhere ... 

622
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:05,770
it's different, but very nice here.

623
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:09,727
Someone once told me that I would never forget
where I would be during the moon landing.

624
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:12,495
And?

625
01:00:14,689 --> 01:00:16,664
He was right.

626
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:22,025
I can not agree.

627
01:00:31,797 --> 01:00:34,635
I see you do not really play rugby.

628
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,053
People hurt.

629
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:42,170
Yes, and you see I did not desert.

630
01:00:46,979 --> 01:00:49,116
Is good, dude.

631
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:54,477
I believed Wright's story anyway.

632
01:00:54,713 --> 01:01:00,009
You have to hand it to him,
he can really crap sales.

633
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,062
He can be sure.

634
01:01:05,826 --> 01:01:08,022
But tell me ...

635
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:13,481
Be honest,
if you would do it again.

636
01:01:13,777 --> 01:01:17,656
Knowing what you know now,
would you go?

637
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:24,653
I would certainly not voluntarily give up.

638
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:31,754
What if they send you to Da Nang.

639
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:38,227
I thought you were still at school.

640
01:01:42,293 --> 01:01:44,766
Damn, Isaac.

641
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:00,235
Morning.

642
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:07,613
The first morning I
Vietnam woke ...

643
01:02:07,793 --> 01:02:11,188
I saw all of those fantastic red butterflies.

644
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:16,805
And for a moment I forgot where I was.

645
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:23,127
Sometimes I think we just so.

646
01:02:24,805 --> 01:02:28,814
Flit from place to place,
not really a plan.

647
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:33,321
At least not one that can be seen.

648
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,161
I have friends in Calgary.

649
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:46,715
They have a farm, there you go.
- No. I do not belong on a farm.

650
01:02:46,716 --> 01:02:50,827
This is not funny.
The police are looking for you.

651
01:02:50,828 --> 01:02:54,091
They have been going door to door even.
- What?

652
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:58,729
I'm sorry,
I should have told you sooner.

653
01:02:58,756 --> 01:03:02,558
That was selfish, I ...
- Never mind, we'll be here.

654
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:07,079
What do you think of Canada?
- No idea.

655
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:10,149
I must warn Joiner.

656
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:14,902
You can get off me better here,
if the home is not safe.

657
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:22,999
You can not just do something without a plan.

658
01:03:23,729 --> 01:03:28,130
I'll meet you at the diner.
Give me a few hours to arrange everything.

659
01:03:49,228 --> 01:03:52,042
You missed the moon landing.
- Have you seen Juniper?

660
01:03:52,073 --> 01:03:55,167
No. I was working.

661
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:13,704
We have Mickey and Dalton
immediately bring to Canada.

662
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:18,243
Did not you hear what I just said?

663
01:04:21,348 --> 01:04:24,328
They do not go to Canada.

664
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:27,034
They go back to Vietnam.

665
01:04:30,478 --> 01:04:32,912
What are you talking about?

666
01:04:32,913 --> 01:04:35,632
Dalton is not deserted.

667
01:04:36,862 --> 01:04:39,263
He just came back to me.

668
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,247
Mickey is only with him gone.

669
01:05:02,662 --> 01:05:06,267
We must go, the cops are looking for us.
- You know what would be awesome?

670
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:10,383
Neil and Buzz decided would have
not to return.

671
01:05:12,071 --> 01:05:15,052
That would be something.
- Yes.

672
01:05:15,836 --> 01:05:20,818
Neil and Buzz disappearing.
- Or even better ...

673
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:23,319
Neil and Buzz desert.

674
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:25,610
Pardon?

675
01:05:25,611 --> 01:05:29,917
They are now where they have a long time to be,
why still go back.

676
01:05:31,602 --> 01:05:34,856
They can not just stay on the moon.

677
01:05:36,068 --> 01:05:38,583
No, they can not.

678
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:43,177
But we do.
- What are you talking about, we are not going to desert.

679
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:47,288
Why not?

680
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:50,246
Because you do not deserting.

681
01:05:50,263 --> 01:05:55,526
You lead us platoon, because you have
signed for. That's your job.

682
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,860
I signed up for a war to win.

683
01:06:05,116 --> 01:06:09,873
Until I came to know, like all others,
that no war can be won.

684
01:06:10,141 --> 01:06:15,409
Come on. You were there. When she boy
from Tennessee dragged inside ...

685
01:06:15,444 --> 01:06:18,648
completely shot to pieces.
You knew it, I knew it, everyone knew it.

686
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:23,069
That this war is about one thing.
Survive. And from that moment ...

687
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,951
was the only thing I could do,
to focus on Jane.

688
01:06:26,992 --> 01:06:31,978
Stay awake at night watch, the tent
Double check for VC. She is counting on me.

689
01:06:32,009 --> 01:06:36,047
I found every trap, because I had to.

690
01:06:41,525 --> 01:06:46,615
If I'm there again, without Jane,
I'm dead.

691
01:06:51,082 --> 01:06:53,736
What our guys then?

692
01:06:55,311 --> 01:07:00,758
Franklin, Sanchez, Burns and me.
You go also our desertion?

693
01:07:03,455 --> 01:07:08,850
Do not you think I know what you feel?
Do you know how much I want to run away with Candace?

694
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:13,935
I would be overjoyed to some
farm in Canada, but I do not.

695
01:07:14,176 --> 01:07:17,750
Because it's Tuesday in Hong Kong and we
go back again tonight. End of story.

696
01:07:17,781 --> 01:07:21,599
Burns will not return.
- Because he has saved our lives.

697
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:25,639
Now he lies somewhere in a hospital, is
wondering if he will ever be able steps.

698
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:29,162
You are a commitment, not
to win a war, but to our unit.

699
01:07:29,193 --> 01:07:31,546
We trust that our front man
us alive bringing forth.

700
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,771
Why do you think I was buying?

701
01:07:39,543 --> 01:07:41,798
An obligation?

702
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:46,252
You do not even know what it means.

703
01:08:21,142 --> 01:08:23,286
Burns is dead.

704
01:08:27,477 --> 01:08:30,669
I just with his father
on the phone.

705
01:08:31,568 --> 01:08:35,636
A staph infection,
He did not even leave Da Nang.

706
01:08:58,187 --> 01:09:01,411
There was a guy in our unit, Burns.

707
01:09:03,962 --> 01:09:09,876
Joiner and I had no apparent
a chance to get out alive.

708
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:16,044
And the others to Burns
showed up to save us.

709
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:24,576
The truth is, without him
I would not even have been.

710
01:09:27,736 --> 01:09:30,295
Burns was shot.

711
01:09:30,648 --> 01:09:32,631
It was very.

712
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:39,504
I just learned that in some
kutziekenhuis died in 'Nam.

713
01:09:42,764 --> 01:09:44,755
Are you ready?

714
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:50,101
I'm not really in the mood
for one of your stories.

715
01:09:50,473 --> 01:09:55,009
What are you talking about?
- You got a nice free time?

716
01:09:57,156 --> 01:10:01,592
Have you found what you came for?
Another great story for your friends?

717
01:10:01,633 --> 01:10:04,567
No, Candace, I did not ...
- Abuses?

718
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:12,455
You bastard.

719
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:44,165
Wright has said that I was here?

720
01:10:45,597 --> 01:10:47,004
Isaac.

721
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:03,907
That's funny.

722
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:08,219
I have that image in my head ...

723
01:11:09,078 --> 01:11:14,888
of you, me and the house,
kids.

724
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:18,686
Our parents who come
for the barbecue on Sunday.

725
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:26,874
But that picture you have not
in your head, do Juniper?

726
01:11:30,194 --> 01:11:31,614
What?

727
01:11:35,095 --> 01:11:37,887
You called me Juniper.

728
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:41,709
That's who you are now.
Not you?

729
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,987
He's really, really nice.

730
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:03,463
Keep him.

731
01:12:11,516 --> 01:12:15,175
What time does your plane?
- 8:55.

732
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,544
I will always love you keep.

733
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:31,980
That will never change.

734
01:13:10,365 --> 01:13:13,432
Thank you for all the surprise packets.

735
01:13:13,913 --> 01:13:17,532
You gave us all something
to look forward to.

736
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:21,282
Anytime.

737
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:38,652
This was a stupid idea.

738
01:13:57,256 --> 01:14:01,112
What are you planning?
- Mickey Wright is not half the world ...

739
01:14:01,143 --> 01:14:04,193
then come back without a story
girl with a good finish.

740
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:07,321
It's over, once again.
- No, not yet.

741
01:14:07,372 --> 01:14:11,942
You go back to Candace and you will
as our friend, stone dick, there.

742
01:14:11,992 --> 01:14:15,879
You're upright, proud
and with a flag in your conviction.

743
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:20,550
What?

744
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:24,039
I'm impressed.

745
01:14:24,234 --> 01:14:26,549
That was almost funny even.

746
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,673
Almost.

747
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:40,133
Time to go pop, dude.

748
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:43,294
Aim right to the heart.

749
01:14:55,727 --> 01:14:59,570
Can I get a ride to the bus station?
- Step into.

750
01:15:04,953 --> 01:15:07,551
Just have to wait for Wright.

751
01:15:09,836 --> 01:15:14,258
Just want to see Candace.
- I'm pretty sure they do not want to see you.

752
01:15:15,018 --> 01:15:19,330
Why do not you go back to the jungle.
Excuse, the rice fields.

753
01:15:20,553 --> 01:15:22,762
I just told you.
- Stand aside.

754
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:24,953
Get out of my house.

755
01:15:26,372 --> 01:15:29,505
You know what, Pete?
I'm going to count to three.

756
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:32,401
If you do not step aside,
I go through you.

757
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:35,121
A ... Two ...

758
01:15:38,811 --> 01:15:40,505
I'm sorry, Pete.

759
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,973
Just breathe.

760
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:01,388
What are you doing here?

761
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:05,341
It was not all a lie.

762
01:16:06,411 --> 01:16:10,705
Not the part that I was in love with you.

763
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:21,140
Please, Candace, do not do this.

764
01:16:23,665 --> 01:16:25,878
Would you say something?

765
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:31,017
Just go away.

766
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:39,787
You've got something beautiful
and you've ridiculed.

767
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:43,088
That is not true
and you know it.

768
01:16:46,496 --> 01:16:50,288
I'm busy,
was there anything else?

769
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:59,814
I'm not like you.
I did not save the world when I was 14.

770
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:06,392
I have in my whole life
never something mandatory.

771
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:09,619
Not to the school, nor the war, nothing.

772
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:14,615
Up to now.

773
01:17:25,369 --> 01:17:27,842
Well, I'll leave.

774
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:33,492
I was at least honest about one thing.

775
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:37,232
I love you for who you are.

776
01:17:37,648 --> 01:17:39,912
Not for any purpose.

777
01:18:24,522 --> 01:18:29,494
On the ground. I said, on the ground.
- Dwell.

778
01:18:29,535 --> 01:18:31,866
Quiet.
- Against the wall and soon.

779
01:18:33,538 --> 01:18:35,895
Check his pockets.
- Do you have weapons?

780
01:18:36,053 --> 01:18:38,108
No, no.

781
01:18:38,493 --> 01:18:40,614
Let me go.
- Please, I want you not arrest.

782
01:18:40,655 --> 01:18:44,362
You do not understand. He is not a deserter.
He has only his free time now.

783
01:18:44,393 --> 01:18:49,476
He was even in his uniform.
- Oh, really. How does he explain this?

784
01:18:49,477 --> 01:18:52,239
HONOR IN A DESERT STREET WOODY
A true story.

785
01:18:53,037 --> 01:18:55,907
What?
- That I get by staying too long.

786
01:18:58,766 --> 01:19:03,607
You must believe me, I have not written.
This I have not written.

787
01:19:05,139 --> 01:19:07,517
I know.
- You have the right to remain silent.

788
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:10,593
He has no rights,
this is a military matter.

789
01:19:10,634 --> 01:19:14,185
Would you tell me where you been buddy?
- Yes, in Vietnam.

790
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:18,592
Well then, boy. Then we go to the office and
wait until you retrieve the Military Police.

791
01:19:18,643 --> 01:19:20,688
No, please.
- I'm sorry.

792
01:19:37,531 --> 01:19:40,067
You denounced him.
- I do not know what you're talking about.

793
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:44,736
You knew they were not going away.
A dilapidated, yellow Victorian house.

794
01:19:44,787 --> 01:19:46,860
Yes gave them as well as our address.

795
01:19:46,891 --> 01:19:49,943
How do you get it in your head?
- You were not here, okay?

796
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:54,013
I had a editorial decision ...
- No, that's pure bullshit and you know it.

797
01:19:54,054 --> 01:19:57,629
This is nonsense, Candace.

798
01:19:58,402 --> 01:20:01,139
He has lied to you.

799
01:20:01,148 --> 01:20:03,702
He has lied to us all.

800
01:20:04,635 --> 01:20:07,836
So that makes it right what you did?

801
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:17,242
You're right, Peter.

802
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:20,007
I was really disappointed.

803
01:20:22,003 --> 01:20:25,120
It's okay, right?

804
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:29,327
I thought you were a traitor.

805
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,901
The truth is that only a coward.

806
01:20:50,704 --> 01:20:53,065
That changes nothing, dude.

807
01:21:07,731 --> 01:21:10,821
How long should you take off your service?

808
01:21:11,716 --> 01:21:15,027
Six months.
- Six months?

809
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:21,619
You were halfway home.

810
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:24,093
Captain Sinclair.

811
01:21:24,094 --> 01:21:25,530
Yes.

812
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:31,178
First Sergeant Freeman, from Selfridge ANG
here soldier Michael J. Wright to pick.

813
01:21:31,563 --> 01:21:33,680
This is from you soon.

814
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:37,722
Was less than 30 minutes
since I spoke to the colonel.

815
01:21:37,928 --> 01:21:41,841
We spent the last two days
the area searched.

816
01:21:41,987 --> 01:21:44,017
This I have been arrested ...

817
01:21:44,058 --> 01:21:48,458
Joiner soldier and I try our all day
to remember where his buddy was.

818
01:21:48,499 --> 01:21:51,643
Not true sometimes?
Is that him?

819
01:21:57,678 --> 01:22:04,003
We got him back into his uniform.
Now only a good shave ...

820
01:22:04,104 --> 01:22:07,109
for his long visit to Leavenworth.

821
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:21,658
Good luck, kid.

822
01:22:22,434 --> 01:22:26,066
That he certainly needed.
Is not it?

823
01:22:29,316 --> 01:22:30,857
Come on.

824
01:22:31,904 --> 01:22:33,923
Have a nice day.

825
01:22:37,005 --> 01:22:40,679
Not too strict,
they have already served six months.

826
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:48,679
You will not believe this.
Dalton Joiner has a raid carried out ...

827
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:51,147
to a prisoner, Michael J. Wright
free.

828
01:22:51,248 --> 01:22:57,576
Without firing a shot, he gets the
Captain flat with rubbish of the first rank.

829
01:22:57,778 --> 01:23:02,331
Franklin and Sanches enter it in their pants.
Where did you get that uniform come from?

830
01:23:02,747 --> 01:23:05,352
Old military equipment.

831
01:23:05,902 --> 01:23:09,944
Nice haircut, Topher.
- Was a special Joiner.

832
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,049
Come, we must hurry.
We have a plane to catch.

833
01:23:13,843 --> 01:23:18,829
I'm going to be here on foot.
How do you walk with those things?

834
01:23:19,565 --> 01:23:22,403
Keep your right, okay?

835
01:23:26,497 --> 01:23:28,398
Hey, Topher.

836
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,722
Keep a watchful 't sail with Juniper, will you?

837
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:39,222
Will do.

838
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:03,597
Come on, we've got ten minutes.

839
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:05,190
Come on.

840
01:24:11,538 --> 01:24:15,579
Share it with the boys.
- What are you talking about?

841
01:24:16,922 --> 01:24:19,492
I'm sorry, dude.

842
01:24:20,551 --> 01:24:23,043
I can not go back.

843
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:26,495
I would be worthless for the unit.

844
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:36,278
No apologies necessary.
You certainly do not.

845
01:24:36,379 --> 01:24:40,402
With all those days that you do for sustained,
did you deserved.

846
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:48,995
Where are you going?
- No idea.

847
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:53,089
We thought maybe to Toronto,
maybe Montreal.

848
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,377
We?

849
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:58,244
Isaac received his summons warrant.

850
01:24:59,053 --> 01:25:02,591
A dodger and a deserter.

851
01:25:03,536 --> 01:25:06,929
I want to know all about it when I return.

852
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,700
Now walk it.

853
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:41,389
Hey, soldier?

854
01:25:44,909 --> 01:25:47,157
Where is Joiner?

855
01:25:48,925 --> 01:25:54,604
He goes ...
He's not coming back.

856
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,971
What are you talking about?

857
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:03,445
He can not lead the
without Jane in his head.

858
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:07,976
It's the only thing he could get there by.

859
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:11,046
She gave us all a strikethrough.

860
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:14,487
No, no.

861
01:26:14,963 --> 01:26:17,613
Please, do not.

862
01:26:17,644 --> 01:26:19,589
Look ...
- No.

863
01:26:19,981 --> 01:26:26,480
What I know, as I now the guys in the lurch
leave, I will anything or anyone worth something.

864
01:26:27,745 --> 01:26:30,144
I just keep walking.

865
01:26:30,199 --> 01:26:33,832
I'll come with you to Canada.
- No, no.

866
01:26:34,182 --> 01:26:37,050
That I'm not touching you.

867
01:26:38,465 --> 01:26:41,882
You stay here,
make a end to this war.

868
01:26:43,428 --> 01:26:46,538
There you have signed up for.

869
01:26:56,575 --> 01:26:58,764
I love you.

870
01:27:25,982 --> 01:27:27,924
Hey, there.

871
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:32,084
Nice to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

872
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:42,407
Would you like something to drink?
- No, not necessary, thank you.

873
01:27:45,005 --> 01:27:50,657
You know, maybe if you look carefully,
you can see that the astronauts back.

874
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:06,776
Dearest Mickey ... 

875
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:10,298
Topher just called me
to say that you are free. 

876
01:28:11,355 --> 01:28:15,098
I drive it in the taxi on the way
to the airport.

877
01:28:15,149 --> 01:28:17,648
Should I miss you. 

878
01:28:17,748 --> 01:28:21,619
We...-truth,
I miss you already

879
01:28:23,092 --> 01:28:28,496
I think I now understand why Juniper never
told about her boyfriend in Vietnam. 

880
01:28:29,254 --> 01:28:33,253
Because people like me
would have made it difficult for her. 

881
01:28:33,543 --> 01:28:39,822
it's funny. I think I was the person
which had to be informed. 

882
01:28:40,613 --> 01:28:44,657
In our anger
to war to stop this bad ... 

883
01:28:44,758 --> 01:28:49,141
I think we have forgotten,
that our boys there, not the bad ones are.

884
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:51,750
They are just trying to survive. 

885
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:56,608
Guys like Joiner,
who risk their lives with every step.

886
01:28:56,709 --> 01:29:01,522
And guys like Burns, who lives
sacrifice in order to save their friends. 

887
01:29:02,623 --> 01:29:06,986
I wish I had met him, for him
thank, he saved you for me. 

888
01:29:10,843 --> 01:29:15,154
Now go back to your radio back to record.

889
01:29:16,832 --> 01:29:20,418
I hope you like this post
received loud and clear ...

890
01:29:21,832 --> 01:29:23,418
in an attractive yellow Victorian house,

891
01:29:24,913 --> 01:29:28,869
there awaits a lucky girl to your home.

892
01:29:30,345 --> 01:29:33,332
With much love, Candace.

893
01:29:48,688 --> 01:29:50,080
And?

894
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:53,596
What?

895
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:58,977
Come on, right? Not crazy,
where is he, where did you go?

896
01:30:02,865 --> 01:30:04,878
To the moon.

897
01:30:17,717 --> 01:30:19,985
Dearest Candace ... 

898
01:30:20,203 --> 01:30:23,532
here I am again, back at the others.

899
01:30:23,633 --> 01:30:26,549
But I'm not in circles. 

900
01:30:26,673 --> 01:30:30,176
Now, with every step I take ... 

901
01:30:30,972 --> 01:30:33,719
 I'm one step closer to you.
