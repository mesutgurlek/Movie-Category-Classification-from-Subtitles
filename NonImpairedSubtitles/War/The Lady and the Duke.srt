Based on <i>Journal of My Life</i>
<i>During the French Revolution</i>

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,927
<i>During the Revolution,</i>

3
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,560
<i>at the end of Rue Miromesnil,</i>

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,738
<i>a new street</i>
<i>north of the Champs-Elysées,</i>

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,370
<i>stood the townhouse</i>
<i>of Grace Elliott.</i>

6
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,483
<i>The ''Grand Lady'',</i>
<i>as she was known,</i>

7
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:06,260
<i>was born in 1 760</i>
<i>of an old Scottish family.</i>

8
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,058
<i>She studied in France,</i>

9
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,472
<i>married SirJohn Elliott, then left him</i>

10
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,441
<i>to become the mistress</i>
<i>of the Prince of Wales,</i>

11
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,107
<i>the future George IV,</i>

12
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,544
<i>to whom she bore a daughter.</i>

13
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,813
<i>Then she was noticed</i>
<i>by Prince Philippe, Duke of Orleans</i>

14
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,112
<i>who brought her to France in 1 786.</i>

15
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:34,115
<i>Their affair ended</i>
<i>but they remained close friends.</i>

16
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,519
<i>The Duke had two houses in Paris.</i>

17
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,128
<i>One at Palais-Royal,</i>

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,494
<i>the other on the site</i>
<i>of today's Parc Monceau,</i>

19
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,238
<i>not far from Rue Miromesnil.</i>

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,150
Pretty posies!

21
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,024
Fresh water!

22
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,164
Who wants a drink?

23
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,023
Returning from England,
the Duke paid me a visit

24
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:20,532
on the eve of Federation Day,
one year after the Bastille fell.

25
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,200
<i>Our enemies will fall confounded</i>

26
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,583
<i>and we'll sing alleluia.!</i>

27
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,073
<i>Good times are coming...</i>

28
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:36,118
<i>We all swore to stand united.</i>

29
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,887
<i>The whole universe will be told</i>

30
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,428
<i>of this glorious oath our hearts uphold.</i>

31
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,633
Long live Orleans!

32
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,178
Long live the Nation!

33
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,826
''Master Fox, attracted by the scent,
addressed him thus,

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,735
''Master... Mister...''

35
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,733
''Mr. Crow, good day.''

36
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,736
''Mr. Crow, good day.
You are handsome, I say!''

37
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,982
''What a beautiful bird!
You are handsome, I say!''

38
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,580
The Duke of Orleans.

39
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,748
Show him in.

40
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,229
Prince!

41
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,801
What joy!

42
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,004
I heard you had arrived, but...

43
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,769
I didn't expect you so soon.

44
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,137
Yet your journey
seemed to last a century.

45
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,804
Letters from England.

46
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,678
Curtsy to the Prince.

47
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,678
What's your name?

48
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,946
Julie.

49
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,188
That's all for now.
The lesson's over. Go and play.

50
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,302
Forgive her,
she has no social graces.

51
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:37,403
I haven't finished dressing
but you may stay.

52
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,009
Take a seat.

53
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,688
I have been taking care

54
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,689
of that little girl.

55
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,359
Her mother lost her husband

56
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:58,562
and lives in great hardship
with four other children.

57
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:03,027
Your devotion to the poor
is a constant wonder, my dear.

58
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,998
It exceeds the bounds

59
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,971
of Christian charity
and revolutionary fraternity combined.

60
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,202
I deserve no credit.

61
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,203
She is the light of my life,

62
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,013
my only consolation

63
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,642
for my own daughter's absence.

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,082
Did you see her?

65
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,020
She's become a real beauty.

66
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,016
She asks for you.

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,751
All of London is waiting for you.

68
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,063
The sweetness of life there

69
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,064
takes us back a few years.

70
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,293
Why didn't you stay longer,
my friend?

71
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:44,232
I came back to...
dispel certain rumors, alas!

72
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,972
Word has it that I dared not return.

73
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,743
At the Federation rally tomorrow,

74
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,813
they'll be surprised
to see me walk in the procession.

75
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,854
It's the best way to quash the rumors.

76
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,689
I won't be mistaken
for a cowardly <i>émigré.</i>

77
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,653
Cowardly, yes.

78
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,622
However, their fears are founded.

79
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,326
But you, my fearless friend,
have stayed.

80
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,404
I am an <i>étrangére.</i>

81
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:18,009
These past two days,
I have guests from the country

82
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,279
here for the parade.

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,283
As you know, new ideas
leniently implemented

84
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,911
by the lawful authorities,
have my full approval.

85
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,755
The ''lawful authority''
- Louis, in this case -

86
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,756
does not implement them.

87
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,064
He hates all friends of Liberty,

88
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,092
commencing with me.

89
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,099
How do you know?

90
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,799
He keeps insulting me.

91
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,934
Remember, after the Bastille fell

92
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,133
I traveled to Versailles

93
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,412
to ask him for my orders.

94
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,173
He answered me harshly,

95
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,784
''I have nothing to say to you.''

96
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,049
He was right!

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,413
I've always felt more alien to him

98
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,820
than to my cook or coachman.

99
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,123
He is your cousin.

100
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,056
My family is the Nation.

101
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,796
I am more French than Bourbon.

102
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,194
The whole court
is colluding with the enemy.

103
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,063
You sound like a Jacobin.

104
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,135
Yes,

105
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,968
and I highly approve of my son's desire
to join their club.

106
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,474
Surely no Orleans belongs with them.

107
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,574
We belong wherever there are patriots.

108
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,844
See where your false friends lead you!

109
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,852
Excepting the Duke of Biron.

110
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,215
I've asked him to dine with us.

111
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,426
I'm delighted.

112
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,730
His only fault is his weakness.

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,265
At least he is loyal to you.

114
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:50,732
But...

115
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,132
the Talleyrands...

116
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,132
the Mirabeaus...

117
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,908
those turncoats have left you
at the mercy of monsters,

118
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:05,146
while Merlin de Douai
and your rascally cohort, Laclos,

119
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,410
who has brought your party
into such disrepute...

120
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,219
Laclos has an outstanding mind

121
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,622
and deep insights.

122
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,623
He's the author of a filthy novel.

123
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,022
I have little regard for the book.

124
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,529
It's profoundly boring.

125
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,531
It sent me to sleep.

126
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,963
Granted, I do not read much.

127
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,398
I'm no judge of letters.

128
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,112
Grace...

129
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,514
I'm so happy to see you again.

130
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,951
I cherish your company and yet, alas,

131
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,987
you have nothing
but harsh truths for me.

132
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,057
But they are not true.

133
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,501
You've been misled...

134
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,870
although...

135
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,871
I trust you are sincere.

136
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,307
The Royalists have turned your head.

137
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,007
The <i>Sansculottes</i>
have turned yours even more.

138
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,213
You'll be your own downfall.

139
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,818
Grace, listen.

140
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,950
Hurry back to your homeland.

141
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,318
Take my prudent advice.

142
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,334
Your revolutionaries
will be <i>your downfall,</i>

143
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,835
and with it, the King's.

144
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,833
You could save him.

145
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,211
Save Louis!
He's digging his own grave

146
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,481
by defying
the sovereign people's will.

147
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,241
What a way to speak!

148
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,983
The only sovereign I know

149
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,286
is the King, no one else.

150
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:57,224
You are a proud Scotswoman who
loves nothing but kings and princes.

151
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,491
I love the king of my adopted country.

152
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,222
I care little for Louis.

153
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,196
I love my Queen.

154
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,699
I detest her.

155
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:10,571
I wish I could break
her influence over you.

156
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,872
She is a lady of great refinement.

157
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,511
I've never heard her say

158
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,287
a single word against you.

159
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,654
And despite my friendship with you,

160
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,822
she trusts me completely.

161
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,890
She sent you to Belgium...

162
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,593
- You know!
- I have spies.

163
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,031
But I won't tell a soul.

164
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,434
I know. But honestly,

165
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,395
some people in Paris
should hold their tongues.

166
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,504
We live in a world of...

167
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,040
slanderers.

168
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,380
I do not believe them.

169
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,477
I don't believe
what they say about the Queen,

170
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,613
or about you.
For they slander you too.

171
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,622
I don't believe
you fomented the October riots

172
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,789
by bribing the French Guards.

173
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,224
Nonsense!

174
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,698
All lies,
spread by La Fayette and his clique.

175
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,695
While the Queen... No, enough!

176
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,634
I respect your fondness
for an undeserving monarchy.

177
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,205
I blame no one for their opinion
of the Revolution

178
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,639
if they respect mine...

179
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,714
but I'm more tolerant
than either side, alas!

180
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,156
Grace,

181
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,356
I implore you, go back home.

182
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,392
There is still time

183
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,223
before events get out of hand.

184
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,098
I love you and I want you safe.

185
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,804
I'll miss you cruelly, but go!

186
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,337
As long as I can see the Queen,

187
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,548
even occasionally,
I feel it's my duty to stay here.

188
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,415
The day of August 1 0th

189
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,487
Nanon!

190
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,658
Death to the Austrian woman!

191
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,301
Lord, they're at it again
like last month,

192
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,478
when they forced the red cap
on the King's head.

193
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:10,120
Everyone's at the Tuileries Palace!
All the working folk

194
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,783
and the delegates
from the countryside!

195
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,292
<i>Good times are coming.!</i>
<i>String up the aristocrats.!</i>

196
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,124
It's the King's last hour!

197
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,427
Mr. and Mrs. Let-them-eat-cake
are goners!

198
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,333
Hush!

199
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,266
What about their Swiss Guards?

200
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,306
They're done for.
I saw them run like rabbits!

201
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,813
Your Louis will hang within the hour.

202
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,542
Quiet, or I'll tell Madame.

203
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,707
She'd do better
to keep out of sight!

204
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,223
The Tuileries Palace is on fire.

205
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,301
The rioters massacred
the Swiss Guards.

206
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,492
My God!

207
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,661
How's the King?

208
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:03,606
With the Queen and their children,
he was seen fleeing to the Assembly.

209
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,312
I hope they won't be thrown to the mob.

210
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,277
Your cook says
they'll arrest all aristocrats.

211
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,545
She's always talked nonsense before.

212
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,344
Now, anything is possible...

213
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,582
If only I'd gone to Meudon!

214
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,830
Maybe there's still time.
HaveJustin prepare the carriage.

215
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,839
The city barriers are closed.
No one can get out.

216
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,071
Then we can only pray.

217
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,407
If I may suggest...

218
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,844
We could go through
the Duke's garden.

219
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,919
To reach Meudon?

220
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,180
We'd have to walk halfway
around Paris.

221
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,550
And I refuse to implicate the Duke.

222
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,192
I suspect today's rioters,
like those ofJune 20th,

223
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,632
are Marat's henchmen
and no friends of the Duke.

224
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,864
Does Madame remember Baptiste,
the doorman?

225
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,900
He lives behind the Invalides.

226
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,637
In Paris.

227
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,112
Yes, but there's a breach
in his garden wall.

228
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,551
Long live the Nation!

229
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,313
Long live the Nation!

230
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,714
Please step up, Madame.

231
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,716
Let us part here.
I'll go on alone.

232
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,588
Give me that.

233
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,394
You must stay in Paris
to mind the house.

234
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,863
Tell my people I'm in Meudon.

235
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,969
They mustn't think I've fled abroad.

236
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,801
God help you.

237
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,470
God help you, especially.

238
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,684
Poor Madame!

239
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,964
What a calamity!
You came alone, on foot?

240
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,193
Jeannette!

241
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,114
Weren't you afraid of being waylaid,

242
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,647
alone at night,

243
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,558
on the road?

244
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,729
I saw worse in Paris.

245
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,063
Nevertheless,

246
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,824
at the foot of Meudon hill,

247
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,068
I heard a man's footsteps
which scared me more

248
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,874
than the murderous mob
on Place Louis XV.

249
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,138
I went and hid behind a log.

250
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,548
Didn't he see you?

251
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,786
If he had,
what would have befallen me?

252
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,050
He may have been
a harmless peasant.

253
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,002
What are you up to?
Give me that!

254
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,196
Madame isn't here.

255
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,403
I'm to deliver it in person!

256
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,067
Madame Elliott?

257
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,545
I am she.

258
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,142
From Madame Meyler.

259
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,823
''Please obtain a travel permit

260
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,095
''for you and your manservant...

261
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,632
''and come alone to Paris,

262
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,532
''where someone
badly needs your help.''

263
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,972
Grace Georgina Elliott,

264
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,686
née Dalrymphe.

265
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,225
Spell it how you like.

266
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,026
Darlymphe,

267
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,000
English citizen,

268
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,037
you may go to Paris

269
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,902
with one servant,
but be back by midnight.

270
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:01,855
Halt!

271
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,561
''The citizen may go to Paris
with one servant,

272
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,064
but must be back by midnight.''

273
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:14,896
Where is the servant?

274
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,866
I sent him back to get...

275
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,136
papers I need in Paris.

276
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,178
Follow me.

277
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,653
Elliott,

278
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,165
English citizen...

279
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,200
With a servant?

280
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,703
Yes, but I told him...

281
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,431
She sent him back
for some papers she forgot.

282
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,839
Let her wait for him, but not too long.

283
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,638
She must be home
before the permit expires.

284
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,273
Tell me, milady,

285
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,850
what possessed you
to enter Paris now?

286
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,856
The jails are full of corpses,

287
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,719
the streets are awash with blood...

288
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,526
Everyone is desperate to leave town,

289
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,466
and you want to come in?

290
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,371
My mother is dying.
I need to be with her.

291
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,600
Very well. You are brave.

292
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,675
You're English.

293
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,379
Why aren't you in England?

294
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,687
My mother and I
have lived in France for six years.

295
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,519
I have two houses here.

296
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:51,830
I feel so French that I transferred
all the money I had in England.

297
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,337
Be warned that Paris is not safe
for enemies of Liberty.

298
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,206
What's going on?

299
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,074
They're taking out some blackcoats.
A conspiracy.

300
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,843
- Taking out?
- Who knows?

301
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,585
- I do!
- No one saw them.

302
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,149
Look in the cart.

303
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,659
They're taking a trip
to Vaugirard cemetery.

304
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,852
Feet first,

305
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,230
and some in pieces.

306
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,093
They're short of room!

307
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,136
Is it the Queen?

308
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,571
It's her favorite,
Princess de Lamballe.

309
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,908
Princess de Lamballe!

310
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,334
Hey, beautiful!

311
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,068
Madame's crying?

312
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,334
For the pretty head on the stake?

313
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,376
She must be lonely up there.

314
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,514
Want to keep her company?

315
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,811
Come on, aristo. Get out!

316
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,954
No! You are mistaken.

317
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,086
I'm weeping for my dying mother.

318
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,458
I'll miss her last words.

319
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,826
Look, I'm not an aristo.

320
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,629
I'm English.
English and a patriot.

321
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,963
All right, be off.

322
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,332
We're not after Englishwomen yet.

323
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,265
Clarisse!

324
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,173
Grace! You're here at last.

325
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,502
I'm here. With difficulty.

326
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,941
What is it? You're crying.

327
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,819
A horrible thing...

328
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,815
I shiver to speak of it.

329
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,653
A gang of fanatics

330
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,428
carrying a stake with...

331
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,602
poor Princess de Lamballe's head on it.

332
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,433
Princess de Lamballe?

333
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,368
Oh, God!

334
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,177
They'd slaughtered her

335
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,675
at the Force prison

336
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,143
and then had the barbarity

337
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,954
to drag her remains
to the Temple prison

338
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:36,616
and show them to our poor Queen.

339
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,857
What times are we living in?

340
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,001
Those ''Enlightenment Philosophers''

341
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,365
should open their eyes!

342
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,811
I'll send for a cordial.

343
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,492
Prudence!

344
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,964
Quick, bring two glasses
and some vintage wine.

345
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,746
But I'm not here to cry.

346
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,930
Whom do you wish me to help?

347
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,234
The Marquis de Champcenetz,

348
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,264
governor of the Tuileries.

349
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,396
Who?

350
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,267
Champcenetz?

351
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,471
Yes, I think you know him.

352
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,512
Indeed...

353
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,780
we met at the Duke of Orleans'
before the Revolution, but...

354
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,950
we weren't particularly close.

355
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,963
Especially since the Duke,
to whom he owes his career,

356
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,491
now hates him

357
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,458
for being ungrateful.

358
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,433
Grace, forgive me.

359
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,034
He led me to believe that he was

360
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,542
one of your friends.

361
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,308
Don't imperil yourself
for a stranger

362
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,675
whom perhaps you dislike.

363
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,421
I'm somewhat obligated to him.

364
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,719
He found me my house in Meudon

365
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,759
when he commanded
the chateau there.

366
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,127
But today,

367
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,038
even if he were my worst enemy...

368
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,185
I'm very surprised.

369
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,780
I heard he was dead.

370
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,655
He got away.

371
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:27,228
When the King fled to the Assembly
against the Queen's will,

372
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,290
he jumped out through a window

373
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,363
and lay down in the garden

374
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:37,300
among the Swiss Guards' corpses.

375
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:42,404
A National Guard found him
and lent him his coat.

376
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,839
He's hiding in my attic.

377
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,527
One moment.

378
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,781
Don't get up.

379
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,585
My respects, Madame.

380
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,088
How are you?

381
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,753
My leg is badly wounded,

382
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,753
I have a fever.

383
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,757
But it's better now.

384
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,654
I sought refuge

385
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,164
with Lord Gower,
the English ambassador,

386
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,902
but he informed me

387
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,999
through his secretary

388
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,935
that as a public official,
he could not see me.

389
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,272
So then... I remembered

390
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,273
in the past...

391
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,874
you introduced me

392
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:54,913
to Madame

393
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,220
who had a secluded house

394
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,757
on the outskirts of Paris.

395
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,192
The doorman thought I was English.

396
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,488
I gave my name as Mr. Smith.

397
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,890
Thank God, he let me in.

398
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,270
We should leave
for Meudon at nightfall.

399
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,137
I have a permit for my manservant.

400
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,997
You will impersonate him.

401
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,607
Do not get up.

402
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,970
Are the streets safe?

403
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,512
I wouldn't risk it!
You wish to go out?

404
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,149
No, I'm seeing Madame to her carriage.

405
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,944
All's quiet around here
but further on there's trouble!

406
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:37,519
Thank you.
I'll tell my driver to be careful.

407
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,353
I won't be long.

408
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,457
Citizen, we're under orders
to let no one out.

409
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:21,964
But I have to be back in Meudon
by midnight.

410
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,603
Orders from Paris and Meudon
are different.

411
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,810
I'm not a Parisian.

412
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,779
I'm not running away.
I just want to go home.

413
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,686
I beg you, for God's sake...

414
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,719
Sorry, they're my orders.

415
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,157
And don't try another barrier.

416
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,354
Find yourself a bed
or you'll be arrested at 1 0 o'clock

417
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:52,426
when the house searches start.
Vehicles must be off the street.

418
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,928
They won't let us out.

419
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,968
I feared as much.

420
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,870
Drive on.

421
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:04,674
Where to, Madame?

422
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,578
The Allées des Invalides.

423
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,119
What's wrong with you, fellow?

424
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,455
He's drunk.

425
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,262
He's still in his cups.

426
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,664
Shame on you, rascal!

427
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,666
I'll walk you to your door.
The sot can lean on me.

428
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,102
I don't want my lady friend
to see him like this.

429
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,039
I'll wait till he's sobered up.

430
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,944
I'm going home.

431
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,478
I don't want to be arrested
for you two.

432
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,218
Thirty sous.

433
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,428
Take care!

434
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,797
The patrols will soon be out.

435
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:14,774
I feel better.

436
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,420
The air is cooler here.

437
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,086
- Let's make haste.
- Careful!

438
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,461
They're going to guard the wall.

439
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:38,702
We're done for!

440
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,609
Don't let me jeopardize you.

441
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,246
Give me up.

442
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,421
You'll save one life at least,
yours.

443
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,582
I shan't even save mine.

444
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,418
They'll think I'm your accomplice.

445
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,526
Then I'll go alone.

446
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:10,298
If you're still strong enough,
let us turn back.

447
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,473
Where to?

448
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,312
My house at Monceau.

449
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,583
I am exhausted.

450
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,314
Keep walking slowly.
Act sick, drag your leg.

451
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,746
That won't be difficult.

452
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,762
Faster, old man!
It's after curfew.

453
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,734
Thank heavens it wasn't a patrol.

454
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,730
They're going back

455
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,163
to the section-house.

456
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,237
We'll meet others, more dangerous.

457
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,612
I don't want you caught.

458
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,347
Abandon me.

459
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,181
Try a little harder.

460
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,886
Beyond Place Louis XV,
we'll find darkness.

461
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,947
It'll take us hours.

462
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,622
No matter.

463
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,295
I undertook to rescue you.
I shall do so or perish with you.

464
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,797
Let that be clear!

465
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:14,834
Look!

466
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,306
There's Pulchérie, my cook,
in the doorway.

467
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:24,309
She is a Jacobin.
We can't trust her.

468
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:28,144
I've an idea. Let's go
to the Duke's garden in Monceau.

469
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,180
It's nearby.

470
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,216
If he finds out we're there,

471
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,291
he will say nothing for your sake.

472
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:40,464
I don't like it.
We would have to pass my doorway

473
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,026
or go around and risk meeting a patrol.

474
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,104
Hide here. I'll go home
and see what I can do.

475
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,878
Enemies of the people
are spreading rumors...

476
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,919
Madame, what a surprise!

477
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,956
Did you come on foot?

478
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,196
As you can see.

479
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,554
From Meudon?

480
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,560
I took a cab to the barriers.

481
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,332
With all the horrors now in Paris,

482
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,974
I felt uneasy in the country.

483
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,205
Don't stay out here.
The patrol is coming.

484
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,113
Pulchérie,

485
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,179
I'm starving.
Bring me some roast fowl and salad.

486
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,351
The larder is empty.

487
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,984
Go wake up the innkeeper.

488
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,185
He'll probably charge me ten louis.

489
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,188
But there's a curfew.
I'll be arrested!

490
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,756
They won't bother you.

491
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,303
You're known at the section-house.

492
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,599
Go quick or I'll dismiss you.

493
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,251
The patrol!
They're coming down the street.

494
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,055
All right, let's wait.

495
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,095
Forgive me, Madame...

496
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,928
Monsieur, who are you?

497
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,535
How dare you enter my house

498
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,972
at such an hour in times like these?

499
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:06,965
Have mercy.

500
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,676
I turned myself in this afternoon.

501
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,745
I was acquitted
and allowed to go home.

502
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,255
As I passed your door,

503
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,690
I thought I'd greet you.

504
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,388
Greetings, Monsieur,

505
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,826
but should I believe you?

506
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,355
He's lying.

507
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,763
You're Champcenetz, aren't you?

508
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:36,971
The Palace governor.
A wanted man, ready for the scaffold.

509
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,141
You nasty aristocrat!

510
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,143
I'd turn you in
if it weren't for Madame.

511
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,370
Go on! Be off!.

512
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,580
Please leave at once.

513
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,911
You'll have us all arrested
for conspiracy.

514
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,053
What are you waiting for?

515
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,994
Over the garden wall.

516
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,819
I'm not sure he can.

517
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,821
Help him.

518
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,129
Get moving, Pulchérie.
I'm hungry.

519
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,600
Now is the time.
The patrol's away.

520
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,402
They'll have gone down Rue Verte.

521
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,107
What if she turns us in?

522
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,380
Where's Nanon?

523
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,949
Gone to ask after her son.
He may be dead.

524
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,691
One misery after another!

525
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,158
I'll be gone, Madame.

526
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,231
Don't endanger yourself.

527
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,175
He needs to lie down.

528
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,209
Come to my bedroom.

529
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,795
Does Madame have any alcohol?

530
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,607
Yes! I think there's some left.

531
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,011
I've an idea, but I doubt
Madame will like it.

532
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,853
Under the circumstances,
Madame won't mind if I am blunt.

533
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,122
If the patrol comes, as it will,

534
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,121
they'll search the house
from top to bottom.

535
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,429
I see only one hiding place,

536
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,994
between the mattresses.

537
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,945
If we pull the middle one out,

538
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,314
we can make a space beside the wall.

539
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,219
But he'll suffocate!

540
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,826
Let's try it.

541
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,933
Your idea is no good.
The bed looks rumpled.

542
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,606
It's suspicious.
They'll want to inspect it.

543
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,139
If I lie in it myself,

544
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,211
they won't think
anyone is hiding there.

545
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,318
Quick, let's not wait for Nanon.

546
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,149
Help me undress.

547
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,384
Good night,Justin.

548
00:43:59,169 --> 00:43:59,931
Who is it?

549
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,137
Pulchérie.

550
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,536
Wait.

551
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,452
All I found was some bread and paté.

552
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,346
Some warm wine is coming.

553
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,118
That Champcenetz, what nerve!
He almost had us hanged,

554
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,196
or guillotined, as they do now.

555
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:32,261
I'd love to see his scrawny head roll!

556
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,768
I'll watch from the front row!

557
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,505
- Forgive me Madame, but...
- I know.

558
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,803
Your son?

559
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,337
I saw him. He's alive.

560
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,379
God be praised!

561
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,378
He spared us that sorrow, at least.

562
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,254
The patrol!

563
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,324
Go and see.

564
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,099
Can you hear? They're coming.

565
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,905
Are you suffocating?

566
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,176
Not if I lie on my side.

567
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,243
Does it make a bigger hump?

568
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,614
Not if I rearrange the sheet.

569
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,676
It's hot.

570
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,346
It makes sense if I push it aside.

571
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,120
Can you breathe?

572
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,586
But I'm hot.

573
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,205
My God! Here they come.

574
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,875
They've all come in.

575
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,079
The municipal officers
want to see Madame.

576
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,016
Let them come in and search.
I've nothing to hide.

577
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,549
Won't you get up?

578
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,415
No, I'm too weary.

579
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,020
Come in, then!

580
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:09,696
What is this?

581
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,103
House search, citizen.

582
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,672
By order of the Commune.

583
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,404
You're suspected of harboring
Mr. Champcenetz.

584
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:24,748
He came here after 1 1 o'clock,
but I showed him out.

585
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,517
We'll see. Please get up.

586
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,745
Must I?

587
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,553
Well, not necessarily.

588
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,121
Not before so many men.

589
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:37,057
If they'll kindly leave, I'll oblige.

590
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,388
Very well. About turn!

591
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,494
Isn't she pretty?

592
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,189
I'll help her dress!

593
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,197
- I'll take her feet!
- Let me see!

594
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:45,590
Silence!

595
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,497
Stand back!

596
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,498
The lady is English.

597
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,701
Don't be a disgrace to the Nation.

598
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,372
Get out!

599
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,624
I'm all a tremble.

600
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,227
Your visit frightened me.

601
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:19,364
But now that I see how kind,
obliging and considerate you are,

602
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,333
and knowing I'm innocent,

603
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,670
I am not the least alarmed.

604
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:30,173
I shall arise and take you in person
around the house.

605
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,481
No need, citizen.

606
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,242
No one we've seen tonight
has been half so civil.

607
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,679
Stay in bed.

608
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,821
I'll be careful with your furnishings.

609
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,558
You, search the room.

610
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,399
You, look upstairs.
You, search the gardens.

611
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,416
How are you, sweetheart?

612
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,023
Hands off!.

613
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:19,519
How about it?

614
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:20,889
What are you up to?

615
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:22,193
Out!

616
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,238
You won't find him.
Madame threw him out.

617
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,169
You can believe Pulchérie.

618
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,375
You know her devotion to the people.

619
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:39,943
She'll tell you how I received him
and sent him away directly.

620
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,911
Madame was outraged
by his impudence.

621
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,453
Would she harbor
so great a foe of the Duke?

622
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,317
Why didn't you
have him arrested at once?

623
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,596
Though I dislike him,
I won't denounce anybody.

624
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,232
Then you're a bad citizen.

625
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,202
A patriot's duty
is to inform on criminals.

626
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,469
Anyway, we'll find him
before tomorrow.

627
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,237
We're wasting our time here.

628
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,512
Good night, citizen Elliott.

629
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:10,780
Let's go, quick!

630
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,491
Will that be all, Madame?

631
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,991
Certainly. Good night, Pulchérie.

632
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,145
Who is it?

633
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,078
Nanon, Madame.

634
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,712
Come in.

635
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:54,980
They've gone.

636
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,992
Thank heaven!

637
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,854
It's over, Madame, don't worry.

638
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:03,764
I know.

639
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,392
Lock the door, quick!

640
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:20,643
He was here!

641
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,047
And you dared! Heavens!

642
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,847
I'm glad I didn't know!

643
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,305
What courage!

644
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,976
And how daring of you
to offer to get up!

645
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,881
What if they had accepted?

646
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,010
They did not.

647
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,180
But I deserve no credit.

648
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:05,188
It is true, I was feeling doomed,

649
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,326
but hearing you groan
beneath the mattress

650
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,263
I suddenly recovered my wits

651
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:16,104
and God gave me more courage
than I ever had before.

652
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,010
When I accepted
without much thought

653
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,540
the task Madame Meyler asked of me,

654
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,979
I had no idea
it would be so perilous.

655
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,981
I naively hoped I would be helping...

656
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,183
forgive me, Sir...

657
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,995
a closer friend than you.

658
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,222
I confess that when the patrol arrived,

659
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,503
I briefly regretted
not having granted your wish

660
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,371
and abandoned you to your fate.

661
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:55,238
But under the threat of those wretches

662
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,810
and the imminence of danger,
I felt a sort of exaltation

663
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:01,815
which was almost supernatural.

664
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:07,146
Rather than escape the peril,
I felt the urge to confront it

665
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:12,587
together with all the innocent victims
of today's barbarians.

666
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:19,161
I suddenly felt ashamed
of not sharing their fate.

667
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:27,337
The horror
of all the atrocities I've seen today

668
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,804
is so strong that surely

669
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,615
I'd have been glad
to climb the scaffold.

670
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,153
If you died,

671
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,515
I would have died with you.

672
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,425
By losing the fear of death

673
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,867
I saved myself, and you as well.

674
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,066
Move into my boudoir.

675
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,717
Marquis?

676
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,254
Can you hear me?

677
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:00,360
Feel him.

678
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:02,569
Such fever!

679
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,276
If he dies, what will we do?

680
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,079
Don't talk nonsense!

681
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,704
Give him some quinine powder.

682
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,204
See who it is.

683
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,994
His Highness, Madame.

684
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,492
Ask him to wait until I'm dressed.

685
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:05,960
I'm coming.

686
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,939
Justin, show him in.

687
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,810
I've come for news.
I heard you returned last night.

688
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,586
Please forgive my disarray...

689
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,057
I know how busy you are.

690
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,528
I wouldn't ask you to wait.

691
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,532
It takes me so long to get dressed.

692
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,732
I must look dreadful.

693
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,303
No, you just look worn out.

694
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,739
Are you sick?

695
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,366
I didn't sleep.

696
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:53,042
The police paid me a call
in the middle of the night.

697
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:58,548
I barely avoided getting up naked
in front of forty men.

698
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:02,491
But their leader,
Jacobin though he was,

699
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,123
had not forgotten his manners.

700
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,729
Revolutionaries are not savages.

701
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:13,702
If you're hiding no one,
you have nothing to fear.

702
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,968
But if you were to hide someone,

703
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,075
you would be putting yourself

704
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,833
in grave danger.

705
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:25,345
No, I wasn't lucky enough
to rescue anyone

706
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,379
from last night's horrors.

707
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,414
I must say I wish I had,

708
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,082
even at my own peril.

709
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,423
If only these dreadful scenes

710
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,821
could cure the admirers
of this hideous Revolution!

711
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,861
These scenes are terrible indeed.

712
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,860
But in all revolutions,
much blood has been spilt

713
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:52,302
and once begun,
it cannot readily be stopped.

714
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,539
Nothing compares

715
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,236
in atrocity

716
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:02,013
with what I saw yesterday
coming from Meudon,

717
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,311
the head

718
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,885
of Madame de Lamballe,

719
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,520
borne on a stake by a raging mob.

720
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,719
I saw it too.

721
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:20,066
My poor sister-in-law's head
was brought to me

722
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,204
as I was dining at Palais-Royal!

723
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,470
This horror is unforgivable.

724
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,973
What harm had she done?

725
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:33,214
As much as I dislike the Queen,
I was very fond of the Princess.

726
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,179
Don't you believe me?

727
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:37,944
I do.

728
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:46,592
I believe you did everything
to prevent these murders

729
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,590
to no avail.

730
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,496
You thought you'd lead the Revolution

731
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,929
but it is leading you
where you never wanted to go.

732
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,173
That's true,

733
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,301
but we must look further ahead.

734
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,740
The Revolution will be of great use
and benefit to our children

735
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,617
although it's terrible
for us to witness.

736
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:15,185
I wish you had remained in England
when you were there.

737
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,024
I would have liked to.

738
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:23,322
I've always envied the life
of an English country gentleman.

739
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,238
While my enemies
taxed me with wishing to be king,

740
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:35,501
I would willingly exchange my lot
and all my fortune

741
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,140
for a small estate in England

742
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,145
and the privileges
of that delightful country,

743
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,414
which I hope to see again.

744
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,354
Why not go back there?

745
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:53,057
Despite the awkwardness
of my position here,

746
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,557
do you think me perverse enough

747
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,368
to go through the streets of Paris
these days

748
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,631
and not feel the deepest distress?

749
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,238
Nevertheless,

750
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:11,439
two years ago,

751
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,016
when La Fayette,
whom I mistook for a patriot

752
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,486
- as all Frenchmen did -

753
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,952
urged me to leave France for a while,

754
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,823
I told him my life
was devoted to serving my country

755
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,263
and I could only leave my seat
at the Assembly

756
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,266
for a position more useful

757
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,266
to the Nation.

758
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,303
My friend,

759
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,273
I know you're a good man,
even too good,

760
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:45,571
and you let yourself be misled
by the semblance of friendship.

761
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,110
But pray go no further!

762
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:54,489
It is not too late
to break loose from the rabble.

763
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:59,792
Don't let them use your name
to commit their loathsome deeds.

764
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,794
All this seems easy to do
in your drawing room.

765
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,362
I wish it were so simple in reality.

766
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:08,835
But...

767
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:13,305
I am swept along in the torrent,
irresistibly.

768
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,035
I am no longer master
of my name or my person.

769
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,350
You can be no judge of my situation

770
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,318
which is unpleasant, I assure you.

771
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,149
For God's sake,

772
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,750
keep your political opinions
to yourself.

773
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,056
Plague me no more on this subject,
it will be of no use.

774
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,896
I must take my leave.

775
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:48,132
I'll call again tomorrow morning
on my way to the Assembly.

776
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,612
You look very ill.

777
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,174
Should I send my physician?

778
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,213
No, thank you.

779
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,349
I just had a bad night.

780
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:19,502
You look better.

781
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,575
The quinine is taking effect.

782
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,713
You overheard us?

783
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,877
I could not help it.

784
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,651
Don't apologize.

785
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,954
With respect, I'm surprised
you didn't tell the truth.

786
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,189
The Duke seemed well disposed.

787
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:40,690
He might have spared you
the danger of hiding me

788
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:45,391
by letting me escape
over his garden wall.

789
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,761
I needed your consent.

790
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,335
The Duke will be back tomorrow.
I'll speak to him.

791
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,611
You seem very preoccupied.

792
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,846
Have there been more horrors?

793
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,016
I know nothing.
I was in Monceau.

794
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:11,254
But I shall hear news at the Assembly.

795
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:16,063
I hope the Royal Family is well

796
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:21,330
and decently treated
in that horrid Temple prison.

797
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,698
I believe so,

798
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,434
although I'm sure they wouldn't pity me

799
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:30,712
if I were in an even worse situation.

800
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:35,344
How can they keep
the poor monarch in prison?

801
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:39,378
He broke his oath to the Nation.

802
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,850
A worthless oath!

803
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,418
Those people believe
in neither God nor Devil.

804
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,626
I myself feel far guiltier than Louis.

805
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,595
He has done nothing.

806
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,166
What have you done?

807
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,633
I'm hiding someone.

808
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,143
Yesterday, you assured me...

809
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,645
Who?

810
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,612
The governor of the Tuileries.

811
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,611
What?

812
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,613
Champcenetz?

813
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:16,981
Poor woman,
there's no greater crime today!

814
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,262
He can't get out of Paris.

815
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,830
He'll be discovered.
You'll both be executed!

816
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,526
Can't you let him out
through your garden?

817
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,265
It's surrounded by troops.

818
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:35,207
Dear Grace, you're risking your life
for a miserable cause.

819
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:38,441
Champcenetz is a good-for-nothing!

820
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,512
He treated me like an ungrateful oaf.

821
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:45,413
You once gave him
command of a regiment.

822
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,924
Against the Queen's wishes.

823
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,660
She wanted it
for one of her dependants.

824
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:59,724
She thought a prince's regiment
should go to a man of the highest rank.

825
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:05,434
Not to a recent nobleman,
like your protégé!

826
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,872
I enjoyed annoying her.
I did!

827
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,111
Far from being grateful,

828
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,683
he sided with my adversaries.

829
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,552
I'd rather you rescued someone else,

830
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,457
not that miserable creature!

831
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:29,122
Champcenetz would give anything

832
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,196
to see you and implore your pardon.

833
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:37,329
It would be most unwise of me
to meet him.

834
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,572
My people would find out.

835
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:43,934
You could see him
without a single person knowing

836
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,347
except my chambermaid.

837
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,675
I must hurry to the Assembly.

838
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,019
I deeply regret leaving you

839
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:58,226
in the danger into which
your folly has led you.

840
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:02,520
I'll try to see
how I can get this man out,

841
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:07,532
but please keep your politics
to yourself.

842
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,940
Would to God
you were safely in England!

843
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,302
I fear much for your safety here.

844
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,749
The Duke hates me.

845
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:26,879
He's gone to have me arrested.

846
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,752
He would doom me, too.

847
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,691
He will let me out
only to turn me in.

848
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:44,540
If you get out,
I'll see you're brought to safety.

849
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,132
How will you know?

850
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,539
The Duke is trustworthy.

851
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,547
Good day, Sir.
Please sit down.

852
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,225
How are you, Madame?

853
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,653
There's color in your cheeks again.

854
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,665
The mere effect of sleep.

855
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:11,932
Will you have some tea?

856
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,302
I prefer your port wine.

857
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,241
You shouldn't have any.

858
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:25,502
After such confinement,
you seem weak and sickly.

859
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,512
Broth would suit you better.

860
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:31,017
That might arouse
my cook's suspicions.

861
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:32,847
Your Highness,

862
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,616
you are goodness itself.

863
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:38,092
I must have seemed ungrateful.

864
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,256
I meant to explain my behavior.

865
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,192
Mr. de Champcenetz, no explanations.

866
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,462
We'll not discuss the past
or anything other

867
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,969
than the predicament
of this excellent person

868
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,799
who is risking her life to save yours.

869
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:56,845
She is unwell.

870
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:01,281
I fear you are both in extreme danger.

871
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,745
I would help you for her sake,

872
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:08,318
but I fear it may not be possible.

873
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:13,352
You and I must forget
that we met before,

874
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:17,062
for we shall never meet in the future.

875
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:21,125
I hope I will never
hear your name again.

876
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,236
Long ago,

877
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:27,498
I formed my opinion of you.

878
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,675
I'm very annoyed
that you can't leave here,

879
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,816
for I shan't relax
while you're under this roof.

880
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,144
I've said enough.

881
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:43,683
As soon as the barriers were open,
I took Champcenetz to Meudon...

882
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,758
Some time later...

883
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,372
From the Duke of Orleans.

884
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:11,548
''The mail coach
that calls at Saint Denis

885
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:15,548
''will take your protégé to Boulogne
for 50 louis.

886
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:20,427
''I enclose a note to the landlord
of the Pavillon Royal in St. Denis.

887
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,591
''Your affectionate friend,

888
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,400
Orleans.''

889
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:36,805
Some years later, I learned that
Champcenetz got safely to England.

890
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:45,653
In mid-January, the Duke de Biron
asked me to tell his fortune.

891
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,091
Why bother reading cards?

892
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,727
What can you hope
from these terrible times?

893
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,260
You asked me to tell your fortune.

894
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,140
You didn't believe me last time.

895
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,402
I did.

896
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,476
Some of your words came true

897
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,440
before I went to war.

898
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,173
But you ignored them.

899
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,279
I wish the Duke

900
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:20,045
and yourself
had taken my words more seriously.

901
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,750
The King would have kept his crown

902
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:29,361
and you would still be living
in peace and joy

903
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,535
instead of spending your life in hiding

904
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:36,801
without a house or carriage
for shelter.

905
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:38,930
I'm not reduced to that.

906
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,309
Why are you in Paris now

907
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:45,776
without a home,
forced to stay in a hotel?

908
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,041
To clear my name
before the Minister of War.

909
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,518
Clear your name?

910
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,683
Of accusations brought against me

911
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,522
by one Rossignol,
a revolutionary general

912
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,525
under my command.

913
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:02,960
You naively hope to be believed
instead of him?

914
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,465
I'm as good a Republican as he.

915
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:10,906
I shall convincingly refute
the allegations of this madman.

916
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,841
He took part in the
September massacres.

917
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,737
On the contrary, in this day and age,

918
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,604
that is his best credential

919
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:23,846
in the eyes of those
who dare to judge their king.

920
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:30,856
The King's trial is the cruelest,

921
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,426
most abominable act ever known.

922
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,764
What surprises me most

923
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,125
is that not a single French <i>chevalier</i>

924
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,327
had the courage
to set the Convention on fire,

925
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,573
burn all the monsters sitting inside

926
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:48,506
and release the King and Queen
from prison.

927
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,076
It saddens me as much as you,
but have no fear,

928
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,881
at worst, the King will be incarcerated

929
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,185
until things settle down.

930
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,916
Indeed, some of the Convention
will vote for his death, but...

931
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:06,516
it's a comfort to know
that the Duke will not vote.

932
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,561
I have his word for it.

933
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:11,095
What I wish

934
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:14,161
is that he would vote
to free the King.

935
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,259
That's not possible.

936
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,099
He'll never do it.

937
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,532
We must be thankful
that he will abstain, lest,

938
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,942
if the King were banished,

939
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:27,614
he might incite foreign powers
to invade France

940
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,014
with all the consequences.

941
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,619
Worse things could happen!

942
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,624
Those consequences scare me less

943
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:39,320
than the thought of the Duke voting
to incarcerate the King.

944
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,960
Would that I could convince him!

945
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,932
I'd give my life

946
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,201
to spare him that dishonor.

947
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:52,004
I've tried to make him see
the error of his ways.

948
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,632
He seemed persuaded,

949
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:58,905
but he keeps going back
to that Madame de Buffon

950
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,843
who took my place in his heart

951
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:05,509
and follows the politics
of Laclos and Merlin.

952
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:12,751
Will you grant me a favor?

953
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,592
May I meet the Duke here tomorrow?

954
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,261
When I see him
at Madame de Buffon's,

955
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,664
he's never alone

956
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,668
and I cannot speak my heart to him.

957
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,467
Of course.

958
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:28,438
I'm expecting him tomorrow
at two o'clock. Come then.

959
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,881
My respects, Madame.

960
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,728
I rarely see you these days.

961
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:51,994
Politics occupy... and preoccupy me.

962
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,263
I'll come straight to the point.

963
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,332
What is your view of this wicked trial
at the Convention?

964
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,471
Will you sit
with those miscreants?

965
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,346
As a deputy, I must.

966
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,082
How can you sit there

967
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:12,410
and see your king and cousin

968
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,848
dragged before that gathering
of ruffians

969
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:20,653
who dare to insult him
with their interrogations?

970
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:26,000
I wish I could be at the Convention

971
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:30,294
to hurl my shoes
at the President and Santerre!

972
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,169
Restrain yourself, Madame!

973
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,111
I know my duty and need no advice.

974
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,003
I hope that's true,

975
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,772
and you'll vote for the King's release.

976
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,415
Certainly,

977
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,280
and for my own death!

978
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,321
The Duke will not vote.

979
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,885
The King mistreated him all his life,

980
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:52,951
but he is his cousin.

981
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,421
He'll feign illness
and stay at home

982
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,793
on the day of the vote
to decide the King's fate.

983
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,993
Then, Highness,

984
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:06,036
I am sure you won't attend
the Convention that day.

985
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,071
I beg you, don't.

986
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,213
On my word of honor, I won't.

987
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:18,110
Although...

988
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:22,451
I feel the King was guilty
of lying to the Nation,

989
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,226
nothing can induce me,
as his relative,

990
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,123
to vote against him.

991
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,497
A meager consolation.

992
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,364
I see no other.

993
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,372
Please excuse me.

994
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,171
In these circumstances

995
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,375
I have little time for myself...

996
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,238
and my friends.

997
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,684
We'll meet this evening.

998
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,162
I see our poor prince

999
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:12,134
is in such a predicament
that he'll need all his courage

1000
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,542
of which he has plenty

1001
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,468
contrary to some people's suggestions.

1002
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,405
I do not doubt it either, but...

1003
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,509
let me be frank.

1004
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,188
The Duke is very kind,

1005
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,018
and of the best character,

1006
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,791
but no one is less fit
to lead a powerful party.

1007
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,525
Neither his upbringing

1008
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,460
nor his brains

1009
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:46,238
nor his talents equip him
for such high office.

1010
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,509
You, his seditious friends,

1011
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,511
with your flattery, have harmed him.

1012
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:57,883
Who gave him the foolish idea
of being elected to the Convention?

1013
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,787
He is not a gifted orator.

1014
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,386
They've nicknamed him
the Mute Deputy.

1015
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,119
It is my turn to take my leave.

1016
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:12,932
Since the army
has temporarily discharged me,

1017
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,394
may I invite you to my hotel
on Saturday evening

1018
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,670
with Madame Laurent
and General Dumouriez?

1019
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:25,212
We can follow the vote

1020
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,675
which I hope will be merciful.

1021
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,978
Your Girondin friends

1022
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:34,480
are deserting the King.

1023
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:35,853
Will you go with them?

1024
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:38,056
Listen, Madame.

1025
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,689
I know there are rumors in Paris

1026
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:46,229
that I, General Dumouriez,
am wavering from side to side.

1027
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,493
No.

1028
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,534
I am perfectly neutral.

1029
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,302
I act as a soldier.

1030
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:55,236
My duty is to serve the army

1031
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:59,002
in every way I can.
One way is to delay this trial

1032
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,548
which is less iniquitous
than you think.

1033
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:02,976
Don't say that.

1034
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,986
It's an abomination.
Must I be the only one to say it?

1035
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:08,254
With due respect,

1036
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,482
it's not so much iniquitous as useless.

1037
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,290
Instead of disputing the King's fate,

1038
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,964
this precious time
should have been used

1039
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:21,592
to prepare the next campaign.
My arguments support yours.

1040
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,629
Yours are very cold.

1041
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:25,630
To theJacobins, cold reason

1042
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,275
weighs infinitely more

1043
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:32,907
than the warmth of your love and pity.

1044
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:39,679
Even if it's true
that Louis is a lying rascal,

1045
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,622
which most deputies believe,

1046
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,755
we'd be fools to behead him.

1047
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,992
By foreseeing the worst,

1048
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,785
one can avoid it.

1049
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:53,056
A death sentence would have
the same effect on our neighbors

1050
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:56,769
as the Brunswick Manifesto
had on our countrymen.

1051
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,804
We must not alarm Europe.

1052
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:03,533
We must win the people over
with gentleness,

1053
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,306
not drive them away with terror.

1054
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,980
That's why I came back to Paris,

1055
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:12,382
to persuade the Convention
to change its policy.

1056
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,337
The Duke of Orleans entered
the Convention at eight o'clock.

1057
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,302
He will vote for incarceration.

1058
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,104
Good heavens!

1059
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,550
I fear worse yet.

1060
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,154
So far, there's no majority for death.

1061
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:48,815
Let's hope.

1062
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,783
Majority for death,

1063
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,730
including the Duke's vote.

1064
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:32,596
His too?

1065
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,731
He swore to me...

1066
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:37,728
He said,

1067
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,905
''Thinking only of my duty,

1068
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:45,111
''convinced that all who violate
the people's will should die,

1069
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,105
''I vote for death.''

1070
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,752
361 votes in favor,

1071
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,381
360 against.

1072
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:57,757
He tipped the balance.

1073
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,150
No. You must add

1074
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:02,189
26 votes for conditional death.

1075
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:07,434
Counting them will make...

1076
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,772
I'm ashamed to wear this.
The Nation has disgraced itself.

1077
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,841
Let the Republic
find the defenders it deserves!

1078
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:39,824
The Republic has better things to do
than take revenge on its princes

1079
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:41,897
and suspect its generals.

1080
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:43,304
If it condemns us,

1081
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,306
who will defend it?

1082
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,638
I never thought much of Orleans.

1083
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,404
Now that he has blood on his hands,

1084
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:56,239
my scorn has turned
to rightful loathing.

1085
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,515
I weep for his children.

1086
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:06,555
In them, I see as many virtues
as he has vices.

1087
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,855
His cowardice will get him nowhere.

1088
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,865
He's in jeopardy like the rest of us,

1089
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:19,333
free spirits who strove
for the Revolution in its early days.

1090
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:25,243
He won't even have the satisfaction
of saving his own honor

1091
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,079
along with the Revolution's.

1092
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,648
We will have no choice

1093
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:34,845
but to seek asylum with the enemy.

1094
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:36,788
What?

1095
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,585
You're willing to betray France?

1096
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:42,264
What France?

1097
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,630
This ragbag
of power-hungry scoundrels?

1098
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,378
Get me the large basket
from the wardrobe.

1099
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:09,317
Get rid of these clothes
and jewels.

1100
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,626
I don't care how.
Get them out of my sight.

1101
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:16,059
What is it, Madame? The Duke?

1102
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:20,064
He voted for the King's death.

1103
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,463
If he had not,
Louis might have been saved.

1104
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:23,963
Death?

1105
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,068
Yes. He went to the Convention

1106
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:30,839
not to save his cousin but to doom him.

1107
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:36,983
I've never felt so repelled by anyone
as he repels me today.

1108
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,986
I cannot tolerate to have around me

1109
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,621
anything that once belonged to him.

1110
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:50,353
Having belonged to him myself,
I cannot bear myself.

1111
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,591
Without God and my faith
to support me...

1112
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:00,742
Tomorrow morning, pack my trunks

1113
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,176
while I get a travel permit.

1114
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,302
We'll go to Meudon.

1115
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,111
The day the King died
was the saddest I ever saw.

1116
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:08,307
The day the King died
was the saddest I ever saw.

1117
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,781
Even the clouds seemed to mourn.

1118
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:12,984
Meudon is on a hill.

1119
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:16,688
With a spyglass
one could see Place Louis XV.

1120
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,353
There are people there.

1121
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,120
Many?

1122
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:25,031
Yes. The crowds are everywhere.

1123
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,561
I don't want to see.

1124
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,410
Are there soldiers?

1125
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:41,145
I think so. I see blue and red.

1126
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,648
Are they moving?

1127
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,281
- Who?
- I don't know.

1128
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,786
The soldiers, the crowd.

1129
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,297
They're all standing still.

1130
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:09,607
Did you hear that?

1131
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:11,940
What's happening?

1132
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,149
The people are rebelling!

1133
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,216
God be praised!

1134
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:20,813
What can you see?

1135
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:22,882
Nothing.

1136
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:26,252
It looks as if...

1137
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:29,930
What was that?

1138
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:34,559
I don't know.

1139
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,571
I know.

1140
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,508
And so do you.
Come, let's not stay here.

1141
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:56,746
I don't think it is possible
to feel a family misfortune

1142
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,858
as sharply as I feel
the King's death.

1143
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,397
Yet, as you see, my eyes are dry.

1144
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,597
I wept too much beforehand.

1145
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,401
I'll never weep again,

1146
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:13,200
not even over my own death
which will be soon.

1147
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,667
Your death, Madame?

1148
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:18,409
May God preserve and protect you

1149
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,747
as He did the other night.

1150
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:25,581
God works in mysterious ways.

1151
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,983
Now, all we can do is pray.

1152
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,867
About six weeks after the King's death,
I fell very ill...

1153
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,732
About six weeks after the King's death,
I fell very ill...

1154
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:45,764
The patrol!

1155
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:46,935
Again?

1156
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,940
Can't they leave me in peace?

1157
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:55,305
I shan't get up,
but I want to see the officer.

1158
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,108
Bring him in here.

1159
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,341
Greetings, citizen.

1160
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:29,814
Pray what is going on?

1161
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,784
House search, by order.

1162
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:35,122
I've been searched twice already
this week.

1163
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:37,716
For what? There's nothing here.

1164
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,923
The other patrols
were from Meudon and Sevres.

1165
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:45,196
We're from Versailles
and more thorough, believe me.

1166
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,195
Nobody fools us.

1167
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,131
Nor the others.

1168
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,433
I have no wish to fool anyone.

1169
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:57,711
I'm a good citizen and no conspirator.

1170
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,642
We shall see.
We heard you're hiding flour.

1171
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,618
There's a pound of it left
in the kitchen.

1172
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:08,213
Please be quick.

1173
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:12,723
Permit me not to accompany you.
As you see, I am ill.

1174
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:16,790
We'll manage by ourselves.
Good health, citizen!

1175
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:36,575
They've gone.
Madame can sleep.

1176
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:39,982
What are they after?
I wish I knew.

1177
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,420
In fact, I know.

1178
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:46,055
Nothing.
They're just vying to outdo each other.

1179
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:50,854
Bring me my writing box.

1180
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:53,695
It's nearly midnight.

1181
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:55,832
You need sleep.

1182
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,236
I'll sleep in the morning

1183
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,805
while you take this letter
to the doctor.

1184
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:41,943
Would you please

1185
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:46,178
be kind enough

1186
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:48,487
to inform the Duke

1187
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:51,915
that I am feeling better

1188
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,128
and in answer

1189
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,123
to his invitation,

1190
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,561
I intend

1191
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:07,097
to visit him

1192
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,534
at Palais-Royal

1193
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,947
the day after tomorrow.

1194
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,352
You look puzzled.

1195
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,282
Don't think I've forgiven him, but...

1196
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:26,720
he sends me
such endearing letters daily,

1197
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:29,490
I can't help softening towards him.

1198
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,862
He sent me his physician.

1199
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:37,260
He keeps entreating me to visit him
as soon as I am well.

1200
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,005
I owe it to him.

1201
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:45,437
Besides, I have no choice.

1202
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:49,380
I don't want to die for nothing.

1203
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:54,744
When I rescued Champcenetz,
my life didn't matter.

1204
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:59,150
But I don't want to be guillotined
on grounds of mere suspicion.

1205
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,285
Suspicion of what? Dear God!

1206
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,898
Until now,
I never wanted to leave France.

1207
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:08,466
I had made it...

1208
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,165
my adopted country.

1209
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,271
I made its King

1210
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,637
my King.

1211
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:20,804
Now that he is no more,
I shall return to my England.

1212
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:25,583
The Duke alone has the power
to procure me a passport.

1213
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:28,019
He owes me that

1214
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:31,816
for ignoring my advice
and acting as a criminal.

1215
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,221
Now he can redeem himself a little.

1216
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:50,210
You're chilled to the bone.

1217
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:53,569
Would you like some tea to warm you?

1218
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:57,949
For now,just a glass of water.

1219
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:00,109
It's warm in here.

1220
01:31:24,178 --> 01:31:25,202
Take a seat.

1221
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,184
You look unwell.

1222
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,816
I hope you have fully recovered
from your cold.

1223
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,690
Yes, I'm over it.

1224
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:49,368
But it upsets me to see you
after what happened last month.

1225
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:53,797
Your black clothes remind me
of those terrible events.

1226
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:56,101
You are mourning

1227
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:57,768
the King's death
like me, I presume.

1228
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,181
I'm mourning my father-in-law,
the Duke of Penthievre.

1229
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:07,552
His death was doubtless hastened
by the King's.

1230
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:13,717
Or was it by the cruel way
in which the trial was held

1231
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,092
and your vote for his death?

1232
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:20,899
I dare say he died of heartbreak

1233
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:23,029
as I shall.

1234
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:27,067
But your Highness
will die like the poor King

1235
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:28,664
on the scaffold.

1236
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:31,267
Lord, what a state you're in!

1237
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:38,583
I certainly would not
have begged you to come

1238
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,917
had I remotely suspected it.

1239
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:45,523
The King was sentenced
and he is gone.

1240
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:48,387
I could not stop his death.

1241
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,396
My vote was not decisive!

1242
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,825
- There were other votes...
- I know.

1243
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,097
But you promised not to vote.

1244
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:02,137
This is a dismal topic.

1245
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:05,570
You cannot, you <i>must notjudge me.</i>

1246
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:08,077
I know my position.

1247
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,882
I could not avoid doing what I did.

1248
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,953
I may be more pitiable
than you can imagine.

1249
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:20,091
More than anyone in France,
I'm the slave of a faction.

1250
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:25,391
But let's change the subject.

1251
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,094
Things could not be worse.

1252
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:35,040
I want you safe in England.

1253
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:38,235
But how to get you out of France?
I have no idea.

1254
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:41,281
If money can buy a passport,

1255
01:33:41,882 --> 01:33:44,077
I will pay ?500 sterling.

1256
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:47,282
It's all I can do for you now.

1257
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:49,948
Rulers like money,

1258
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,426
that's what gives me hope.

1259
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:56,822
I'll try to approach their ringleaders.

1260
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:00,364
But Robespierre, the ''Incorruptible''

1261
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,860
whom I never see, is all-powerful.

1262
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:05,197
Your archenemy, I hear.

1263
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:08,709
I have every reason to think so,
although...

1264
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:10,737
two months ago,

1265
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:14,170
when he was planning
to have me exiled,

1266
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:18,544
he said I had not been
an unworthy citizen.

1267
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:23,082
My exile would not be a punishment

1268
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,885
but a precaution.

1269
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:29,257
Then he won't be displeased
to see you leave France.

1270
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:32,657
It would be your wisest move.

1271
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,059
Don't you believe it.

1272
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:40,637
They didn't reprieve me from exile
just to see me leave voluntarily,

1273
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,333
or help my friends to leave.

1274
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:47,908
Don't try to fathom
the depths of our politicians' minds.

1275
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:53,842
Will you take tea with me now?

1276
01:34:58,259 --> 01:35:00,124
Will you be dining in the country?

1277
01:35:02,763 --> 01:35:04,196
At my house in Paris.

1278
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:06,858
I'll keep the fires lit for a few days.

1279
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,235
I shall avoid returning to Meudon.

1280
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,434
The patrols from Versailles

1281
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:14,565
and Sevres are harassing me.

1282
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:20,108
Then stay in Paris, although I fear
you won't be treated better here.

1283
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,076
I am told you were very reckless
during the Revolution.

1284
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:28,278
Be careful from now on!

1285
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:31,483
Keep your thoughts to yourself.

1286
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:34,952
Wear black for the King
if you want to, by God,

1287
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:37,730
but say you are mourning a relative

1288
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:42,094
or you'll be in worse trouble
than I can get you out of.

1289
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:46,197
I'd rather you stayed in the country

1290
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:48,968
until you can obtain
a passport to England.

1291
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:54,676
Personally, I wish I'd never left.

1292
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:58,251
Now I'll never see England again.

1293
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:04,214
I'll call in a few days
to report on my progress.

1294
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:07,316
Take a seat, Highness.

1295
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:08,721
I am not staying.

1296
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:16,431
I only came to tell you

1297
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:19,935
to forget about the passport.

1298
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,375
I've done all I could

1299
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:28,070
but I was told by a person in authority,
whom I cannot name,

1300
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:32,218
that you must not apply for one
or even mention England.

1301
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:35,288
You must bear your misfortune
like the others

1302
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:37,148
and keep quiet.

1303
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:48,292
I fear your house will be searched
in the next few days.

1304
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:53,095
I advise you
to dispose of any incriminating papers.

1305
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:58,108
In late March or early April,
when General Dumouriez fled France...

1306
01:36:58,212 --> 01:37:00,112
In late March or early April,
when General Dumouriez fled France...

1307
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:06,146
The Duke, Madame.
With two gendarmes.

1308
01:37:06,787 --> 01:37:07,776
Two gendarmes?

1309
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:13,715
How now?

1310
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:18,191
What's going on?

1311
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:22,062
What is the meaning of your escort?

1312
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:28,336
I'm not escorted by choice.

1313
01:37:28,742 --> 01:37:30,937
It was decided by the powers that be.

1314
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:32,945
Are you under arrest?

1315
01:37:33,414 --> 01:37:35,075
Not quite, yet.

1316
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:37,575
But news has come that Dumouriez,

1317
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:41,451
whose adjutant is my son,
the Duke of Chartres,

1318
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:46,083
refuses to obey
the Convention's orders.

1319
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:49,588
So he's joining the enemy?

1320
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,530
What else can he do
except march on Paris?

1321
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,729
His troops wouldn't follow.

1322
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:59,434
So my ''escort'' is due to my son!

1323
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:05,543
I left you a letter he wrote me

1324
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:08,341
blaming me for the King's death.

1325
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:10,382
You'd be wise to return it to me.

1326
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:33,706
It will endanger you instead.

1327
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:38,436
Have no fear.

1328
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,140
I don't know why I left it with you.

1329
01:38:43,617 --> 01:38:46,984
It dishonors me
and could have imperiled you.

1330
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:51,622
I advise you to burn all correspondence,
however harmless,

1331
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,487
that you may have put aside.

1332
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:00,590
Whether you like it or not,

1333
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:05,227
I approve of your son's
outspoken defense of Louis.

1334
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:14,241
I prefer to be reproached by you
than by him.

1335
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:19,518
You're an incorrigible royalist,

1336
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:22,580
but...

1337
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:26,652
my son's defection,

1338
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:31,119
which some call treason,

1339
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:36,834
undoes all our family's efforts
to support the Revolution.

1340
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:40,502
The Revolution itself annihilated them.

1341
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:43,098
I am left with nothing.

1342
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,301
No family, no friends.

1343
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,813
I shall remain alone
for a short while.

1344
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:52,780
If I must perish,

1345
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:56,218
I shall go willingly,

1346
01:39:56,457 --> 01:40:00,027
disavowing none of my words,
deeds or thoughts,

1347
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:01,324
if you don't mind.

1348
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:04,491
I don't only mind,

1349
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:07,466
I am desolate!

1350
01:40:08,268 --> 01:40:11,396
I loved you and I still love you.

1351
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:14,107
I hope God loves you

1352
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:18,235
and I pray for you
as I hope you would for me.

1353
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:22,346
Prayers would save neither of us,
I fear.

1354
01:40:22,983 --> 01:40:26,612
Perhaps not in this world,
but in the next.

1355
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:32,181
I doubt the Supreme Being
is on the side of tyrants.

1356
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:36,194
He is not on the side of perjurers!

1357
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:38,897
Enough of this.

1358
01:40:40,067 --> 01:40:42,160
It's too late to philosophize.

1359
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:48,206
Dear Grace, I love you.
I want you to be happy.

1360
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:52,739
I firmly believe that if I die,
you will survive.

1361
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:58,913
I am concerned about the money
you invested in my affairs.

1362
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:03,083
I will take steps
to ensure that after my death

1363
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:05,917
the income will be paid to you
in England.

1364
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:10,222
So my demise will not ruin you.

1365
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:13,191
Stop talking like this!

1366
01:41:13,767 --> 01:41:16,759
Who knows which of us will die first?

1367
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:18,661
I shall.

1368
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:22,637
I hope so, for your sake and mine.

1369
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:27,307
Since nobody loves me any more,
why go on living? Adieu.

1370
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:28,738
Prince,

1371
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:32,252
despite everything,

1372
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:35,986
remember that I love you.

1373
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:51,131
That evening

1374
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,135
The guards are here.

1375
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:01,638
Show them in.

1376
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:14,526
Citizen Elliott,

1377
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:18,665
the citizen-president
of the Roule Section

1378
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:21,196
has ordered us to inspect your papers.

1379
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:24,733
My papers? Do you mean...

1380
01:42:24,905 --> 01:42:29,171
Every piece of writing.
Especially letters to you.

1381
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,134
Are they locked away?

1382
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:34,143
Some are.

1383
01:42:34,748 --> 01:42:37,308
- The keys are...
- Leave it to the guard!

1384
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:40,183
Search the writing desk.

1385
01:42:42,256 --> 01:42:45,248
You three, inspect the room.

1386
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:50,689
Search every drawer!

1387
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:55,497
The rest of you, follow me.

1388
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:05,109
Those are personal.
But you may read them.

1389
01:43:05,379 --> 01:43:07,210
I've nothing to hide.

1390
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:11,618
In English, I suppose!

1391
01:43:11,818 --> 01:43:13,843
I don't speak it.

1392
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:15,613
I can translate.

1393
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:18,122
We'll find an interpreter.

1394
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,058
Wrap them up.

1395
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:36,804
You there!

1396
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,440
Bring that writing box.

1397
01:43:46,687 --> 01:43:47,745
Put it here.

1398
01:43:54,361 --> 01:43:57,489
No doubt it has secret compartments.

1399
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:44,008
And what is this?

1400
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:47,313
- A letter.
- I realize that.

1401
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:51,347
It is sealed
and not addressed to you.

1402
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,930
How does it come to be
in your possession?

1403
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:13,098
It was sent to me from Naples.

1404
01:45:13,373 --> 01:45:15,739
Why was it sent via you?

1405
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:19,903
Gentlemen, as you ought to know,

1406
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:22,875
Naples was blockaded
by the French fleet

1407
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:25,608
under Admiral Latouche-Tréville.

1408
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:28,418
It was sent to me by his courier.

1409
01:45:28,855 --> 01:45:30,254
No matter!

1410
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:33,089
As <i>you</i> ought to know, citizen,

1411
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:35,987
England is at war with us.

1412
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:38,422
Corresponding
with the Republic's enemies

1413
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:41,830
is an offense punishable
by the guillotine!

1414
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:46,306
We have long been suspicious of you.

1415
01:45:46,306 --> 01:45:49,707
Now here is the undeniable proof.

1416
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:55,143
Have no doubt,
your fate will soon be settled.

1417
01:45:56,483 --> 01:45:57,882
What are you saying?

1418
01:45:58,051 --> 01:46:00,212
Mr. Fox is your friend.

1419
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:04,322
He's in correspondence
with the Surveillance Committee.

1420
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:07,484
Don't confuse him with Mr. Pitt,

1421
01:46:07,794 --> 01:46:10,558
the Prime Minister,
your sworn enemy.

1422
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:12,723
Mr. Fox is a liberal.

1423
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:14,560
The Committee will decide.

1424
01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:18,768
Anyway, we have orders
to arrest you tonight.

1425
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:42,691
Citizen Grace Georgina Elliott,

1426
01:46:43,463 --> 01:46:47,456
in the name of the Republic,
I arrest you.

1427
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:50,669
Let me at least take a few clothes.

1428
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:52,370
Be quick!

1429
01:46:54,674 --> 01:46:57,040
Fetch me my warmest shawl.

1430
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:23,363
Sit there.

1431
01:47:24,704 --> 01:47:26,399
Shapely wench!

1432
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:39,682
Drink this, it'll warm you up.

1433
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:44,591
It's no Burgundy,
but you can't be choosy now

1434
01:47:44,591 --> 01:47:47,116
with no more dukes or princes
to protect you.

1435
01:47:47,794 --> 01:47:50,354
Without protection, the party's over.

1436
01:47:51,097 --> 01:47:53,031
Answer when you're spoken to!

1437
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:56,701
My protection is my conscience.
I've done no wrong.

1438
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:59,064
If you hadn't conspired,
you wouldn't be here...

1439
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:02,475
About to dance on Place Louis XV.

1440
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:04,402
We'll watch you.

1441
01:48:04,611 --> 01:48:06,511
It'll be a pretty sight, my sweet.

1442
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:08,605
You won't get away.

1443
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:11,950
The guillotine! Ever heard of it?

1444
01:48:12,686 --> 01:48:14,551
Good invention, eh?

1445
01:48:14,721 --> 01:48:16,188
That's progress.

1446
01:48:16,623 --> 01:48:18,420
Makes nice music.

1447
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:20,816
Just three little notes...

1448
01:48:31,571 --> 01:48:32,902
Scared, aren't you!

1449
01:48:33,073 --> 01:48:35,098
A new dance to learn, my pretty!

1450
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:36,967
The steps are easy.

1451
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:40,013
I'm not afraid. I'm innocent.

1452
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:42,880
You're not my judges! Leave me be!

1453
01:48:43,984 --> 01:48:46,953
Leave her alone!
Don't answer them, citizen.

1454
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:51,056
I have the right to say I'm innocent.

1455
01:48:53,126 --> 01:48:58,029
If your only charge against me
is Mr. Fox's letter,

1456
01:48:58,298 --> 01:49:00,357
I'll surely be acquitted.

1457
01:49:01,935 --> 01:49:04,995
If you broke the seal and read it,

1458
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:09,442
you'd see it was sent
not to an enemy of Liberty

1459
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,810
but to a good patriot.

1460
01:49:12,078 --> 01:49:14,478
Why didn't you read it to us?

1461
01:49:15,115 --> 01:49:16,514
Shut up!

1462
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:19,175
I don't want to open it.

1463
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:22,315
I cannot. It was entrusted to me.

1464
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,148
The Committee will decide.

1465
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:54,144
Take your time!

1466
01:49:54,621 --> 01:49:57,055
It's nicer out than in!

1467
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:12,497
Stay here.

1468
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,370
The lavatory's over there
behind the buffet.

1469
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,525
I managed to find you a chair,
citizen.

1470
01:50:35,228 --> 01:50:38,493
For me?
Why show me such favor?

1471
01:50:38,999 --> 01:50:40,489
It was my idea.

1472
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:42,998
I've always thought
you were a good citizen.

1473
01:50:43,536 --> 01:50:46,061
My sister Roseline
is your lace-maker.

1474
01:50:47,173 --> 01:50:48,231
I see!

1475
01:50:48,742 --> 01:50:52,508
I am here because of
a dreadful misunderstanding.

1476
01:50:52,612 --> 01:50:54,580
Then you'll soon be free.

1477
01:51:01,388 --> 01:51:03,379
Please use this chair, ladies.

1478
01:51:04,024 --> 01:51:06,254
It was brought for you, Madame.

1479
01:51:06,559 --> 01:51:09,084
You have the privilege of age

1480
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:11,027
and you were here before me.

1481
01:51:11,164 --> 01:51:14,463
We've stood so far.
We can remain standing.

1482
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:17,467
Let's take turns sitting.

1483
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:20,596
When I'm tired of standing, I'll tell you.

1484
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:22,538
Please, you go first.

1485
01:51:22,642 --> 01:51:24,007
I accept.

1486
01:51:24,444 --> 01:51:26,844
My poor legs are so swollen,

1487
01:51:27,113 --> 01:51:28,910
I fear they will burst.

1488
01:51:31,017 --> 01:51:33,247
Aren't you the Duchess of Grammont?

1489
01:51:35,588 --> 01:51:37,249
And you, the Duchess of Chatelet?

1490
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:38,688
I am.

1491
01:51:39,225 --> 01:51:42,262
And who are you?

1492
01:51:42,262 --> 01:51:45,425
If we ever get out of here,
we must meet again.

1493
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:48,228
I see you're persecuted
for the right cause.

1494
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:50,364
My name is Grace Elliott.

1495
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:52,069
I thought so.

1496
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:55,065
Abbé de Damas often told me

1497
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:59,507
of how you risked your life
to help a fugitive

1498
01:51:59,813 --> 01:52:03,874
and of the good advice
you gave an unfortunate prince.

1499
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,017
You look very light.

1500
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:11,380
Why don't you sit on my lap?

1501
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:20,728
I must be heavy.

1502
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:22,725
Light as a feather.

1503
01:52:23,136 --> 01:52:24,763
And you smell so good!

1504
01:52:25,171 --> 01:52:28,163
It shields me
from the filthy stench in here.

1505
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:30,167
It's my secret.

1506
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:34,175
A small lavender bag

1507
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:37,410
that my chambermaid
thoughtfully gave me this morning.

1508
01:52:45,191 --> 01:52:46,123
Follow me.

1509
01:52:48,628 --> 01:52:49,356
Quick.

1510
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:52,763
God be with you.

1511
01:52:53,466 --> 01:52:54,831
You too.

1512
01:53:02,342 --> 01:53:03,639
''It's a joy to see

1513
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,438
''how, little by little,

1514
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:08,379
''the holy guillotine will deliver us

1515
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:10,711
''from all the human flesh-eaters.''

1516
01:53:18,424 --> 01:53:19,413
Follow me.

1517
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:23,461
Not you.

1518
01:53:44,384 --> 01:53:47,251
Prince!
All is well with you, I hope.

1519
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:51,321
By God, Grace! It's you?
I am very sorry indeed.

1520
01:53:51,524 --> 01:53:53,617
What has befallen you?

1521
01:53:53,693 --> 01:53:55,627
And you?

1522
01:53:58,631 --> 01:53:59,732
Is he going to prison?

1523
01:53:59,732 --> 01:54:02,200
No, to Palais-Royal.
Until further notice.

1524
01:54:10,376 --> 01:54:12,276
You heard what he said to her?

1525
01:54:13,213 --> 01:54:15,078
Yes. Very suspicious.

1526
01:54:18,384 --> 01:54:19,009
Next.

1527
01:54:32,232 --> 01:54:33,529
Please be seated.

1528
01:54:47,647 --> 01:54:48,841
Citizen Elliott,

1529
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:52,044
Georgina Grace,

1530
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:55,421
née Dalrymple.

1531
01:54:56,489 --> 01:54:57,924
What has she done?

1532
01:54:57,924 --> 01:55:01,621
She's an Englishwoman
residing on Rue Miromesnil.

1533
01:55:03,196 --> 01:55:05,926
We found this letter in her house.

1534
01:55:06,499 --> 01:55:08,990
From one Englishman to another.

1535
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:21,406
It is unopened.

1536
01:55:22,348 --> 01:55:23,542
What is in it?

1537
01:55:24,484 --> 01:55:26,349
I have no idea at all.

1538
01:55:26,686 --> 01:55:30,213
I was asked
to forward it to Mr. Fox.

1539
01:55:31,658 --> 01:55:34,218
A blatant case of conspiracy.

1540
01:55:34,827 --> 01:55:36,920
I know the woman. She's a royalist.

1541
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:41,598
She plotted in England to wed
Orleans' daughter to an English prince.

1542
01:55:41,834 --> 01:55:43,495
Send her to the Force prison!

1543
01:55:44,337 --> 01:55:48,171
Citizen Chabot,
I find you somewhat hasty.

1544
01:55:49,309 --> 01:55:51,607
Why was this person arrested

1545
01:55:51,744 --> 01:55:54,406
for having a letter to Mr. Fox
in her house?

1546
01:55:55,715 --> 01:56:00,049
Had it been to that rascal Pitt,
you couldn't have treated her worse.

1547
01:56:00,253 --> 01:56:03,450
Mr. Fox is our friend,
the friend of a free world.

1548
01:56:03,723 --> 01:56:05,816
He loves our Revolution.

1549
01:56:06,326 --> 01:56:10,319
Then, citizen Vergniaud,
let's open the letter to make sure.

1550
01:56:10,463 --> 01:56:12,556
No. It is needless and improper.

1551
01:56:13,099 --> 01:56:16,626
Is it honorable to read
a private letter to a great man?

1552
01:56:16,736 --> 01:56:18,067
It shan't be done.

1553
01:56:18,237 --> 01:56:20,637
We'll send the letter intact to Mr. Fox.

1554
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:23,208
No. It must be opened and read.

1555
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:25,670
I agree.

1556
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:27,438
Do you?

1557
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:28,341
No.

1558
01:56:28,448 --> 01:56:29,574
Yes.

1559
01:56:29,682 --> 01:56:30,478
Likewise.

1560
01:56:41,394 --> 01:56:43,658
Latouche-Tréville's manifesto.

1561
01:56:48,034 --> 01:56:49,661
It's in English.

1562
01:56:54,374 --> 01:56:58,140
Our interpreter is inspecting papers
in a suburb of St. Germain.

1563
01:56:58,344 --> 01:57:00,312
We cannot wait for him.

1564
01:57:01,748 --> 01:57:02,646
Citizen Elliott,

1565
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:07,184
please come forward
and translate for us.

1566
01:57:16,829 --> 01:57:17,955
Don't cheat!

1567
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:21,523
We know enough English
to tell if you're lying.

1568
01:57:58,805 --> 01:58:00,773
Here's our interpreter. Sit down.

1569
01:58:03,376 --> 01:58:05,537
Translate this from the beginning.

1570
01:58:09,048 --> 01:58:11,312
''I enclose within this missive

1571
01:58:11,517 --> 01:58:14,247
''the manifesto
from Admiral Latouche-Tréville

1572
01:58:14,353 --> 01:58:16,446
''to the King of Naples.

1573
01:58:17,356 --> 01:58:19,290
''I cannot help but admire

1574
01:58:19,625 --> 01:58:25,063
''the bravery and energy
of the French nation at this time.

1575
01:58:25,565 --> 01:58:28,835
''I share your belief

1576
01:58:28,835 --> 01:58:30,803
''that the French Revolution

1577
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:34,840
''is one of the world's
most glorious events.

1578
01:58:35,808 --> 01:58:39,335
''Human rights are the true foundation

1579
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:42,514
''of every rational constitution,

1580
01:58:43,049 --> 01:58:46,815
''as they are
of England's own Constitution.

1581
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:49,646
''The war in America

1582
01:58:49,755 --> 01:58:52,417
''has taught us that a people's uprising

1583
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:54,417
''is never spurious.''

1584
01:58:58,798 --> 01:58:59,696
What about that?

1585
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,465
Isn't it magnificent?

1586
01:59:04,003 --> 01:59:05,436
Wasn't I right?

1587
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:10,000
Citizen,

1588
01:59:10,209 --> 01:59:11,972
accept our apologies.

1589
01:59:12,478 --> 01:59:13,570
You may go.

1590
01:59:29,362 --> 01:59:30,488
You must be very tired.

1591
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:33,959
One of the Committee's carriages
will drive you home.

1592
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:37,968
I can hardly stand up
after spending two horrid nights

1593
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:41,268
in sordid, brutal conditions.

1594
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:47,045
The people of your section were
overzealous. They've wasted our time.

1595
01:59:48,614 --> 01:59:51,014
Citizen!
A few more questions, if I may.

1596
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:57,647
Do you know citizen d'Orleans,
also known as <i>Egalité?</i>

1597
02:00:01,127 --> 02:00:04,961
Did you speak with him
in the waiting room just now?

1598
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:08,999
I only asked him how he was.

1599
02:00:09,769 --> 02:00:12,203
What, pray, did he say?

1600
02:00:14,073 --> 02:00:15,734
He said,

1601
02:00:16,976 --> 02:00:20,207
''By God, I am sorry to see you here.''

1602
02:00:20,446 --> 02:00:23,381
He was afraid
you'd be questioned about him

1603
02:00:23,549 --> 02:00:25,380
and would betray him.

1604
02:00:26,686 --> 02:00:29,018
I was examined and found innocent.

1605
02:00:29,655 --> 02:00:30,890
Please let me go!

1606
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:32,825
This is a different charge.

1607
02:00:32,825 --> 02:00:33,757
As a Committee member,

1608
02:00:34,193 --> 02:00:36,718
I can indict you
as Orleans' accomplice.

1609
02:00:37,029 --> 02:00:38,587
God, will this never end?

1610
02:00:38,798 --> 02:00:40,026
Tears do not move us.

1611
02:00:40,499 --> 02:00:45,129
The tears shed in this room
could supply all of Paris with water.

1612
02:00:45,671 --> 02:00:49,208
Orleans wanted to be king
and overthrow the Republic.

1613
02:00:49,208 --> 02:00:50,641
I'm sure he didn't.

1614
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:52,038
You know he did!

1615
02:00:52,144 --> 02:00:54,772
That's why he voted
for the King's death.

1616
02:00:54,947 --> 02:00:58,007
With all my heart, I wish he hadn't.

1617
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:00,677
He could be happy now.

1618
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:02,578
Then why did he vote?

1619
02:01:03,856 --> 02:01:07,849
Because you made him
commit that ghastly crime.

1620
02:01:09,629 --> 02:01:11,096
You call it a crime?

1621
02:01:12,465 --> 02:01:14,990
It's reckless of you
to say so here,

1622
02:01:15,201 --> 02:01:17,567
in front of 50 Convention members

1623
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:19,729
who all voted the tyrant Capet dead

1624
02:01:20,006 --> 02:01:23,772
not to become kings,
but to rid the world of his vile race!

1625
02:01:24,043 --> 02:01:26,637
Now we'll deal with the would-be king

1626
02:01:26,812 --> 02:01:28,507
and admirer of England,

1627
02:01:28,814 --> 02:01:31,874
that graveyard of Liberty
with which he connives,

1628
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:34,945
and you too!
You won't escape me.

1629
02:01:35,221 --> 02:01:38,088
Take her to prison!
She must be tried!

1630
02:01:38,257 --> 02:01:39,781
You're going too far.

1631
02:01:39,859 --> 02:01:40,883
She's been tried.

1632
02:01:41,494 --> 02:01:43,155
She's Mr. Fox's friend.

1633
02:01:43,829 --> 02:01:45,057
She can't have plotted.

1634
02:01:45,364 --> 02:01:47,389
There's no proof at all.

1635
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:51,865
What is this din?
What's going on?

1636
02:01:52,171 --> 02:01:53,160
Citizen Robespierre,

1637
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:56,768
they won't let me
arrest this Englishwoman,

1638
02:01:57,243 --> 02:01:59,905
a friend of Orleans and a conspirator.

1639
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:01,747
Has she been heard?

1640
02:02:02,048 --> 02:02:03,037
And acquitted.

1641
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:04,684
On another charge, and wrongly so.

1642
02:02:04,684 --> 02:02:09,288
She was found with a letter
to Charles Fox, our friend.

1643
02:02:09,288 --> 02:02:10,656
What was in it?

1644
02:02:10,656 --> 02:02:13,090
It praises the actions
of our fleet in Naples.

1645
02:02:21,367 --> 02:02:23,858
We have more important business.

1646
02:02:25,071 --> 02:02:26,368
Let her go home.

1647
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:28,767
There's time to decide.

1648
02:03:15,588 --> 02:03:17,385
It's six o'clock.

1649
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:19,917
Is it morning or evening?

1650
02:03:20,025 --> 02:03:23,756
Morning. Madame has slept
since yesterday afternoon.

1651
02:03:26,031 --> 02:03:27,191
I can get up

1652
02:03:28,167 --> 02:03:30,829
although I'm not quite rested.

1653
02:03:31,303 --> 02:03:33,965
Did Madame see the letter
on her nightstand?

1654
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:38,006
The Duke sent it yesterday.
I didn't dare wake you.

1655
02:03:41,814 --> 02:03:44,339
He says he's coming at noon.

1656
02:03:45,351 --> 02:03:48,081
But I have to leave for Meudon.

1657
02:03:49,922 --> 02:03:54,018
I'll send him word to come...
when I return tonight at eight.

1658
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:57,288
Justin can deliver it.

1659
02:04:05,104 --> 02:04:07,095
I couldn't deliver it.

1660
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:09,339
I went to Palais-Royal.

1661
02:04:10,276 --> 02:04:11,937
The Duke was arrested this morning.

1662
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:15,247
In his bed, at 4 a.m.

1663
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,945
Throw it in the fire.

1664
02:04:28,327 --> 02:04:29,294
Wait!

1665
02:04:32,998 --> 02:04:35,967
Hang the Duke's portrait
back on the wall.

1666
02:05:07,566 --> 02:05:12,435
Philippe d'Orleans was escorted
to Fort St.Jean in Marseilles

1667
02:05:17,276 --> 02:05:21,542
and then back to Paris
to be executed on November 5th.

1668
02:05:26,752 --> 02:05:29,778
By then,
Grace Elliott was under arrest.

1669
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:35,754
While her fellow captives' heads rolled,

1670
02:05:36,795 --> 02:05:41,198
she awaited her turn,
which did not come.

1671
02:06:07,826 --> 02:06:11,990
The fall of Robespierre set her free.
