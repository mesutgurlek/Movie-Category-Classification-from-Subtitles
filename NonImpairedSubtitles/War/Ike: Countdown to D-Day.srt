1
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,186
Let me put this another way.

2
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:31,189
lf I am not given complete and
unfettered command of this situation...

3
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,594
...you can,
if I may put it politely, sir...

4
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:39,671
...take this job and put it where you
choose because I'll damn well quit.

5
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,036
My other generals say it's unwise.
Too much responsibility for one man.

6
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,037
Then find other generals.

7
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,473
Even your own other generals
say the same thing.

8
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,142
Then I'll also find new ones.

9
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,181
I know who we're talking about here,
prime minister.

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,125
Your Air Marshal Harris
and my General Jimmy Spaatz.

11
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:09,491
The RAF and the U.S. 8th Air Force
want to fight their own war.

12
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,193
Win it with strategic bombing.

13
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,999
-They think--
-I know what they think, general.

14
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,303
And it is very seductive.

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,511
Continue the saturation bombing
of the Continent...

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,671
...until the enemy's lost
his will to fight.

17
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,450
Leave him defeated and dispirited...

18
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,520
...before your invasion force
even sets foot ashore.

19
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,053
lf there's a shore to set foot on.

20
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,160
That kind of bombing would turn
Paris into a soccer field...

21
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,421
...Holland into a swimming pool.

22
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,026
You were an infantry officer,
prime minister.

23
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,797
We both know wars
can only be won on the ground.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,970
America did not send a million
of its finest men to stand by...

25
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:56,673
...while faceless aircraft destroy the
Europe they're willing to die to save.

26
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:03,947
And I don't believe you rallied
the British people to fight on, alone...

27
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,854
...all these long years
to bear so much...

28
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:11,725
...only to see the great cities
of Europe become heaps of rubble.

29
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,226
We have to do more than liberate
Europe. We have to save it.

30
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,676
We're soldiers, you and l.
There can only be one commander.

31
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,540
One conductor of this orchestra.

32
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,410
One supreme commander...

33
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,546
...in the air, on the ground, at sea.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,123
Or face interservice bickering,
clashing egos...

35
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,590
...conflicting operational deployments.

36
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,559
One invasion, one commander.

37
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,366
A sampling of this morning's
editorial contribution:

38
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,939
''As the Allies prepare for
our greatest challenge of the war...

39
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,050
...our leaders must not lose sight...

40
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,779
...of the true measure
of military leadership.

41
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,820
The victories
of General Montgomery...

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,824
...at El Alamein, Sicily and
every campaign he has undertaken...

43
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,929
...deserve prime consideration.

44
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,467
His hand is never far from such
forward momentum...

45
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,727
...as we have enjoyed in this war.

46
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,430
No other general
can make that claim.''

47
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,705
I could go on, but they're all
much of a muchness.

48
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,779
I don't deny Monty's achievements
as a field commander.

49
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,143
Whilst you can make no such claim.

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,014
Come, come, general. Don't take
offense. We're too close for that.

51
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:51,152
Monty's not the man for this. We both
know it. Far too in love with his image.

52
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,800
There's no shortage of men who would
like the title ''supreme commander.''

53
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,466
Or even a part of it. And l--
We must identify each man...

54
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,939
...and decide whether or not he is fit.

55
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,148
Harris?

56
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,913
-Far too oblivious to destruction.
-Certainly not Spaatz.

57
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,124
Too flamboyant. Marshall?

58
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,989
You know F.D.R.
won't let him leave Washington.

59
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,926
And Mountbatten
is commanding in the Pacific.

60
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,503
Then who?

61
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:46,316
Your own Mr. Roosevelt has his
doubts about a supreme commander.

62
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:50,183
I leave him to you, sir.
You'll be able to set him straight.

63
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:58,754
No human in history has ever held
the power for which you now ask.

64
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,932
Not Caesar, not Alexander, no man.

65
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,330
Ever.

66
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,339
But this is Eisenhower
you're considering.

67
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:17,743
ls this relatively untried American
the right man for the job?

68
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,011
-Very popular with the men.
-lrrelevant.

69
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,985
Disciplined soldiers
fight at their leader's command...

70
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,057
...whoever that might be.

71
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,092
My victories that brought
us back North Africa...

72
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,425
...weren't won because I was popular
with the ordinary ranks.

73
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,627
No, I dare say. Brandy?

74
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:42,435
-No, thank you.
-Oh, I forgot your strict scruples.

75
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:48,879
General, let it not come
as a surprise to you.

76
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:55,620
The decision is as good as made.
There will be no turning back.

77
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,916
Eisenhower is to be
supreme commander.

78
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,027
That is the consensus of the Allies.

79
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,598
I see. Politics first, is it?

80
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,267
Yes?

81
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,731
Yes, chief whip?

82
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,965
Time to prepare for the afternoon
question period, prime minister.

83
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,712
One last thought, prime minister.

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,371
There's more than one way
to skin this cat.

85
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,141
lf things remain as they are...

86
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,843
...let Eisenhower be
the de facto figurehead.

87
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,922
Just don't formalize it.
Leave some room for the rest of us.

88
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,618
Oh, l'm sure you'll find some way
to maneuver, general.

89
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,128
You know my admiration
for your soldiering skills.

90
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,204
There are two kinds
of problem drinkers, chief whip.

91
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,173
Those who drink too much
and those who drink too little.

92
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:57,612
I believe it's a religious thing with
the general. Strict Methodist, I think.

93
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,252
Oh, might be an asset.

94
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,781
Way the odds
are on this thing...

95
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,516
...we could use somebody
on close terms with God.

96
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,938
Giving Monty a private audience?

97
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,379
You could call it that.

98
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,212
Man's a pain in the ass.

99
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,685
Kind of megalomaniac who's got his
own ideas how to win this war.

100
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,916
He'll never accept you.
I admire Churchill much as any man...

101
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,653
...but not even he could sell that
without some sticking in the craw.

102
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,357
Churchill's not there to sell.
His job is making decisions.

103
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,364
Mine is to make them work.

104
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,026
Yeah, well, you're tough enough
to make it happen.

105
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,605
Even with the generals
and admirals he offended.

106
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,538
l'm glad you feel that way
because if we foul up...

107
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,702
...we'll end up sharing
a supply desk in Washington.

108
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,112
You'd lose your operational rank.
They'd take away three stars.

109
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,516
-Remember '38 in the summer?
-Yeah.

110
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,783
Careers had stalled.
We figured we'd be passed over...

111
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,484
-...and mustered out within a year.
-As colonels.

112
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,858
-Yes, as colonels.
-So we'd still be ahead of the game.

113
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,830
Now, tell me about the tanks
in the sand.

114
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,372
Those beaches aren't really sand.
They're pebble and rock.

115
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,205
Your 3:00 meeting is here.

116
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,070
Your unfriendly friendly.
I'll slip out the back.

117
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,062
Tut-tut.

118
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:03,164
Needlessly timid, if you ask me.
And I trust you are asking me.

119
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:08,405
Of course. That's why we're here. For
a frank discussion, just you and me.

120
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,311
Good. Then I will be frank.

121
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,544
Like all battles,
this one will be won on the ground.

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,247
But not necessarily by infantry men,
one foot at a time.

123
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:22,690
Armor can slash through first,
leaving infantry to consolidate gains...

124
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:27,060
...but that requires
a flexible master plan.

125
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,862
We might find a sudden lunge across
the low countries, a dagger aimed...

126
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,972
...at the heart of Berlin
could end the war by Christmas.

127
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,236
The concept for a broad landing
at Normandy has been approved.

128
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,675
Given the political sensibilities
involved...

129
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,609
...there's no going back on that.

130
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:47,242
You're the supreme commander.
The politics are your concern.

131
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,684
My interest is
the most effective strategy...

132
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,755
...and tactical moves
to support it.

133
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,627
A massive invasion will be tipped to
Jerry's intelligence, we know that.

134
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,094
He'll be ready to defend across
a broad front.

135
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,065
A slashing blow will be harder for him
to concentrate his troops against...

136
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,463
...with any depth.

137
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,572
Unless the German knows where
the slashing blow is coming.

138
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,006
Then, as you put it,
with his intelligence alerted....

139
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,774
You're being inflexible.

140
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,473
l'm adhering to a master plan.

141
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:25,013
Once we have established beachhead,
we can reexamine our options.

142
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,254
I see.

143
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:32,125
And as commander of all land forces,
I'll have my say in that reexamination?

144
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,461
Absolutely.

145
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:39,196
Now, let me outline
my expectations...

146
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,966
...for your ground forces
once ashore.

147
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,510
Here, the ground slopes easily.

148
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,428
Sir, it wouldn't take
more than 1 5 minutes.

149
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,574
Fifteen minutes better spent
on real work, captain.

150
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,778
With respect, sir,
public relations is real work.

151
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,073
I know you don't
have time for the press...

152
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,410
...but folks back home need
to know you.

153
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,211
Human face of the leader, sir.

154
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,583
Mr. Roosevelt is their leader,
and mine.

155
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,951
-Yeah, but--
-lnterview division commanders.

156
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,592
Try some platoon sergeants.

157
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,126
What about my chief of staff,
General Smith?

158
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,827
What do you say, Beetle? Want
to show the world your human face?

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,797
Sorry, sir. I wasn't issued one.

160
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,105
This isn't MacArthur's HQ, where he
has to be at the center of everything.

161
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,038
We're a team here.

162
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,611
So go get some publicity
for the running backs. That is all.

163
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,042
Yes, sir.

164
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:09,460
-He's arrived.
-I saw. I could hardly miss it.

165
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:19,666
Beetle, he's brilliant,
but sometimes he acts like a child.

166
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,864
Are you thinking
of sending him home?

167
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,305
Let's have him.

168
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,510
He'll see you now.

169
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,117
-You gonna keep the helmet on?
-Damn right.

170
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,604
I think you know why you're here.

171
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,108
More or less.

172
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,475
Some prep-head politician stateside
got pissed at the truth.

173
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,675
That's neither more nor less, George.
lt's damned ignorant.

174
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,317
''Anglo-Saxons to rule the postwar
world.'' What the hell is that?

175
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,719
The straight skinny.

176
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,594
When this is over,
it will be us and the Brits...

177
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,696
...have to put
the world back together.

178
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,059
That's gonna come
as a surprise to Stalin...

179
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,599
...who's losing millions
on the eastern front.

180
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,828
Yeah, communism's for the next war.

181
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,270
Goddamn it, George. Shut up.

182
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,977
The Czechs are also in this war.

183
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,912
And the Dutch and the Danes
and God knows who else.

184
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,180
And above all...

185
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,878
...it's racialism.

186
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,217
lt's the very thing we're fighting.

187
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:52,020
I can't have my generals
spouting idiocy Hitler would applaud.

188
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,999
Anglo-Saxon superiority? That's
exactly the kind of pigheaded crap...

189
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,865
...that will make Stalin think
we are the next enemy.

190
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,300
Sometimes I think you don't have
the vaguest idea why we're fighting.

191
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,309
-That's not fair, lke.
-lt is if it's true.

192
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,318
l'm not sending a bunch of fresh
young kids from lowa and California...

193
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:18,115
...and New York and Nebraska to die
on French beaches for the freedom...

194
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,626
...of people they know nothing about
so we can establish a new racial order.

195
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,723
l'm asking them to die
to prevent precisely that.

196
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:33,235
And they're ready to do it.
And that's why they're heroes.

197
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:40,503
And why slapping a shell-shocked
soldier as a malingerer is never...

198
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,581
...never permissible!
Do you understand me, sir?

199
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,882
You should know
that despite the fact...

200
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,994
...that he doubts
your worthiness to command...

201
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:01,664
...that General Marshall has left it
to me to decide how to handle this.

202
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,235
So I ask you again.
Do you understand?

203
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,073
Sir, yes, sir.
I understand completely.

204
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,446
I do, lke. I swear I do.

205
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,020
What I don't get, I'll study.
I promise.

206
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:31,320
I swear, I promise. Just please...

207
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,826
...don't send me home.

208
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,129
Please, lke.

209
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,604
I couldn't bear to be in Washington
when the show starts.

210
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,675
Don't do that to me. I beg you.

211
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,274
Soldier to soldier, that I'll keep
my mouth shut. I promise you.

212
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,649
Soldier to soldier.

213
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,950
Soldier to soldier.

214
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,417
I wish it were that simple.

215
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,221
You were my mentor.

216
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,197
My senior officer,
who told me once a long time ago...

217
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,767
...that one day
l'd be giving him orders.

218
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,672
Well, that day's come, George.
And that's the truth.

219
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,902
Soldier to soldier.

220
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,679
Last time, Georgie.

221
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,280
Last time.

222
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,889
Thank you.

223
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,878
Sir, may I return
to my headquarters now?

224
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,998
Gentlemen.

225
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:30,672
Played him like a violin.
Ate out of my hand, he did. Drive on.

226
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,846
-How'd it go?
-l'm keeping him on.

227
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,394
Probably thinks
he put one over on me.

228
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,462
Hell, maybe he did.

229
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,163
Let's keep him in Maidenhead,
commanding his fictitious army.

230
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,735
Now Rommel thinks he's my ace.

231
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,966
Besides, once we get ashore,
I'll need him...

232
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,770
...to command real tanks.

233
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,343
Traff, what you got?

234
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,339
Early estimates of airborne losses.

235
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,783
Assume perfect weather,
and we go with a full or half-moon.

236
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:14,415
No crosswind at the drop zone,
losses could be low as 8 percent.

237
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,757
But should any of the elements turn
against us, casualties will spiral.

238
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,300
They might hit a quarter or more.

239
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,270
One in four.

240
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,332
What's the split between
wounded and dead?

241
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,041
Oh, with paratroopers, one might
as well assume they're all dead.

242
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,311
A wounded jumper is a cripple.

243
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,947
And we all know this enemy.

244
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,361
l'm ahead of you.

245
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,394
What the hell time is it?

246
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,562
lt's 0520.

247
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,971
But you want to be woken for this.

248
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,038
ln from Southwest Command,
just decoded.

249
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,815
All chiefs of staff
in the map room, 20 minutes.

250
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,816
No doubt in your mind about this?

251
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,252
Afraid not.

252
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:31,192
The craft's scars could only be made
by Krupp Essen U-2 1 0 torpedoes.

253
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,729
Then the German
is right off the coast.

254
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,524
What about damage?
Too much for a loner.

255
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,466
Absolutely. This was a full pack.

256
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,539
ln daylight, C-search patrols
can spot E-boats...

257
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,802
...as soon as they come
close enough to fire torpedoes.

258
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,912
But at night, under radar....

259
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,346
Then what in damnation were men
doing out there after nightfall?

260
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,179
Landing-craft drivers
were having a difficult time...

261
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,379
...managing these new
duplex-drive craft.

262
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,888
They're fragile in anything
but good weather.

263
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,993
Division commander felt
they needed more experience.

264
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,860
Then the man is a damned fool and
should be relieved of his command.

265
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,467
You won't find any
of my divisional commanders...

266
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,002
...playing silly buggers
with Jerry concealed.

267
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,036
How many landing craft lost?

268
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:20,076
First estimates are at 1 1 , possibly 1 2.
But we've only seen two or three hulls.

269
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,940
Any intercepted Jerry signals?

270
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,641
E-boat captains radioed Berlin,
claiming two dozen.

271
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,348
We went on the air
with a decodable signal...

272
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,647
...to Patton's fictitious army...

273
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,983
...saying it lost five landing craft.

274
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,092
First reports back
from Signal Corps...

275
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,387
...indicate Jerry bought
the whole program.

276
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,360
l'd be surprised if Jerry's
really buying the idea...

277
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,194
...that the bulk of our forces
are in the east.

278
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,700
I wouldn't. Not with activity
in the southwest.

279
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,499
I take your point.

280
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,070
But we have fake tanks,
trucks and landing craft...

281
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,338
...deployed throughout
that entire region.

282
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:59,143
And our psychological
warfare squads in Norwich...

283
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,719
...generate more radio traffic
than our entire force doubled.

284
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,957
They use a new magnetic wire
that records Morse messages...

285
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,922
...and repeats it night and day.
From what we monitor...

286
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,586
...the Germans have moved
a full signal battalion to Dieppe...

287
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,391
...in order to sort it out.

288
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,161
We have Patton's HQ
in Maidenhead.

289
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,739
The enemy is certain he will be field
commander of any Allied invasion.

290
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,300
-They can't imagine anyone else.
-Well, hell.

291
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,937
lf Hitler had half his wits about him,
he'd be on Monty's tail night and day.

292
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:37,612
And there is no sign that the
3rd Air Fleet, the 1 6th Army...

293
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,247
...or any of 1 6 panzer divisions
southward.

294
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,088
I think we fooled them.

295
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,895
He believes Patton's
fictitious army is real.

296
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,594
He's not really watching Normandy.

297
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,072
-For now, at least.
-Precisely, for now.

298
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,766
Rommel's no fool. Sooner or later,
he'll figure out there's a limit...

299
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,468
...to the size of our force,
send flights...

300
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,806
...to inspect Patton's army
and discover...

301
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,280
...that all his tanks and trucks
are nothing but papier-mache.

302
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,385
Tell me about these men we lost.

303
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:13,047
And what is this duplex-drive problem
on the damn landing craft?

304
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,321
The DDs? Well, the men
call them Donald Ducks...

305
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,055
...because they're not
that easy to understand.

306
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,995
lt takes practice to reach
the skill level necessary...

307
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,260
...to master the two output levels.

308
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:28,167
One for the high seas and the other
for soft landings on a beach.

309
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,604
We were short
of the bloody things before.

310
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:34,500
That's an entire battalion's
passage gone.

311
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,170
Could be a month before we
get replacement craft.

312
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,876
lt's only 1 9 days to the half-moon
and the right high tide.

313
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,453
Look, if we can trick Rommel
for 1 9 days through to mid-May...

314
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,615
...surely we can push him
to the next useful moon and tide.

315
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,420
That would be June 5th, sir.

316
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:56,329
All this dithering around is bloody
annoying, General Eisenhower.

317
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:00,437
My men are ready to go.
I say the sooner the better.

318
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:05,304
Leaving it to June is a tremendous
risk. What if there's a storm?

319
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:10,414
Then we've lost June. We have to put
it off to July. Six weeks to September.

320
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,073
lt's not enough to land the army.

321
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,344
We have to get tanks ashore,
get inland...

322
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,148
...before the worst of
autumn weather slows us down.

323
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,518
What can you give me in June,
Stagg?

324
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,353
Expecting a fine
English summer, sir.

325
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,191
I mean, meteorology's a fair bit
of witchcraft...

326
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,129
...but all indications
are for one of our better Junes.

327
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,634
Three extra weeks means
at least 1 00 more LSTs.

328
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,231
Give us more time to pulverize
the rail lines out of Germany.

329
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,036
-And railheads in France.
-The men are impatient.

330
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,571
-Dulls their itch.
-And sooner or later...

331
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,409
...we won't be able to hide the size
of our force in the southwest.

332
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,579
May 1 9th or June 5th?

333
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,522
Or the fail-safe last chance in July?

334
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,956
Mid-July.

335
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,325
Leaving maybe eight weeks,
if there's an early frost...

336
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,092
...to establish a beachhead
for half a million men.

337
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,859
How doable is that?

338
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,268
That's what I thought.

339
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:15,311
Please have it factored in for the
next meeting, gentlemen. Thank you.

340
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,653
I know the reason you're here.

341
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,522
Of course, the loss of these men is....

342
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:36,056
Yes, of course. But I was referring
to your other reason.

343
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,464
Other reason?

344
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,434
You have the advantage
over me, sir.

345
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,802
I certainly hope so. lt's my job.

346
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,988
I am told you've committed to June.

347
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,121
Given up on a May landing.

348
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,094
I assume Monty kept you informed.

349
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,061
No names, no pack drill.

350
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,100
But of course, general,
you are in Britain.

351
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,501
You must assume I have resources
to keep myself in the picture.

352
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,502
And I understand
from Mr. Roosevelt...

353
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,444
...that the additional time
will increase the number...

354
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,847
...of these newfangled landing craft.

355
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,581
The president is my security leak?

356
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,416
Hardly.

357
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,619
But even if he were,
he is your superior.

358
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,263
And my good friend and ally.

359
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,333
Never forget, general,
you serve at our pleasure.

360
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:49,302
Then if it please you, sir,
we need to delay till June 4 or 5.

361
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,101
l'm promised excellent weather.

362
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,108
By then, we will have
1 00 more landing craft.

363
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,678
So...

364
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,839
...the fate of our two great nations
comes down...

365
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,976
...to things called LSTs
and Donald Ducks.

366
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:10,152
Well, if it be so, so be it. And yes,
general, I accede to you once more.

367
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,319
June it is.

368
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,467
Good. Thank you.

369
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,676
But that raises another problem, sir.

370
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:34,942
Further delay creates almost
unbearable pressure on our security.

371
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,556
We can't let the Germans sense
we're only making a feint at Calais.

372
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:44,389
lf Rommel moves his main force to
Normandy, we'd be stacking bodies.

373
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,790
There's only one way to be
certain that German spies...

374
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,731
...or loose lips don't stumble
across our activities...

375
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,530
...and anticipate our moves.

376
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:57,141
That is to seal the coast across
the south of England and Wales...

377
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,173
...to all unauthorized traffic.

378
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,209
Most of it is sealed already.

379
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,371
I mean all of it.

380
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,642
No civilian traffic whatsoever.

381
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:11,016
Are you mad, sir? Do you not
realize that no one in Britain...

382
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,521
...lives more than
1 50 miles from the sea?

383
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:18,121
lt is no accident that Britannia rules
the waves and all that business.

384
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,595
We are a people whose entire destiny
is linked to the sea.

385
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,860
Which is why you must now
turn your people away from it.

386
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,294
lmpossible.

387
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,030
lt might mean thousands...

388
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,905
...tens of thousands
of young men's lives.

389
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,710
I will give you this, general.

390
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,378
You know how to take charge.

391
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,280
lt's not about power, sir.

392
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,661
lt is simply the judicious use of the
responsibility you entrusted me with.

393
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:56,290
Only under duress and your threats to
walk out. l'd have you remember that.

394
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,061
Yes, sir.

395
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,016
The Ministry of lnformation
unedited footage...

396
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,814
...spied by the 3rd Red army
Film Corps.

397
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,253
The surrender of
the German 7 th army.

398
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,656
Hitler refuses to allow
further withdrawal.

399
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,093
Throws three panzer divisions
from the western front to the east.

400
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,994
They're on the APC. Look at that.

401
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:35,504
Three less we have to face. One
more reason to rethink a broad front.

402
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,370
Ride a dagger-thrust road
straight to Berlin.

403
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,313
And we'll have the French
to help us along.

404
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,113
Smuggled, unedited film
from Warsaw Ghetto...

405
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,483
...where Jews resist an entire
German army for six weeks.

406
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,854
Twice as long as the well-fed
French army in 1 940.

407
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,518
Don't count on them
to help us along.

408
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,457
Supreme commander meets
with soldiers of the line.

409
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,313
Give me five minutes.
I'll have tonight's feature ready.

410
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,147
-What have you got?
-Sahara.

411
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,052
-Bogart wins the war in North Africa.
-Not bloody likely.

412
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,656
I'll be off, then.

413
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,929
I'll walk you out.

414
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,968
-lt's supposed to be a good movie.
-Not much taste for cinema, myself.

415
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,107
Besides, never enough time
for preparation, is there?

416
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,673
Well, we all need some recreation.

417
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,179
Movie once a week, let the hair down,
it seems to do the trick.

418
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,251
lf you say so. Although,
if you don't mind me saying so...

419
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,686
...that jeering when you came on the
screen, a bit much, you know.

420
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,548
Good-natured, as I see it.

421
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,323
Undisciplined.

422
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,654
So is using
German troop movements...

423
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,391
...to push your plan
for a dagger thrust again.

424
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,528
The broad assault
is a closed matter.

425
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,834
I allow all my sub-commanders
latitude, general...

426
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,771
...but restraint is also a virtue.

427
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,336
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,082
Point taken.

429
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,669
He looks cold.

430
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,606
Yeah.

431
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,876
But if we get our asses kicked, we
won't be walking across snowy tundra.

432
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,741
We'll have to swim back.

433
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:04,047
Truth is, I wasn't looking at Napoleon.
I was thinking about the soldiers.

434
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,984
Johnny's graduating from the
academy this session. June 6th.

435
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,028
Proud moment.

436
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,522
Have your son succeed you
at West Point.

437
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,168
Yeah, I can't believe
I won't be there.

438
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,668
Cheer him and shake his hand.

439
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,864
You'll see him soon enough.
And when you do....

440
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,701
Yeah.

441
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,404
lt stinks.

442
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,445
lt does.

443
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,079
But any way you look at it,
we're getting off easy from this war.

444
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,118
I'll most likely live to see it over.

445
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,130
And my son won't be in it
for as long as most.

446
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,060
But on the other hand...

447
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,526
...this war is still your burden.

448
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,368
And the rest of us,
we're just supporting cast.

449
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,441
lf it's any comfort...

450
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,771
...so far, general, you are giving
one hell of a great performance.

451
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,641
I don't think I needed
to hear my job described...

452
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,685
...quite like that, General Smith.

453
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:16,051
I loved your crack at Monty
about the French.

454
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,759
Oh, thank you.
We bought them from Harrods.

455
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,661
-Harrods?
-Oh, he splashed out.

456
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,027
Wow, that is beautiful.

457
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,466
A lousy wine, Edgar.

458
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,010
But not for long, huh? Soon be
downing the best French stuff.

459
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,706
What do you say, Edgar? I reckon
four days from the beaches to Paris.

460
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,113
-Get there on the 8th.
-I have no idea...

461
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,545
...what you're talking about, Henry.
Nor do you, get it?

462
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,123
Watch it, colonel.
Remember who you're talking to.

463
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,352
Major general. Don't you
damn well forget it either, Henry.

464
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,692
Come, Edith, it's time
we powdered our noses.

465
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,964
Henry, you're a goddamned idiot.
Just button it up.

466
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,735
What's the big deal? The whole
world will know soon enough.

467
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,810
lt is a 1 00-to- 1 shot because
it's more than the line of duty.

468
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,977
There's so little chance
of any us coming out of it.

469
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,848
I ought to put it up to you.

470
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,354
You all got families at home.
Wives, mothers and sweethearts.

471
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,551
I ain't got no one,
so it doesn't matter about me.

472
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,322
I know how you feel about it.

473
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:36,635
He actually said, ''June 4th,''
in the hotel grill?

474
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,833
That place is packed
that time of night.

475
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,534
What the hell was he thinking?

476
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:45,341
-He had too much to drink.
-Henry Miller is a major general.

477
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,780
Entertaining guests
with inside knowledge...

478
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,079
...is a betrayal of the men
he commands.

479
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,744
Of course.

480
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,447
How'd Chapman get onto this?

481
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:58,357
A junior officer from the 1 01 st was at
the next table. He contacted his CO.

482
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,692
-Well, did you speak to the officer?
-Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,494
A first lieutenant.
Young man from Philadelphia.

484
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,866
Feels awful about the thing.
Didn't want to be thought a snitch.

485
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,004
But?

486
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,771
But he said he commanded
a platoon of airborne infantry.

487
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,439
His chances were bad enough without
making it easier for the Krauts.

488
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:25,021
Then he's a damn sight better
officer than Miller. And smarter.

489
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,351
Henry was a roommate at West Point.

490
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,061
One of my closest friends.

491
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,664
You know, the word stayed closed.
No one really knows about it.

492
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,602
I do.

493
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,563
At ease.

494
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,776
lke, l'm sorry. l'm so sorry. l--

495
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,184
-I don't know what got into me.
-I do.

496
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,759
I swear, I'll never touch another drop.

497
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,754
You're lying.

498
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,568
-So, what will you do with me?
-What do you think?

499
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:55,406
Oh, please. lke, don't do this to me.

500
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:59,915
We go back too far. We're old friends.
You can't cut me loose.

501
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,617
lt might be easier if we didn't
have so much history, Hank.

502
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:08,157
But the stakes are way too big.
You'll have to go home immediately...

503
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,159
...and you won't be coming back.

504
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,821
We both owe that to the men
who will be dead in a few weeks.

505
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:20,335
I'll lose my operational rank.
I'll go home in disgrace, a major.

506
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,573
You can't send me home.

507
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,508
You owe me something.
l'm part of the inner circle.

508
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,676
That's the worst thing
you could have said.

509
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:37,919
There is no inner circle. Only those
who will live and those who will die.

510
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,021
And you don't seem to get that.

511
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:05,311
Send him home immediately.
Loss of theater rank.

512
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,910
Try to keep him a colonel if you can.

513
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,077
And on his record?

514
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:16,784
''Deemed more useful in HQ. Skills
not needed in theater of operation.''

515
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,033
The thing about all the power,
Beetle...

516
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,538
...it isn't the big decisions
that weigh heavy.

517
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,270
Hell, you can decide
to invade Russia at dinner.

518
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,779
Pick Waterloo for battle on a whim.

519
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:43,283
lt's the details. The small stuff.

520
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:48,016
lt's easy to gamble
a million lives. What's hard...

521
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,453
...is to see how that can hurt
one single person.

522
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,159
And if you can't keep that straight...

523
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,170
...hell...

524
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,772
...you'll lose your humanity.

525
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,711
Won't you?

526
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,715
I couldn't say, sir.

527
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,792
As you were.

528
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,995
-Good morning, Beetle.
-Same to you.

529
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,263
I thought you quit smoking.

530
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:40,172
l'm trying. Ready for the big day?
lt's the big moment.

531
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,608
Anything good in the paper?

532
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,270
No, not really.

533
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,118
lt's stateside,
but, hey, it's three days old.

534
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,450
Walter, you're my chief of staff,
not my HQ censor.

535
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,932
''While lke's a good administrator
and a good organizer...

536
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,831
...he lacks the military flare
of a Montgomery...

537
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,495
...or the audacity of a Patton.

538
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:14,770
Yet, for better or worse, he's the man
they call supreme commander.''

539
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,908
You know, lke...

540
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,077
...a little public relations
wouldn't do any harm.

541
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,121
Oh, it would, and you know it.

542
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,159
We're surrounded by some of
the biggest swelled heads in history.

543
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,422
My job is keeping them pulling
together in the same direction.

544
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:39,729
I can't do that if l'm competing
with them for newspaper ink.

545
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,701
This is your plan. You developed it.

546
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:48,641
You fought Churchill for it,
all the politicians, even F.D.R.

547
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,180
No, this is your show.
The world ought to know it.

548
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,445
Maybe. One day, but not this day.

549
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,521
This day, we have
other fish to fry, general.

550
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,592
-Now may I have some coffee?
-Yes, sir.

551
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,638
Oh, a point of principle, old man.

552
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,302
A bad habit in my opinion.
Never been permitted in my HQ.

553
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,408
Oh, all right, Monty,
if it's so damned important to you.

554
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,816
I did agree to use your ground
for this.

555
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:53,367
Churchill makes the final decision
on what they buy. Only him.

556
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,513
But don't oversell. He can smell
bull pucky a mile away.

557
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,740
You are acquainted with Eisenhower,
an American cousin.

558
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,886
Yes. Good to see you again.

559
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:07,046
Prime minister tells us we may have
great confidence in this undertaking.

560
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,557
Oh, I never disagree
with Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty.

561
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,889
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

562
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,588
How delighted we are
to see you again, general.

563
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,257
We look forward
to our private luncheon next week.

564
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,097
As do l, ma'am. I thank you.

565
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,503
General, if you please.

566
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,062
Excuse me.

567
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,656
Your Majesties, Mr. Prime Minister...

568
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:18,488
...honored guests, dignitaries,
l'm Dwight Eisenhower...

569
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,960
...commander in chief,
Supreme Headquarters...

570
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,999
...Allied Expeditionary Force,
European Theater of Operation.

571
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,468
Just getting the title straight
is tiring enough.

572
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,770
So I will leave much
of today's business...

573
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,504
...to my trusted and gifted
colleagues, brothers-in-arms.

574
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,140
We are from different traditions,
different services...

575
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,843
...but we are united in this crusade.

576
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:49,182
We shall liberate Europe.
We shall restore freedom.

577
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,726
We shall make the world
safe for democracy.

578
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:58,861
There is no other cause so urgent
as to bring us so far from our homes.

579
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,395
This is our purpose.

580
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,665
This is Operation Overlord.

581
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:09,471
Explaining how we will succeed
is best done by my chiefs of staff...

582
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,877
...starting with General Montgomery...

583
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:16,179
...commander, 2 1 st Army Group
and responsible for all our land forces.

584
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,412
General, if you will.

585
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,923
Your Majesties.

586
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:30,465
Of the enemy's 60 divisions in France,
1 0 are armored.

587
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,864
Commanded by Erwin Rommel.

588
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:36,768
As you know, I faced him
in the desert and bested him.

589
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,431
But make no mistake,
Rommel is an energetic--

590
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,546
Clever, putting Monty
front and center.

591
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,683
--so he can bring
his tanks southward.

592
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,217
But we shall make
a strike forward here.

593
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:54,289
I hope to make Falaise 32 miles
inland within 40 hours.

594
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,985
Paratroopers will total
over 30,000 men.

595
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:02,690
The largest drop in history.
Casualties will be high...

596
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,097
...but the size of the force should
draw two enemy divisions...

597
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,569
...from the beaches, just as our men
are ready to disembark.

598
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,332
To take the left flank...

599
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,501
...we need to land enough men
to swamp Hitler's Atlantic wall.

600
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,409
Losses amongst the British
and Canadian troops...

601
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,846
...will be heavy
during the assault wave...

602
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,782
...but easing off as they move
past the pillboxes.

603
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:27,219
While fighter command provides cover
for the beach assault...

604
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,951
...and strafes the Atlantic wall...

605
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:35,394
...General Spaatz will smash the rail
links leading south from La Manche...

606
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:40,970
...delaying any attempt by Rommel
to reinforce his southern defenses.

607
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,481
Well, Your Majesties,
gentlemen, there it is.

608
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:58,351
We're anxious to hear your thoughts,
additions, criticisms. The floor is open.

609
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,622
I am impressed by the detail...

610
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:05,751
...the comprehensiveness
of your planning.

611
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,932
But the expected losses,
the sheer carnage....

612
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,103
I also ache at that thought,
Your Majesty.

613
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,735
I remember my first trip
to Europe as a young man.

614
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:27,282
I felt blessed to be here, to see it...

615
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:31,319
...to touch the origins of my own
country that I love so dearly.

616
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:37,291
I hoped one day that all Americans
would have the same opportunity.

617
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:44,896
Now hundreds of thousands will,
along with Britons and Canadians...

618
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:49,368
...and European Allies
fighting to return home.

619
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:57,471
This kind of visit
isn't what I had in mind...

620
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:02,679
...but if they do not offer
the sacrifice of blood now...

621
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,812
...we will all pay dearly
with added gallons later.

622
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,293
So if some must die...

623
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,054
...it is in a worthy cause.

624
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,249
I am in this thing
with you till the very end...

625
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,622
...and if it fails,
we both go down together.

626
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,432
lt's dicey to get out on a limb
with disturbances over Baffin lsland.

627
00:47:56,607 --> 00:48:01,476
lf they form a front and move across
the North Atlantic, this time of year...

628
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,113
...l'd say six days
for a top-speed journey...

629
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,375
...and with the proposed
landing a week away....

630
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,610
You realize that this may be...

631
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,311
...the most important
weather forecast in history.

632
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,286
I do indeed, sir.

633
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,224
l'd feel a lot more comfortable...

634
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,160
...if I could have another
two days before committing.

635
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,493
The admiral can correct me
if l'm wrong...

636
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,432
...but if we don't move
the men toward the ships...

637
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:31,472
-...we're gonna miss the tide, sir.
-I'll be damned if I wait till July.

638
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,110
The men will go stark raving mad.

639
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:59,031
June 5 is a go.
lssue the movement orders.

640
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:02,035
Well done. We'll do it proud, lke.

641
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:05,641
I'll be in Falaise in 72 hours,
Paris by the autumn.

642
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,643
Paris in the fall. Bless you, Monty.

643
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,646
No one can say you don't tackle things
with two fists. I admire confidence.

644
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,080
Let's all get some of that.

645
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,186
All of you...

646
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,621
...Godspeed.

647
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,995
Thank you.

648
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,133
Good luck.

649
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,717
You're sure this is how
you want it, general?

650
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:00,192
Yes, prime minister.

651
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,931
You see no value to me
or President Roosevelt...

652
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,365
...speaking directly
to the people of Europe?

653
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:10,102
Not until the landings
are an assured success.

654
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,600
This way, if it fails,
I will be the first one to address...

655
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,472
...the question of the invasion.

656
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,239
You and the president
will be blameless.

657
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,680
l'm expendable. You two are not.

658
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:25,753
Shoulder the whole burden alone
to the very end, is it?

659
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,555
One conductor is what I asked for
and what you've given me.

660
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,691
You've made the manly choice.
I admire it.

661
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,202
All the same, between we two...

662
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:44,136
...surely God himself must tremble
at the task that lies before you.

663
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,040
And it is God's work you do, lke...

664
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,872
...for you hold all our lives
in your hands.

665
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:56,183
lf I do God's work, then he will be
at my side, and I cannot fail.

666
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:01,950
Although, candidly, God hasn't been
much help with DeGaulle.

667
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,594
Not even God could move him.
And it's no use looking to me.

668
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,698
DeGaulle hates me.

669
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,733
He ignores that France is
collaborating with the enemy.

670
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,930
Pretends Vichy doesn't exist
and Jews aren't being rounded up.

671
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,597
A horrid man...

672
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:24,407
...but he guards French
prerogatives jealously.

673
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:29,609
Take another run at him, lke.
I'll back any bargain you strike.

674
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,180
Would you just assure me
of one thing?

675
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,915
The sands
on these Norman beaches...

676
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,192
...dense enough for tanks?

677
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,021
You can drink to it, sir.

678
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,192
Once more...

679
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,928
...unto the breach, dear friends.
Once more...

680
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,131
...or close the wall up
with our English dead.

681
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,334
ln peace, there's nothing
so becomes a man...

682
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,536
...as modest stillness and humility.

683
00:51:56,713 --> 00:52:00,547
But when the blast of war blows
in our ears, then imitate the tiger.

684
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,548
Do you get the feeling Europeans...

685
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,279
...have been at this war
thing for a long time?

686
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:09,357
Too long.
lt's almost as if they like war.

687
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:14,252
I am afeard there are few die well
that die in a battle.

688
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,160
How can they charitably
dispose... ?

689
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,995
Sounds like Shakespeare
had it all figured out.

690
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,399
Yeah.

691
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:25,302
But he was writing after
the war was over and won.

692
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,278
lt's spooky...

693
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:41,857
...listening to words written 400
years ago about our battlefields.

694
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:45,324
Words about blood and grief.

695
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,486
Very spooky.

696
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,189
But if I may, ours is not
to reason why.

697
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:53,165
Of course it is. We're the generals.

698
00:52:55,672 --> 00:53:00,735
I think Monty's got Churchill worried
that the beaches won't hold the tanks.

699
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,369
l've told you a hundred times,
we've done our homework.

700
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,346
The sand will support
the tank track rails with ease.

701
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,719
I don't think that's what's
bothering you.

702
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:18,692
-You read Marshall's letter.
-About the paratroopers? Yes, I did.

703
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,625
-What'd you make of it?
-He's wrong.

704
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,359
He says drop the jumpers
behind the beaches.

705
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,660
Try to draw the Germans
in two directions.

706
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:30,238
lf I were Rommel, l'd ignore them.
Concentrate everything on the beach.

707
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,169
l'd do the same. Every hour I delay
the invasion force from moving in...

708
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,040
...would be another hour
airborne units would be isolated.

709
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,445
Exactly. Besides, I need those men...

710
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,314
...all 30,000 of them, to keep
nipping at the Krauts' heels.

711
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:47,479
They have to be close to force
Rommel to deal with them.

712
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,888
Yeah, but the drop zones, Brad.

713
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:56,960
You heard Leigh-Mallory's estimate
of losses with a close drop. Carnage.

714
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,397
How would a distant drop be better?

715
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,531
lf inland progress was slow,
we'd have those men...

716
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:06,005
...wandering around France
looking for something to eat.

717
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:13,080
We'd be repeating the mistake
we made in Anzio.

718
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:22,124
Marshall's a godfather to us, Brad.
I hate to cross the old man.

719
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,885
lt's like a friend of mine said:

720
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:28,588
''One supreme commander,
one voice.''

721
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:35,063
We few, we happy few,
we band of brothers.

722
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:38,435
For he today that sheds his blood
with me shall be my brother...

723
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,200
...be he ne'er so base.

724
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,709
And gentlemen
in England, now abed...

725
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,848
...shall think themselves accursed
they were not here...

726
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:49,383
...and hold their manhoods cheap
while any speaks...

727
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:54,854
...that fought with us upon
St. Crispin's Day!

728
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,253
My sovereign lord....

729
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:01,158
I hope the main attraction's
a bit more cheerful.

730
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:07,432
lt's Rita Hayworth. A hell of a lot
easier on the eye than that bunch.

731
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,409
l've been in the theater years
and never seen--

732
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,809
Excuse me, please.

733
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,407
Why don't you be
a good boy and scram.

734
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,916
-Of course, we'll go--
-No, that's all right.

735
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,453
You're welcome to stay here,
but this guy--

736
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,648
This guy.

737
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,261
l'm sorry. That's my one virtue.

738
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,129
-McGuire.
-Hello.

739
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,232
l'm sorry.

740
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,267
lt's a little crowded here.
Would you mind moving over?

741
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:43,838
Oh, that's quite all right.
Make yourself at home.

742
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,007
Dearest Mamie...

743
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:00,623
...at last, the days grow longer,
and we will soon be in it.

744
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:05,523
I face that with neither dread
nor joy.

745
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:10,359
How I wish this cruel business of war
could be completed quickly.

746
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,369
lt leaves me heartsick to think
of sending so many men...

747
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,870
...against Hitler's Atlantic wall.

748
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:22,375
I admit to having developed
a veneer of callousness...

749
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,879
...but counting the human cost
is a terribly sad business...

750
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,247
...and no veneer of callousness
allows me to escape the truth...

751
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,288
...that back home, the news
brings anguish and suffering.

752
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:38,455
So many youngsters
already gone forever.

753
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,564
Mothers, fathers, brothers...

754
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,030
...sisters back home
have a difficult time...

755
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:49,501
...retaining any belief
in the eternal rightness of things.

756
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,738
There is no true glory in war.

757
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,301
Yes, sir. At 0900.

758
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,205
Yes.

759
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:36,043
lntelligence signals confirm Rommel
moved the 1 1 6th Panzer Division...

760
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,950
...basing at Verville. That is shouting
distance from the main drops.

761
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,887
ls it a single redeployment
or part of larger movement?

762
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:47,519
So far, just a one-shot affair, but he
bypassed Juno, Sword and Gold...

763
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,188
...and sent them directly
to Utah and Omaha.

764
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,726
That doesn't change my view.

765
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:55,700
We have to have the airborne
as close as possible.

766
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,397
I need jumpers breathing
down the Germans' necks...

767
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:01,009
...pulling them around.

768
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,513
The plan always called
for the diversion to be--

769
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,115
I know!

770
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,348
I know.

771
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:11,475
-You're new here. What's your name?
-Corporal William Younger, ma'am.

772
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,577
All right, now remember,
we hear nothing in this room.

773
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,218
And we never speak.

774
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,115
No matter what,
we never stop work.

775
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:21,815
The king himself may enter, but what
we're doing must take priority.

776
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,118
Now carry on.

777
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:27,627
-They deserve a force at the Krauts'--
-Stop.

778
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,391
I know the risks for both sides...

779
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,161
...but neither of you
makes a decisive case.

780
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,567
How many ways can I say it?

781
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,940
l'm counting on those jumpers
to split German attention...

782
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:41,133
...ease pressure on the assault wave.

783
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,508
And they should have, but that
was before Rommel redeployed.

784
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,842
One division isn't a redeployment.

785
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,348
For men in my drop,
it's a potential disaster.

786
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,548
Jumpers and glider-borne troops
are sitting ducks...

787
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:56,180
...for the first 1 0 minutes
until they regroup.

788
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,627
Damn. There goes another.

789
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:06,130
lt's the 81 st lnfantry.

790
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,203
Wehrmacht, conscripts,
the crack units are to the north.

791
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:13,206
Perhaps. But if Jerry's reinforcing
the whole damn region...

792
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,834
...we lose 70 percent of glider troops
before they're out of planes.

793
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,344
And the jumpers?

794
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,852
Some of them will make it, but they'll
be short of the numbers you need...

795
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,055
...if seaborne landings are depending
on airborne to distract Jerry.

796
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,386
You're saying there's no middle
ground. We should cancel it.

797
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,895
We don't want the slaughter
of two fine divisions.

798
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:37,089
The 1 01 st and the 82nd are elite, lke.
We'll need them down the line.

799
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,463
We'll need them on June 5th.
Otherwise the entire German army...

800
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,004
...will let loose on my assault waves.
My loss will be 70 percent.

801
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,640
All right.

802
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,537
Thank you. l've heard both sides.

803
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,046
I need a night to sleep on it.

804
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:55,082
Sorry to disturb, sir. May l?

805
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,344
lf it's good news.

806
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,421
Well, sir, I wish I could say it was...

807
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,924
...but it's getting a little bit uncertain.

808
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,221
You said it would take days
for systems...

809
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,262
...to get from Baffin lsland to here.

810
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,491
And so it should, sir.

811
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,795
Unless they dislodge
from the jet stream...

812
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,268
...a meteorological possibility,
they're not--

813
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,533
I can't work with possibilities,
group captain.

814
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:22,303
At minimum, I need probabilities.

815
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:26,107
Are there such things
as meteorological probabilities?

816
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,118
There will be, sir, within hours.

817
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,222
Not fast enough, group captain.
I need hourly reports.

818
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,516
Yes, sir.

819
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,424
He doesn't make weather.
He talks about it.

820
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,863
Then get him to say nicer things.

821
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:49,237
Look, give me some time
to work on this airborne thing.

822
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,306
I'll send for you
when l've figured it out.

823
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,412
Yes. What is it?

824
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,686
Our friends at HQ say the airborne
decision is at a head.

825
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:08,915
lf you're to be heard,
now would be the hour, sir.

826
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,219
And what do you think, Wiatt?

827
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,523
lnland, they're no help
to the landing force.

828
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:18,633
Keep them close,
they could be shredded.

829
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:25,232
Let's see how he works it out.
Thank you, Wiatt.

830
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,464
lf I may...

831
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:57,670
...it's the right decision.

832
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,836
Divisional commanders can't
factor in weather and the seas...

833
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:06,505
...supplies, naval support,
DeGaulle, the politics.

834
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,280
Besides, it's not their job.

835
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,251
I'll inform Leigh-Mallory and Brad.

836
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,394
Don't publish that order until I do.

837
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,599
You better get some sleep.

838
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,863
You have another dragon
to slay tomorrow.

839
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,310
l've considered it.

840
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:43,282
Either way, some units will
sustain devastating losses.

841
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:47,752
But this invasion is largely
dependent on sea and air power.

842
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,358
Our land troops are inferior...

843
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,290
...if for no other reason
than they're not on land.

844
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:57,899
So our most important job
is securing beachheads.

845
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:01,525
Deference must be given to protecting
troops trying to come ashore...

846
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:06,107
...to clear the way for the armor and
artillery that will push Rommel back.

847
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:10,775
That being the case, despite
the projected losses, Traff...

848
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:15,543
...even 70 percent,
the airborne operation has to go.

849
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:26,116
lt's the toughest choice
l've ever had to make.

850
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,290
Do everything to diminish the hazards.

851
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:32,161
Go over every detail a thousand times.

852
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:38,139
But as painful as it is, those soldiers
will have to bear the rough portion.

853
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:44,572
General Bradley's assault troops
must be given every edge we can find.

854
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,814
A perfectly sound decision.

855
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:51,112
We'll keep Jerry watching out
for his backside.

856
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:54,188
You get yours to those jumpers
as soon as you can.

857
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,587
Count on it.

858
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,089
Thank you, gentlemen.

859
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,032
Brad?

860
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,331
When he wakes up,
l'm seeing Churchill.

861
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,737
-He's gonna bring it up--
-Will you lay off?

862
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,071
l've told you, the sand will hold.

863
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,305
We tested with light bombing.
Resistance gave measurements.

864
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:24,181
I know. lf the first of those storms hits
the beaches the same time we do...

865
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:26,378
...you're looking at 2 inches of rain.

866
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:30,924
Maybe 20-foot swells, eating
at the beaches. Huge erosion.

867
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,624
Would you still go
in that kind of weather?

868
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:40,064
lf we don't go now....
A lot can happen in three weeks.

869
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,933
They'd get onto us.
Rommel can move more men.

870
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:49,009
So I ask you again, my good friend,
what if the conditions are marginal?

871
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:53,046
The beaches will be firm.
I know they will.

872
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:57,049
You can trust me on this
and not worry yourself about it further.

873
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,451
-Thank you, general.
-General.

874
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:30,081
Salute! Attention!

875
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:43,859
Thank you for taking the time
to join us, general.

876
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:53,705
Not even your headman's Kansas
charm can melt the French iceberg.

877
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,173
Don't bet on it.

878
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,898
Attention, all ranks!
General officer!

879
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,938
As you were.

880
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:28,676
Come, general.
Let me provide you with some details.

881
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,011
Prime minister.

882
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:40,020
lf the Frenchman can back up
his manner...

883
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:44,455
...he should be able to control
the weather for us. And the tides.

884
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,858
All we want is he tells
the French to welcome us.

885
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,430
Neutrality might mean
they'll work against us...

886
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,123
...like some did at Dunkirk.

887
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,434
My, my.

888
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:59,301
Seems that our work isn't up
to the general's level.

889
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:18,423
General DeGaulle,
I trust your confidence is buoyed.

890
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:24,464
I think your Operation Overlord
is poorly conceived.

891
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:28,091
I have explained its failures
to General Eisenhower.

892
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:31,834
He has all the information to make
the necessary corrections.

893
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,771
l'm grateful for the general's
contributions.

894
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,844
I'll explain them to you all later.

895
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:40,072
Although, as l've told the general,
with regret...

896
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:44,413
...we simply don't have the time
to make the changes suggested.

897
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,788
Perhaps...

898
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,823
...you could use a moment alone...

899
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,328
...to discuss other matters?

900
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,227
Yes, sir.

901
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,732
General?

902
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,049
What do you expect from me,
general?

903
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,277
-This is, after all, your speech.
-Yes.

904
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:22,550
But it is to be broadcast to the French
people on the eve of their liberation.

905
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:25,523
I was hoping for your support
since we recognize you...

906
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,161
...as their legitimate voice.

907
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,729
Of course you do.
There is no one else.

908
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,528
So I shall give my own address
when the time comes.

909
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:37,331
As, of course, you must.
But it is our hope, our urgent hope...

910
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,269
...that you'll endorse
my remarks...

911
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,966
...and that is why my speech
should concern you.

912
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:46,171
Your remarks concern me greatly,
General Eisenhower.

913
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,146
But not for the reasons
you might like.

914
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,809
Okay, what's wrong with it?

915
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:58,717
Firstly, you urge Frenchmen
to follow your orders?

916
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,089
Only I will command
the people of France.

917
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,659
I understand that.
We all do.

918
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,893
But this operation can only work
if it speaks with one voice.

919
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,401
So they say.

920
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:12,302
You even ask my people
to accept Allied money.

921
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:18,538
Yet, as president of the provisional
government, only I can issue currency.

922
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:22,275
You say local administrations
will stay in place.

923
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:23,941
For stability, general.

924
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,713
Only I shall decide
what to do with Vichy officials.

925
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,414
No, no. lt's quite impossible.
I'll never accept...

926
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,220
...that you can speak
for all the Allies.

927
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,952
The British have.

928
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:39,726
The Canadians, the Australians,
the exiled Dutch and Poles.

929
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,893
Roosevelt and Churchill have agreed.

930
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,670
Come to think of it,
you're the only exception.

931
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:49,843
You will not treat us like ltaly.
We are not German allies.

932
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:54,346
ln fact, the Vichy government
is precisely that, general.

933
01:10:55,551 --> 01:11:00,921
But we will liberate France and
treat her as an ally nonetheless.

934
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,288
All I ask is that you speak on the radio
after my address...

935
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,328
...and call on your people
to aid us in their liberation.

936
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,727
Speak after you?
lmpossible.

937
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,266
That would imply I approve
of your program.

938
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,308
I understand.

939
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,941
Allow me to see you to your car.

940
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,704
-You're wet, Stagg.
-Aye, sir.

941
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,341
lt started raining.

942
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,442
-I find that very depressing.
-Depressing. Yes.

943
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:05,178
Well, three depressions, actually.
One after the other.

944
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,482
They rolled in from Baffin lsland
in unbelievably quick time.

945
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:12,218
-l've never seen it like--
-How long before they pass through?

946
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:14,191
-All three?
-Yes.

947
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:18,595
Three to five days.
Might be some calm in between them.

948
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:22,032
Meantime, we're looking at swells
of up to 40 feet mid-Channel...

949
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,331
...30-feet breakers
on the landing zones...

950
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,838
...and winds of up to 50 miles
an hour.

951
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,500
We can't get the gliders
and C-4 7 s off the ground.

952
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,943
Even if we did, they'd be blown all
over Europe when they jumped.

953
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:34,980
Embarkation status, Birdie?

954
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,846
Crew's aboard ship,
vessel's fully loaded.

955
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,013
Mulberries and LST is fueled.
More crafts still at mooring.

956
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,125
C-4 7 s in place.
Gliders leashed.

957
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:47,126
Men ready for boarding
on 30 minutes' notice.

958
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,992
We can't send them.
They'll drown before they arrive.

959
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,895
True enough.
Some will.

960
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,901
But we have to calculate the margins.

961
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,062
This might work to our advantage.

962
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,903
lt's certain Jerry won't expect
an invasion force in this weather.

963
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:05,808
Of course, it is up to you.
But with all the goodwill in the world...

964
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:09,849
-...we can't wait forever.
-No.

965
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:15,418
But we can wait one more day.
We owe the men that.

966
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:20,051
Disembarkation is delayed
2 4 hours to Tuesday.

967
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:25,064
We meet at 01 30 hours
tomorrow morning to finalize.

968
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:21,347
Sir, there's a definite break
almost immediately at hand.

969
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,751
What kind of break?

970
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,385
This dreadful torrent that seems...

971
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,863
...ready to wash us away
will lift in three hours or so.

972
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,194
For how long?
What's off the lrish coast?

973
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,336
A nasty low.
But even at top speed...

974
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:38,803
...it would need 36 hours
to reach the Normandy coast.

975
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,999
Meanwhile, winds will moderate.

976
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,168
The bombers should be able
to operate starting tomorrow...

977
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,836
...and right into June 6th.

978
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,574
At best, a moderately
good night for drop zones.

979
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,183
For air power, generally.

980
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:54,550
Heavy and medium bombers will find
the going, well, chancy at best.

981
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:58,056
True, but we could press our entire
force of bombers into service.

982
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:00,286
They'd operate well
in these conditions.

983
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,259
Yes. I expect they would.

984
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:05,423
But if Stagg could give us
a larger window on the 7th--

985
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,068
l'd take comfort in that.

986
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,704
l'm not ready to give up
on the 6th, Stagg.

987
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,100
Sir.

988
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,667
Would you know more
by 0200 hours, son?

989
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:19,136
I expect we'd have a better sense
of the speed...

990
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,179
...of the next storm's approach. Yes.

991
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,080
l'm afraid that's not good enough,
old man.

992
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,744
The American force
has the longest sea journey.

993
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:29,755
Now, they must put to sea
in the next half-hour...

994
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,155
...if Overlord's to happen
on the 6th.

995
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:36,559
And further, if you have Admiral
Kirk set sail then recall his fleet...

996
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,825
...for worsening weather,
he can't refuel.

997
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:43,233
-Won't be ready in time for the 7th.
-Too late after that.

998
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,568
Tides and moon won't be
in the right alignment on the 8th.

999
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,807
Any reason we shouldn't go
on the 6th, Monty?

1000
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,144
I would say go.

1001
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:55,075
One hell of a gamble to go now.

1002
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,684
-Very chancy.
-I know.

1003
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,617
The question is, how long
can we hang this operation...

1004
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,917
...on the end of a limb
and just let it dangle there?

1005
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:11,955
l'm quite positive the order
must be given.

1006
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,496
Signal will go to the fleet
immediately, sir.

1007
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:20,699
We meet again at 0400 hours
for a report on their progress.

1008
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:24,778
That'll be our last chance
to hold off till July.

1009
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:51,598
Finally going as I predicted, sir.
The break is almost upon us.

1010
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,199
Long-range forecast
still unpleasant...

1011
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:58,499
...but I can promise the weather
will clear in a matter of hours.

1012
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,667
Gentlemen.

1013
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,971
I command you...

1014
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:09,382
...but you command the men
l'm about to throw into battle.

1015
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:12,482
One last go-round, please.

1016
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,856
Well, they're almost in the Channel.

1017
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,926
The weather front is moving
faster than the ships.

1018
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:24,156
By the time the LSTs reach landfall,
sea shall be calm.

1019
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:27,165
I say, no turning back.

1020
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:31,529
-Agreed.
-A dark day for airborne, l'm afraid.

1021
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,143
Well, if there is to be a recall,
it must be now.

1022
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:45,247
Let's go.

1023
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,258
Sixth Airborne K-1 2!

1024
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,080
Stand by, signal....

1025
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,815
89 7 7 in the wing.

1026
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:28,560
Last one at the dance?

1027
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,595
Or the first?

1028
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,735
Hell, that's just the way it is, Beetle.

1029
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,361
One minute l'm exactly
what Churchill described...

1030
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,939
...the most powerful man in history.

1031
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:45,307
Now the order's given.
Hell, l'm just audience.

1032
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,142
Front row, center, to be sure.

1033
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:53,383
But a corporal on Juno,
a private on Utah...

1034
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:57,554
...they're the ones who will affect
the outcome, not me.

1035
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:00,254
lt's up to them now.

1036
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,560
Yes, sir.

1037
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,040
All right. Gather around.

1038
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:22,980
Ten minutes to onload.
Just enough time for a visitor.

1039
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,848
The supreme commander himself
is coming to see us off.

1040
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,786
No kidding.
Hell, I'll bet he ain't coming with, boys.

1041
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,186
lt's not his job.

1042
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,793
Besides, he hasn't earned
his Jump Wings.

1043
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:38,194
All right. Here's the protocol.
Do not speak unless spoken to.

1044
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:39,799
lf he asks you a question...

1045
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:43,165
...you'll find that generals
are not interested in the personal.

1046
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,329
Be prepared to answer
questions such as:

1047
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,032
Where you trained,
where you did jump school.

1048
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:51,938
What kind of medals and ribbons
you've earned. Stuff like that.

1049
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,512
All right?

1050
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,749
Seven out of 1 0, Beetle.
Maybe more.

1051
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:34,319
ln God's hands, sir.

1052
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,805
At ease.
Gather around.

1053
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,911
That's an order, jumpers.

1054
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:07,386
Smoke them if you got them.

1055
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:11,283
-Where you from, son?
-Basic at Dix, jumped at Bragg, sir.

1056
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,359
Corporal, I asked where you're from.

1057
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,019
You had a life before the Army,
didn't you?

1058
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,531
You bet I did, sir.
l'm a Chicago boy.

1059
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,363
-Southside.
-Good for you.

1060
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:25,973
-How about you? Where you from?
-New Orleans, sir.

1061
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:29,208
Nebraska, sir.
Go Corn Huskers.

1062
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:31,868
That's the wrong team, jumper.

1063
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:34,880
-Anybody here from Kansas?
-l'm from Kansas, sir.

1064
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,610
-Go get them, Jayhawks.
-You bet. Look out, Hitler.

1065
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,313
-Here we come.
-Yeah!

1066
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,821
-All ready, then?
-Yes, sir.

1067
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,550
No, we ain't worried, general.

1068
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,491
lt's the Krauts that
ought to be worrying now.

1069
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:52,693
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a light?

1070
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:57,699
-Yes, I do, lieutenant.
-Thank you, sir.

1071
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,155
Our landings on the French coast
have failed...

1072
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:22,854
...to gain a satisfactory foothold,
and I have withdrawn the troops.

1073
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,625
My decision to attack at this time
and place was based upon...

1074
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:29,429
...the best information available.

1075
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:34,940
lf any blame or fault attaches
to the attempt, it is mine alone.

1076
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:45,483
lf it all goes wrong,
if Overlord fails...

1077
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,388
...give that to the press.

1078
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:57,930
Of course, Overlord did not fail.

1079
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,994
How could it?

1080
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:04,963
With so many fine young men and
women from all corners of the earth...

1081
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:10,375
...all determined to do their best
to free a world gone half-mad.

1082
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,672
There would be setbacks.

1083
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:17,750
There would be small triumphs,
even in the first few hours.

1084
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:22,414
A message from Leigh-Mallory.

1085
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,887
Read it.

1086
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,825
''Urgent.

1087
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:32,330
Sir, it is at times difficult
to admit one is wrong.

1088
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:36,561
But I have the great pleasure
in doing so on this occasion.

1089
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:40,071
Casualties are dramatically below
my estimates.

1090
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:43,233
I congratulate you
on your command decision...

1091
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,711
...and apologize for adding
to the supreme commander's worries.

1092
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,941
Leigh-Mallory.''

1093
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:55,855
-Any numbers?
-Early estimates...

1094
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,515
...about 20 percent.

1095
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:07,130
-Carry on, general.
-Sir.

1096
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,635
Twenty percent
is so much better than 7 0.

1097
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,882
But the loss of even one
of this gallant band is a loss...

1098
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,451
...to all decent humanity everywhere.

1099
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:31,559
And besides, if the person killed
in action is you or the one you love...

1100
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:35,384
...then the odds
are 1 00 percent in that case.

1101
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:39,829
They knew that,
these great crusaders.

1102
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:42,492
But they went anyway.

1103
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,171
Too many of them are now with God.

1104
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:53,214
We may never see their like again.

1105
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,379
We may never see their like again.
