1
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:36,146
<i>It's the night of Saint Lawrence, my love...</i>

2
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:39,117
<i>the night of the shooting stars.</i>

3
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:43,751
<i>We Tuscans say that each shooting star
grants a wish.</i>

4
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:46,918
<i>Don't sleep yet.</i>

5
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:50,761
<i>What I wish tonight...</i>

6
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,731
<i>is to find the words to tell you...</i>

7
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,144
<i>about another night of Saint Lawrence,
many years ago.</i>

8
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:10,812
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS

9
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:05,139
I'm very happy
to have performed this marriage...

10
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:07,439
because Belindia is expecting a child.

11
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:10,063
And you were both living in sin.

12
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,498
God only knows what's in store for us.

13
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,802
It's such a big risk to be here.

14
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,162
You're all dressed up,
and the Americans are nearby...

15
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:19,886
while the Germans are still here.

16
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,165
Get going.

17
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:25,062
No. I must tell you one thing.

18
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:31,396
If the Day of Wrath, the Dies Irae...

19
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,283
the end of the world...

20
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:35,914
is near...

21
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,280
and it is always near...

22
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,445
our duty, yours and mine...

23
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:44,132
is to survive.

24
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,430
You understand?

25
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,485
Let us pray.

26
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,712
<i>At that time, I was only 6 years old.</i>

27
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:07,545
<i>I didn't know
whether I was afraid or fascinated.</i>

28
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:11,222
<i>Everything in those days was so unusual.</i>

29
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:53,739
My daughter can't leave like that.

30
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,978
- Let's go.
- She can't leave like that.

31
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,024
This poor daughter of mine.

32
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,454
What are you doing, Papa?

33
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:02,945
I want to celebrate this day, child.

34
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:09,223
We must all honor her...

35
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:12,418
my devil of a daughter.

36
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,116
Let me.

37
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:17,916
Here, pass it along.

38
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,228
I could go to the cabin.

39
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:22,690
Here is a slice for Ulivo.

40
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:24,064
Come here.

41
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:35,934
You're back, Nicola!

42
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,799
We jumped off the train, but I fell badly.

43
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:41,142
Oh, shit.

44
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,929
- This is Bruno.
- Nice to meet you.

45
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,812
What are you guys going to do?

46
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:47,605
He's going to Palaia.

47
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,589
But Palaia is that way.

48
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,056
He wants to take me to San Martino.

49
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:54,738
But the Germans have mined it.

50
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,817
What about my home?

51
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,561
Green crosses show
which houses will blow up.

52
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:02,799
I don't know about your house.

53
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:06,218
There's enough for you, too.

54
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,614
She's my wife. We were just married.

55
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,627
Hektor smiled...

56
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:29,288
as did Andromache.

57
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:32,351
Tenderly, the hero coddled his son...

58
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:36,350
and lifting him towards
the heavens, exclaimed:

59
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,648
"O merciful Zeus and all ye gods...

60
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,134
"allow this son of mine...

61
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:45,341
"to become preeminent...

62
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:48,344
"among the Trojans, and valiant in might.

63
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,937
"And when he returneth home from battle...

64
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:55,828
"let men say, 'His father was never greater...

65
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:59,965
"and may his mother rejoice in that'."

66
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,366
Hektor!

67
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:05,976
Hektor placed his son in his bride's arms...

68
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:09,814
and, moved by both laughter and tears...

69
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:13,877
she had him suckle her fragrant breast.

70
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:16,972
To you, Ulitto!

71
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,000
- Nicola!
- Nicola!

72
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,323
Come with me. Come.

73
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:39,982
No, this way is better.

74
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,647
You saw the cross?

75
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:45,840
The house has been mined.
We're hiding in the Miglioratis' cellar.

76
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:47,756
Anna saw you come.

77
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:50,509
Keep him here. I'm going to check outside.

78
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:56,942
Those clothes!

79
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,098
When will it happen?

80
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:02,507
Don't know.

81
00:11:06,508 --> 00:11:08,711
I'm glad the house will blow up.

82
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,116
If it does, we'll all move to Florence.

83
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,995
Yeah, Florence.

84
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,203
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,126
Don't ever tell Papa!

86
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:53,785
I am fine.

87
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,811
I am fine.

88
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,517
Come on, let us help you.

89
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:44,928
I'm fine.

90
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:47,781
Hello, Nicola.

91
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:50,621
Please.

92
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:54,683
Send them away.

93
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:54,627
I think the Americans are coming.

94
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,771
Wake up.

95
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,824
The Americans?

96
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,551
Galvano, the crank.

97
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,733
You'd better stop, sir. They really believe it.

98
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:16,707
Should I?

99
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,855
You dumb fool, you!

100
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,484
I see them!

101
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:39,646
I never thought,
but you should have known.

102
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,817
They'll never forgive us.

103
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:45,531
Never.

104
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,227
Who's there?

105
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,708
It's me, ma'am.

106
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,179
Where are you going?

107
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,803
I'm going to pee.

108
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:01,079
You shouldn't play such jokes.

109
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,381
Not like that!

110
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:59,549
Good morning.

111
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:02,235
The Germans have summoned me.

112
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:05,021
The Americans are closing in.

113
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:06,976
They've landed at Montechiari.

114
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,501
Did you hear the cannons?

115
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:11,225
Last night a bomb hit the washhouse.

116
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,652
Therefore, by sundown...

117
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,625
you must all be at the cathedral.

118
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:20,339
Call my wife and wait below.

119
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:25,843
The Germans have ordered us all
to gather in one place.

120
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,909
I suggested the cathedral.

121
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,568
The piazza has not been mined.

122
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:32,941
Wait.

123
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,235
The Germans will shoot anyone on sight...

124
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,609
who is found outside the cathedral.

125
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:42,733
Tonight at 3:00 a.m.,
they'll blow up all the houses they've mined.

126
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,444
Papa.

127
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:57,381
Duilio and Nicola can't go to the cathedral.

128
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:59,044
They're deserters.

129
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:03,940
My house will be the first to go!

130
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:06,406
They'll blow them up at 3:00 a.m.

131
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,195
Mine will be first!

132
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,966
Give out the remaining food.

133
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:13,379
Bread and tomatoes.

134
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:16,063
Who knows how long
we'll be in the cathedral?

135
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,725
Go close the door.

136
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:25,334
I'm sorry about that joke yesterday.

137
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:28,923
We couldn't care less.

138
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,734
- Until tonight.
- Until tonight.

139
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,322
Donati from Montopoli?

140
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,367
From Montopoli, yes.

141
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,754
I stayed at your father's house once.

142
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,086
He and I were friends.

143
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,197
I'm Galvano Galvani.

144
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:09,514
When you visited us, it was...

145
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:13,070
snowing.

146
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,692
You were 13 then.

147
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:17,095
I recognized you.

148
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:20,004
How's everything?

149
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:27,907
Is the cathedral a good idea?

150
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,029
What a question!

151
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:40,545
These days,
who can tell what's good or bad?

152
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,924
I thought it out.

153
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:45,890
I thought it out.

154
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:49,478
When it's dark,
I'm going to look for the Americans.

155
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,773
I don't trust the Germans.

156
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,950
Don't you trust our bishop?

157
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,023
I thought about that, sir.

158
00:20:57,318 --> 00:21:00,185
But a German was killed here the other day.

159
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:02,905
Nobody knows who did it...

160
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:05,121
and the Germans are vindictive.

161
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:09,080
Starting tomorrow,
they'll shoot anyone, young and old alike.

162
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,322
Death is everywhere these days.

163
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:14,199
I've made my decision.

164
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,656
If anyone else agrees, we'll go together.

165
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:24,241
Wear dark clothes. We go by night.

166
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:29,752
Not the dogs.

167
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:34,544
They make noise.
We'll have to leave them behind.

168
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:38,901
I hadn't thought of that.

169
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,968
Mama's coming with us.

170
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:44,342
And me? With whom do I go?

171
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,247
The sun will set in five minutes!

172
00:22:54,552 --> 00:22:55,566
Wait.

173
00:22:58,487 --> 00:22:59,894
Wait a minute.

174
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,132
First we eat.

175
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:04,691
Why not later, by the washhouse?

176
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,347
You're eating now?

177
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:11,119
We'll have to start out very quickly,
without stopping.

178
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,025
In the past days, they didn't eat much.

179
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,885
Need some strength.

180
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,651
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

181
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,574
Forgive us.

182
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:29,195
Forgive us. We are such fools.
We are scared.

183
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:32,459
Forgive us. We are scared.
We are such fools.

184
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:40,428
Good luck.

185
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,544
That's our dog. Can you hear him? It's Wolf.

186
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,395
That's him! That's him!

187
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:33,491
Let's hide. Go, go, go!

188
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,286
It's us!

189
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,114
- We are coming with you.
- It's us.

190
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:45,491
We are coming with you.

191
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,793
- Is that you, Corrado?
- And you, Belindia?

192
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:49,300
Where are you?

193
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:00,680
When will San Martino blow up?

194
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:05,032
They said 3:00 a.m.

195
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,309
Come, Cecilia...

196
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:27,584
make yourself light.

197
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,445
If we stay quiet...

198
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,035
we'll hear the bombs.

199
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,262
Rosanna...

200
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:17,072
do you feel
you've been through this before?

201
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:20,327
Yes.

202
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,746
I wish it were already 3:00 a.m.

203
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,237
I can't stand it.

204
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:41,221
<i>I'm a fool.</i>

205
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:43,970
<i>I keep thinking...</i>

206
00:27:44,615 --> 00:27:47,396
<i>that they'll blow up
the cockroaches in the sink.</i>

207
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:54,847
Don't cry.

208
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,116
We'll start all over again.

209
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,993
<i>I don't want to start over.</i>

210
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:07,038
<i>God, I've never asked for anything.</i>

211
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,434
<i>But at least save the mattresses.</i>

212
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:15,571
<i>No, God, let the houses blow up.</i>

213
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,200
<i>I've waited for an hour.</i>

214
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,499
<i>I never had so much fun.</i>

215
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,901
<i>How could I have wanted our house to go?</i>

216
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,522
<i>With the yellow sofa...</i>

217
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,203
<i>the staircase...</i>

218
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,191
<i>the entrance.</i>

219
00:30:50,942 --> 00:30:52,795
That wasn't San Martino.

220
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:55,603
San Martino's to the right.

221
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,398
Seemed like it to me.

222
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:00,853
No. The explosions came
from somewhere else.

223
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:05,745
It was San Martino.

224
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,635
Definitely San Martino.

225
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,439
The wind carried the sound to the left.

226
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,280
Our rosy San Martino fades away.

227
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,760
We're going that way.

228
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:24,499
Mama, I'm so hot.

229
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:25,911
Take it off.

230
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,831
Hey, Corrado!

231
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:01,093
Bruno should've reached
the Americans by now.

232
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:02,373
Who's Bruno?

233
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:05,409
A man with whom you should fall in love.

234
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:07,400
Why didn't you bring him?

235
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:10,721
- Is Bruno dark?
- Bruno means "dark."

236
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:12,995
So what? I was blonde as a child.

237
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:18,500
The English!

238
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,531
Don't eat so much. You'll get sick.

239
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:45,010
Did you yell, "It's the English"?

240
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:46,577
The English, yes.

241
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,754
But it's the Americans that are coming.

242
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:50,231
No, the Sicilians.

243
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,892
Sicilians?

244
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:55,250
The Fifth Army has a unit
of Sicilian-Americans.

245
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:57,009
I heard that in Florence.

246
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,662
Sicilian. Sicilians?

247
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:01,228
Like you.

248
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:19,405
You're the only one
who hasn't thrown it away.

249
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:26,594
I won't throw it away
until my husband is back from India.

250
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:30,400
I won't.

251
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:49,824
You're such a pig.

252
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:05,622
Let's find those Americans.

253
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,950
What's wrong? You ate too much?

254
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,817
Mara, come back! Come back!

255
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,347
Mara, come here, Mara!

256
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,405
Where are you going, Mara?

257
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,223
To the Sicilians.

258
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,281
Friends!

259
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:07,649
A stone hit me.

260
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:13,081
- How'd it happen?
- Why are you here alone?

261
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:14,461
I was looking for you.

262
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:16,600
You're the Sicilians from Brooklyn?

263
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:19,806
Help me, Tuminello.

264
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,947
- Tuminello?
- That's him.

265
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:24,148
Your name's Tuminello?

266
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,986
- Mine, too. Mara Tuminello.
- From Castelbuono?

267
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:29,555
From Castelbuono.

268
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:33,585
- I'm related to Salvatore.
- And me to Assunta, Rocco's daughter.

269
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,607
Take me to America.

270
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,559
I'll take you to Brooklyn.

271
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:43,029
Where?

272
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:45,902
It's here.

273
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:08,197
So much snow...

274
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:10,726
it makes me dizzy.

275
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,182
It was a girl!

276
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:37,943
I saw something move.

277
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:40,765
What aim! You got her in the head.

278
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:44,761
At least she died instantly.

279
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:12,049
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

280
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:15,854
I've looked for blackberries,
but there aren't any left.

281
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:19,213
We found some blueberries down there.

282
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:20,521
Didn't we, Dad?

283
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:23,656
Your mouth is still blue.

284
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:47,931
The rest of you, listen to me!

285
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:51,001
We know he wasn't alone.

286
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:52,218
Right, Dad?

287
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:54,846
Go back to San Martino!

288
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:58,111
Galvano Galvani, take them to the cathedral.

289
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:00,341
Or we'll kill them all!

290
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:01,848
We're going...

291
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:03,861
but we'll be back. Right, Dad?

292
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,784
I'm coming!

293
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,741
We know he wasn't alone!

294
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:09,364
Right, Dad?

295
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:23,861
We're going back.

296
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:28,012
Or she'll have it here.

297
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:31,342
In the cathedral, your bishop will protect us.

298
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,512
I'll take them just outside San Martino.

299
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,496
Corrado, wait.

300
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,068
We're going back,
but my mother-in-law can't keep up.

301
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:45,669
I'll take care of her.

302
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:48,107
Leave her at the Meridiana house.

303
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:49,995
She was born there.

304
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:53,992
Forgive me, but I'm afraid out here.

305
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:58,272
Say something, at least!

306
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:01,060
- Say something!
- Let's go.

307
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,870
What should we do? We are leaving?

308
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:18,010
First we'll bury the Sicilian girl.

309
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,217
Belindia!

310
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:41,365
If it's born...

311
00:40:41,464 --> 00:40:43,024
The baby, if it's born...

312
00:40:43,128 --> 00:40:45,428
you never know, what will we name him?

313
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:47,219
That's right!

314
00:40:48,725 --> 00:40:50,000
Any name you want.

315
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,103
My father's name.

316
00:40:53,874 --> 00:40:55,151
What was it?

317
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,695
God! What was my father's name?

318
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:02,252
Giovanni!

319
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:47,738
There aren't enough hosts for all of you.

320
00:41:48,223 --> 00:41:50,109
There's been so much confusion.

321
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:54,293
Even if we divide the ones in here...

322
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:56,409
they're not enough.

323
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,192
Over there.

324
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:05,267
Let me think a minute.

325
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:09,206
We...

326
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:13,491
We have the bread.

327
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,245
Not the bread!

328
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:21,384
The Scardagli woman's right.

329
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:24,172
That's your name, isn't it?

330
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,535
Scardigli.

331
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,253
Scardigli, then.

332
00:42:30,606 --> 00:42:33,605
Whoever has any bread,
break it into many pieces.

333
00:42:34,316 --> 00:42:35,744
I'll consecrate it...

334
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:37,952
and He will help you.

335
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:45,919
What Saint's day is today? What Saint?

336
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,196
If you don't know, who does?

337
00:42:54,564 --> 00:42:56,026
Saint Cyriacus!

338
00:43:03,203 --> 00:43:07,161
We'll remember this unusual day
as the Day of Saint Cyriacus.

339
00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:13,150
<i>On this Saint's Day, in the summer of 1944...</i>

340
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,858
<i>we all sought salvation in the House of God.</i>

341
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,436
Do not forsake me now.

342
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:18,604
My piece is too big.

343
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,482
What do I do? Chew it?

344
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,640
- Where are you hurt?
- Where is Luciana?

345
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:43,556
Stop. I said stop.

346
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:45,346
Stop. Stop.

347
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:50,240
Let me go.

348
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:31,764
I'll do it alone.

349
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,047
Alone.

350
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,267
Alone.

351
00:48:17,383 --> 00:48:20,764
<i>We kept going,
although we didn't know where to.</i>

352
00:48:21,508 --> 00:48:25,370
<i>We couldn't hear the cannons anymore.
But Galvano wouldn't give us a break.</i>

353
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:29,369
<i>I could only think
of a wonderful thing that happened to me.</i>

354
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,453
<i>Signora Concetta...</i>

355
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:35,129
<i>couldn't stop at the house
where she was born, the Meridiana...</i>

356
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:36,758
<i>because it was burning.</i>

357
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:39,609
<i>That's when she put
two gold earrings on my ears.</i>

358
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,027
<i>She said, "On a little girl, they'll be safer."</i>

359
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:55,314
Cecilia, are you afraid?

360
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,608
When I'm afraid, do you know what I do?

361
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,405
I recite this rhyme:

362
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,981
<i>"Dirt and soil. Job had a boil.</i>

363
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:07,722
<i>"Medication, medication.
Add some chicken defecation.</i>

364
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,033
<i>"And the dog and cat doo-doo.</i>

365
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,209
<i>"By tomorrow you'll be through.</i>

366
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,146
<i>"Sigh and moan.</i>

367
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:16,748
<i>"Stump of tree.</i>

368
00:49:16,944 --> 00:49:18,853
<i>"Severed vine. Leave me be.</i>

369
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:23,531
<i>"Rise up, run from here.
Make my warts disappear."</i>

370
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,414
They even carry away the dead.

371
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:57,830
No, I'm just tired. It'll pass.

372
00:51:57,937 --> 00:51:59,366
- Where are they from?
- From Briolo.

373
00:51:59,473 --> 00:52:01,414
- And the Americans?
- No Americans around here.

374
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,428
Just Germans everywhere.

375
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,029
Where are you going?

376
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:07,499
What about the bus?

377
00:52:09,356 --> 00:52:10,403
It's mine.

378
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:12,489
They took it.

379
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:17,087
I've been following them for five days.

380
00:52:18,089 --> 00:52:20,509
Sooner or later they'll abandon it.

381
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:22,245
And I'll be there.

382
00:52:23,815 --> 00:52:25,603
It's my bus, my life!

383
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:31,739
I'm sorry.

384
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:34,079
You're all hungry like me...

385
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:35,713
but I need them.

386
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:38,969
Thirty eggs.

387
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:40,732
I figured it out.

388
00:52:41,439 --> 00:52:42,551
One a day.

389
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:45,305
And in 30 days the war will be over.

390
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:50,586
I'm gonna make it.

391
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:55,124
You forgot your shoe.

392
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:13,522
I'll stay with you.

393
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:16,969
Where else would I go?

394
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:24,016
Five...

395
00:53:25,198 --> 00:53:27,654
Five days since I spoke to anyone.

396
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:31,785
Five days...

397
00:53:32,428 --> 00:53:33,889
without talking.

398
00:54:02,688 --> 00:54:04,279
To find the Americans...

399
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,054
you have to first find Dante.

400
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:12,216
Dante's band of rebels.

401
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,264
Bandits.

402
00:54:13,372 --> 00:54:14,298
Where?

403
00:54:15,514 --> 00:54:16,791
By the Arno River.

404
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:27,220
Where are you going?

405
00:54:27,638 --> 00:54:28,782
Come with us.

406
00:54:34,963 --> 00:54:35,978
He's dead.

407
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:40,519
Come back.

408
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:43,591
He's dead.

409
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:26,680
What do you mean, nothing?

410
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:27,798
Nothing over here.

411
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:54,827
Thank you.

412
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,778
Alfredina.

413
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:12,904
What happened?

414
00:56:13,518 --> 00:56:15,044
Wait, I'll do it.

415
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:26,623
Is it true that you're related to Galvano?

416
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:32,866
A peasant made noble forgets her relatives.

417
00:56:45,057 --> 00:56:46,333
We'll sleep here.

418
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:50,837
Poison ivy!

419
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:10,863
You bitch!

420
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,432
What are you doing? Dilvo!

421
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,166
Where were you?

422
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:24,112
In San Martino.

423
00:58:24,218 --> 00:58:26,388
How long have you been looking for us?

424
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:29,331
For three days.

425
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:36,816
What about the cathedral? And Belindia?

426
00:58:37,141 --> 00:58:38,733
- I don't know.
- How come?

427
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:40,685
I don't remember.

428
00:58:40,788 --> 00:58:42,412
- Do you have a fever?
- No.

429
00:58:43,922 --> 00:58:46,094
No, I left Belindia and the others...

430
00:58:46,642 --> 00:58:47,918
outside the town.

431
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:51,466
I don't remember the rest.

432
00:58:55,726 --> 00:58:56,653
Cecilia?

433
01:00:28,169 --> 01:00:29,923
Gino? Gino Bulleri?

434
01:00:30,184 --> 01:00:32,005
What are you doing? Harvesting?

435
01:00:32,104 --> 01:00:33,312
What about you?

436
01:00:34,022 --> 01:00:35,299
Where are you headed?

437
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,602
We're trying to reach the Americans.

438
01:00:38,214 --> 01:00:39,641
Do you need any help?

439
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,273
Do you know a Dante?

440
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,478
They say he knows the way.
Do you know him and his gang?

441
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,098
That's us.

442
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:49,496
You!

443
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:52,794
What do you mean?

444
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:55,324
That's us, and that's Dante.

445
01:00:56,734 --> 01:00:58,228
The one with the vest.

446
01:00:59,038 --> 01:01:01,404
No. Today, I can't take you anywhere.

447
01:01:01,693 --> 01:01:03,284
Tomorrow, Bruno will take you.

448
01:01:03,387 --> 01:01:05,722
After we've finished.

449
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:08,437
- Bruno Marini?
- Yes, from Volterra.

450
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,683
What's happened here?

451
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:12,719
The Fascists and Germans want our wheat.

452
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,285
- But where?
- We're hiding it in the woods.

453
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:17,106
No, where's Bruno?

454
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:18,929
He's around. Just look.

455
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:21,611
We're helping these families.

456
01:01:21,877 --> 01:01:24,113
If you'd help, too, we'd appreciate it.

457
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:26,609
We hadn't planned on it, but we'll help.

458
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:28,295
Hurry.

459
01:01:28,402 --> 01:01:31,019
At noon the Germans fly overhead...

460
01:01:31,217 --> 01:01:32,742
and we'll have to hide.

461
01:01:41,518 --> 01:01:42,445
Bruno.

462
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:48,171
Hello.

463
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:56,965
No, give it to me.

464
01:01:58,694 --> 01:02:00,319
You've changed so quickly.

465
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:02,561
My eyes are red.

466
01:02:02,725 --> 01:02:03,772
From wheat?

467
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:05,982
We haven't slept in three days.

468
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,512
Today, we'll help you.

469
01:02:07,843 --> 01:02:09,532
Rosanna's here, too.

470
01:02:09,795 --> 01:02:11,582
We're going to the Americans.

471
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:21,884
Did your feet heal?

472
01:02:28,187 --> 01:02:29,398
I'll stay here.

473
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:03,589
Put it down.

474
01:03:57,048 --> 01:03:58,706
- Is that Bruno?
- Yes.

475
01:04:00,056 --> 01:04:01,266
He fell asleep.

476
01:04:09,523 --> 01:04:10,537
Stop that.

477
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:33,672
They'll be back.

478
01:04:34,601 --> 01:04:35,528
Stop.

479
01:04:35,848 --> 01:04:37,473
Come here and sit down.

480
01:04:39,047 --> 01:04:43,139
Everyone from San Martino
who decided to stay...

481
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:44,668
has to change his name.

482
01:04:44,773 --> 01:04:46,715
- Change it? Why?
- It's safer.

483
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,565
- Can I pick my own name?
- Yes.

484
01:04:53,091 --> 01:04:54,237
I'm thinking.

485
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:57,089
For instance, my name is Bruno.

486
01:04:57,346 --> 01:04:58,839
But now I'm Biondo.

487
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:01,850
I'm San Martino.

488
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:04,789
Juliano.

489
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,127
I like changing names.

490
01:05:07,996 --> 01:05:09,752
I never liked mine.

491
01:05:10,044 --> 01:05:10,937
Dilvo.

492
01:05:11,035 --> 01:05:13,075
Can I be Bruno, although it's his name?

493
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:14,455
That's all right.

494
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:16,053
I'm Achilles.

495
01:05:16,762 --> 01:05:19,127
He never lost a battle! Right, Nina?

496
01:05:19,225 --> 01:05:20,686
You, Achilles?

497
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:22,739
But where's your sword?

498
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:26,869
In your sheath, my Helen of Troy.

499
01:05:38,224 --> 01:05:40,199
I don't even know if it's a name.

500
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,245
Requiem.

501
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:19,709
Call me Requiem.

502
01:06:21,856 --> 01:06:22,784
Lion.

503
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:25,687
Orangutan.

504
01:06:26,781 --> 01:06:27,709
Owl.

505
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:32,348
Fur.

506
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,903
That's a nice name. And you?

507
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,190
I...

508
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:04,807
Giovanni.

509
01:07:09,102 --> 01:07:10,149
Giovanni.

510
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,487
Your feet are so pretty.

511
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:46,844
They're the only pretty things about me.

512
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,015
Otherwise, I'm ugly.

513
01:07:49,117 --> 01:07:50,644
You're not ugly.

514
01:07:50,749 --> 01:07:52,853
You don't have to console me.

515
01:07:53,756 --> 01:07:56,242
I was born ugly, and I've stayed ugly.

516
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:03,640
What you don't know...

517
01:08:03,736 --> 01:08:05,623
is what it is to be ugly...

518
01:08:06,487 --> 01:08:08,428
and yet to feel beautiful.

519
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:13,134
Maybe it's the way the men look at you.

520
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,486
You understand that,
even though you're a virgin.

521
01:08:32,652 --> 01:08:33,960
<i>And still...</i>

522
01:08:35,469 --> 01:08:37,956
Still, if the Germans fly over again...

523
01:08:38,924 --> 01:08:40,809
one, the one I choose...

524
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:43,143
the one I want...

525
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:47,301
and I won't be a virgin anymore.

526
01:10:12,485 --> 01:10:14,820
<i>That night was August 10, my love.</i>

527
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,182
<i>The shooting stars...</i>

528
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:19,320
<i>the night of Saint Lawrence...</i>

529
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:21,313
<i>when wishes are granted.</i>

530
01:10:21,537 --> 01:10:24,024
<i>But none of us thought about it then.</i>

531
01:10:26,976 --> 01:10:28,317
<i>The next morning...</i>

532
01:10:28,414 --> 01:10:31,098
<i>before the others woke up...</i>

533
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:33,977
<i>Renata and I went to pee.</i>

534
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:02,141
You have a vivid imagination.

535
01:13:18,654 --> 01:13:19,831
American.

536
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,707
Americans.

537
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:05,993
God, my head's spinning.

538
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:10,718
I'm dizzy.

539
01:14:10,824 --> 01:14:12,929
You're not used to them, Papa.

540
01:14:32,673 --> 01:14:35,160
- Over the hill.
- No, through the woods!

541
01:14:38,527 --> 01:14:39,900
The Fascists!

542
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:24,294
Leave it.

543
01:15:28,396 --> 01:15:30,020
I'll show you.

544
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:00,376
- Giuseppe!
- Rosanna!

545
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:02,483
Does Mama know you're with them?

546
01:16:02,589 --> 01:16:05,371
Move away! Rosanna, move away!

547
01:16:06,204 --> 01:16:07,861
Move away, Rosanna!

548
01:16:33,905 --> 01:16:35,050
Nicola!

549
01:16:44,269 --> 01:16:45,796
Give yourself up!

550
01:16:47,371 --> 01:16:48,681
You give up!

551
01:17:01,543 --> 01:17:03,069
You've killed me.

552
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,345
- Who's winning?
- I am looking for Bruno.

553
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:24,658
Who's winning?

554
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:34,007
Grandma's been wounded.

555
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:46,257
Some water.

556
01:18:07,723 --> 01:18:10,243
I'll say Mussolini as often as I like.

557
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,633
I'll say Mussolini as often as I like.

558
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:33,791
Bruno! Biondo!

559
01:18:34,532 --> 01:18:35,773
Over here.

560
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:37,246
Stay down.

561
01:18:38,529 --> 01:18:39,575
Papa!

562
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:46,899
Let's get out of here. They're killing us all!

563
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:12,941
Hold on!

564
01:19:25,519 --> 01:19:27,307
- Cut, cut.
- His hands, his hands.

565
01:19:47,046 --> 01:19:49,216
Show yourselves!

566
01:19:51,076 --> 01:19:53,116
I know you all!

567
01:19:54,242 --> 01:19:57,142
Show yourselves! Luigi! Giuseppe!

568
01:19:58,305 --> 01:19:59,581
And you...

569
01:20:00,001 --> 01:20:02,683
Dilvo Senesi, I recognized you.

570
01:20:03,934 --> 01:20:06,967
And I know you, too.
You're Giglioli from Marzana!

571
01:20:19,193 --> 01:20:21,580
You've already killed me, Giglioli.

572
01:20:25,879 --> 01:20:27,569
Why mess up my face?

573
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:33,482
My God, Senesi!

574
01:20:36,979 --> 01:20:38,889
Go, go, go, go!

575
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,509
Stay right there!

576
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,685
Go away!

577
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:57,924
Away!

578
01:21:05,511 --> 01:21:07,485
"Dirt and soil. Job had a boil.

579
01:21:07,592 --> 01:21:10,721
"Medication, medication.
Add some chicken defecation.

580
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:13,919
"And the dog and cat doo-doo.
By tomorrow you'll be through.

581
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:16,124
"Sigh and moan. Stump of tree.

582
01:21:16,354 --> 01:21:18,296
"Severed vine. Leave me be.

583
01:21:25,376 --> 01:21:27,960
"Rise up, run from here.

584
01:21:28,446 --> 01:21:31,097
"Make my warts disappear."

585
01:23:26,959 --> 01:23:28,366
That's enough!

586
01:23:29,774 --> 01:23:30,887
Enough.

587
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:42,498
The Marmugis are hiding in the orchard.

588
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:57,153
One of them climbed up the cherry tree.

589
01:23:59,394 --> 01:24:00,441
Down! Down!

590
01:24:01,443 --> 01:24:02,586
I won't!

591
01:24:04,034 --> 01:24:05,887
I said, come down!

592
01:24:05,984 --> 01:24:08,569
Father, where are you?

593
01:24:08,671 --> 01:24:10,743
- Come down!
- Can you hear me?

594
01:24:11,327 --> 01:24:13,114
I hear you!

595
01:24:16,668 --> 01:24:17,944
I hear you!

596
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:22,803
Kill me.

597
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:30,450
Not him.

598
01:24:38,004 --> 01:24:39,598
He's only 15.

599
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:53,063
Not him.

600
01:24:54,542 --> 01:24:56,135
He's only 15.

601
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:17,119
Shoot. Can't you see how he's suffering?

602
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:47,897
<i>We hiked all the way to Saint Angelo.</i>

603
01:26:48,514 --> 01:26:51,197
<i>The farmers gave us shelter for the night.</i>

604
01:26:52,192 --> 01:26:54,165
<i>They reopened their houses.</i>

605
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:56,987
<i>We were all so tired...</i>

606
01:26:57,374 --> 01:26:59,261
<i>that we forgot our fears.</i>

607
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,877
This shoe is finished.

608
01:27:29,905 --> 01:27:32,903
We're going, Papa.
They put us up somewhere else.

609
01:27:33,135 --> 01:27:34,825
Nearby, in a hayloft.

610
01:27:36,911 --> 01:27:38,732
Are you feeling better?

611
01:27:39,438 --> 01:27:42,022
- Yes, I feel better.
- See you in the morning.

612
01:27:42,124 --> 01:27:43,269
Till tomorrow.

613
01:27:43,372 --> 01:27:45,793
- I brought some pillows.
- Thank you.

614
01:27:52,136 --> 01:27:53,762
Are you crying?

615
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,341
Because your children left?

616
01:27:57,701 --> 01:27:59,524
Your wife's still here.

617
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:04,478
You're man and wife, aren't you?

618
01:28:11,168 --> 01:28:12,543
For 30 years.

619
01:28:13,057 --> 01:28:15,063
Anyway, there's water here.

620
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:16,860
Goodnight.

621
01:28:24,765 --> 01:28:26,587
Sorry, Concetta...

622
01:28:31,577 --> 01:28:33,234
but she was too curious.

623
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:36,563
- I'll call her back and explain.
- No, don't bother.

624
01:28:36,983 --> 01:28:38,390
It's the war.

625
01:28:45,781 --> 01:28:47,438
You tore your dress.

626
01:28:47,892 --> 01:28:50,475
You should've had your wrists bandaged.

627
01:28:53,393 --> 01:28:56,044
I must have bruised your shoulders.
I'm heavy.

628
01:28:56,145 --> 01:28:58,087
You're stronger than I am.

629
01:29:07,499 --> 01:29:09,158
Go ahead. You talk.

630
01:29:09,771 --> 01:29:11,559
No, it's not important.

631
01:29:15,752 --> 01:29:18,501
I'd never have expected you and me to be...

632
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:22,979
together on a bed, talking this way.

633
01:29:23,878 --> 01:29:25,055
Strange.

634
01:29:26,117 --> 01:29:28,451
My heart's also beating very fast.

635
01:29:35,552 --> 01:29:38,586
I'm filthy, and I'm dirtying up the bedcover.

636
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,085
I'll sleep on the chair.

637
01:29:41,406 --> 01:29:42,899
I'm also filthy.

638
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:46,489
I'll stand by the window while you undress.

639
01:30:07,156 --> 01:30:08,616
Did you know...

640
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,311
as a boy, I had a crush on you?

641
01:30:12,178 --> 01:30:13,738
I think you knew.

642
01:30:14,672 --> 01:30:16,559
Love doesn't hide easily.

643
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,624
I knew.

644
01:30:22,927 --> 01:30:24,933
What are you making me say?

645
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:32,550
They made us drink too much of that wine.

646
01:30:33,578 --> 01:30:34,755
Exactly.

647
01:30:35,624 --> 01:30:37,663
And tomorrow may never come.

648
01:30:49,092 --> 01:30:51,262
I'll undress behind the closet.

649
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:05,946
Undress where you like.

650
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:09,722
After what I've seen,
a naked man won't scare me.

651
01:31:11,226 --> 01:31:13,048
You're not embarrassed?

652
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:17,010
Are you?

653
01:31:17,497 --> 01:31:18,925
But I'm a man.

654
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:24,110
I am embarrassed.

655
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:42,573
How many of us will be able
to keep going tomorrow?

656
01:31:44,974 --> 01:31:48,006
- Tonight, no one sleeps.
- I'll sit up with you.

657
01:31:49,644 --> 01:31:51,019
You're tired.

658
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,607
Try to sleep a little.

659
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:17,529
We're both tired.

660
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,980
This could have happened 40 years ago.

661
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,889
It would have been better.

662
01:33:15,338 --> 01:33:18,119
Yes, I'm missing three.

663
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:22,023
With all my teeth, it would have been better.

664
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,909
Let's go downstairs.

665
01:33:40,671 --> 01:33:42,231
Tomorrow morning.

666
01:34:05,912 --> 01:34:08,212
No, leave it on.

667
01:34:21,105 --> 01:34:23,209
Last night, we were liberated.

668
01:34:24,368 --> 01:34:26,571
The Fifth Army, so they say.

669
01:34:26,863 --> 01:34:30,026
They entered Marano, Palaia, and Muriolo.

670
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:33,413
They won't come up here. We're too small.

671
01:34:38,443 --> 01:34:41,605
The church bells tell you
which towns are liberated.

672
01:34:49,286 --> 01:34:51,195
We'll go to see them further down.

673
01:34:51,301 --> 01:34:54,082
You'll meet them
on your way to San Martino.

674
01:34:54,628 --> 01:34:57,529
Your people downstairs
are getting ready to go.

675
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:02,232
It's raining, and the sun is shining.

676
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:29,487
Come.

677
01:35:30,647 --> 01:35:32,588
Signora, catch!

678
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:23,579
Galvano!

679
01:36:26,304 --> 01:36:27,994
What's the rush?

680
01:36:28,096 --> 01:36:30,484
They're lending us wagons.
There's room for you.

681
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:32,597
- So suddenly?
- Why should we wait?

682
01:36:32,701 --> 01:36:34,588
Why not tomorrow?

683
01:36:34,814 --> 01:36:37,081
There's no need to hurry now.

684
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:38,452
Duilio!

685
01:36:41,338 --> 01:36:42,997
Let's stay a while.

686
01:36:43,994 --> 01:36:45,454
It's nice here.

687
01:36:46,871 --> 01:36:49,010
He wants to wait for tomorrow!

688
01:36:50,007 --> 01:36:51,828
Until it stops raining!

689
01:36:53,334 --> 01:36:54,675
You'll get soaked.

690
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:57,198
We won't get soaked!

691
01:36:58,419 --> 01:36:59,978
Signora Concetta!

692
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,514
Papa, what's going on?

693
01:38:06,937 --> 01:38:08,311
You're not coming?

694
01:38:08,408 --> 01:38:10,709
Go ahead. I'll catch up later.

695
01:38:13,944 --> 01:38:16,692
What's so important here?

696
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:18,165
Nothing.

697
01:38:18,421 --> 01:38:20,362
What do you mean, nothing?

698
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:23,952
I'll fix my shoe. Then I'll leave.

699
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:32,273
<i>Galvano stayed on for three more hours...</i>

700
01:39:33,622 --> 01:39:35,629
<i>alone with many thoughts...</i>

701
01:39:36,278 --> 01:39:38,960
<i>while we made our way back to San Martino.</i>

702
01:39:42,355 --> 01:39:44,394
<i>My story ends here, my love.</i>

703
01:39:47,346 --> 01:39:50,411
<i>I don't know if things happened
exactly like that.</i>

704
01:39:51,663 --> 01:39:55,010
<i>I was only six then, but the story is true...</i>

705
01:39:56,653 --> 01:39:59,206
<i>and even true stories can end well.</i>

706
01:40:03,754 --> 01:40:05,413
<i>Sleep now, darling.</i>

707
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:09,826
<i>Let me look at you.</i>

708
01:40:12,489 --> 01:40:14,724
<i>You're beautiful when you sleep.</i>

709
01:40:46,555 --> 01:40:49,849
<i>"Dirt and soil. Job had a boil.</i>

710
01:40:50,297 --> 01:40:53,460
<i>"Medication, medication.
Add some chicken defecation.</i>

711
01:40:53,913 --> 01:40:57,588
<i>"And the dog and cat doo-doo.
By tomorrow you'll be through.</i>

712
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,206
<i>"Sigh and moan. Stump of tree.</i>

713
01:41:00,789 --> 01:41:02,697
<i>"Severed vine. Leave me be.</i>

714
01:41:03,092 --> 01:41:04,915
<i>"Rise up, run from here.</i>

715
01:41:05,523 --> 01:41:07,410
<i>"Make my warts disappear.</i>

716
01:41:07,987 --> 01:41:09,873
<i>"Dirt and soil.</i>

717
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,563
<i>"Job had a boil."</i>
