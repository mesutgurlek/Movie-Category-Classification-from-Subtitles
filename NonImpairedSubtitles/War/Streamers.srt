1
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,901
1, 2, 3, 4, hey!

2
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,940
1, 2, 3, 4, hey!

3
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,445
give me the detonator.

4
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,221
What are we blowing up?

5
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,756
what difference
does it make?

6
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:45,230
You ready
on the right?

7
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,401
Uh, rooney,
don't blow your dick off.

8
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,271
Good idea.

9
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:55,273
Protect yourself
at all times.

10
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,609
Let's blow
that sucker up.

11
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,789
Pretty little thing,
isn't it?

12
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,093
Yeah. 4th of July.

13
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,596
Quite a little sparkler.

14
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,698
One thing about the long fuse
- yeah.

15
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,100
...Is that you're
further away from it

16
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,602
When it goes off.

17
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,737
You remember that bridge?
the bridge

18
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,872
Where we used
3 miles of fuse?

19
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,143
We were sitting there
for four days.

20
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,547
It seemed like four days.

21
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,282
I took a nap.
You woke me up

22
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,418
So we could watch
the sucker go off.

23
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,188
We were way over
beyond the hill.

24
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,361
It was pretty
when it went off.

25
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,264
God, it was beautiful.

26
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,600
You did that great, rooney.

27
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,834
It was fucking beautiful.

28
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:58,202
That was a masterpiece.

29
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,916
Oh, hi, martin.
How are you?

30
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,853
Getting shorter.

31
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,761
Oh, god. Those two nuts
are playing war again.

32
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,964
I bet he shit his pants.

33
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,340
What the hell are you
laughing at? Ten-hut!

34
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,675
Oh, my god, martin.
What happened?

35
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:12,677
What's your name, soldier? Bush, sir.

36
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:14,846
Put it down. Drop it, martin. Drop it.

37
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,382
No! Drop it!
Put it down!

38
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,584
Get some cold water
- would you get away from me, please?

39
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,253
What's that sticking out in
front of your drawers, bush?

40
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:24,622
Nothing, sir. You're
goddamn right it's nothing.

41
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,890
No!

42
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,394
did you shit your bed?

43
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,397
No, sir.
Well, you should have.

44
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,367
Stick it under there,
martin.

45
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,702
I hate it.
Martin, I know.

46
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,904
Do you know how I hate it?
Yes, I know. Everybody hates it.

47
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,939
Don't you think I hate it,
martin? I enlisted, though.

48
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,009
I enlisted, and I-
yeah, I enlisted, too.

49
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,546
I want it clean now!
Sit down. Sit down.

50
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:49,547
Move!

51
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:56,053
come on in.
it's still bleeding?

52
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:58,055
I vomit every morning.

53
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,658
I get the dry heaves
in the middle of every night.

54
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,027
You're just scared,
martin.

55
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:05,797
It's just fear.
You can get over that.

56
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,199
Wrap this very tightly.
Wrap this and hold it there.

57
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,802
Hold it up in the air.
Do you throw up?

58
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,572
Hold it there, martin,
and don't do anything.

59
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,908
Just stay there and hold this
very tightly and keep it up.

60
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,242
All right?
Mm-hmm.

61
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,344
Where is that thing?

62
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,650
They're going to ask
some questions.

63
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,026
Um, uh, roger
isn't here right now.

64
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,361
They told me a black boy
live in here.

65
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,130
Where's he at?

66
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,132
Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm saying.

67
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,267
Uh, he isn't here.
He'll be back later, though.

68
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:46,037
Uh, you can come back then.
His name is roger.

69
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,909
They're all so mean.

70
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,612
They're all so awful.

71
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,013
I've got two years to go.

72
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,049
Just thinking about it
is gonna make me sick.

73
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,216
This is all fucked.

74
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,218
What are you doing?
Okay, this is good.

75
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:03,254
This is gonna hurt
just a little.

76
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:05,256
No, it's good.
It's good, it's good, it's good.

77
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,492
You know, I thought
it would be different.

78
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,894
I just wanted
to get out.

79
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:12,129
I might not have come in here.
I might not have found you.

80
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,298
I don't care. I'd be out. Oh, shit.

81
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,239
I slit my wrist!
Oh, martin, jesus!

82
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,342
I did. He's just kidding. He's kidding.

83
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,744
I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

84
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,280
I slit my wrist!

85
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:36,354
It's not gonna do any good
to bandage it up.

86
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,356
I'm getting out of here.
I don't care...

87
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,257
What's going on? I'm getting out of here.

88
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,259
Nothing, man.

89
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,996
Ain't no thing
but a chicken wing.

90
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:15,192
Hey, richie, who was
that colored guy in here?

91
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,695
Uh, he came in here looking for
roger. He didn't even know his name.

92
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,964
I cut my wrists, billy.
For god's sake, martin.

93
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,699
Huh?
I did.

94
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,802
You're disgusting. No, it's the
truth. I did. I am not disgusting.

95
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:26,804
It may not be disgusting, but
it certainly is disappointing.

96
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,773
What are you guys talking
about? I cut my wrists.

97
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,709
I slashed them, and richie
is pretending I didn't do it.

98
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,078
I am not. And you only cut one
wrist, and you didn't slash it.

99
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,080
I can't stand
the army anymore, billy.

100
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,017
This is just between martin and me,
all right? It's between me and the army.

101
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,419
Let's just go outside. Can
I see? Did he really do it?

102
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,621
No.
Yes!

103
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,925
Aw, geez, martin.
That's really awful.

104
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,426
Maybe you better go
to the infirmary.

105
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,227
No. I already washed it
with peroxide, billy.

106
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,063
It isn't very deep.
Just let us be, please.

107
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,731
He needs to straighten out
his thinking a little bit.

108
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,133
Maybe I can help him. Yeah, you
just go do some pushups or something.

109
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,802
Hey, listen,
you're no doctor.

110
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,804
I wanna make sure he doesn't
have to go to the infirmary.

111
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,006
Then I'll leave you alone.
I know what martin needs.

112
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,908
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

113
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:06,044
it's really deep!

114
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,792
Hey, rog.

115
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,694
Man, I want to get
out of here.

116
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,829
Out and free.
So go, man.

117
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,065
There's the door get out.
Go on. Ain't you a bitch?

118
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,101
Why don't you turn the lights
on in this motherfucker?

119
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,869
Lights on!

120
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:39,443
Apples, apples all the way!
Apples, apples every day!

121
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,579
To the left! To the left! To the left!

122
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,649
To the left! To the left! To the
left! To the left! To the left!

123
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,418
Throw down! Give me ten! Count off!

124
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,488
1! 2! 3!
3!

125
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,725
4! 5! 6!

126
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,059
7.

127
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,728
8. 9.

128
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,195
You and me
are more regular army

129
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,197
Than the goddamn sergeants
around this place.

130
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:02,199
You know that? Yeah,
if I was you, billy boy,

131
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,068
I wouldn't be talking
so sacrilegious so loud.

132
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,739
you smack them in the head...

133
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,040
Three laps around the pole.

134
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:14,378
To the left, motherfucker,
to the left!

135
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,614
Don't you think l.B.J.
Wants some sergeants

136
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,017
In that vietnam
in disneyland, baby?

137
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,586
Lord have mercy
on the old son.

138
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:25,823
He's going over there
to be mickey mouse.

139
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:30,028
Do him a lot of good. Make a
man out of him. I can't hear you!

140
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,829
Make a man out of him!
That's right!

141
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,665
Calisthenics!
Count off!

142
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,733
1! 2!

143
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,201
3! 4!

144
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:41,539
You know what the old boy's
m.O.S. Is?

145
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,208
His military
occupation specialty?

146
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:48,212
Demolition, baby.
Expert is his name.

147
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,081
you mean that old
son of a bitch

148
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,883
Who can't light his own
cigar for shaking

149
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,086
Is supposed to go over there,
blowing up bridges and shit?

150
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,755
he could hardly
blow up a bunk bed.

151
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,027
At least he ain't
cutting his fucking wrists.

152
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,962
I hear that.

153
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,944
Hey, rog.
Yeah.

154
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,714
You ever ask yourself if you'd rather
fight in a war where it was freezing cold

155
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,982
Or one where
there was snakes?

156
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,751
You ever ask
that question?

157
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,420
Can't say I ever did.

158
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,991
I used to ask it all
the time. All the time.

159
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,027
I mean, us kids sitting
out on the back porch

160
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,029
Telling ghost stories
at night.

161
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,031
'cause it was korea time,
and the newspapers

162
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,366
Were full of pictures
of soldiers in the snow

163
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,869
With these white frozen beards,
and they got-

164
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,904
They got rags
tied around their feet.

165
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:49,240
White frozen beards?

166
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,977
And snakes, man.

167
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,779
We hated snakes.

168
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,781
I mean, it's bad enough
to be crawling around

169
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,783
In a fucking jungle
ducking bullets.

170
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,986
Then you gotta crawl
right into a goddamn snake.

171
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,955
It's awful.

172
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,658
Yeah, it don't sound
none too cool.

173
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:11,662
When I got my draft notice, this
goddamn vietnam didn't even exist.

174
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:14,431
I mean, it existed, but not
as in a war we might be in.

175
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:17,802
I started crawling around on the floor
in this house where I was staying,

176
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,737
Going bang, bang,
bang, bang.

177
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,538
Shooting just like
some fucking kid.

178
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,642
Hey, man, my first goddamn
formation in basic, billy-

179
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,245
Man, there's some nco
up there jamming away, man.

180
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,681
He's going-

181
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,683
He says, "all right.
Now, some of you men

182
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,652
Are gonna be dying
in this war."

183
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,188
Right?
I'm saying, "what war?

184
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,356
Man, what is this crazy man
talking about?"

185
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:43,027
Right.
Now everybody's going.

186
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,532
Yeah, they're
cleaning house.

187
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,902
Don't seem possible.

188
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,338
I mean,
people shooting at you.

189
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,874
Shooting at you
to kill you.

190
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,810
That's something.

191
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:13,157
Hey, richie, why do you always
gotta be wearing that navy hat, man?

192
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,726
This is the army.
This is not a navy hat.

193
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:18,529
It's an authentic
greek fisherman's cap.

194
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,865
Yeah, what are you,
a greek?

195
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:21,899
no.

196
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,205
God damn!

197
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,140
How'd you get all
that blood on your shirt?

198
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,343
I simply did
a rather wonderful thing

199
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,045
For a friend of mine.

200
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,313
I helped him to see himself

201
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,548
In a clearer,
more hopeful light,

202
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,083
And I am very happy.

203
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,418
Yeah, well, what'd you do,
cut his throat?

204
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:44,188
no.

205
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,090
Didn't, uh,
billy tell you?

206
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,492
about what?
About martin.

207
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:49,727
No.

208
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,895
no?

209
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,330
No.

210
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,664
No?

211
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,867
What do I want to gossip
about martin for?

212
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,401
Who's planning to gossip?

213
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,937
I mean, it did happen.
We can talk about it.

214
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:02,139
It really wasn't
anything, roger,

215
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,675
Except that, uh,
martin made this rather

216
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,978
Desperate, pathetic gesture
for attention

217
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,980
Which seems to have
brought to the surface

218
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,647
Billy's more humane
and protective side.

219
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,984
I'm gonna have to
obliterate you.

220
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,619
Obliterate, did you say?
Oh, billy.

221
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,922
You better say shit, ain't
and motherfucker real soon,

222
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,656
Or we're all gonna know
just how far

223
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,359
Beyond the fourth grade
you really went.

224
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,796
You ain't worth shit,
motherfucker.

225
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,798
all right!
Uh, no, no, no, billy.

226
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,700
Wit is my domain.

227
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:32,770
You're in charge of sweat
and running around the block.

228
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,111
Hey, billy, you wanna
go to a movie tonight?

229
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,714
I don't know.
What's playing?

230
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,649
I don't know.
What's the difference?

231
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,054
You wanna go, rog?
Don't ask roger.

232
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,790
How are we going to kiss
and hug and stuff like that

233
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,392
If he's around?

234
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,294
faggot.

235
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,234
Imagine being in combat
with richie.

236
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,236
People blasting away at you.

237
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,238
Probably wanna hold your hand
or something.

238
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,308
yeah, he's something, man.

239
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,909
He's all right.

240
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,779
I think we ought
to do this area.

241
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:21,352
I think we should mop
and buff this floor.

242
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:25,556
1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4!

243
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,558
This area
ain't standing tall!

244
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,328
This area's a mess! You put
it up to an area standing tall!

245
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,230
That's good talk, lad.
This area is a midget.

246
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,733
You put it next to
an area standing tall.

247
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,905
You don't think he means that
shit he's always talking, do you?

248
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:44,875
What? Him? No.

249
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:47,244
I'd put money on it, rog,
and I ain't got much money.

250
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,046
No, you listen to the old rog.

251
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:52,116
Now, you seen that picture of that cute
little dolly he's got in his locker?

252
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,684
Man, he's not swish!

253
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:56,087
No way, man.
No fucking way.

254
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,522
I don't know, man. Since people
started getting shipped out,

255
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,124
He's been acting
real strange.

256
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,825
Yeah, well,
who ain't nervous?

257
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,929
You ever talk
to any of these guys?

258
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,798
Queers, I mean.

259
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,534
Hell, no, man.

260
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:12,536
What do I want
to do that for?

261
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,305
Shit, no.

262
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,577
I mean, some of them
are okay guys.

263
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,413
Then there's
these bitches, man.

264
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,681
They're so crazy, they can't
see nothing but themselves

265
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,618
And these goddamn games
they're always playing.

266
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,054
Man, you can be decent
about anything.

267
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,357
You see what
I'm saying, rog?

268
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:36,160
I mean, I just think we all ought
to be honest with each others.

269
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,596
You understand me or what?
No, I don't understand you.

270
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,565
One stupid fucking nigger
like me.

271
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,667
Now, how's that
supposed to be?

272
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:45,369
That's right, man.
Mock me.

273
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,339
That's just what I need.
Hey, where you going?

274
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,242
It's Saturday.
I'm supposed to call.

275
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,562
Say, boy,

276
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,066
Whose locker is that
you're looking into there, huh?

277
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,068
Hey, what's happening, baby?
That ain't your locker

278
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,304
Is what I'm asking you,
nigger.

279
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,407
I mean, you ain't got the
body of no white goddamn woman

280
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,142
Hanging on your wall
now, does you?

281
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:26,977
No.
No, no, no.

282
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:30,481
You don't wanna be lying
to me now, bean breath.

283
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,950
I got to turn you in
if you're lying.

284
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,352
And you do got the body
of some white hot-thing woman

285
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:38,589
Hanging on your wall now,
don't you, for you to peek at?

286
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,525
Ain't nobody else around here
but you, huh?

287
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:43,594
You could be thinking about
that sweet,

288
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,464
Wet, white poontang
little pussy, huh?

289
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:50,867
Yeah, I could be
thinking all that,

290
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,104
Except I know
the penalty for lying.

291
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,738
Thank god for that.

292
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,373
My man.

293
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,210
Man, check it out.
Now, this here

294
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,278
Is the locker
of a faggot.

295
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,047
Of course it is, man.
I can see that, man.

296
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,550
Any damn fool
could see that, man.

297
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:09,220
Yo, man. Hey, you want a shot? No, man.

298
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,722
Hey, brother rog, you don't
wanna take my bottle, man.

299
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,491
I think you're a tom now.

300
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,992
Oh, shit.

301
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,728
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

302
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,063
Go on.
How the fuck do I know, huh?

303
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,733
I just got in, right?
New boy in town.

304
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,701
Somewhere over there, man.
I don't know, man.

305
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:25,969
They just dumped me in here

306
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,939
With a bunch of pale-born
motherfuckers, man.

307
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,076
I just got in, man.
P company and shit, man.

308
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:34,745
I walk all around
this motherfucker, man.

309
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,114
This outfit look like
it's a little short on soul.

310
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,582
You know what I mean?

311
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,485
You got few brothers, what
I'm trying to say and shit.

312
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,121
Now, go on, man.

313
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,956
Take yourself a real taste.

314
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,760
Yeah.

315
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,097
Man, it ain't that bad.

316
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,066
What about
the white boys, huh?

317
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,369
They give you any shit, man?

318
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,437
It's good business, man.
What's the situation, you know?

319
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,773
'cause, like, I'm one of
them dudes that like to know

320
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,975
What's going on
within the situation

321
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,678
Before the situation get a
chance to be closing in on me-

322
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,181
Man, it ain't that bad.

323
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,416
They just pale,
most of them,

324
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,717
But they can't help it.

325
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:14,985
Now, how they
gonna help it?

326
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,987
Some of them got
a little bit of soul.

327
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:18,755
We got a couple
real good boys around here.

328
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:21,625
You give them a little coppertone,
they'd be straight, man.

329
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,961
Yeah.
What about the ncos?

330
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:28,732
We got any brother ncos
looking out for us?

331
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,467
Are they all white?

332
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:34,371
Like I goddamn well know all
the fucking officers are white.

333
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,273
The fucking officers
are always white, man.

334
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:38,475
Fucking snow cones in bars
everywhere you look and shit.

335
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,177
The first sergeant's
a black man.

336
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,080
Oh, yeah?
That's good news, blood.

337
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,148
I heard hitler
was a jew, too.

338
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,819
Yo, man, you wanna go over
to the club with me and shit?

339
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,321
You know, the bowling alley.

340
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,122
There's a nice bowling alley
down there, man.

341
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:54,325
They got some sweet hos
over there. Let's cut out.

342
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,626
No, man. No.

343
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,929
Aw, come on, baby, man.
No. Some other time.

344
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,300
I gotta get
my area straight.

345
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,302
Me and the guy
who lives in here, too-

346
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,671
We're gonna straighten up a little bit. Oh.

347
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,541
Oh, yeah. Right.

348
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,577
You got your
sweet deal here, right?

349
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:16,480
You don't wanna
fuck it up, huh?

350
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,682
Let me ask you
something, man.

351
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:21,418
How the fuck you rate
this whole joint, huh,

352
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,653
All to yourself,

353
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,722
And I'm fucking jammed up
over in p company

354
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,790
Like we're fucking fleas

355
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,626
Man, we ain't got
this whole place.

356
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,927
You think you're talking
to a fool or something, man?

357
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:33,564
I can see who's here
and who ain't here, man.

358
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,500
You got this whole fucking joint
to make your home, man.

359
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,370
You and a fucking couple of bunch
of dickhead white boys and shit, man.

360
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,538
I'm fucking jammed up in p company with the rest of the

361
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,341
We're here because
all three of us are spec 4.

362
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:46,209
What? You spec 4?

363
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,412
What the fuck is spec 4, huh?

364
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,347
T-5, nco, pfc.

365
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,482
Nigger, you're spec shit!

00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:56,019

They gonna be

368
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,024
Everybody's motherfucking ass
in this place, man.

369
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,859
Maybe one week
before getting shipped out

370
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,595
To get their same ass

00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,008
And the peoples is living.

377
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:21,912
'cause I can't cut this
shit here, you understand?

378
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,180
I can't cut it.

379
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,753
This your area mate, man?

380
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,622
Yeah, that's one of them.

00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,956
Uh, hey, rich-

00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:39,563
He just came over

Yo, uh, what happened to that

You know, cut himself?

Martin's gone now. You're

388
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,708
I say, my man,

389
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,280
So, uh, okay, man.

390
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,417
You ain't gonna make it

391
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:03,554
No. You go on.
I'll catch you later.

392
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,589
Aw, man, that's a shame.

393
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,058
Make me wanna cry
in my heart, you know.

394
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:11,395
You go and get your head
smoking and stop on back.

395
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,830
All right, man.

396
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,400
Guess I got to be one man
one more time, huh?

397
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,668
Easy, boss.

398
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,371
Yeah, you go on home, man.
Go on home, nigger.

399
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,406
You gonna be hearing
from me, too.

400
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,409
Yeah, I can
and do believe that.

401
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:32,983
God damn!

402
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,685
Who was that?

403
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,521
the man's new, rich.

404
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,924
I don't know his name
more than that carlyle.

405
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,293
He's new. He just got out of basic. New?

406
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:45,028
He looks
pretty used to me.

407
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,864
What doesn't?

408
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,766
Hey, billy,
how's your old man doing?

409
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,801
There wasn't anybody home.

410
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,336
Oh, man, that's too bad.

411
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,907
billy, are we going
to the movies tonight or not?

412
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,809
I ain't going nowhere.

413
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,614
what are you doing?

414
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,982
What is this?

415
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,351
Baby powder?

416
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,987
You got enough jazz in there
for an entire beauty parlor.

417
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,856
I get rashes, okay?
So what?

418
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:15,225
They got powder for rashes
that ain't baby powder.

419
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,428
It doesn't work as well.
I've tried it.

420
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,662
Have you tried it?

421
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,164
At least
get yourself straight!

422
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:22,999
What do you
want me to do?

423
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,001
Get inside your locker
and shut the door.

424
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:27,971
Don't holler for help. Nobody
will know you're in there.

425
00:23:27,972 --> 00:23:30,373
But I'm so pretty.

426
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:33,577
Tell that man you mean
what you're saying, rich!

427
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,546
Mean what?
That you think you're pretty!

428
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:40,216
Of course I do. I am.

429
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:42,152
Don't you think
I'm pretty, roger?

430
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:44,120
Yeah, I told you,
you're full of shit,

431
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,489
And you're cute.

432
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,125
Carlyle told you
you were cute, too.

433
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:52,663
Like I told you, rog.

434
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,266
What did you tell rog?

435
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,001
That you go down.

436
00:23:58,002 --> 00:23:59,470
That you go up and down
like a yo-yo,

437
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,839
And you go blowing all
the trees like the wind!

438
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:13,416
What in the hell made you
tell roger I've been down?

439
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,724
It's in your eyes.
I've seen it.

440
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,125
What?

441
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,327
You.

442
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,567
What is it, billy,
you think you're trying to say?

443
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:34,304
You with all your wit
and intelligence,

444
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:36,373
Your humanity.

445
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,242
I said it, rich. I said
what I was trying to say.

446
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:40,944
Did you?

447
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,615
I think I did.

448
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,517
Do you?

449
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,052
Loud and clear.

450
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:53,223
they got to put me in
with the weirdos.

451
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,759
Now, why is that?

452
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,829
Why the army hate me
to do this shit to me?

453
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,732
Huh?

454
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,167
roger, sometimes I think
you're so naive.

455
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,371
I mean, it really isn't
such a bad thing after all.

456
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:09,907
Is it, billy?

457
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,208
How would I know?

458
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:14,310
Oh, go fuck yourself!

459
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:16,179
Can I think of you as I do?

460
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,248
God damn it, that's it! It!

461
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:19,816
Now, I'm gonna level
with you, rich!

462
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,084
You're gonna hear
what I'm saying

463
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,853
And not what you think
I'm saying?

464
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,621
Don't get cute.
Don't turn away cute.

465
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:27,157
I wanna say something straight
at you, and I want you to hear it.

466
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,892
This is level, rich.

467
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,494
This is straight talk.
No bs, no tricks.

468
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:34,164
What you do on the side, that's your
business, and I don't care about it.

469
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,934
But if you don't cut this cute shit
with me, I'm gonna turn you off.

470
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,269
You understand? You ain't gonna
get a "good morning" out of me.

471
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,471
'cause it's getting
bad around here, rich.

472
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:42,739
I know how you think,

473
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,008
How you keep looking out at me
and seeing yourself.

474
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,477
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
because that's all that's happening.

475
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,780
That's all there is to it
when you look out at me

476
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,182
And think there's some kind of
approval or whatever you see in my eyes.

477
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,283
You're just seeing yourself.

478
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,124
How else do you
want me to be?

479
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,460
That ain't any part
of it, rich.

480
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:10,567
I don't come from the same
kind of world as you do.

481
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,470
damn, richie. You think roger
and I came off the same street?

482
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,504
Bullshit.

483
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:16,306
All right. Okay.

484
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,277
I've just done
what I wanted to all my life.

485
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,380
If I wanted to do something,
I just did it, really.

486
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:27,684
I've never had to work
or anything like that.

487
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,486
I've always
had nice clothing,

488
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,421
Money for cab fare,

489
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,890
Money for whatever
I wanted, really.

490
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,926
I'm just not like you are.

491
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,795
But you ain't really
done that stuff.

492
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,498
What?

493
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,299
That fag stuff.

494
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,364
how long you think we got?

495
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,899
Before what?

496
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,734
They ship us out, man.

497
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:20,103
What, to the war?

498
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:23,473
To disneyland, baby?

499
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:27,044
shit. I don't know.

500
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,046
That's up
to them ibms, man.

501
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,247
Machines running this shit.

502
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,685
Maybe next week.

503
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,289
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe never.

504
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,290
You know, I was reading

505
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,892
They're planning
to build it up

506
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,594
To over 500,000 men
over there-

507
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:47,497
Americans- and that they're
gonna leave it that way

508
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,365
Until we can win it.

509
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:53,303
It'd be a great place
to come back from.

510
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,238
I keep thinking
about that, you know?

511
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,240
To have gone there,
to have been there,

512
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,242
And seen it, and lived.

513
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,816
I don't know what I think
about this war.

514
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,384
I tell you, I've been
doing a lot of reading,

515
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,053
And I think
it's right we go.

516
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:11,988
I mean, it's just like

517
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:13,690
When north korea
invaded south korea,

518
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:17,160
Or when hitler invaded poland
and all them other countries.

519
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:18,361
He just kept
testing everybody,

520
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,263
And when nobody
stood up against him

521
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:21,798
And tried to stop him,

522
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,167
He got so committed
that he couldn't back out.

523
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:26,336
And that's what I figure
this ho chi minh is doing

524
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,537
And all them other communists.

525
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:28,772
If we let them know

526
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,140
Somebody's gonna
stand up against them,

527
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,109
They'll back out
just like hitler would've.

528
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,576
Yeah, well, you know,
there's people saying

529
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:37,347
That l.B.J. Is a hitler,
not a ho chi minh at all.

530
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,682
well, I don't know
anything about all that.

531
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:41,351
But what I do know
is I'm certain

532
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,987
I don't want to go there,
no matter what is going on.

533
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,388
I mean, those viet cong,

534
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:47,290
They don't just shoot you
and blow you up, you know.

535
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,659
They got these other
horrible things they do,

536
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,628
Like these caves
that they hide in.

537
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,864
Like, you know, you go
inside- you follow them inside-

538
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,032
And they have these snakes
that they've tied

539
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,634
From their tails
to the ceiling.

540
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,070
And you go in after them.
It's dark,

541
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,304
And the snake is furious

542
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:03,039
From having been tied
by its tail.

543
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,675
And you crawl
right into the snake.

544
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:07,911
They do not.

545
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,313
That's awful, richie.

546
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:12,482
That's probably the most
disgusting thing I ever heard of.

547
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:15,451
I mean, I don't
want to go anyplace

548
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:16,853
Where that kind
of shit is going on.

549
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:20,390
I mean,
old l.B.J. Is hitler.

550
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,993
Suddenly, I see it all
very clearly.

551
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,195
I mean, any person who would
hang a snake by its tail

552
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,030
In the hope
that some other person

553
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,665
Might crawl into it
and get bitten to death-

554
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,334
That first person is somebody
who ought to be shot.

555
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:33,970
And I hope the 500,000 other
soldiers that get shipped over there

556
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,305
Kill them all-
all them gooks-

557
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,573
Get them driven back into
germany where they belong.

558
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,984
¶ beautiful dreamer ¶

559
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:51,254
Hey, richie, you want a shot
of some beam, man? Oh, yeah.

560
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:53,389
I want a shot
of some beam, man.

561
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,427
Why didn't you ask me if I want a
shot? All right. It's in my locker.

562
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,063
Oh.

563
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,333
Oh, man, not that locker.
The liquor locker.

564
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:09,405
sons of bitches, man.
That ain't funny!

565
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:13,210
What you laughing at?
Fucking dicks, man.

566
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:41,838
Look at him at attention.

567
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,542
How come you all take
this stuff so seriously?

568
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:47,710
what?

569
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,645
this army nonsense.

570
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:51,481
I mean, you're always
polishing your brass,

571
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,049
Keeping
your footlocker neat.

572
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,251
Your locker's so neat.

573
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,785
I mean, there isn't
any point to it.

574
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:57,420
well, we're here, ain't we?

575
00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:58,821
I mean, we're in the army.

576
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:00,924
Rules, rich.
Me and rog obey the rules.

577
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,458
You probably
don't understand rules.

578
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:03,659
Yeah, that's right.

579
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,895
It just so happens
that me and billy

580
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,662
Agree on a lot of things, man.

581
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,065
I mean, the army
ought to be serious,

582
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:11,534
Even though
it sometimes ain't.

583
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:15,338
Am I right?
that's right, brother.

584
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:17,640
you're lucky, you know,

585
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,742
The two of you having each
other for friends the way you do.

586
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,681
I never had a friend
like that...Ever,

587
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,317
Not even when I was little.

588
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,532
there ain't been no
soldiers in this camp but me.

589
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,801
oh, boy.
guess who.

590
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:48,538
I've been the only one.
I've been the only me.

591
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,106
Fucking rooney.

592
00:31:56,013 --> 00:32:01,384
For so long, I've been
the only goddamn one.

593
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:08,258
Haah!
Haah!

594
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,330
what kind of platoon
I got here?

595
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,565
You bunch of shit sacks.

596
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,800
Everybody look sharp!
Up and armed!

597
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:19,602
Up and armed!

598
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:20,937
Hey, what's happening,
sarge?

599
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,206
shut up, hicks.
Want a belt?

600
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,241
How can I say no?

601
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,777
My name is cokes.

602
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:30,380
How about me, too?

603
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,349
You wait your turn.

604
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,219
Don't you see what I got here?

605
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,057
Everybody, ten-hut!

606
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:50,166
This here is my friend,

607
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:55,005
Who in addition
just came back from the war.

608
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:01,244
This man's a fucking hero.

609
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,580
He's always been
a fucking hero.

610
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,349
Aww.

611
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,583
Show him your boots.

612
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,286
Cokesy, show them-
show them your jungle boots.

613
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:13,456
Look at that boot!

614
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:15,591
Get over here
and look at that boot!

615
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:17,193
Move! You, too, douglas.

616
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,133
That ain't no
regular goddamn army boot.

617
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,636
That is a goddamn
jungle boot.

618
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:31,774
That green canvas is a jungle
boot because of the heat,

619
00:33:31,775 --> 00:33:33,643
And them
- look at them little holes in the bottom.

620
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:34,977
You see that?

621
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:38,481
That is air for when you've
been walking in water,

622
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:41,651
Like a lot of water,
like maybe in a jungle swamp.

623
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,421
The army
ain't no goddamn fool.

624
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:49,526
You see a man wearing
a pair of boots like that,

625
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,327
You know he been to the war,

626
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:54,797
And you might as well see
he got a chest full of medals!

627
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,167
He ain't going to have
no boots like that

628
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,537
If he ain't been to the war,
which is where I'm going,

629
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,374
And all you slap-happy
motherfuckers are going, too.

630
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,610
Got to go kill some gooks!
That's right.

631
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:09,745
Going to piss on them.

632
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:13,849
Old booze. That's what I did,
piss in the rivers.

633
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,420
Goddamn g.I.'s secret weapon!

634
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:21,824
Old booze, and he's pissing it
in all their running water.

635
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:23,359
Makes them yellow!

636
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:41,144
Me and cokes have been in so much
shit together, we ought to be brown.

637
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,646
Don't take no offense
to that, hicks.

638
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:48,851
We've been swimming in it,
101st airborne together.

639
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:53,156
101 screaming
goddamn eagles!

640
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,759
Aah!
Aah!

641
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,197
This ain't the army.
You punks ain't in the army.

642
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:03,433
You ain't even seen the army.

643
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,370
The army is airborne!
Airborne all the way!

644
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,772
Airborne! Airborne, all the-
sergeant. Sergeant!

645
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:12,208
Can I have a drink, too?

646
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,845
What?
He's kidding me.

647
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:18,248
Ain't you? You've got
to be kidding me.

648
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,517
Ain't he kidding me?
Hicks?

649
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,252
Uh-huh. He's kidding me there, cokesy.

650
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,786
don't you know

651
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,689
You're trying to take
the booze out of the hand

652
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,325
Of the next goddamn

653
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:33,729
Congressional water
medal winner award?

654
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,205
Old rooney.

655
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:46,008
Old rooney-
he almost done it already.

656
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:50,280
You think we ought to show
these shit sacks

657
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,048
How men are men
jumping out of planes?

658
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,650
Yeah. Hold this.

659
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,718
Don't drink it!

660
00:35:57,454 --> 00:36:00,723
a plane full of screaming,
stomping men!

661
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:09,098
Stand up!

662
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,568
Hook up!

663
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,804
Check static line!

664
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,440
Check equipment!

665
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,609
Sound off!
Equipment check!

666
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,611
Check!
Check!

667
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,781
Stand in the door!
Stand in the door!

668
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:28,484
Jump!
Jump!

669
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:32,255
Geronimo!

670
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,213
What a feeling.

671
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:06,822
Beautiful feeling.

672
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:17,199
You remember that one guy-
o'flannigan?

673
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,569
o'flannigan.

674
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,274
Ah! He was this one guy,
o'flannigan.

675
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,644
We was testing these chutes

676
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,012
Where you could just pull
a lever by your ribs here

677
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:31,281
When you hit the ground, see,

678
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,616
And the chute
will come off you.

679
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:35,518
Because it was after-

680
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,289
After a whole bunch of guys
had been dragged to death

681
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,857
In an unexpected and terrible
wind at fort bragg.

682
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:44,360
And they wanted you to be
able to release the chute

683
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:46,896
When you hit- if there was
a bad wind when you hit.

684
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:50,566
So o'flannigan-

685
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,170
He was this kind of joker

686
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,206
Who had the goddamn sense
of humor of a clown

687
00:37:57,207 --> 00:38:03,078
And nerves, I tell you,
of steel.

688
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,116
And he says he's going
to release the lever mid-air

689
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:13,122
And reach up and grab the lines
and float on down hanging.

690
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,758
I seen him pull
the lever at 500 feet,

691
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,761
And he reaches up
to two fistfuls of air.

692
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,297
The chute's
20 feet above him.

693
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,901
He went into the ground
like a knife.

694
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:26,836
jesus.

695
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:32,141
Didn't get to sing the song,
I'll bet.

696
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:34,410
What song is that,
sergeant rooney?

697
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,312
Shit sack, shit sack!

698
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:37,647
What song?

699
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:42,084
"beautiful streamer,"
shit sack.

700
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:44,153
There was this one guy

701
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:47,657
With his chute going up
above him in a streamer,

702
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,625
Like a tulip-

703
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,794
Only white, you know,

704
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:55,798
All twisted,
never going to open.

705
00:38:55,799 --> 00:39:00,269
Like a big icicle sticking up
right up above him.

706
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,805
He went right by me.

707
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:05,708
We met eyes, sort of.

708
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:09,345
He was looking real puzzled.

709
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,649
And he- he looks right at me

710
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,819
And then up in the air
at the chute

711
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,422
And down at the ground.

712
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,894
Was he singing it?

713
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:28,197
No, he didn't sing it.

714
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:29,965
He was going like this,

715
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:32,568
Like he was going
to climb right up the air.

716
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:40,843
Cokes gets
the silver star in korea

717
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:44,046
For rolling a barrel
of oil down a hill

718
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,349
Into 47 chinky-dinky
chinese gooks

719
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,051
Who were climbing
up the hill,

720
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,253
And when he shot into it
with his machine gun,

721
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:53,355
It blew them all
to grape jelly.

722
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,591
¶ beautiful streamer ¶

723
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,661
¶ open for me ¶

724
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:02,698
But the one I remember

725
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,569
Is this little guy
in a spider hole,

726
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,640
Which is a hole in the ground
with a lid on it,

727
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,476
And he shot me in the ass
as I was running by.

728
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:18,648
A bullet knocked me so hard,
it knocked me into a ditch.

729
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,950
I got crawling behind him.

730
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:25,120
Crawling, crawling behind him.

731
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:28,491
I threw a grenade
into his hole,

732
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,859
And then I sat on the lid.

733
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:35,865
I could feel him bouncing
and yelling under me.

734
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,767
Bouncing and yelling
under the lid.

735
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:42,805
I could hear him.
I could feel him.

736
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:44,640
I just sat there.

737
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:49,812
I bet he was singing it.

738
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:54,984
I think so.

739
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,620
You think we ought
to let them hear it?

740
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,662
I don't care who hears it.
I just want to be singing it.

741
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,431
all right, you listen up.

742
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:11,934
You better be listening good.

743
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:15,605
This is a song a man sings-

744
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,173
He's going down through the
air, his chute don't open.

Easy, coke.

768
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,002
I've been doing that.
Don't mean nothing.

769
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,870
No.

770
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,939
I told him when they
wanted to send me back,

771
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,708
I ain't got no leukemia.

772
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,843
They want to check it.

773
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,145
They think I got it.

774
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:05,014
No.
I don't think I got it.

775

No.
Rooney.

776
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:11,587
Rooney, my mother had it.

777
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:15,390
She had it.

778
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:19,729
Just as she had it,
I've been falling down.

779
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,063
That don't mean nothing.

780
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:23,365
I've been falling down
because I'm drunk.

781
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:25,434
I'm drunk all the time.

782
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:28,070
All I know is

783
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:31,507
You and me are going back
over there together.

784
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,442
Cokey, that's all I know.

785
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:40,082
Me and cokes are going back to
the war zone where we belong.

786
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,084
Gonna blow it to shit.

787
00:43:42,085 --> 00:43:45,254
You better be reading
the papers.

788
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:50,159
Cokes and rooney
doing daring, brave deeds

789
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,227
Because we're old hands at it,

790
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:54,196
Making shit disappear.

791
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:56,832
Goddamn whoosh!
Whoosh!

792
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:57,833
Them noises-

793
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,936
That's what me and-
me and co-

794
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:03,039
No, no, no, no.

795
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,640
Well, you're cool
with the dynamite.

796
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:05,941
That's what you're trying
to say, right?

797
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,277
Shut the fuck up.
That's what you can do.

798
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,379
And go to goddamn bed.

799
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,115
just go to sleep
is what you can do

800
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:17,053
Because me and rooney, we
fought it for two wars already,

801
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,587
And we're going to make it
through this one,

802
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:20,355
And leukemia that comes
or doesn't come-

803
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:21,490
Who gives a shit?

804
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:22,792
Not guys like us.

805
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:36,772
We're going
just as pretty as pie.

806
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,207
It's lights-out time,
ain't it, rooney?

807
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,809
christ to god damn it.

808
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,544
Just flick out the old light,
sarge. That's what we say.

809
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,514
yeah, do it. shut up! That's an order!

810
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,337
Well, lordy have mercy,
if that ain't a pair.

811
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,840
if that ain't a pair.

812
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,246
they're something,
ain't they?

813
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,181
yeah, too much.

814
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,184
what time is it?

815
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:23,252
sleep time, man.

816
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:49,444
richie.

817
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:53,415
Richie.

818
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,383
Hmm?

819
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,453
Hey, man, you ain't really
into that stuff, are you, man?

820
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:03,025
What stuff is that, roger?

821
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,794
Man, that fag stuff.

822
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,673
You just got caught up
with the wrong group, man.

823
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,574
That's what I think happened.

824
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:20,676
Am I right?

825
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:24,513
You got caught
with a bad bunch.

826
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:26,882
That's what happened, man,
and it happens.

827
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:29,451
Hey, I bet
you never had a chance

828
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:31,486
To really run
with the boys, right?

829
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:35,624
No, man, I'm talking about really
normal guys like me and billy.

830
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:44,633
Man, do some pushups
or something, man.

831
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,668
It'll straighten you out.

832
00:46:46,669 --> 00:46:49,604
I know that thing, man.
That I know.

833
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,474
Works.

834
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,145
Rog.

835
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,214
Hmm?

836
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,049
had a buddy, you know,

837
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,651
This kid I grew up with,

838
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:05,420
Played ball with him
in high school.

839
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:07,656
He was a real bad man
sometimes, you know?

840
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:11,526
Used to have gangster pictures
up in his room.

841
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:13,495
Anyway, we got into this deal

842
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:15,731
Where we'd drive on down
to the big city, man,

843
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,300
You know,
hit some bad spots,

844
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:20,269
Let some queer pick us up

845
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,073
Long enough to let him
buy us some good stuff.

846
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:27,609
And pretty soon they'd ask us,

847
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,811
Do we want to go
over to their place, you know?

848
00:47:29,812 --> 00:47:33,215
"sure," we'd say,
and order up one more drink.

849
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:35,784
Then when we hit the street,
we'd tell them to kiss off,

850
00:47:35,785 --> 00:47:37,786
Call them a fag and a queer
and jazz like that

851
00:47:37,787 --> 00:47:39,421
And tell them to kiss off.

852
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:42,691
That kind of jazz went on and
on for sort of a long time,

853
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:46,495
And it was a good deal if you were
low on cash and needed a laugh.

854
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,463
It went on for a while.

855
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:51,934
Then one day frank
comes up to me and he says,

856
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,336
"going home with the guys,
but-"

857
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:57,672
He said,
why don't I tag along?

858
00:47:57,673 --> 00:47:58,908
"what the hell?" he says.

859
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,543
What does it matter
who does it to you?

860
00:48:01,544 --> 00:48:04,479
Some guy or some old broad, you
close your eyes, a mouth's a mouth.

861
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,018
It don't matter.
Know what I'm saying?

862
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,386
Tried to talk him out of it,

863
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,922
But he wasn't hearing
anything I was saying.

864
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,189
He had this nice little girl

865
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,758
He was going out with
at the time.

866
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:19,628
You know the way a real bad cat
can sometimes do that,

867
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:21,997
Have a nice little girl
who's crazy about him

868
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:24,566
And he is for her, too, and he's a
different cat when he's around her?

869
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,368
uh-huh.

870
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:30,572
yeah.
That was him and linda.

871
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:33,943
Then one day he just
dropped her, let her loose.

872
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,712
He was hooked.

873
00:48:37,713 --> 00:48:41,150
He was into it
with no way he knew out.

874
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,318
damn.

875
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,555
You understand
what I'm saying?

876
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:50,859
He was hooked.
Never thought he would.

877
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,028
Then one day he just woke up,
and he was on it.

878
00:48:58,768 --> 00:48:59,835
Rich.

879
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:03,672
Man, do you hear
what he's saying, man?

880
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,010
He's a storyteller.
What?

881
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:13,648
I mean he's a storyteller.
He tells stories all right.

882
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:14,950
what are we into now?

883
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:19,989
Huh?

884
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,265
Who's that?

885
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:35,204
what's happening?

886
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:39,508
Who's that?

887
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:43,612
damn, brother.

888
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:46,781
What, are you attacking
or retreating?

889
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:57,326
you all
don't give a fuck, man,

890
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,595
Because you got it made.

891
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:02,498
You got friends...

892
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,503
People to talk to,

893
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,171
And I ain't got nothing.

894
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,944
I ain't got shit.

895
00:50:15,945 --> 00:50:17,646
You got your job.

896
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:20,782
Yeah.

897
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:23,352
You got jobs so motherfucking
important, man,

898
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,986
They probably ain't never
going to ship you out,

899
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:29,324
You got jobs
so fucking important.

900
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,660
I ain't got no fucking job.

901
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:36,932
Ain't nobody will give me
a fucking job, man!

902
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:42,071
They gonna kill me.

903
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,506
They gonna send
my fucking ass out there

904
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:46,241
To fucking vietnam
and kill me.

905
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:51,680
God damn it, man. Damn it.

906
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:53,848
hey, man, what you doing?

907
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:55,517
Hey, man,
what you doing, man?

908
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:02,458
Say, brother, what you doing on
my freshly mopped floor, my man?

909
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,093
sorry, man.

910
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:07,129
I'll go-

911
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,698
I'll go to sleep.
Okay, man?

912
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,301
It's all right?
Yeah, man.

913
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,036
Hey, look, why don't you go
where your bed is at, man?

914
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:17,239
Don't you like beds?

915
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:22,144
I can't find it, man.

916
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:24,913
Come on, man.

917
00:51:26,382 --> 00:51:28,883
Oh, goddamn
motherfucking man,

918
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:31,853
I looked all over this motherfuck
- I can't find it.

919
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:34,022
Well, just get one
of them beds, man.

920
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:35,790
Sleep in one
of these beds, man.

921
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:37,058
We got beds here.

922
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:41,696
I can't find my own bed,
god damn, not anywhere.

923
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:43,031
Lay down on this,
man.

924
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,769
Guy's hurtin', rog.

925
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,571
yeah, I know.

926
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:06,288
I had such a sweet time,
you know.

927
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:10,459
It's so pretty, man.
It's so fucking pretty, man.

928
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,464
They going dancing and shit,
make you want to fucking cry.

929
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,299
Make you want to cry, bro.

930
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:21,336
So sweet, though.

931
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:25,407
Why I got to be here?

932
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,276
Why I got to be here, bro?
I don't know, jim.

933
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,480
I know why he's
got to be here, rog.

934
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,581
Jive, man.

935
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,550
Well, I know.
Why don't you ask me?

936
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:38,220
All right, you tell me. Why the
fuck does he have to be here?

937
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:43,158
Freedom's frontier, man.
That's why.

938
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,693
Freedom's frontier.

939
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:53,202
What are you doing?

940
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,604
Why do you always got to be
doing that shit, man?

941
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:02,877
you don't know why he's doing it. Do you?

942
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:05,880
it's our dances.

943
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,918
<i>¶</i>

944
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,631
<i>¶ I remember yesterday ¶</i>

945
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:26,535
<i>¶ it doesn't seem
so far away ¶</i>

946
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:30,439
<i>¶ the crazy things
we used to do ¶</i>

947
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,642
<i>¶ I can still remember ¶</i>

948
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:37,178
<i>¶ all the boys
on Friday night ¶</i>

949
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:40,515
<i>¶ we had to keep them
out of sight ¶</i>

950
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:43,918
<i>¶ so we could have
our secret ¶</i>

951
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:47,256
<i>¶ rendezvous ¶</i>

952
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,957
<i>¶ I remember the danger ¶</i>

953
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,525
<i>¶ I remember the sign ¶</i>

954
00:53:50,526 --> 00:53:52,561
<i>¶ we were flashing
the lights ¶</i>

955
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,763
<i>¶ 'cause we were ready ¶</i>

956
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:58,133
<i>¶ we were ready
for the boys ¶</i>

957
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,502
Rog, you think I'm a busybody?

958
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:03,338
Hey, man, I think
we should play some ball.

959
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:05,206
That's what I think.

960
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:07,876
Yeah. I just don't feel
like it.

961
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,279
I don't know what it is. I'm
feeling sick-like. I don't know why.

962
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,848
Be good for you.
Yo. Come on, man.

963
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:16,117
I mean, like, a lot of people
thought I didn't know

964
00:54:16,118 --> 00:54:18,320
How to behave in a simple way
back home, you know?

965
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,921
That I overcomplicated
everything?

966
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,890
I didn't think so.

967
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,858
I just thought I was seeing
complications that were there

968
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:25,960
But nobody else saw.

969
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:27,729
Wisconsin's
a funny place, man.

970
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,165
All them clear-eyed people
looking at you,

971
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,134
Saying "hello"
and "how are you?"

972
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:35,304
Then all of a sudden, some
neighbor goes mad as a hatter.

973
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,838
Yeah, well, man, I'm going
to be madder than that

974
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,507
If you don't hurry up

975
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,575
And start shooting
this rock, man. Come on.

976
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:43,612
This one time,
I had this neighbor.

977
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,046
One morning
he comes out of his house,

978
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:46,715
And he's got axes
in both of his hands,

979
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,116
And he starts attacking
all the cars

980
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:51,886
That are driving up and down
in front of his house.

981
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:53,822
Made me want to be a priest.

982
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,924
I was 16, man.

983
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,726
Priests could help people,
you know?

984
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:58,993
Thought I wanted that.

985
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:07,202
Same game,
another buck.

986
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:10,939
Think that's mine.
You owe me 20.

987
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,107
There you go.

988
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:14,676
<i>¶ boys in the attic ¶</i>

989
00:55:14,677 --> 00:55:16,044
<i>¶ boys ¶</i>

990
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,314
<i>¶ oh, yeah ¶</i>

991
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,585
come on, man.

992
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,691
Can't fucking do it.
It ain't my game.

993
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:31,960
I mean, like that bar
we go to, you know?

994
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,329
Think I can get a job there
bartending, maybe?

995
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,365
you don't want
a fucking job.

996
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,667
It's that black girl, the
waitress, you really want.

997
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,235
no, man, not really.

998
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,170
Hey, come on, man.
She's cute. I'd fuck her.

999
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:46,941
I mean, not the way
you're saying is all.

1000
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:48,777
damn! Sure, there's something about her.

1001
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,545
I don't know what. I ain't
even spoke to her yet.

1002
00:55:50,546 --> 00:55:53,515
I mean, when she's doing it,
when she's dancing.

1003
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,983
ow!

1004
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,920
Sometimes I think she's-
she's degrading herself.

1005
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:00,321
You think she is?
Thanks a lot.

1006
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:02,156
Man, you don't even
know that bitch.

1007
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:04,626
She's working.
I'd like to talk to her.

1008
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,562
Tell her stuff, that she's
cute, and she's got a nice ass.

1009
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:08,930
I'd drive her to brooklyn.

1010
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:10,532
I think she's smart, too.

1011
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,603
Hey, martin,
how you doing, man?

1012
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,204
Hey, martin.
Looking pretty good.

1013
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,601
you make a basket?

1014
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,235
Remember when we met
in p company,

1015
00:57:21,236 --> 00:57:24,072
Both of us brand new, you
started talking to me and stuff?

1016
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,807
Yeah.

1017
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:27,075
Did you see something in me

1018
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,743
That made you want
to talk to me?

1019
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:31,045
Man, I was talking
to everybody

1020
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:33,214
The whole day, man-
two whole days.

1021
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,520
Just the first person
to talk back is all.

1022
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,021
The first white person,
you mean?

1023
00:57:56,572 --> 00:57:58,206
Anybody here, man?

1024
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:03,612
Hi, carlyle.
How are you feeling?

1025
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,214
Fine, man.

1026
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:08,282
Where- where's my man, man?
He ain't here?

1027
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:09,618
Nobody here?

1028
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,185
Who do you want?

1029
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:12,521
Where's, uh-

1030
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,492
Where's the black boy?

1031
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,027
Roger?

1032
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:20,395
God, why do you
keep calling him that?

1033
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,596
Don't you even know
his name yet?

1034
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:22,898
His name is roger.

1035
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,699
Ro-ger.

1036
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,201
Yeah.

1037
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:28,970
Where's he at?

1038
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:30,505
I'm not his keeper, you know.

1039
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:32,140
I'm not his private secretary,
you know.

1040
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,711
no.

1041
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:39,180
No, I don't know, okay?

1042
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:48,322
I mean, uh-

1043
00:58:48,323 --> 00:58:52,928
Old carlyle made a fool out of
himself, you know, the other night,

1044
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,863
Coming here talking
on and on and shit,

1045
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,299
Crying and shit, laying
on the floor like he did.

1046
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,668
Remember that?
Yeah.

1047
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:03,304
Yeah, you remember that?

1048
00:59:03,305 --> 00:59:05,506
That's all one night,
man, okay?

1049
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:08,176
That ain't the real carlyle
who's in here, okay?

1050
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,545
This here the real carlyle.

1051
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,050
Who the real richie?

1052
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:18,453
The real richie has gone
home to manhattan.

1053
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,254
I, however, am about
to read this book.

1054
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,695
there's a chill in here.

1055
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,930
It comes down from the hall.

1056
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:33,534
Think I am getting
a little cold.

1057
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,376
Listen, do you want
a cigarette?

1058
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,481
Oh, don't you smoke?

1059
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:51,252
Do you have to go right now?

1060
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,195
See, I been looking at you
real close, man,

1061
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,568
It's just a way I got about me.

1062
01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:09,403
And I bet

1063
01:00:09,404 --> 01:00:13,875
If I was to hang my boy
at you-

1064
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:17,278
My big boy, man-

1065
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:19,948
You'll start
wanting to touch it.

1066
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:27,221
Yeah, you'd be begging and
talking real sweet to old carlyle.

1067
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:30,058
Am I right or wrong?

1068
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,893
What do you say?

1069
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,061
Pardon?

1070
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,295
You heard me.

1071
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:40,234
Hey, richie,
richie, richie, richie,

1072
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:44,238
How long you been a punk?

1073
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:47,075
How long you been
a punk, rich?

1074
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,577
Can you hear me?

1075
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:51,612
Am I clear?

1076
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:55,249
Or do I talk funny?

1077
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,688
Can you smell the gin
on my mouth?

1078
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,690
If you really did come here
looking for roger,

1079
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,692
He and billy are right out
there playing basketball.

1080
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,161
Or there's a poker game
going on

1081
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,429
At the end of the barracks
if you want to join them.

1082
01:01:10,866 --> 01:01:14,202
I got no athletic abilities.

1083
01:01:15,871 --> 01:01:19,540
No moves, man, you know?

1084
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:21,109
I got none, man.

1085
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:24,145
Hey, richie.

1086
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:26,881
I got this question
I asked you, man.

1087
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:28,583
I got no answer.

1088
01:01:32,487 --> 01:01:35,056
"how long you been a punk?"
is the question I asked you.

1089
01:01:37,893 --> 01:01:39,227
Can I get a reply?

1090
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,229
Not to that question.

1091
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,297
Well, who do
if you don't, huh?

1092
01:01:43,298 --> 01:01:46,400
I mean, hey, baby,
how am I going to know if-

1093
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:51,072
Oh, listen. Don't you
want to talk to me?

1094
01:01:51,073 --> 01:01:53,908
Don't you want to talk
to old carlyle?

1095
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:55,576
Not at the moment.

1096
01:01:55,577 --> 01:01:57,678
Well, I want
to talk to you, man.

1097
01:01:57,679 --> 01:01:59,680
Play ball, man.

1098
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:00,849
Fuck you, man.

1099
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,517
When's the last time
you had kp, huh?

1100
01:02:03,518 --> 01:02:07,188
When's the last time
you pulled kp, huh?

1101
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:09,523
I'm e.D.

1102
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:10,859
You're what?

1103
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,862
E.D.? E.D., huh?

1104
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,030
Ain't fucking asked you what
your friends call you, man.

1105
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:18,699
I asked you when's
the last time you had kp.

1106
01:02:21,203 --> 01:02:24,873
E.D. Is exempt from duty.

1107
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,540
What?

1108
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,542
You ain't got no duties?

1109
01:02:28,543 --> 01:02:30,544
What the shit are you
talking about, huh?

1110
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:32,881
Man, what the fuck
you talking about, man?

1111
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,549
Everybody in the army
got duties, man.

1112
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,218
If you ain't got
no goddamn duties, man,

1113
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:38,552
Who got them, huh? Me?

1114
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:41,222
Carlyle, it's just
because of my job.

1115
01:02:41,223 --> 01:02:44,558
I have a very special job.

1116
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,228
And my friends
don't call me e.D.

1117
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:48,830
They call me irie.

1118
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:55,103
so what you're saying

1119
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,272
Is that you kissed ass
with somebody, right?

1120
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,310
How come you talk so much?

1121
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:05,847
Goddamn fucking
little fuck-face queer.

1122
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,282
Carlyle,
what is wrong with you?

1123
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,517
You, man.
You're fucking ugly.

1124
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:10,852
You got a nice mouth.

1125
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,854
Oh, yeah. Got a nice mouth?

1126
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,122
You got
a fucking weird mouth,

1127
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,192
And you like to fucking
suck joints, man, huh?

1128
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:20,195
Hey, what? You're just going
to run away from me, man?

1129
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,530
You come back now,
you hear?

1130
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:24,765
You'd best.

1131
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:28,402
You come on back, richie,
and I'll tell you a good story.

1132
01:03:28,403 --> 01:03:33,241
Make you laugh
and make you cry, baby.

1133
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,009
That's right.

1134
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:39,814
Fuck you, man. I don't
want to play no more.

1135
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:43,517
Yeah.

1136
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:51,259
mm.

1137
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,527
Hey, what's happening, baby?

1138
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:58,166
Where's richie? What
are you doing on his bed?

1139
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,868
Taking up space.

1140
01:04:01,503 --> 01:04:03,004
hey, man.

1141
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,840
You know, they send me over
to that vietnam and shit, man,

1142
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:07,208
I'll be cool, you know?

1143
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,844
Know why?

1144
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:11,679
'cause I've been dodging
bullets and shit, man,

1145
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,482
Ever since I was old enough
to get on pussy

1146
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,351
And make it happy to know me.

1147
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,588
I'll get old, baby.

1148
01:04:20,589 --> 01:04:22,656
I could do my job.

1149
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,528
I was just laying here,
you know, thinking that,

1150
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,864
And you come in,
and out it came.

1151
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:34,035
Words to say my feelings.

1152
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,803
That's my problem.

1153
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:38,706
Maybe that's the black man's
problem altogether.

1154
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:40,141
You ever consider that?

1155
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,211
Too much feeling.

1156
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,646
I mean, it's like
he too close to everything.

1157
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:51,552
You know, too close
to his body, his blood.

1158
01:04:51,553 --> 01:04:54,055
Man, it ain't like he got
no good mind or nothing.

1159
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,891
It's just that he
believes in his body.

1160
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:02,063
Hey, richie the only punk
in here, or is there more?

1161
01:05:03,498 --> 01:05:07,835
Punk, man.
Is he the only punk?

1162
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:09,337
He's all right.

1163
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,506
Hey, man, I ain't asked you
about the quality of his talent.

1164
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:14,642
Is he the only punk
is what I'm asking.

1165
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:16,344
You get orders yet?

1166
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,845
For what?

1167
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:21,182
Tell you where you work,
idiot.

1168
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,683
I'm p company, all right?

1169
01:05:22,684 --> 01:05:24,018
I do kp.

1170
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:27,155
That's all, all right?
Don't deserve no more.

1171
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,691
You know, I been in this army
for three months and ten days,

1172
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:33,527
And everybody is still
doing the same shit,

1173
01:05:33,528 --> 01:05:35,196
Saying the same shit,

1174
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,532
Wearing the same shitty-assed
green clothes.

1175
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:40,034
I ain't been happy
one day, mister,

1176
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:43,871
And that's a lot of misery
back to back in this old boy.

1177
01:05:43,872 --> 01:05:46,540
Hey, richie a good punk,
right?

1178
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,176
He take care
of you and roger, right?

1179
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:50,878
That's how come all three
of y'all are snuggled up

1180
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:52,546
In the corner of this room
like that, huh?

1181
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:54,215
what?

1182
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:57,685
Richie. You and roger
hitting on richie, right?

1183
01:05:57,686 --> 01:05:59,820
He's not a queer,
if that's what you're saying.

1184
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:01,289
Maybe a little bit effeminate,

1185
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,024
But that's all, if that's
what you're saying.

1186
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,492
I'd like to get
some of him myself

1187
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,060
If he's a good punk
is what I'm saying.

1188
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:08,496
That's what I'm saying.

1189
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,164
Damn, man, ain't you got
no fucking understanding

1190
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:11,832
Of how a man could be
a little diplomatic

1191
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,501
About what he's saying,
sort of sideways? Shit.

1192
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:16,004
We don't do that stuff.
What stuff?

1193
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,006
Listen, I don't feel too good.
If you don't mind-

1194
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,573
What stuff, billy boy?

1195
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:22,176
What stuff?

1196
01:06:22,177 --> 01:06:23,177
What you're thinking.

1197
01:06:23,178 --> 01:06:25,846
What am I thinking?

1198
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:27,181
You know what you're thinking.

1199
01:06:27,182 --> 01:06:29,850
Yeah, I know. I know
because it's in my head, man,

1200
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:32,353
But how the fuck
do you know, huh?

1201
01:06:32,354 --> 01:06:35,756
Hey, I can see
your heart, billy boy,

1202
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:38,359
But you can't see mine.

1203
01:06:41,696 --> 01:06:43,864
You just talk fast
and keep moving, don't you?

1204
01:06:43,865 --> 01:06:45,133
You don't ever stay still.

1205
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,867
Words to say
my feelings, billy boy.

1206
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:49,303
Words to say my feelings.

1207
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:55,143
Hey, there he is.
There he be. Thar she blows.

1208
01:06:57,379 --> 01:07:00,814
He's one of them who hasn't come far down
out of the trees yet, billy. Believe me.

1209
01:07:00,815 --> 01:07:01,815
Oh, richie, richie.

1210
01:07:01,816 --> 01:07:04,818
You got rudeness
in your voice.

1211
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:07,488
You got meanness
for old carlyle.

1212
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:09,490
You trying to say
I ought to leave?

1213
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:11,692
You don't want me here?

1214
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:14,795
You came in here looking for
roger, who isn't here, right?

1215
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:16,997
Man, you must have
important matters

1216
01:07:16,998 --> 01:07:18,832
To take care of
all over the quad.

1217
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,768
I can't imagine a man like you

1218
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:22,836
Not having extremely
important things to do

1219
01:07:22,837 --> 01:07:25,506
All over the world,
as a matter of fact, carlyle.

1220
01:07:27,842 --> 01:07:30,844
Hey, man, don't mind all
that shit I say, all right?

1221
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:34,482
I just talk bad, okay?
I don't do bad.

1222
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:38,018
I'm just so bored
and restless, you know?

1223
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:40,854
Taking it out on you all,
too, you know?

1224
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:42,090
I mean, I know richie here

1225
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,524
Ain't really no punk,
you know?

1226
01:07:43,525 --> 01:07:45,326
Not really.

1227
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:48,596
Just jiving, you know.
Entertaining my own self.

1228
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:55,203
Y'all don't take me
serious, okay?

1229
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,304
Not ever.

1230
01:07:58,873 --> 01:08:00,641
Okay, I'm going to be
cutting out, all right?

1231
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:01,909
You all be cool.

1232
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,979
Man don't do the jive,

1233
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,248
And he the one getting
jived, you know?

1234
01:08:08,883 --> 01:08:10,050
That's what
my little brother mel

1235
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:11,119
Used to tell me
all the time.

1236
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,088
Easy, y'all.

1237
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,161
Hey, baby. Y'all playing
with 51 cards, man.

1238
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,096
The red queen is down there.

1239
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,166
Oh, my man. What's happening, baby?

1240
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,101
What's happening?

1241
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,671
Man, I am going to have to
move myself out of here

1242
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:33,841
If roger decides to adopt
that son of a bitch.

1243
01:08:33,842 --> 01:08:35,276
he's an animal.

1244
01:08:44,853 --> 01:08:46,287
Hey, billy.
What?

1245
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,857
Remember that story
you told last night,

1246
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:51,025
After we were in bed?

1247
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,226
What story?

1248
01:08:52,227 --> 01:08:55,530
You know, that story
about you and your friend.

1249
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,865
What was his name?
Frankie guy?

1250
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,200
what about it?

1251
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,068
Anybody got a couple
bucks I can borrow, man?

1252
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:04,138
Rog, where you been, man? That
asshole friend of yours was here again.

1253
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:06,474
Man, come on. I need $5.00.

1254
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,142
I got 5. I got 10.
You want 10?

1255
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:09,210
Yeah.

1256
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,811
We got to talk
about him, man.

1257
01:09:10,812 --> 01:09:11,979
We got to talk about him.

1258
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,314
Hey, man, I just talked to him.

1259
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,415
We're going downtown, man.

1260
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:17,151
He felt real bad
about the way he acted

1261
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:19,153
And how y'all guys
done him and stuff, man.

1262
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:22,323
He was falling down
apologizing all over the place.

1263
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,824
He's got a lot
of weird ideas

1264
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:25,259
About us, roger,
I'm telling you.

1265
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,161
Well, he's a little fucked up
in his head, man,

1266
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:28,462
But he ain't no trouble.

1267
01:09:28,463 --> 01:09:30,164
Well, who needs him, man?

1268
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,832
I mean, we don't need him.

1269
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,734
I think you're getting
a little too nervous.

1270
01:09:33,735 --> 01:09:36,270
Nobody said anything
about needing anybody.

1271
01:09:36,271 --> 01:09:40,508
Damn, man, I been
on the street all my life.

1272
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:44,645
I mean, he just brings
back home is all, man.

1273
01:09:44,646 --> 01:09:46,847
Look, I played me
a little bit of ball.

1274
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:50,184
I'm feeling good.
I'm about to take me a shower.

1275
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:52,453
I'm telling you, rog, there's
something's wrong with him, though.

1276
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:55,189
Hey, man, every black man
in the world ain't like me.

1277
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,857
Get used to the idea, man.

1278
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:58,826
Once you get to know him,
you're going to like him.

1279
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:02,196
You'll be laughing when he talks
his shit, man, just like me.

1280
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:03,598
But you got to relax, man.

1281
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,032
Take a shower.

1282
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:06,367
I took one!

1283
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,835
Hoo hoo!

1284
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,003
I'm gonna be
a devil maker.

1285
01:10:10,004 --> 01:10:12,673
People like
a chicken dinner

1286
01:10:12,674 --> 01:10:13,974
From the shack.

1287
01:10:13,975 --> 01:10:15,142
Well?

1288
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:16,310
Well, what?

1289
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:19,146
That story you told
about your friend.

1290
01:10:19,147 --> 01:10:20,114
What about it?

1291
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,584
Was it really about you?

1292
01:10:23,585 --> 01:10:25,886
Were you frankie?

1293
01:10:25,887 --> 01:10:27,321
You son of a bitch.

1294
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:29,223
You are really sick, you
know that? I'm just asking.

1295
01:10:29,224 --> 01:10:31,225
Your brain is really,
truly rancid.

1296
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:32,893
You know there's
a theory now it's genetic,

1297
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:34,895
That it's all a matter
of genes and shit like that?

1298
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:36,897
Everything is not
so ungodly cryptic, billy.

1299
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:41,402
You, man. You and the rot that's
making out of your feeble fucking mind.

1300
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,873
watch a brother.

1301
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,908
Sex, drugs, danger,
danger, ah.

1302
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:50,244
Rog, you ain't really going
into town with that guy, are you?

1303
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:52,580
Oh, man, you bet
your ass I'm going.

1304
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,081
He's got a good head,
he's got wheels,

1305
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:56,216
And if you had got any
sense, you'd be going with us.

1306
01:10:56,217 --> 01:10:57,951
What are you talking about,
go with you?

1307
01:10:57,952 --> 01:10:59,420
I just told you,
the man's crazy.

1308
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,188
And I just told you
you're wrong.

1309
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:02,390
we weren't invited.

1310
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,224
All right, I'm inviting you.

1311
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:05,859
Well, I'm not going.

1312
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,528
Oh, come on, richie.
You sure?

1313
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,229
No, I'm afraid not.

1314
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,898
Billy.

1315
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,200
Come on, man.

1316
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:15,869
Hey, he's got wheels.

1317
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:17,037
We're going drinking.

1318
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:18,539
See if getting
your head real bad

1319
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,541
Don't make you
feel real good.

1320
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:22,209
Man, you know
what I'm talking about.

1321
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,578
I told you, you got him
all wrong. I got him right.

1322
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:26,180
But what if I'm right?

1323
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,882
Oh, billy, billy.
He's waiting on us.

1324
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:31,051
You know you want to.

1325
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:34,555
Jesus, man. Bad cat like that
got to know the way.

1326
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,590
I mean, he's been
to d.C. Before, man.

1327
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:38,225
He's got cousins there.

1328
01:11:38,226 --> 01:11:39,960
He got the wheels
for the weekend.

1329
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:43,230
You always talk about
not doing nothing,

1330
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,898
But you just talk.

1331
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:47,901
Relax, man.
Tonight, be doing it.

1332
01:11:47,902 --> 01:11:50,270
Cruise down the strip,
bad as we want to.

1333
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:53,240
Take a cigarette butt and
flick it out the window, man,

1334
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:54,308
And watch it bounce.

1335
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:56,009
Pick up some
cute little bitches,

1336
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,144
And if we don't,

1337
01:11:57,145 --> 01:11:59,647
He knows a cat house
that's full of cats.

1338
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,081
You serious?

1339
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:02,883
You mean you're going
to a whorehouse?

1340
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:04,518
that's disgusting.

1341
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:05,853
Listen to who's talking.

1342
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,688
What do you want me to do,
stay here with you?

1343
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:08,989
We could go to
a movie or something.

1344
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,524
I'm sick of all this talk,
man.

1345
01:12:10,525 --> 01:12:12,493
Are you guys going to go
or you going to stay?

1346
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,761
I don't know.

1347
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,496
Billy.

1348
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:18,532
All right, I'm going.

1349
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:20,835
All right. Yeah.

1350
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:23,604
Billy, you'll
be scared to death

1351
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,105
In a cat house,
and you know it.

1352
01:12:25,106 --> 01:12:26,774
Bullshit.

1353
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,509
Hey, billy's got a lion tamer
between his legs.

1354
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,014
Yo, dude, man.
Hey, my man.

1355
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:35,583
All right.

1356
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:38,218
Yeah, man, like I been waiting
all my motherfucking life.

1357
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:39,553
Let's book.
All right.

1358
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:41,555
Billy's coming too, man.
He just got to change.

1359
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:43,891
That's working it.
That's beautiful, man.

1360
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:45,559
Didn't I tell you?

1361
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,462
Yeah, we all going to be
friends. I can see that.

1362
01:12:48,463 --> 01:12:51,298
Richie. $10, please.

1363
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:52,566
Pretty please?

1364
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:54,234
All right, my man.
Come on, baby.

1365
01:12:54,235 --> 01:12:55,569
All right, all right,
all right.

1366
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:57,571
Let's just say 15.

1367
01:12:57,572 --> 01:12:59,239
All right, all right. 20?

1368
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,174
20 is what we're going
to make it, my man,

1369
01:13:01,175 --> 01:13:02,843
Because that's what I'm
going to get back to you.

1370
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:04,177
The hos ain't going to wait. All right.

1371
01:13:04,178 --> 01:13:05,112
All right.

1372
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:09,750
Man, come on. Hurry up.

1373
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:14,455
Let's go, man.

1374
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,528
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you mine ¶</i>

1375
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:21,862
<i>¶ you and I, yeah ¶</i>

1376
01:13:21,863 --> 01:13:24,532
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you mine ¶</i>

1377
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,800
<i>¶ so come on home ¶</i>

1378
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,735
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you mine ¶</i>

1379
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,670
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you,
baby ¶</i>

1380
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,539
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you mine ¶</i>

1381
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,873
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you ¶</i>

1382
01:13:32,874 --> 01:13:34,942
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you mine ¶</i>

1383
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,343
<i>¶ mine ¶</i>

1384
01:13:36,344 --> 01:13:42,316
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you mine ¶</i>

1385
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,884
<i>Right here.
¶ so come on home ¶</i>

1386
01:13:43,885 --> 01:13:46,554
<i>¶ I'm gonna make you mine ¶</i>

1387
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:01,835
You hide, and I'll find you.

1388
01:14:01,836 --> 01:14:03,737
Okay, close your eyes.

1389
01:14:34,035 --> 01:14:35,869
I don't know where it was.

1390
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,705
It wasn't here.

1391
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,206
And we were all in it.

1392
01:14:39,207 --> 01:14:40,374
That's what it felt like,

1393
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,543
Except we all had
different faces.

1394
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,712
After you guys left, I only
dozed off for a couple minutes,

1395
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,214
So it couldn't
have been very long.

1396
01:14:47,215 --> 01:14:49,550
Roger laughed a lot.

1397
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,552
Billy was taller.

1398
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,887
I don't remember
all the details, exactly,

1399
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:56,890
Except that even though
we were the ones in it,

1400
01:14:56,891 --> 01:15:00,494
I know it was about my father.

1401
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:03,497
He was a big man.

1402
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:05,165
I was 6.

1403
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:08,835
He was a very big man
when I was 6 and he went away.

1404
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:09,770
But I do remember him.

1405
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:24,251
We had money
from mom's family,

1406
01:15:24,252 --> 01:15:25,786
So he was just always home.

1407
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:33,860
I remember coming back from,
I think, kindergarten,

1408
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:37,531
And, as I came
up the front walk,

1409
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:39,533
He was coming out
the front door,

1410
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:43,537
And he had these suitcases
in his hands.

1411
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:44,838
He was leaving, you see.

1412
01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:47,073
Sneaking out.

1413
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,878
And we just
looked at each other,

1414
01:15:51,879 --> 01:15:54,881
And I knew.

1415
01:15:54,882 --> 01:15:56,517
I started crying.

1416
01:15:58,219 --> 01:15:59,820
"don't you cry.

1417
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:02,155
Don't you start crying,"
he said.

1418
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:06,159
I tried to grab him.

1419
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,261
He pushed me
down on the grass,

1420
01:16:08,262 --> 01:16:11,498
And then he was g-o-n-e.

1421
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:14,167
I can't get this thing.
Does somebody have an opener?

1422
01:16:14,168 --> 01:16:16,837
Hey. Old carlyle'll
get that for you.

1423
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,172
that was it?

1424
01:16:19,173 --> 01:16:21,508
I remember hiding my eyes

1425
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:25,612
And lying in the grass,
waiting.

1426
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,017
And that was it.

1427
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:32,586
Thank you.

1428
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:35,522
He never came back?

1429
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:36,490
No.

1430
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:44,197
Ain't that some shit?

1431
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:47,100
Now here I am, right?

1432
01:16:47,101 --> 01:16:48,869
Jive-time street nigger,

1433
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,872
And I knew where
my old man was all along.

1434
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:57,544
He were working up at
this butcher shop, you know?

1435
01:16:57,545 --> 01:17:01,648
Two blocks up the street.

1436
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:03,817
My old ma,
she used to point him out.

1437
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:05,486
She'd say, "there he is.

1438
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,489
"there he go.
That's your daddy.

1439
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,956
There he is, boy."

1440
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,829
One day, he come up to me.
We're all playing...

1441
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:19,165
Stickball or something,
me and a bunch of friends.

1442
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:22,503
He come up to me
and he said, "boy."

1443
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:24,505
Man, my daddy
want to talk to me.

1444
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:29,309
I was happy
as a pig in shit, man.

1445
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,612
He said, "boy."

1446
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,082
"boy, I ain't your daddy.

1447
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:39,185
"I ain't. Your mama,
she's crazy.

1448
01:17:39,186 --> 01:17:41,855
"she don't know what the hell
she talking about, boy,

1449
01:17:41,856 --> 01:17:43,824
But I ain't your daddy."

1450
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,195
I looked at him, and I said,

1451
01:17:49,196 --> 01:17:54,200
"don't you be calling
my mama crazy, you hear?

1452
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:57,170
Don't you call
my mama crazy, daddy."

1453
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,509
He didn't know
what the fuck to do.

1454
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,121
Yeah. You know,
when richie first saw me,

1455
01:18:15,122 --> 01:18:17,991
You know, he didn't
like me much no how.

1456
01:18:20,161 --> 01:18:21,995
But he done thought
about it now, you know?

1457
01:18:23,998 --> 01:18:27,634
Changed his way of thinking.
I can see that clear now.

1458
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:31,905
We're going to be one
big happy family, right?

1459
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:37,845
Carlyle likes me, billy.

1460
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:38,846
He thinks I'm pretty.

1461
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,781
Mm, mm, mm.
Now wait a minute.

1462
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,851
I ain't say you was pretty.

1463
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,385
I said you was cute.

1464
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:51,191
You see, a broad is pretty,

1465
01:18:51,192 --> 01:18:54,862
But a punk, if he
good-looking- then he's cute.

1466
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,062
You're cute.

1467
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:03,470
Oh, he's going to steal me
right away, billy.

1468
01:19:03,471 --> 01:19:05,973
You're so slow.

1469
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:07,975
I prefer a man
who's decisive.

1470
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,142
just keep it up.

1471
01:19:09,143 --> 01:19:10,811
You're going to have us
all believing

1472
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:13,113
You are just what
you say you are.

1473
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:16,483
Which is more
than we can say for you.

1474
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:18,485
Jive, jive.

1475
01:19:18,486 --> 01:19:20,186
You are arrogant, billy.

1476
01:19:20,187 --> 01:19:22,355
So arrogant.

1477
01:19:22,356 --> 01:19:24,925
Well, what are you?
On the rag?

1478
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:28,161
Wouldn't it just bang your
little balls if I were?

1479
01:19:28,162 --> 01:19:30,998
man, what is with you?

1480
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:33,834
Stupidity offends me.

1481
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,770
Lies and ignorance
offend me.

1482
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:43,510
know where we was,
the three of us earlier on?

1483
01:19:43,511 --> 01:19:45,512
All three of us?

1484
01:19:45,513 --> 01:19:48,515
To the wrong side
of the tracks, richard.

1485
01:19:48,516 --> 01:19:51,852
One good black
upside-down whorehouse,

1486
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:55,522
Where you get what you buy,
no jive along with it.

1487
01:19:55,523 --> 01:20:01,094
So if it's a lay you want
and a lay you need, you go.

1488
01:20:01,095 --> 01:20:03,764
Or don't they have
faggot whorehouses?

1489
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,866
Man, if y'all
don't stop this shit,

1490
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:08,535
I'm going to have to go
upside someone's head.

1491
01:20:08,536 --> 01:20:09,736
"where we was."

1492
01:20:09,737 --> 01:20:12,973
"where we was."
listen to him.

1493
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:16,142
Oh, god. Carlyle,
he has more schooling

1494
01:20:16,143 --> 01:20:19,880
Than you've got
fingers and toes.

1495
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:23,550
It's this pseudo-earthy
quality he feigns.

1496
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:25,886
Inside, he's pure cashmere.

1497
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:27,888
That's a lie.

1498
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:30,891
I'm polyester,
worsted, and mohair.

1499
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:33,560
You have a lot of school,
billy, and don't say you don't.

1500
01:20:33,561 --> 01:20:35,762
You said fingers and toes.
You didn't say "a lot."

1501
01:20:35,763 --> 01:20:37,564
I think people get dumber,

1502
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:41,468
The more they park their ass
in some schoolhouse door.

1503
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,136
Well, that just depends

1504
01:20:43,137 --> 01:20:45,005
On what the hell
you're talking about.

1505
01:20:46,574 --> 01:20:47,507
Yeah, well.

1506
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:51,078
I used to know cats
back on the block

1507
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,647
Who really knew
what was shaking.

1508
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:56,249
Then they go away
to some school,

1509
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,619
And they come back,
and they ain't know

1510
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,987
What the fuck was happening.

1511
01:21:04,191 --> 01:21:05,626
billy,

1512
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,294
Why don't you and roger
go out for a walk?

1513
01:21:08,295 --> 01:21:09,863
What?

1514
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,365
Roger asked you
to go downtown.

1515
01:21:12,366 --> 01:21:15,802
You went. You had fun.

1516
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:19,906
I asked you to go, too.

1517
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:22,876
You asked me.

1518
01:21:22,877 --> 01:21:25,211
You begged billy.

1519
01:21:25,212 --> 01:21:26,513
You took my $20.

1520
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,882
You begged billy.

1521
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,555
I'm asking you a favor now.

1522
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:38,058
Go for a walk and let me
and carlyle have some time.

1523
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:43,229
Man, that's how
you all work it?

1524
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,666
work what?

1525
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:49,002
Whose ever turn it be.

1526
01:21:49,003 --> 01:21:51,905
No, no, that ain't
the way we work it

1527
01:21:51,906 --> 01:21:53,907
Because we don't work it.

1528
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:56,910
See, there it is.

1529
01:21:56,911 --> 01:22:00,847
That goddamn fucking education
showing through again, man.

1530
01:22:00,848 --> 01:22:03,516
All them years in school.

1531
01:22:03,517 --> 01:22:05,318
Didn't we have a good time
tonight, man?

1532
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:09,856
Huh? I let you ride
in my car, right?

1533
01:22:09,857 --> 01:22:12,859
Show you some good cat houses,
all that sweet black pussy.

1534
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,527
Ain't we friends?

1535
01:22:14,528 --> 01:22:16,196
How come you don't
like me, man?

1536
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:18,231
Richie likes me, man. How
come you don't like me?

1537
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:20,967
If you're really doing what I think
you're doing, you're a fucking animal.

1538
01:22:22,536 --> 01:22:24,204
Hey, billy, no, man.

1539
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,205
What, man?

1540
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,273
Just relax. No point.

1541
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:29,342
Man, I told you,
this ain't going on here.

1542
01:22:29,343 --> 01:22:30,711
We both told you
it ain't going on.

1543
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:31,712
Don't jive me, nigger.

1544
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,947
I know what the fuck
is happening.

1545
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:36,349
Are you going for a fucking
walk like I'm asking, or what?

1546
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,051
Because I'm going to get
this shit straight.

1547
01:22:38,052 --> 01:22:39,219
we live here.

1548
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,386
I live here too, roger.

1549
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:41,722
This is my house, too.

1550
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,123
don't you think I know that?

1551
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,258
Did I say something to make
you think I don't know that?

1552
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:46,893
Carlyle is my guest.

1553
01:22:46,894 --> 01:22:47,894
All right, fine.

1554
01:22:47,895 --> 01:22:49,896
He's your friend,
this is your home,

1555
01:22:49,897 --> 01:22:51,231
So that means he can stay.

1556
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,399
But this don't mean
I got to leave.

1557
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,901
I'll catch you all
in the morning.

1558
01:22:54,902 --> 01:22:56,236
roger, what the hell
are you doing?

1559
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:57,738
I'm doing what you should
be doing, man.

1560
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,405
It's late, and I'm going to bed. What?

1561
01:22:59,406 --> 01:23:00,841
Just get in the fucking bed.

1562
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,508
All you got to do
is climb in your rack,

1563
01:23:02,509 --> 01:23:04,010
Put your head
on the pillow and sleep.

1564
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,212
Give me my goddamn pillow.

1565
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:07,180
You've got to be kidding!
What?

1566
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:10,683
No, man. No.
Give me my pillow.

1567
01:23:10,684 --> 01:23:11,852
You mean just go to bed?

1568
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:12,953
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1569
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:14,520
Man, this shit has been
happening so long,

1570
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:17,390
Ain't nothing you can do
to stop it.

1571
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:19,259
I don't believe this shit.

1572
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,194
You ain't serious, huh?

1573
01:23:21,195 --> 01:23:23,063
What the fuck
am I supposed to do, huh?

1574
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:26,133
Ain't you got no feelings,
huh, for a man?

1575
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,701
Ain't you got no feelings
for how a man feel, man?

1576
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:30,403
You's a pair
of motherfuckers.

1577
01:23:30,404 --> 01:23:31,671
That's it, right?

1578
01:23:31,672 --> 01:23:32,773
You's a pair
of motherfuckers, right?

1579
01:23:32,774 --> 01:23:36,542
You're snits!
Don't you hear me, man?

1580
01:23:36,543 --> 01:23:38,544
Understand
the situation here, man.

1581
01:23:38,545 --> 01:23:41,214
I thought we had a deal.

1582
01:23:41,215 --> 01:23:43,216
All right, all right.

1583
01:23:43,217 --> 01:23:45,051
You get on your knees, punk,

1584
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:46,219
And I mean now,

1585
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,054
And you going to be
on my joint fast

1586
01:23:48,055 --> 01:23:49,890
Or you going to be
one busted-ass punk.

1587
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:52,458
roger, I ain't going to have
this going on here. I can't.

1588
01:23:52,459 --> 01:23:54,227
Jealous, billy?

1589
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:55,561
Just go out that door!

1590
01:23:55,562 --> 01:23:57,030
god damn it!

1591
01:23:57,031 --> 01:23:59,399
Just go out that
fucking door, both of you!

1592
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,268
Go out in the bushes
or some field, man.

1593
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,502
See if I care.

1594
01:24:02,503 --> 01:24:04,004
But it ain't going on here.

1595
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:05,272
It ain't going on
in my house.

1596
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:07,007
You understand?

1597
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:08,675
I ain't got much
in this goddamn army,

1598
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,510
But here is mine.

1599
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:12,545
I want my fucking nut!

1600
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:13,780
I want my nut, man!

1601
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:15,949
The fuck you so
uptight for, huh?

1602
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,518
He wants me.
This boy here wants me.

1603
01:24:18,519 --> 01:24:19,686
Richie wants me, man.

1604
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,188
Who the fuck are you
to stop it?

1605
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,956
Yeah, that's right.
That's right, billy.

1606
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:24,224
Richie one of them white boys

1607
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,525
Want to get fucked
by a nigger.

1608
01:24:25,526 --> 01:24:26,927
Ain't that right, rich?

1609
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:28,862
This may be his dream
come true.

1610
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:32,299
Make it in the real world how a
nigger's an animal. You hear me, carlyle?

1611
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,068
Hey, I don't give a fuck
what he's trying to prove,

1612
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:37,904
Long as I get my nut.

1613
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:40,540
Besides, man, I know
I ain't no fucking animal.

1614
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:41,808
I ain't got to prove it.

1615
01:24:41,809 --> 01:24:44,878
Lesson number 1, school boy.

1616
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:48,315
You don't see so well what you
see in the dark, motherfucker.

1617
01:24:49,383 --> 01:24:50,817
who said the lights go out?

1618
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:55,889
Nobody goddamn asked me
if the lights go out!

1619
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,825
I do, motherfucker.
I say so, god damn it.

1620
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:00,426
Can't you just fucking
let people be, man?

1621
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:06,532
I'm going to cut
your fucking ass, boy,

1622
01:25:06,533 --> 01:25:09,002
Just so you can see
how it feel, right?

1623
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:11,504
And cutting can happen, boy.
This knife is true, sucker.

1624
01:25:11,505 --> 01:25:13,173
no, come on, carlyle.
Rog.

1625
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:14,207
Shut up.

1626
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,342
come on.

1627
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:17,244
put your hand out,
boy. Put it out.

1628
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:18,678
Don't hurt him, carlyle.

1629
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:20,213
Motherfucker threw
a shoe at me, man.

1630
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:22,182
Come on, man. You don't
go through life clean, man,

1631
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:24,184
Thinking you can
throw another one.

1632
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:26,686
Put your hand out. Come on.
Hold your hand out, boy.

1633
01:25:26,687 --> 01:25:27,854
Do the fucking thing I say.

1634
01:25:32,526 --> 01:25:33,960
Motherfucker!

1635
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,699
yeah, boy.
That's your blood, boy.

1636
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,368
The blood inside you.

1637
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:44,537
You don't ever see it.

1638
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:47,207
Take a good look
at how it come out, boy.

1639
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,708
Enough of it come out, boy,

1640
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:50,176
And you're in the worst
goddamn trouble

1641
01:25:50,177 --> 01:25:51,544
You ever seen in your life.

1642
01:25:51,545 --> 01:25:54,480
And know I'm the man that can
deal that trouble, boy,

1643
01:25:54,481 --> 01:25:56,549
As easy as I smile.

1644
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:57,784
And I smile easy.

1645
01:25:59,987 --> 01:26:00,921
bastard.

1646
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:05,491
Bastard.

1647
01:26:05,492 --> 01:26:07,827
Bastard ruined
my mood, richie.

1648
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:10,496
He ruined my mood, man.

1649
01:26:10,497 --> 01:26:15,168
Fighting and loving different
in the feelings I got.

1650
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:17,170
I see blood come out
of somebody like that, man,

1651
01:26:17,171 --> 01:26:19,839
It don't make me feel good.

1652
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,174
Hurt me, man.

1653
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:23,843
Hurt me, man,
put the hurt on somebody

1654
01:26:23,844 --> 01:26:26,146
I thought was supposed
to be my friend.

1655
01:26:29,016 --> 01:26:30,917
Everything was getting
so sweet, too.

1656
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:35,088
One big family.

1657
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:38,191
Shit. I ain't
supposed to know, right?

1658
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:41,727
One dumb stupid nigger.

1659
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:46,199
No mind, he thinks.

1660
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:50,536
No heart, no feelings
or gentleness.

1661
01:26:50,537 --> 01:26:53,206
You see how that
ain't true, richie, right?

1662
01:26:53,207 --> 01:26:54,274
You see, right?

1663
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:56,977
Bastard.

1664
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:01,481
Bastard threw
a fucking shoe at me, man.

1665
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:02,515
Fucking shoe.

1666
01:27:04,318 --> 01:27:08,455
Somebody else would have cut
his fucking heart out for less.

1667
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:10,223
But I got to let him know.

1668
01:27:10,224 --> 01:27:12,758
I let him know, man.

1669
01:27:12,759 --> 01:27:14,560
He throws shit, he gets shit.

1670
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,831
I ain't hurt him bad.

1671
01:27:18,832 --> 01:27:20,833
You see that, right?
I ain't hurt him bad.

1672
01:27:20,834 --> 01:27:23,169
Jesus h. Christ.

1673
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:25,605
You know what I'm doing?

1674
01:27:25,606 --> 01:27:28,841
You know what I'm
standing here doing?

1675
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:32,178
I'm a 24-year-old
college graduate-

1676
01:27:32,179 --> 01:27:34,414
Goddamn intellectual type,

1677
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:35,882
And I got a knife in my hand,

1678
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,851
Thinking about coming up
behind one black human being,

1679
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:42,088
And I'm thinking
nigger this and nigger that.

1680
01:27:42,089 --> 01:27:43,623
I want to cut his throat.

1681
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:46,926
That is ridiculous, man.

1682
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:49,029
I never faced
anybody in my life

1683
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,530
With anything to kill them.

1684
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,032
You understand me?

1685
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:55,235
I don't have a goddamn thing
on the line here.

1686
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:56,969
Look at me, roger.

1687
01:27:56,970 --> 01:28:01,441
Look at me. I got a cut on my
palm. I don't know what happened.

1688
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:03,309
Jesus christ, man,
I get sweat all over me

1689
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:04,911
When I think of what
I was near doing.

1690
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:08,114
I mean, you think I need
a reputation as a killer?

1691
01:28:08,115 --> 01:28:10,483
A bad man with a knife?

1692
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:12,652
Bullshit, man. I need shit.

1693
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:16,923
I got sweat all over me, man.

1694
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:19,459
I got the mile record
in my hometown.

1695
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,161
I did the mile in 4:42,

1696
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:24,164
And that's the goddamn record
in windsor county, man.

1697
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:26,399
I don't need approval
from either one of you.

1698
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:31,171
You want to be a faggot?

1699
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:34,174
A goddamn swish, sucking cocks
and taking it in the ass?

1700
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:35,475
The thing of which you dream?

1701
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:36,476
Go.

1702
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:39,079
And you.

1703
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,013
You want to be
a bad-ass animal, man?

1704
01:28:41,014 --> 01:28:42,848
Get it on. Go.

1705
01:28:42,849 --> 01:28:44,517
But I wash my hands, man.

1706
01:28:44,518 --> 01:28:46,819
I'm not human as you are.

1707
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,355
I put you down.
I put you down.

1708
01:28:49,356 --> 01:28:51,191
You gay little
piece of shit cake.

1709
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:52,258
Shit cake!

1710
01:28:52,259 --> 01:28:53,259
Fuck you, billy.

1711
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,860
And you.

1712
01:28:54,861 --> 01:28:57,330
You're your own
goddamn fault, sambo!

1713
01:28:57,331 --> 01:28:58,331
Samb-

1714
01:29:01,535 --> 01:29:03,169
Out of my way.

1715
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:04,604
Get out of my way.

1716
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,547
Hey, man, what's
the matter with you?

1717
01:29:14,548 --> 01:29:16,816
nobody talk that
weird shit to me, man.

1718
01:29:16,817 --> 01:29:18,951
You understand?

1719
01:29:23,824 --> 01:29:26,159
rog,

1720
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,027
I think he stabbed him.

1721
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:32,365
He just cut my hand.
That's all.

1722
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:33,933
It just knocked
the wind out of me.

1723
01:29:33,934 --> 01:29:35,034
Just scared me. That's all.

1724
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,340
Man, are you all right?

1725
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,046
Are you all right, man?

1726
01:29:47,047 --> 01:29:48,348
Did he slit you?

1727
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:50,250
Come on, man. Come on.
Let's get up on the bed.

1728
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:51,717
I am on the bed.

1729
01:29:51,718 --> 01:29:53,620
No, billy,
you're not. You're not.

1730
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:54,621
Shut up, man.

1731
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:55,755
You're on the floor, man.

1732
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:57,557
We're on the bed, man.
I'm on the bed.

1733
01:29:59,893 --> 01:30:01,994
Hey, come on. Come on.
Are you all right, man?

1734
01:30:01,995 --> 01:30:03,329
Let me just see
where he got you.

1735
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:05,565
No! Nigger, leave me alone!

1736
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:07,800
What did you do, man? Damn.

1737
01:30:07,801 --> 01:30:10,370
Did you slit him or stick him?
Huh? You nigger.

1738
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:12,004
Shut up!

1739
01:30:12,005 --> 01:30:13,906
Oh, man, let me see
where he got you.

1740
01:30:13,907 --> 01:30:14,840
Ow.

1741
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,280
Fuck it, man.
I stuck him, all right?

1742
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,748
I stuck it in, man.
I fucking turned it, okay?

1743
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:27,587
This fucking army break
my fucking heart, man.

1744
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,689
If I can't be
where there's pretty men,

1745
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:30,923
I don't want to live.

1746
01:30:30,924 --> 01:30:35,027
wash me down, shit face!

1747
01:30:36,363 --> 01:30:37,530
shut up.

1748
01:30:37,531 --> 01:30:39,932
All right, just shut up.
Shut up.

1749
01:30:39,933 --> 01:30:41,767
Shut up, richie.
Just go get help. Go.

1750
01:30:41,768 --> 01:30:44,537
Just go, richie. Just go.
Go get somebody.

1751
01:30:44,538 --> 01:30:46,939
Wh-who? I'll go.

1752
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,209
Get the sergeant, the od,

1753
01:30:54,915 --> 01:30:56,416
I forgot my shoes, roger.

1754
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:58,818
Get the fuck out of here.

1755
01:31:04,758 --> 01:31:07,126
Roger, I taste my blood.
What does that mean?

1756
01:31:07,127 --> 01:31:08,994
I taste my blood.

1757
01:31:08,995 --> 01:31:11,598
What does that mean?

1758
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:14,133
I'm cold.

1759
01:31:15,402 --> 01:31:17,704
It's cold, roger. I'm cold.

1760
01:31:21,908 --> 01:31:24,744
He woke me.

1761
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:27,813
Olly olly oxen free.

1762
01:31:27,814 --> 01:31:30,283
I won't talk bad,

1763
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:31,718
Don't cut me anymore.

1764
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:35,488
I couldn't take it, okay?

1765
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:38,658
Oh, it was you, assholes.

1766
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:40,826
Everybody drunk, huh?

1767
01:31:40,827 --> 01:31:42,729
Sergeant-
I don't blame you.

1768
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,964
I lost my rent.

1769
01:31:44,965 --> 01:31:45,965

1770
01:31:45,966 --> 01:31:47,967

Carlyle stabbed billy.

1775
01:31:54,808 --> 01:31:55,808
What?

1776
01:31:55,809 --> 01:31:58,010
Carlyle stabbed him.

1777
01:31:58,011 --> 01:31:59,679
Wha- who-

1778
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,247

Him.

1780
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:10,757
Who are you, soldier?

1781
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:13,293

You got a knife there?

1784
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:20,132
That's cokes' knife!

1785
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:21,967
That's cokes' trench knife.

1786
01:32:21,968 --> 01:32:25,405
What- where's cokes?

1787
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:27,674
What is going on here?

1788
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:29,342
Leave me alone, carlyle.

1789
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:31,344
You better watch your step.

1790
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:33,713
You see what I got here?

1791
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,748
You watch your step,

1792
01:32:35,749 --> 01:32:38,785
Now, I'm just trying to
find out what's going on here.

1793
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:40,119
Now you relax!

1794
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,621
Motherfucker.

1795
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:44,023
Motherfucker!

1796
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:47,627
Yaah!

1797
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:49,228
You, god damn it,

1798
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:53,132
I'm going to cut you good.

1799
01:32:53,133 --> 01:32:55,335
Aah.

1800
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:56,736
I cut my hand.

1801
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:59,806
I hurt myself. I cut my hand.

1802
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:02,208

01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:10,149
Billy!

1806
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:21,060
Don't tell nobody on me, okay?

1807
01:33:21,061 --> 01:33:23,162
Don't tell nobody on me,
and I'll let you go.

1808
01:33:23,163 --> 01:33:26,432
I'll let you go.

1809
01:33:26,433 --> 01:33:28,468
Shit, baby.

1810
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:29,769
Oh, mommy.

1811
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,405
How the fuck am I going to get
back to the world now, man,

1812
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:33,406
Making all this fucking mess?

1813
01:33:36,276 --> 01:33:37,410
Wh-what happened?

1814
01:33:40,146 --> 01:33:42,448
Don't do it.
Don't tell on me, all right?

1815
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:43,549
I don't-

1816
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:44,884
Shut up, nigger.

1817
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:47,854
Don't you go talking the
weird shit, too, all right?

1818
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:50,122
Don't you go talking
that weird shit, too!

1819
01:33:50,123 --> 01:33:51,123
You hear me?

1820
01:33:51,124 --> 01:33:52,124
No, I won't, no.

1821
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:56,028
Oh, man. Oh, baby, carlyle.

01:34:00,233 --> 01:34:01,534
You know me.

1825
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:04,036
You know me, man!

1826
01:34:04,037 --> 01:34:04,970
Shit.

1827
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:23,489
Sergeant rooney?

1828
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:25,357
Oh, jesus. God,
what the fuck is going on?

1829
01:34:25,358 --> 01:34:26,826
no, no.
Get up against the bunk.

1830
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:28,561
Get up there.
Call the mp, man.

1831
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:30,563
Get up there!
Call the mps, man!

1832
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:33,399
Call the fucking hospital,

1833
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,601
Get down from that bunk,
soldier!

1834
01:34:35,602 --> 01:34:36,936
What the hell's
going on here?

1835
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:38,370
I was asleep.
Get up on the bunk.

1836
01:34:38,371 --> 01:34:39,405
Put your hands together.

1837
01:34:39,406 --> 01:34:40,840
What's this building
number?

1838
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,575
What the fuck's

1839
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:45,244
number 320- 362.

1840
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:49,348
What's happened in here?

1841
01:34:49,349 --> 01:34:51,016
The sergeant first class
is cut to shit, sir.

1842
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:52,485
Call the ambulance.
Yes, sir.

1843
01:34:52,486 --> 01:34:53,986
I've already called
an ambulance, sir.

1844
01:34:53,987 --> 01:34:55,120
Bring that man down here.

1845
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:57,690
Okay, you watch him.
Move it.

1846
01:35:02,996 --> 01:35:04,964
Oh, now, that isn't carlyle.

1847
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:08,200
Get up against the locker.
Move.

1848
01:35:08,201 --> 01:35:09,201
What's your name,
soldier?

1849
01:35:09,202 --> 01:35:10,503
Hicks, roger.

1850
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,371
You the officer of the day?

1851
01:35:12,372 --> 01:35:13,806
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant townsend, sir.

1852
01:35:13,807 --> 01:35:16,709
Yeah, yeah, well, put your gun
away before you hurt somebody.

1853
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,911
Yes, sir.

1854
01:35:18,912 --> 01:35:20,212
You stab these men, son?

1855
01:35:20,213 --> 01:35:22,281
No, that's roger.
That's not carlyle.

1856
01:35:22,282 --> 01:35:23,950
That man over there said

1857
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:25,284
Some nigger went crazy
with a knife.

1858
01:35:25,285 --> 01:35:26,786
I didn't say that word.

1859
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:28,721
Lieutenant,
the medics are here.

1860
01:35:28,722 --> 01:35:30,122

1861
01:35:30,123 --> 01:35:31,256
Uh, no, sir,
I'm just the orderly.

1862
01:35:31,257 --> 01:35:32,458
Dr. Banes is coming.

1863
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:33,726
I'm dr. Banes.

1864
01:35:33,727 --> 01:35:37,663
Check these men.
I think they're dead.

1865
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:40,900
Hey! Put your hands up
against the locker!

1866
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,369
This man's dead.
You can take him away.

1867
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:51,978
Hey, hey-

1868
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:54,714
Sarge, we got this guy
on the street.

1869
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:56,682
He was running
like a streak of shit.

1870
01:35:56,683 --> 01:35:58,985
that's him. He did it.

1871
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:00,520
Hey, officer,
what's going on here? Huh?

1872
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:01,721
He's got blood
all over himself.

1873
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:03,288
What about a knife?
Did you find a knife?

1874
01:36:03,289 --> 01:36:04,323
You find a weapon on him?

1875
01:36:04,324 --> 01:36:05,892
I found a switch blade
on him.

1876
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:08,260
I found this
in the bushes nearby.

1877
01:36:08,261 --> 01:36:09,562
Jesus christ!
see now-

1878
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,463
Oh, no, no, you're not as smart
as you think, officer.

1879
01:36:11,464 --> 01:36:13,432
Jesus, god almighty.

1880
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,668
Chicken blood. Chicken blood
and chicken heart

1881
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:17,069
And livers and all that.

1882
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:19,104
See, I was walking along
on my way, you know,

1883
01:36:19,105 --> 01:36:21,007
And these dudes they jumped out
of these bushes, you know,

1884
01:36:21,008 --> 01:36:22,675
And they threw it all over me.

1885
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:24,577
Chicken bloods and chicken
heart, ain't it ridiculous?

1886
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:26,812
All right, sit him down there.
Sit him down and shut him up.

1887
01:36:26,813 --> 01:36:28,681
You don't understand, you see-
I said to shut him up.

1888
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:29,982
Shut up!
Do what he says.

1889
01:36:29,983 --> 01:36:32,051
Could you be so kind
as to remove these cuffs?

1890
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:34,453
All right, all right. But I'm
going to be thinking over here.

1891
01:36:34,454 --> 01:36:35,521
Make no mistake about that.

1892
01:36:35,522 --> 01:36:37,557
I'm going to be thinking
it all over.

1893
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:40,192
I got big planning to do.

1894
01:36:40,193 --> 01:36:43,128
I'm going to be thinking
over here in my quietness.

1895
01:36:43,129 --> 01:36:44,564
what's your name,
soldier?

1896
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:46,465
Douglas, sir. Richard douglas.

1897
01:36:46,466 --> 01:36:47,466
Do you sleep here?

1898
01:36:47,467 --> 01:36:49,134
Yes, I do, sir.

1899
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:51,537
And roger sleeps here,
and billy slept here.

1900
01:36:51,538 --> 01:36:54,406
That's sergeant rooney.
He's our platoon sergeant.

1901
01:36:54,407 --> 01:36:56,408
That's carlyle.
He's a transient, sir.

1902
01:36:56,409 --> 01:36:58,778
A sub-transient
from p company.

1903
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:00,179
And you had nothing
to do with this?

1904
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,581
No, I had nothing to-

1905
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,549
Did he have anything to do
with this? No, he didn't, sir.

1906
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:04,850
And I didn't, either.

1907
01:37:04,851 --> 01:37:07,419
It was carlyle who just got
into a fight with billy.

1908
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:09,388
He went crazy. I don't know
what they were fighting about.

1909
01:37:09,389 --> 01:37:11,891
How
- how did the sergeant first class get involved?

1910
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:12,959
I don't know, sir.

1911
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,094
I wasn't here.
I was going to get you.

1912
01:37:15,095 --> 01:37:18,564
Sergeant rooney came back.
I don't know why.

1913
01:37:18,565 --> 01:37:21,133
Carlyle just attacked him.

1914
01:37:21,134 --> 01:37:22,534
Okay, billy
was already stabbed.

1915
01:37:22,535 --> 01:37:23,569
All right, all right,
all right.

1916
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:25,838
Look, I've had enough of this.

1917
01:37:25,839 --> 01:37:28,574
Listen, all you guys are going
to have be going now, all right?

1918
01:37:28,575 --> 01:37:29,976
Seriously.

1919
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:34,113
Now, if you just kindly remove
these cuffs from my hands.

1920
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:37,516
Get me a bus ticket home.
I've quit the army.

1921
01:37:37,517 --> 01:37:38,550
You are doing what?

1922
01:37:38,551 --> 01:37:39,919
Sir, I'm not going to be quiet.

1923
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,754
I have quit the army.

1924
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:42,955
You shut the hell up, soldier.

1925
01:37:42,956 --> 01:37:44,289
Look, sir, I don't
understand you people.

1926
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:45,591
Don't you people understand

1927
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:47,994
When a man is talking english
to speak his mind?

1928
01:37:47,995 --> 01:37:49,095
I have quit the army.

1929
01:37:49,096 --> 01:37:50,362
Get him out of here.

1930
01:37:50,363 --> 01:37:52,698
Hey, look. Oh, no.

1931
01:37:52,699 --> 01:37:55,400
You guys are not going to be doing
this to me no more, all right?

1932
01:37:55,401 --> 01:37:58,137
Look, just leave me alone.
Take these cuffs off of me.

1933
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:01,007
I'm staying here. This is
my place. It's not yours.

1934
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:03,609
Just take these cuffs
off of me, please.

1935
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:06,211
My- my little sister lynn sue,
she knew all about this.

1936
01:38:06,212 --> 01:38:08,948
She told me-
get these fucking cuffs off me!

1937
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:12,652
where's your bunk, douglas?

1938
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:13,753
Right there.
Get in it.

1939
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:17,523
And you, uh-
hicks. Right here.

1940
01:38:17,524 --> 01:38:18,624
Get in bed.

1941
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:20,760
Look, do we really have
to sleep here tonight?

1942
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:23,395
Where else you going to sleep?

1943
01:38:23,396 --> 01:38:25,564
All right, this barracks
is sealed off.

1944
01:38:25,565 --> 01:38:26,866
Nobody goes in or out.

1945
01:38:26,867 --> 01:38:28,534
Mccarthy,
secure the back door.

1946
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:31,370
Come on. Let's get out of here.
We got to write this up.

1947
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,206
All right, did you hear him?

1948
01:38:34,207 --> 01:38:36,976
This barracks is sealed off.
No one in or out.

1949
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,899
How come you made me
waste all that time

1950
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,033
Talking shit to you

1951
01:39:01,034 --> 01:39:02,835
And all that time
you was a faggot?

1952
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:04,737
I mean, you really was, man.

1953
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:07,506
You could've
just told old rog.

1954
01:39:07,507 --> 01:39:09,909
I've been telling you.

1955
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:14,747
Oh, man.
Jive, man, jive.

1956
01:39:14,748 --> 01:39:17,616
All you did is bullshit
all over us,

1957
01:39:17,617 --> 01:39:19,919
Just bullshit.

1958
01:39:22,555 --> 01:39:24,990
I just wanted
to hold billy's hand.

1959
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:25,925
He didn't want to.

1960
01:39:53,486 --> 01:39:54,854
Ah-ha-ha!

1961
01:40:07,467 --> 01:40:11,703
Hey, hey,
what a day, gentlemen.

1962
01:40:11,704 --> 01:40:13,038
How you all doing?

1963
01:40:14,207 --> 01:40:18,443
We had a hell of a day,
old rooney and me.

1964
01:40:18,444 --> 01:40:21,280
We've been playing
hide and go seek,

1965
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:23,015
And I was hiding,

1966
01:40:23,016 --> 01:40:24,483
And now I think
he started hiding

1967
01:40:24,484 --> 01:40:26,852
Without telling me
he was going to.

1968
01:40:26,853 --> 01:40:29,721
I can't find him.

1969
01:40:29,722 --> 01:40:31,924
I thought maybe he was
hiding over here, huh?

1970
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:33,525
Sergeant-

1971
01:40:33,526 --> 01:40:35,427
uh, no, no.

1972
01:40:35,428 --> 01:40:36,595
He ain't here,
sergeant.

1973
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:45,570
I got to find him.

1974
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:48,540
He knows how to react
in a tough situation!

1975
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,681
He didn't come up
here looking for me?

1976
01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:59,318
well, you know, we was going
to go to sleep, sarge.

1977
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:01,753
Got to get up early.

1978
01:41:01,754 --> 01:41:05,291
You know how
this mother army is.

1979
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:09,328
You don't mind I sit here
a little, wait on him, huh?

1980
01:41:09,329 --> 01:41:13,999
You can have a little wine.
You can have some.

1981
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,170
We can go back into the area.
We've been downtown.

1982
01:41:18,171 --> 01:41:20,039
Sergeant cokes-

1983
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,641
Let him rest, rich.

1984
01:41:26,446 --> 01:41:29,849
hmm, we went to d.C.

1985
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:32,852
To this private club I know.

1986
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:37,189
Had ten or more snorts,

1987
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:39,691
And we decided
to come back here

1988
01:41:39,692 --> 01:41:41,994
After playing some snooker.

1989
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:46,465
Yeah, that was fun.

1990
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:49,869
On the way,
we picked up this kid

1991
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:52,671
From the engineering unit
hitchhiking.

1992
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:55,941
I saw- I'm coming
around this corner.

1993
01:41:55,942 --> 01:41:59,511
All of the sudden, there's this car
stopped dead in front of me, man.

1994
01:41:59,512 --> 01:42:01,213
I slam on the brakes,

1995
01:42:01,214 --> 01:42:03,282
But it's like pudding
the way I slide into him.

1996
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:06,018
He wasn't blinking
or nothing like that, you know?

1997
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:08,653
There's just a big bang,
and then we yell.

1998
01:42:08,654 --> 01:42:12,992
Rooney starts laughing
like crazy.

1999
01:42:14,594 --> 01:42:16,461
The kid jumps out of the back.

2000
01:42:16,462 --> 01:42:18,463
Says he's going to take
a fucking bus.

2001
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:32,177
This guy, uh,
from the other car,

2002
01:42:32,178 --> 01:42:34,780
He's swearing at me.

2003
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:37,549
My car's still running fine,

2004
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:41,320
So I move it off to the side
of the road, you know.

2005
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:42,788
I tell him to do the same

2006
01:42:42,789 --> 01:42:44,423
While we're waiting
for the cops.

2007
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:47,659
He says his car's going
to stay right where it is

2008
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:49,128
Because he had
the right of way

2009
01:42:49,129 --> 01:42:50,896
Because he was making
a legal turn.

2010
01:42:52,632 --> 01:42:56,101
So we're waiting for the cops.

2011
01:42:56,102 --> 01:42:57,669
Some cars go by.

2012
01:43:00,573 --> 01:43:02,874
This guy's car

2013
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:09,348
Was this big fucking buick.

2014
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:12,351
And around the corner comes
this little red triumph.

2015
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:14,420
The driver's this blond kid,

2016
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:16,155
Got a little blond
sitting next to him.

2017
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:17,722
You can see
what's going to happen.

2018
01:43:17,723 --> 01:43:19,291
There's this goddamn car

2019
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:21,060
In the middle of the road
with nobody in it.

2020
01:43:21,061 --> 01:43:23,162
So the triumph goes crashing

2021
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:25,297
Into the back of the fucking
buick with nobody in it.

2022
01:43:25,298 --> 01:43:27,967
Bip, bang, boom!

2023
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:30,970
Everything stops!

2024
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:33,172
It's all still.

2025
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:37,476
Everybody's staring.
It's all still.

2026
01:43:43,549 --> 01:43:48,687
The fucking buick
kind of shudders.

2027
01:43:48,688 --> 01:43:51,090
It starts to move

2028
01:43:51,091 --> 01:43:54,926
With nobody in it.

2029
01:43:54,927 --> 01:43:58,864
It starts to roll
from the impact,

2030
01:43:58,865 --> 01:44:01,300
And it just rolls
just far enough

2031
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:02,968
To where the road
starts a downgrade.

2032
01:44:02,969 --> 01:44:05,837
And it's drifting
over to the side of the curb

2033
01:44:05,838 --> 01:44:08,673
And then over it
and then onto this hill,

2034
01:44:08,674 --> 01:44:10,075
And it's starting
to pick up speed

2035
01:44:10,076 --> 01:44:11,643
Because the hill
is real steep.

2036
01:44:11,644 --> 01:44:14,446
And it just disappears
over the side,

2037
01:44:14,447 --> 01:44:15,947
Rolling into the dark.

2038
01:44:15,948 --> 01:44:19,418
Just rolling real quiet.

2039
01:44:22,755 --> 01:44:25,391
Rooney, rooney, rooney-

2040
01:44:25,392 --> 01:44:28,960
Rooney falls over.
He's laughing so hard.

2041
01:44:32,598 --> 01:44:35,600
I didn't know what to do.

2042
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,540
So in a minute, the cops come.

2043
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:44,910
In another minute, some guy
comes running up over the hill.

2044
01:44:44,911 --> 01:44:47,879
Says some guy's got run over
by this car with nobody in it.

2045
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,816
We didn't know what to think.

2046
01:44:51,817 --> 01:44:55,787
This was
fucking unbelievable to us.

2047
01:44:57,924 --> 01:45:01,260
Rooney is screaming
at me how we got into

2048
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:05,464
Four goddamn accident fights
and got out clean.

2049
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:13,405
And now I can't find him.

2050
01:45:13,406 --> 01:45:18,077
I'll just sit here
a little, I mean-

2051
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:25,551
Hey.

2052
01:45:25,552 --> 01:45:27,219
What's up?

2053
01:45:31,524 --> 01:45:32,924
Why are you crying, soldier?

2054
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:40,132
Hey.

2055
01:45:41,667 --> 01:45:42,934
Why is he crying?

2056
01:45:42,935 --> 01:45:46,071
He's crying
because he's a queer.

2057
01:45:48,975 --> 01:45:50,175
You a queer, boy?

2058
01:45:51,744 --> 01:45:54,379
Yes, sergeant.

2059
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,453
How long you been a queer?

2060
01:46:01,454 --> 01:46:04,556
I don't know.

2061
01:46:04,557 --> 01:46:07,593
All of his fucking life.

2062
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:12,897
Don't be talking mean at him.

2063
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:17,769
Ain't two months ago,
maybe even yesterday,

2064
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:21,440
I called a kid who was a queer
a lot of awful names.

2065
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:23,775
Now I just want
to be figuring things out.

2066
01:46:25,311 --> 01:46:30,382
I don't know
what's hurting in me.

2067
01:46:32,252 --> 01:46:36,488
Oh, no, no, boy.

2068
01:46:36,489 --> 01:46:39,291
You listen to me.

2069
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:41,826
You're going to be okay.

2070
01:46:43,729 --> 01:46:45,764
There's a lot of worse things

2071
01:46:45,765 --> 01:46:49,168
Than being a queer
in this world.

2072
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:51,303
I mean,
you could have leukemia.

2073
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:52,837
That's worse.

2074
01:46:54,474 --> 01:46:57,509
I keep thinking if there was
something I could've done

2075
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:58,877
If it was different-

2076
01:46:58,878 --> 01:47:03,282
If I'd have killed more gooks

2077
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,817
Or more krauts

2078
01:47:05,818 --> 01:47:08,420
Or more dinks-

2079
01:47:09,889 --> 01:47:13,592
Or if I had a wife,
I had kids-

2080
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,394
I never had any.

2081
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:18,664
My mother did.
She died of it anyway.

2082
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:22,367
That if I let that little gook
out of that spider hole

2083
01:47:22,368 --> 01:47:24,869
He was in I was sitting on-

2084
01:47:27,907 --> 01:47:31,410
I'd let him out now
if he was in there.

2085
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:33,945
But he ain't.

2086
01:47:42,922 --> 01:47:45,190
How am I ever going
to forget it?

2087
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:50,696
That funny little guy.

2088
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:55,334
I can feel him
in there, though...

2089
01:47:57,002 --> 01:47:59,705
Bouncing and yelling under me.

2090
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:04,243
Just begging for me
to let him out.

2091
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:08,413
Just like a goddamn
charlie chaplin movie-

2092
01:48:08,414 --> 01:48:11,182
Everybody falling down
and clumsy

2093
01:48:11,183 --> 01:48:13,952
And him banging and yelling
away under there

2094
01:48:13,953 --> 01:48:18,823
And me just sitting there
looking around.

2095
01:48:18,824 --> 01:48:21,660
And he was charlie chaplin.

2096
01:48:23,896 --> 01:48:27,932
And then he blew up.

2097
01:48:27,933 --> 01:48:31,069
Maybe you was charlie chaplin,
too, sarge.

2098
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:33,104
Nah.

2099
01:48:33,105 --> 01:48:35,206
I don't know who I was.

2100
01:48:44,517 --> 01:48:46,351
And then he blew up!

2101
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:54,459
Do you think
he was singing it?

2102
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:56,395
what?

2103
01:48:56,396 --> 01:48:58,764
Do you think
he was singing it?

2104
01:48:58,765 --> 01:49:00,165
Oh, yeah.

2105
01:49:01,634 --> 01:49:04,536
Oh, yeah,
he was singing it.

2106
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,935
