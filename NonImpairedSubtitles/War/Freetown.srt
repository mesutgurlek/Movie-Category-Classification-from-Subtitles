1
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,510
Hey.

2
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,284
Krahn?

3
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:39,996
No.

4
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,595
- Is that your government car?
- Church.

5
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,722
Is that where you work?

6
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,226
I volunteer.

7
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,453
Hey! Stop!

8
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:22,121
Stop the car!

9
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:58,074
You can handle this, Brother Abubakar.

10
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,452
Make sure their needs are met
and they're kept safe.

11
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:04,205
These are fine young men, Philip.
They look up to you.

12
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,543
Once things have stabilized here,
they will be a powerful force for good.

13
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:09,919
And until then?

14
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:13,756
Keep moving forward.

15
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:09,580
- Be careful.
- I know.

16
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:12,750
Here, watch your step.

17
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,043
- Thank you.
- Watch your step.

18
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,170
Okay. Good.

19
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:19,966
Menti, where is Abubakar?

20
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,718
He'll come.

21
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,514
Should we wait for him?

22
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,850
Should we?

23
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:31,060
No. It would just worry everyone.

24
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,813
Thank you, Elder.

25
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:39,986
Are you ready?

26
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,572
Yes, I am.

27
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:14,437
Akatika Ronke Delia,

28
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:17,690
having been commissioned
of Jesus Christ...

29
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:54,185
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

30
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:05,029
I felt clean and peaceful.

31
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:07,281
You almost missed it.

32
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:09,117
I got stuck in the mud.

33
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,703
Poor thing is starting to get old.

34
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,916
And on top of that, there were rebels.

35
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,502
Children with guns, stealing car parts.

36
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,337
They stopped you?

37
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,172
No need.

38
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,924
I was a mouse in a trap.

39
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,968
I couldn't leave the car,
and that got them curious.

40
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,138
But they didn't do anything to you.

41
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,014
They asked if I was Krahn.

42
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,391
Wanted to intimidate me.

43
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:36,352
You don't need to fear us.

44
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,105
And if I'm Krahn?

45
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,440
Oh, you are not.

46
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,321
But if I am, what then?

47
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:50,116
Should I fear the rebels?

48
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:57,331
We want only to be treated fairly.

49
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:03,462
That is what we all want.

50
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:09,177
- Congratulations, Akatika.
- Thank you.

51
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:12,013
We'll be by Sunday morning
to walk with you to church.

52
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:14,015
You wait here. I'll be back for you.

53
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,391
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

54
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,603
There's still light enough.
Don't worry, Brother Abubakar.

55
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:21,063
Brother Abubakar can't help it.
He was born to worry.

56
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:23,983
It is true, you know.

57
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:29,030
My mother never worried because
I did enough for the both of us.

58
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:30,740
- You hurry back, okay?
- We will.

59
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:33,075
Let's move.

60
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:37,413
Don't worry too much.
I'm sure they'll be fine.

61
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,068
Well done, boys.

62
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:08,945
Stay safe out there in Paynesville.

63
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,571
- Stay safe in Monrovia.
- Take care of yourselves.

64
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:12,657
All right.

65
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,083
Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!

66
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,377
Hurry up!

67
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:54,865
I got the Book of Mormon.

68
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,453
Your shirt in the wardrobe.

69
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:11,966
Church isn't going to wait for us.

70
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,093
Uh-huh.

71
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,401
Your turn.

72
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:44,540
Amen.

73
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:49,211
- Are you okay?
- Why?

74
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,463
Yeah, sure.

75
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:51,589
Good.

76
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:54,800
Grab your tag.

77
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,860
- They are coming.
- Move! Move!

78
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:14,779
Move it!

79
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:17,573
Menti, are you okay?

80
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,162
Stay there. Stay there.

81
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,747
Brother, stay down. Stay down.

82
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:27,583
Get out of my way!

83
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:30,878
Get down.

84
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:35,841
Move it!

85
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:41,639
Shut up.

86
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:44,058
Doe's people will pay for his sins.

87
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,726
- I'm not Krahn.
- Really?

88
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:47,269
I'm... I'm not Krahn.

89
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:49,605
Just shut up!

90
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:57,613
It's good to see you today.

What's going on?

100
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,226
I don't know.

101
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,528
Stay down.

102
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,614
Get down. Get down.

103
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:42,134
What's going on?

104
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,056
I...

105
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:57,525
He'll have to stay inside.

106
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,569
Excuse me.

107
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,905
Sister Akatika, the missionaries,
Menti and Meyers,

108
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,281
they did not come with you
to church today?

109
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:08,369
No, I waited for them.
They didn't show up. I came by myself.

110
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:09,787
I see. I'm sorry they were not there.

111
00:16:09,912 --> 00:16:12,456
It's no problem.
I would come either way.

112
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,333
I believe you.

113
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,669
Is everything all right?

114
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:19,755
Excuse me.

115
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:23,634
Elders, we have to go now.

116
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,802
Now.

117
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:26,845
All right. All right.

118
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:28,055
Wait. I'm coming with you.

119
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:11,932
Where are you going?

120
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,602
You may want to get packed.

121
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:16,770
What are you talking about?

122
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:20,232
We're not staying here anymore.

123
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,872
We are not going anywhere.

124
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:37,166
There was much rebel activity
last night,

125
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,668
and Brothers Menti and Meyers
have not been seen.

126
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,794
Really?

127
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,713
Abubakar, easy.

128
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:45,215
Whoa, oh! Watch out! There's a car!

129
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:46,342
Sorry about that.

130
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,260
We need to get there
in one piece, Abubakar.

131
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:49,928
You're going to hit somebody
if you continue like this.

132
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:51,805
Abubakar, easy now. Come on.

133
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,768
What if something happened to them?
What will I say to President Cunningham?

134
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:59,647
I should have been there
for them this morning.

135
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,690
Save your promises.

136
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:07,780
- That's why we go to church every week.
- Maybe next.

137
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:10,574
Okay. I'll take that as a yes.

138
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:11,784
- How do you do that?
- What?

139
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,535
Talk to people so easily.

140
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,329
- Do I?
- Yeah.

141
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,790
Can't just go up to someone
you don't know like it's nothing.

142
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:19,708
Yeah, it's nothing. Just say hello.

143
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,419
- No, it's not that easy.
- Have you tried?

144
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:25,714
- I'm not good at talking to people.
- Then why are you here?

145
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,216
To teach people, I guess.

146
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:30,052
How can you teach people
if you can't talk to them?

147
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,261
I teach by example.

148
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:34,264
The example of not opening your mouth.

149
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:37,434
You open your mouth,
you're teaching people.

150
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,020
- Hey.
- Hey, missionaries.

151
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:41,980
You should come to church
with us, David.

152
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:43,732
Your goats will love it.

153
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,651
No, goats don't belong at church.

154
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,361
- Did you know that?
- What?

155
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,113
That goats don't belong at church.

156
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,906
Isn't that just nonsense?

157
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,449
I, uh...

158
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:55,202
Hey, I've seen all types at church.

159
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:56,537
You're being funny.

160
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:57,871
You're too smart for us.

161
00:18:57,996 --> 00:19:00,040
But bring you and your family
along this week.

162
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,333
Okay, I'll tell them.

163
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,502
Learn about a Good Shepherd.
Sounds good?

164
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:04,920
Yes.

165
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,296
That's my guy.

166
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:07,715
Take care, David.

167
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,551
Don't forget to bring your goats.

168
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:13,262
You see? Easy.

169
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:14,805
If you say so.

170
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:22,229
- Is that...?
- Rebels.

171
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,610
What are you doing out here?

172
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:29,903
You shouldn't be here.

173
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:32,156
We're just teaching about...

174
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:34,867
I know who you are.

175
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:36,076
Are you trying to get shot?

176
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:38,620
- They're not after missionaries.
- No.

177
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,040
They are after Krahn.

178
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:47,463
- Gaye?
- Yes.

179
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:50,507
My name. It shows that I'm a Krahn.

180
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:01,310
Shoot all the Krahn.

181
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,562
Run!

182
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,819
That way. That way. That way. Move.

183
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,613
Run away!

184
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:16,576
No, no, no, this way. Come back.
Everybody, get inside.

185
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:38,138
Kids, come on!

186
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,600
Hurry! Hurry!

187
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:47,189
Violence escalated this morning

188
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:52,069
as NPFL forces seized control
of outlying areas of Monrovia.

189
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,155
Shortages of food and water
in Paynesville

190
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,827
are forcing thousands of refugees
to plead for aid from the United Nations.

191
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:02,120
The NPFL threatens
conditions will worsen...

192
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:03,705
Hey, look out!

193
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:06,166
...as long as President Doe
controls the government.

194
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,418
President Doe's actions...

195
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:11,463
- Abubakar.
- Shh. Hang on, Elders.

196
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:14,216
We are trapped. No food. No water.

197
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,093
They shoot us if we try to escape.

198
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:19,012
Rebels are setting up checkpoints
at the edge of the city,

199
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:21,723
discouraging any who are trying to flee.

200
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:22,850
No Krahns can get by me.

201
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:27,145
I'll make sure I pull out in front
of every Krahn that crosses my path.

202
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:29,690
We can get no food, water.

203
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,317
- Our kids have been shot at.
- Come on.

204
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:35,195
Come, come. Come on.

205
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:42,452
The men who live in this apartment,
are they in here?

206
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:57,509
Whoever it is, they'll go.

207
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:01,847
Menti. Meyers. Are you there?

208
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,349
That's Forkpah.

209
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,346
Praise God you were not harmed.

210
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,724
You're making the right choice.

211
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:50,771
It isn't safe to be here any longer.

212
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:54,274
How can you teach about Jesus Christ
when people's lives are at risk?

213
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:57,277
Your mothers will be very happy
to see you.

214
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,863
He's not going home.

215
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:03,784
We're going to teach.

216
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:04,910
During the war?

217
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,080
Away from the war, where it is safe.

218
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:10,123
It's not safe in Monrovia, my brother.

219
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:11,541
It is not safe anywhere.

220
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:16,088
Then we will leave the country.

221
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,216
- Wait, what?
- He's not kidding.

222
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:21,635
Are you just gonna pack up and
drag a suitcase to Sierra Leone?

223
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,428
Selli.

224
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:25,973
Anyone have a better idea?

225
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:28,558
Lay low. Stay inside.

226
00:23:28,684 --> 00:23:31,687
You can study if you want,
but stay off the streets.

227
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,772
Brother Abubakar.

228
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:36,024
Stay out of the reach of the rebels.

229
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,235
Look. Stock food and water.

230
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,362
Let's just wait this thing out.

231
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:41,613
There's no more food.

232
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:43,281
The water is out, too.

233
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:44,825
Same with our place.

234
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,160
And power's been gone for weeks.

235
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:51,248
What if you run into the rebels
just walking down the street?

236
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:53,000
What if they shoot you
because you're Christian?

237
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,086
Or because you're tall or not,
or for whatever reason?

238
00:23:56,211 --> 00:24:00,632
Or they shoot us through our apartment
door while we're hiding like cowards.

239
00:24:00,757 --> 00:24:03,885
It is not cowardice to survive.

240
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,304
We are not going to Freetown.
It is not an option.

241
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,556
Brother Abubakar.

242
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,475
You could drive them there.

243
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,396
No. No, no, no.

244
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,981
What else can we do?

245
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:23,947
There are rebels everywhere
in the city and in the jungle.

246
00:24:24,072 --> 00:24:27,200
They're gonna set up roadblocks
and checkpoints

247
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:30,203
at every intersection
between here and the border.

248
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:33,206
Just finding petrol will take
a miracle from God.

249
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,541
Let's just wait here until...

250
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,669
We aren't any safer here
than we are in the open air.

251
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:42,549
I saw a man get shot right in front
of our apartment this morning.

252
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:45,927
It could have been any of us.

253
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:52,225
We will use the main road
out of the city.

254
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,811
But I imagine
we can run into trouble here.

255
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:56,605
Stop. All of you.

256
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:01,068
This is just too fast. We need to think.

257
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:04,237
Lives are at stake here, including ours.

258
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:08,408
I assured President Cunningham
that I was gonna keep you safe.

259
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:11,870
And he trusts that I do the right thing.

260
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:15,707
Look, I don't care if you're not gonna
teach another soul ever again.

261
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:19,086
We are not going to Freetown.

262
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,006
Hymns...

263
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:25,675
Scriptures...

264
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:28,720
The Savior...

265
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:32,808
These were not always a part of my life.

266
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:37,604
One day, I meet two men
in white shirts and ties

267
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:39,648
on the streets.

268
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:42,359
They ask me if they can share a message.

269
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:43,985
I said no.

270
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,780
It wasn't for me.

271
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:52,369
Not after some of the things
I have done.

272
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:55,163
When I turned to leave,

273
00:25:55,288 --> 00:26:01,795
Elder Menti said, "Will you pray for us?

274
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,841
Will you pray for us?"

275
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:08,510
I didn't know
who these missionaries were.

276
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:11,096
I've never been to any church before.

277
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:14,891
I've never even said a prayer before.

278
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:18,145
But those simple words stuck in my mind.

279
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:22,399
That night, before I went to bed,

280
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:25,569
I spoke out loud to God.

281
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:28,405
For the first time in my life,
I said a prayer.

282
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:32,450
I didn't even know if I did it right.

283
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:37,164
I just talked.

284
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:42,002
And it felt like
I could tell him anything.

285
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:47,132
It felt like he was
actually listening to me.

286
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,595
It was so easy.

287
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,808
Now, that was the first time
I ever said a prayer.

288
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:01,730
If you do not have a chance to
share this message with others,

289
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,649
then the rebels have already won.

290
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:09,571
We don't even know if we can get there,
let alone if we should.

291
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,823
When we leave our apartment
every morning,

292
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:13,742
we don't always know where we are going.

293
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,994
Revelation doesn't come

294
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:20,457
when we are hiding in the shadows
or sitting on the ground, asking for it.

295
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,251
It doesn't come that way.

296
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:27,088
It comes when we are out working,
without knowing where we are going,

297
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,925
constantly taking steps forward.

298
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,763
So, when do we go?

299
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:37,390
We should sleep
at the mission office tonight,

300
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:39,893
and then we'll leave
first thing tomorrow morning.

301
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:43,146
What about Gaye and Nyanforth?

302
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:44,648
I'll go to Paynesville tomorrow morning

303
00:27:44,773 --> 00:27:46,441
and tell them to meet you
at the mission office.

304
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,735
There's no time to wait.

305
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,112
No one gets left behind.

306
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:21,601
Thank you, sister.

307
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:22,852
At your service.

308
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,734
Where did all these people come from?

309
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:31,778
They are people that feel threatened.

310
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:36,408
We go with them in the morning
to the northern region,

311
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:38,159
where it's safer.

312
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:40,412
You will stay with us.

313
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:42,872
Thank you, but we cannot
leave the mission.

314
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:45,500
They're killing the Krahn.

315
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:49,462
And the rest, they take into camps.

316
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:51,965
There's not enough food here
for these people.

317
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,384
Not even for tonight.

318
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:58,805
- We will go and get something to eat.
- No. The rebels are out there.

319
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,474
Please.

320
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,810
We will be fine.

321
00:29:03,935 --> 00:29:05,353
I'll go with you.

322
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:06,730
Uh, your name.

323
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:09,107
They will question you.

324
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:12,110
They will know.

325
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,365
I will go.

326
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:28,626
Be careful.

327
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,631
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you, too.

328
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:57,822
Hey! Stop the car!

329
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,653
I will head to the field.

330
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:37,946
You see what you can find.

331
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:41,408
- And let's meet back here.
- Okay.

332
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:50,560
Where is your friend?

333
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:56,524
He went out to look for food.

334
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:59,611
And you didn't go with him?

335
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,495
It's not safe for me out there.

336
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,622
Why not?

337
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:15,210
Some men were taught to hate.

338
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:17,212
By who?

339
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:22,926
By men who were hated.

340
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,533
Hey.

341
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:53,665
Look. There.

342
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,292
Give me your weapon.

343
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,420
What is that?

344
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,930
What is that?

345
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,015
It's that fool over there.

346
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:20,817
Shoot again.

347
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:23,278
Is he Krahn?

348
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,029
He's a thief.

349
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,377
What is that?

350
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:03,109
Give me that.

351
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,607
I'm sorry.

352
00:35:32,448 --> 00:35:35,284
"And then it shall come to pass

353
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,204
that the spirits of those
who are righteous

354
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:42,834
are received into a state of happiness,
which is called paradise,

355
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:46,045
a state of rest, a state of peace,

356
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,506
where they shall rest
from all their troubles

357
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:52,176
and from all care and sorrow."

358
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:55,096
Alma chapter 40.

359
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:58,182
"Rest from all their troubles."

360
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:01,978
Seems difficult to believe
at a time like this.

361
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:06,733
It seems like at a time like this,
you have to believe.

362
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:08,359
Sure.

363
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:11,028
But death is final.

364
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:13,531
It's a lot of trouble
for you to live through

365
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:16,868
before you get
to that state of paradise.

366
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:20,371
It does not say anything
about needing to die

367
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:24,041
before you can feel paradise.

368
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:28,671
Do you want to go with them tomorrow?

369
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:31,299
Don't you?

370
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:32,717
It's dangerous.

371
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,261
So is staying here.

372
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:39,390
I'd rather find somewhere
where we can teach

373
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:42,685
than be here and trapped.

374
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,938
You can stay.
They are only killing Krahns.

375
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:47,648
No.

376
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,817
We stay together.

377
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,069
What if they catch us?

378
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:56,449
What if they identify me?

379
00:36:56,574 --> 00:36:58,868
It won't come to that.

380
00:36:58,993 --> 00:37:01,704
If someone asks you where you're from,

381
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:06,250
say you're from here,
born and raised in Paynesville.

382
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:09,086
Stand up and be counted.

383
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:15,261
Stand up, be counted, and lie.

384
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:20,223
If it means saving your life?

385
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:27,021
In the moment,

386
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:29,913
when there is a gun to your head

387
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,845
and the sun is beating down,

388
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:40,034
you must choose to live or die.

389
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:45,373
Are you really going to die
just to prove a point?

390
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:50,586
Think of all the people you'll teach
after this is all done.

391
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:59,637
The rebels are killing Krahns
just because they can.

392
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:05,184
They're not the law of Liberia,
the law of God.

393
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:11,357
I'm not telling you
to betray your tribe.

394
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:13,526
Just preserve it.

395
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:16,195
There's nothing wrong with that.

396
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:26,497
I think I liked you better
when you didn't talk.

397
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:09,744
Well, Gaye, are you sure
you want to do this?

398
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,787
Yeah.

399
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,660
- I'll shoot!
- Don't shoot!

400
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:54,080
Don't shoot!

401
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:57,333
Let's go. Move!
All of you, move! Let's go!

402
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,931
Go on.

403
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:26,237
You. Are you Krahn?

404
00:42:26,362 --> 00:42:27,655
No. I'm not Krahn.

405
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,281
- I'm Gio.
- You're lying!

406
00:42:29,406 --> 00:42:30,783
Why? Why would I lie?

407
00:42:30,908 --> 00:42:32,952
Because you fear me.

408
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:36,122
There's a Krahn dog.

409
00:42:43,337 --> 00:42:45,089
- Gaye?
- Huh.

410
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:47,007
What are you looking at?

411
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,009
Do you ever think about paradise?

412
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:50,845
This is not the end.

413
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,683
Do you ever wonder
how it feels like to be there?

414
00:42:55,808 --> 00:42:58,811
And you, little mother?

415
00:42:58,936 --> 00:43:00,688
Are you Krahn?

416
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:02,481
I'm Krahn.

417
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:05,276
There's no shame in it.

418
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:17,955
Gaye.

419
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,832
You should run.

420
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:21,417
I see my paradise.

421
00:43:22,543 --> 00:43:26,505
It is beyond the river, near the jungle.

422
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,509
Coconut palms and a salty breeze.

423
00:43:30,634 --> 00:43:33,429
I've never seen a more beautiful
place like this.

424
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:47,276
Where do you come from?

425
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:51,197
Not... Not Krahn.

426
00:43:51,322 --> 00:43:53,115
Not Krahn.

427
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:03,000
And you?

428
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:06,295
Are you a Krahn?

429
00:44:10,507 --> 00:44:12,259
Nyanforth?

430
00:44:16,138 --> 00:44:18,599
Are you a Krahn?

431
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,768
No, I'm not.

432
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:32,655
You.

433
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:36,283
Are you a Krahn?

434
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:42,414
Elder.

435
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:51,423
Elder is my title.

436
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:57,096
I am...

437
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:00,641
an ordained minister of Jesus Christ.

438
00:45:10,818 --> 00:45:13,654
Ansa! Ansa!

439
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:16,865
Ansa!

440
00:45:18,993 --> 00:45:21,120
These men...

441
00:45:21,245 --> 00:45:23,580
These are good men. I know them.

442
00:45:23,706 --> 00:45:24,999
You know them?

443
00:45:25,124 --> 00:45:27,251
They are from my church.

444
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:28,627
Let me take them.

445
00:45:28,752 --> 00:45:30,921
- I'll put them to work digging.
- This one is a Krahn.

446
00:45:31,046 --> 00:45:33,465
He will be treated as such.

447
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,444
- Menti?
- Yeah?

448
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:55,154
We don't have any bread.

449
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:57,781
What do we have?

450
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:00,159
Nothing much.

451
00:46:00,284 --> 00:46:01,952
We will make it work.

452
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:04,204
Then I'll ration it for the five of us.

453
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,956
Seven.

454
00:46:10,252 --> 00:46:12,212
They will come.

455
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:15,632
We're gonna ration them.

456
00:46:15,758 --> 00:46:19,720
I think we just have to make do
with what we have.

457
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:21,722
Yes. That's better.

458
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,974
But the food and all that... 'cause...

459
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:25,601
Oh, no.

460
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:26,727
No.

461
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:29,521
So, what do we do?

462
00:46:29,646 --> 00:46:31,774
Maybe we're gonna walk.

463
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,989
Were you born to worry?

464
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:43,327
Here.

465
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:49,333
I'm looking for the Elder.

466
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,543
The one who is Krahn.

467
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:59,134
He used to live near us in the city.

468
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:00,427
But we have not seen him.

469
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:01,804
Where?

470
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:03,972
Tell me where you lived.

471
00:47:30,624 --> 00:47:32,501
Elders?

472
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:36,880
Elders.

473
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:40,050
Elders!

474
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,300
You're looking for Elder.

475
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:31,518
What do you want from this Krahn?

476
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:48,869
What about you?

477
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:55,375
Are you a Krahn?

478
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,504
- Huh?
- No.

479
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:02,841
Lucky us.

480
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:26,281
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Quick.

481
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:28,075
Brother Meyers, Brother Menti,
We got to go. We got to go.

482
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,619
Hey, Abubakar, come on.

483
00:49:30,744 --> 00:49:32,079
Guys, we have to go.

484
00:49:32,204 --> 00:49:33,288
We have got to go.

485
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:36,458
Come on in here for prayers.

486
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,752
Menti.

487
00:49:38,877 --> 00:49:41,380
Why aren't they here?

488
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:47,636
I'll say it.

489
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:53,559
Dear God, before we depart,
we ask for thy watchful care.

490
00:49:53,684 --> 00:49:56,061
The journey we now feel prompted to take

491
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:59,106
require thy protective hands.

492
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:03,402
We are unsure as to what lies ahead,
but, Lord, we pray for the vehicle,

493
00:50:04,527 --> 00:50:07,322
that it will function properly

494
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:11,034
and be able to handle
the uncertain terrain.

495
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,498
We pray for thy children who have
sacrificed so much on our behalf.

496
00:50:16,623 --> 00:50:20,586
Help their faith to carry them
through these difficult times.

497
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:23,171
Bless those who remain,

498
00:50:23,297 --> 00:50:25,799
that their burden may be lightened.

499
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:28,844
We pray for Gaye and Nyanforth.

500
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:31,555
We've done our best...

501
00:50:33,307 --> 00:50:36,768
We've done our best to find them,

502
00:50:36,893 --> 00:50:38,645
but have been unsuccessful.

503
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,314
Comfort them, oh, Lord.

504
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:41,857
Be with them.

505
00:50:41,982 --> 00:50:44,318
Hello? Hello?

506
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:47,195
Finally, we pray for our driver...

507
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:48,864
- Is anybody there?
- ...Brother Philip Abubakar.

508
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:50,032
You must get out.

509
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:52,909
And for the safety of him
and his family...

510
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:54,870
They're coming for you... the rebels.

511
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:56,413
- ...as we strive to do...
- They are not here.

512
00:50:56,538 --> 00:50:59,207
- ...that which is impossible.
- You must leave now.

513
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:04,004
Elders!

514
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:07,341
Elders!

515
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:09,676
I'm so sorry.

516
00:51:54,805 --> 00:51:56,139
Down, down, down. Go down.

517
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:18,995
Menti? Elders?

518
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:20,288
Abubakar?

519
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:23,375
I found them in Paynesville. Let's go.

520
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,502
Elders.

521
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,425
We have to go now.

522
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:34,720
Brother Momulu,
you need to come with us.

523
00:52:34,845 --> 00:52:38,181
These rebels have nothing for you.

524
00:52:38,306 --> 00:52:40,475
I will stay. They need me.

525
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,936
You have a good heart.
Be strong, my brother.

526
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:44,855
You needn't worry.

527
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,940
I can't help it.

528
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:40,994
Where is he?

529
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,165
Now you tell me, or I'll shoot you
right here, right now.

530
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,250
Where is he?

531
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:54,174
He's been taken to Freetown.

532
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:56,301
He's not a threat, Ansa.

533
00:54:00,764 --> 00:54:03,809
Get up. You are coming with me.

534
00:54:05,227 --> 00:54:07,103
Come on. Let's go.

535
00:54:21,868 --> 00:54:24,329
- Menti's going to get hungry.
- I am fine.

536
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:28,041
- He already is.
- I am fine.

537
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,918
This is not going to be long, right?

538
00:54:30,043 --> 00:54:31,837
- Yeah, just two days, brother.
- Two days?!

539
00:54:31,962 --> 00:54:34,631
Oh. Stop for coconuts.

540
00:54:34,756 --> 00:54:35,966
Yeah. Let's do it.

541
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:37,634
Menti, I thought you said you were fine.

542
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:41,555
- Who says no to coconuts?
- Nobody does that, you know?

543
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:47,853
I can use the stones to indicate
to them for checkpoints.

544
00:54:47,978 --> 00:54:50,188
Now, if we're going to...

545
00:54:50,313 --> 00:54:53,149
Hey, guys, we got some more coconuts.

546
00:54:53,275 --> 00:54:54,317
- Selli.
- Yeah?

547
00:54:54,442 --> 00:54:56,820
Here's your coconut.

548
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:58,989
Okay, so that's all the same.

549
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:00,240
Guys, come around.

550
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,451
Guys, guys, guys, come see.
Come see. Come here.

551
00:55:03,577 --> 00:55:06,204
Okay.

552
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:08,373
We are right here.
That's our current position.

553
00:55:08,498 --> 00:55:10,542
And, now, we're going to meet
these three NPFL checkpoints.

554
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:13,003
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll go down this bridge.

555
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:14,170
There's a river.

556
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:17,465
So as soon as we turn,
we'll get to the river.

557
00:55:17,591 --> 00:55:20,594
So we'll have to cross it
and then move to the main interstate.

558
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,262
- That's Freetown?
- Yes.

559
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:24,764
Somewhere right here. Yeah.

560
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:27,851
I don't know. Is this our plan?

561
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:30,186
- And is it the map?
- Yeah, that's the map.

562
00:55:30,312 --> 00:55:32,480
Look, let's take this as...

563
00:55:32,606 --> 00:55:35,692
It's not to scale, but at least
it can explain something.

564
00:55:35,817 --> 00:55:38,403
I know Freetown is supposed to be here.

565
00:55:38,528 --> 00:55:39,988
Freetown, Freetown, Freetown.

566
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:41,281
- Freetown.
- Right here. Yeah.

567
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:42,866
Okay.

568
00:55:43,783 --> 00:55:45,785
What is the difference
between this and that?

569
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:48,663
I don't know any sign that would show,
but I know Freetown's right there.

570
00:55:48,788 --> 00:55:51,166
This is Free...
Let's say that is Freetown.

571
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,544
There's a difference between
this location and this.

572
00:55:54,669 --> 00:55:56,254
- Okay, Freetown is here.
- That's fine. Whatever.

573
00:55:56,379 --> 00:55:58,381
- That's Freetown.
- Are you guys okay? Any questions?

574
00:55:58,506 --> 00:56:01,176
The rebels, are they looking for Krahn?

575
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:04,721
The rebels are there to cause trouble.

576
00:56:04,846 --> 00:56:09,601
Most of them are there for the money,
and then some are there for food.

577
00:56:09,726 --> 00:56:14,147
And obviously, a few of them
have been paid to report the Krahn.

578
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:16,107
Or shoot them.

579
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:20,111
Elder Gaye, we won't let that happen.

580
00:56:21,696 --> 00:56:23,698
Okay, so we need to get going now.

581
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:24,991
Have to get going.

582
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:29,871
We need to go.

583
00:56:35,877 --> 00:56:38,046
Have faith, brother.

584
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,765
- Nobody say anything. I'll handle this.
- But what if they ask if we're Krahn?

585
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,351
- Or any question why...
- Just keep your mouth shut.

586
00:57:33,476 --> 00:57:34,686
Not a word, any of you.

587
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:37,230
Hey, someone is coming. Stop!

588
00:57:37,355 --> 00:57:39,941
Stop the car! Stop the car.

589
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:54,998
You want some water?

590
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,585
How many are in there?

591
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:01,546
There are seven of us in here.

592
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:48,676
We're looking for a Krahn.

593
00:58:59,312 --> 00:59:00,772
We have a message for you.

594
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:05,819
Have you heard of the restored gospel?

595
00:59:07,403 --> 00:59:12,367
We are missionaries of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

596
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:13,910
When Christ was on the Earth,

597
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:17,038
he established a church
with the priesthood authority.

598
00:59:17,163 --> 00:59:21,793
But the authority was removed
after the 12 apostles were killed.

599
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:25,338
Many years later,
Christ restored his gospel

600
00:59:25,463 --> 00:59:26,756
with the priesthood power

601
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:30,176
through a prophet
by the name Joseph Smith.

602
00:59:30,301 --> 00:59:33,304
Go on. Off.

603
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:36,766
If you receive his gospel
and repent, you will be happy.

604
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:39,811
We'd love to share more
with you and your friends.

605
00:59:39,936 --> 00:59:41,813
Wow.

606
00:59:41,938 --> 00:59:42,981
What?

607
00:59:43,106 --> 00:59:44,983
We're supposed to open
our mouth, aren't we?

608
00:59:45,108 --> 00:59:46,401
Yes, of course.

609
00:59:46,526 --> 00:59:48,153
That was really fine. Seriously.

610
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,806
We will be okay, brother.

611
01:00:16,931 --> 01:00:20,310
It was supposed to drop by now.

612
01:00:20,435 --> 01:00:23,146
Did you serve a mission, Philip?

613
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:26,065
No. I joined the church
after I got married.

614
01:00:26,191 --> 01:00:29,444
How did you find the church?

615
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:33,698
You know, before I joined the church,

616
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:40,038
I would hear about the Mormons
and their evil and strange ways.

617
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:42,790
It was never a good thing.

618
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:45,710
Then one day, I see this young man

619
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:50,298
walking by the streets,
teaching people about God.

620
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:52,926
Then I started to pay close attention.

621
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:55,220
But it was never like people would say.

622
01:00:55,345 --> 01:00:59,515
And even when people would not
listen to them, they could...

623
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:03,061
They would even show kindness
and sometimes even help.

624
01:01:04,938 --> 01:01:06,731
Then I thought to myself,

625
01:01:06,856 --> 01:01:12,695
"What type of evil would
compel people to do such good?"

626
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,573
I just couldn't figure it out.

627
01:01:15,698 --> 01:01:17,200
It didn't make sense to me.

628
01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:20,703
Cognitive dissonance.

629
01:01:20,828 --> 01:01:22,413
Yeah.

630
01:01:22,538 --> 01:01:24,874
Confusion.

631
01:01:24,999 --> 01:01:29,379
When you learn a truth that conflicts
with what you already believe,

632
01:01:29,504 --> 01:01:32,340
your mind isn't comfortable with it.

633
01:01:34,634 --> 01:01:37,095
You know, the church used
to have a policy

634
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:41,724
that excluded Africans
from the priesthood.

635
01:01:43,017 --> 01:01:49,857
We were banned, not allowed, denied.

636
01:01:50,817 --> 01:01:55,822
I remember learning about it
after joining the church.

637
01:01:55,947 --> 01:01:58,157
Here I was,

638
01:01:58,283 --> 01:02:03,204
one of the first Liberians
to be baptized into the church.

639
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:05,623
One of the first priesthood holders

640
01:02:05,748 --> 01:02:07,792
in the country.

641
01:02:10,044 --> 01:02:14,632
The priesthood has changed my life
more than I could ever hope for.

642
01:02:22,265 --> 01:02:24,809
Talk about confusion.

643
01:02:28,229 --> 01:02:31,941
Doesn't God love all his children?

644
01:02:32,066 --> 01:02:36,571
Why would his organization,
which is truly led by a prophet,

645
01:02:36,696 --> 01:02:41,576
have such a racist policy?

646
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:44,495
I couldn't get my head around it.

647
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:47,790
Cognitive dissonance.

648
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,461
But you did.

649
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:54,172
God allows us to change.

650
01:02:54,297 --> 01:02:55,882
He wants us to change.

651
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:58,843
The power of the atonement

652
01:02:58,968 --> 01:03:03,056
is that Christ died for everyone.

653
01:03:03,181 --> 01:03:07,247
Being able to change, to improve,

654
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:10,255
to move forward,

655
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,982
it is for everyone.

656
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,614
When one person changes for good,

657
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:24,744
God forgives and rejoices.

658
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:27,538
You know, it felt like
the same way when I joined.

659
01:03:27,663 --> 01:03:29,499
How long ago was that?

660
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:32,043
That was about five years ago.

661
01:03:32,168 --> 01:03:34,379
Five years.

662
01:03:35,421 --> 01:03:37,590
Now look at where we are.

663
01:03:40,635 --> 01:03:42,637
Worst mistake ever.

664
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:15,253
There were some missionaries driving
on this road. Did you see them?

665
01:04:15,378 --> 01:04:17,213
There were some missionaries
all in white.

666
01:04:17,338 --> 01:04:20,341
How long ago did they pass through?

667
01:04:20,466 --> 01:04:22,969
Maybe an hour ago.

668
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:25,513
Lift the gate. Lift the gate.

669
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:53,875
They need you.

670
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,210
And what about you and your mother?

671
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:58,588
I'll care for her, as usual.

672
01:04:58,713 --> 01:05:01,007
We could keep her in the mission office

673
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:03,259
or even in the church.

674
01:05:04,844 --> 01:05:06,762
Philip, they're here to teach,

675
01:05:06,888 --> 01:05:09,140
and you cannot ask them
to waste their time.

676
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:13,227
They should go back to their families,
move on with their lives

677
01:05:13,352 --> 01:05:16,731
instead of being
a horrible burden on everyone.

678
01:05:16,856 --> 01:05:17,982
Burden?

679
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:20,693
Is it a burden to serve?

680
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:24,697
Is it a burden to help someone in need?

681
01:05:24,822 --> 01:05:29,660
You don't pray to have more faith
and just expect it to come.

682
01:06:02,109 --> 01:06:04,820
- Can we get through?
- Unh-unh.

683
01:06:04,946 --> 01:06:07,240
Not unless we move it out ourselves.

684
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,702
I'll go have a look.

685
01:07:51,677 --> 01:07:55,431
They're all passed out.
Meyers, come help me.

686
01:07:56,682 --> 01:07:58,684
Don't make any noise.

687
01:07:59,894 --> 01:08:01,437
Here.

688
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:03,688
What are you doing with these?

689
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,609
Saving lives.

690
01:08:15,368 --> 01:08:17,870
I'll go out and help them.

691
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:19,413
No, no, no. This is faster.

692
01:08:19,538 --> 01:08:21,791
We need to be ready to go
if they wake up.

693
01:08:24,543 --> 01:08:26,295
They're not waking up.

694
01:08:43,104 --> 01:08:45,022
Hurry.

695
01:08:57,326 --> 01:09:00,746
No, no, no. Go put it back.
Go put it back. Go.

696
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,386
Is someone there?

697
01:09:17,096 --> 01:09:18,431
- Menti, freeze!
- Hey, stop!

698
01:09:18,556 --> 01:09:19,974
Freeze!

699
01:09:20,099 --> 01:09:21,684
Hey, hey. Stop!

700
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:22,852
Menti!

701
01:09:22,977 --> 01:09:24,395
Meyers, get in the car.
He's going to shoot.

702
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,480
- Menti!
- Hey, stop!

703
01:09:26,605 --> 01:09:28,524
Start the car.

704
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:30,401
Where are the keys?

705
01:09:32,945 --> 01:09:34,739
- Can you be any more louder?
- I'm sorry.

706
01:09:34,864 --> 01:09:36,449
I didn't know
it would fall apart like that.

707
01:09:36,574 --> 01:09:39,869
But wait, how did you know
he wouldn't shoot?

708
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:43,706
Because you can't shoot
what you don't have.

709
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:48,836
- What are you doing with that?
- It's okay, brother.

710
01:09:48,961 --> 01:09:52,840
Brother Philip, we'll give it
to someone in need.

711
01:10:06,604 --> 01:10:08,272
Abubakar, we should pull over.

712
01:10:08,397 --> 01:10:10,357
We need to get some rest.

713
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:24,288
So, we're going to sleep here,
and everyone takes watch for an hour.

714
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:26,165
- 90 minutes.
- Why does it matter?

715
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:29,293
Because a full R.E.M. cycle is
90 minutes, and it's more healthful.

716
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:31,670
- Okay, whatever.
- So, where are we sleeping?

717
01:10:31,796 --> 01:10:33,047
- Where are we sleeping?
- Just find a spot.

718
01:10:33,172 --> 01:10:35,090
- Who takes watch first?
- Where are we sleeping?

719
01:10:35,216 --> 01:10:36,425
I'll go. I'll watch first.

720
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,302
You watch first. Okay, good.

721
01:10:38,427 --> 01:10:40,805
We'll just make camp here.

722
01:10:43,516 --> 01:10:45,017
I'll make a bed.

723
01:10:45,142 --> 01:10:46,602
Everybody okay?

724
01:10:46,727 --> 01:10:47,603
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

725
01:10:47,728 --> 01:10:49,522
Do not disturb me.

726
01:11:42,575 --> 01:11:44,910
It's my turn to watch.

727
01:11:49,832 --> 01:11:51,625
You're gonna need this.

728
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:56,130
Nyanforth said you were
face-to-face with a Krahn killer.

729
01:11:57,298 --> 01:11:59,091
Momulu saved us.

730
01:11:59,216 --> 01:12:01,594
His timing was lucky.

731
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:03,762
He interfered?

732
01:12:03,888 --> 01:12:05,514
Yes.

733
01:12:06,724 --> 01:12:09,476
Maybe there is hope for him.

734
01:12:09,602 --> 01:12:11,937
All in God's time.

735
01:12:12,897 --> 01:12:17,151
I was standing there
at the end of this row of people.

736
01:12:17,276 --> 01:12:21,864
I watched as the guard
interrogated each person.

737
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:24,283
I kept wondering,

738
01:12:24,408 --> 01:12:27,745
"Is it fair for anyone
to die like this?"

739
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:32,958
It was just as Nyanforth
had suggested the night before,

740
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:38,672
being faced with the choice
to live or to die.

741
01:12:38,797 --> 01:12:43,552
I was ready to lie
when the question came.

742
01:12:43,677 --> 01:12:47,848
I wanted to be brave and tell the truth.

743
01:12:49,391 --> 01:12:53,687
But there was an old woman before us.

744
01:12:53,812 --> 01:12:55,940
She was brave.

745
01:12:58,567 --> 01:13:01,820
But he shot her without blinking.

746
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:05,532
I didn't want to be brave after that.

747
01:13:05,658 --> 01:13:09,578
It didn't seem worth it.

748
01:13:10,829 --> 01:13:13,791
I was afraid.

749
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:16,627
You should not feel bad about that.

750
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,051
Scripture says, "Fear not."

751
01:13:24,176 --> 01:13:29,431
Isaiah, Samuel, Moroni.

752
01:13:29,556 --> 01:13:33,644
Look at where you are
and what you're doing.

753
01:13:33,769 --> 01:13:37,481
You could have
stayed in the city and hid.

754
01:13:37,606 --> 01:13:40,818
But you are here,

755
01:13:40,943 --> 01:13:45,155
moving forward, trying to live.

756
01:13:47,449 --> 01:13:52,663
Is it brave just to try to live?

757
01:13:52,788 --> 01:13:55,499
It is brave to face your fears.

758
01:14:04,758 --> 01:14:06,552
Yeah.

759
01:14:18,397 --> 01:14:19,523
Soldier.

760
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:22,860
Lift gate. Lift gate.

761
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:28,258
Do you see something?

762
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,261
Just an abandoned car.

763
01:15:31,386 --> 01:15:32,971
Why are you protecting him?

764
01:15:33,097 --> 01:15:35,474
Protecting who, Ansa?

765
01:15:37,017 --> 01:15:39,895
Liberia will suffer for Doe's actions.

766
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:43,398
He must be stopped.

767
01:15:43,524 --> 01:15:46,944
Doe favors his people above others.

768
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:50,239
He stole the power of the government,

769
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:52,616
and he is there illegally.

770
01:15:52,741 --> 01:15:54,118
He holds it over us,

771
01:15:54,243 --> 01:15:57,955
giving positions of leadership
to his people.

772
01:15:59,164 --> 01:16:03,252
The Krahns think
they are all better than us.

773
01:16:05,838 --> 01:16:09,800
This boy you're protecting
is one of them.

774
01:16:12,845 --> 01:16:16,140
They are responsible for this war.

775
01:16:16,265 --> 01:16:20,394
They are responsible
for the death of my father,

776
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:25,816
my mother, and my two younger brothers.

777
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:29,444
I will not stop
hunting and killing Krahns

778
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:33,031
until they are all gone.

779
01:16:34,867 --> 01:16:37,494
Liberia will not be well with them.

780
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:39,454
Never.

781
01:16:46,086 --> 01:16:48,255
Hatred breeds hatred.

782
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,385
We'll catch them at the border.

783
01:17:09,193 --> 01:17:11,195
- Good morning, Menti.
- You're wearing a tie?

784
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,362
Yeah.

785
01:17:12,487 --> 01:17:14,531
- You want some breakfast?
- Everybody happy now?

786
01:17:14,656 --> 01:17:15,949
Did you sleep well?

787
01:17:16,074 --> 01:17:17,868
Ooh, that stinks.

788
01:17:17,993 --> 01:17:19,411
Let's go over there.

789
01:17:19,536 --> 01:17:21,872
- Want some breakfast?
- Not if it's yams.

790
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:23,624
I think I slept on it wrong.

791
01:17:30,923 --> 01:17:32,758
One more day until we are free.

792
01:17:32,883 --> 01:17:34,968
One more day until we can teach.

793
01:17:35,093 --> 01:17:37,846
One more day until this car can rest.

794
01:18:12,172 --> 01:18:13,382
Abubakar, slow down.

795
01:18:13,507 --> 01:18:15,217
- Slow down.
- Lots of kids here.

796
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:16,718
Slow down. Slow down.

797
01:18:21,223 --> 01:18:24,851
- Don't fight. Don't fight. Don't fight.
- Hey.

798
01:18:24,977 --> 01:18:26,061
Watch it. Watch it.

799
01:18:26,186 --> 01:18:27,854
Hey, hey, hey.

800
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,106
These are some kids.

801
01:18:29,231 --> 01:18:31,024
- Tell them something, Selli.
- What?

802
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:33,819
Teach them something, anything.

803
01:18:33,944 --> 01:18:35,279
Take the Book of Mormon.

804
01:18:35,404 --> 01:18:36,947
This is Joseph Smith.

805
01:18:37,072 --> 01:18:40,075
He was a prophet. He could hear God.

806
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,035
Selli, come down. I know you're happy.
Come on.

807
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,746
Okay, here you go. Take this one.

808
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:47,624
This is Jesus Christ.
He's the Son of God.

809
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:50,711
Come here. Come here.
Everybody, come around.

810
01:18:50,836 --> 01:18:53,255
Be careful. Yes. You are getting there.

811
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,465
- Teach them something. Anything.
- Take the Book of Mormon.

812
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:58,593
- Give him one.
- Step out, step out.

813
01:18:58,719 --> 01:18:59,803
- Watch out. Watch out.
- Watches over you.

814
01:18:59,928 --> 01:19:01,805
No, no, no, no, that's my tie.

815
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:04,224
Give one to your friends.
Yeah, and you, too. Okay.

816
01:19:04,349 --> 01:19:06,226
And you, and you, and you. Okay.

817
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:08,061
That's it. And you.

818
01:19:08,186 --> 01:19:10,397
And everybody.
He watches over all of us.

819
01:19:10,522 --> 01:19:11,815
We are finally teaching.

820
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,567
I'll be fine. I don't care. Just go.

821
01:19:13,692 --> 01:19:15,360
No matter what,
he's always there for us.

822
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:16,611
Come on, Selli. Get back in.

823
01:19:16,737 --> 01:19:19,364
- He loves you.
- He'll always loves you.

824
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:20,741
Come on.

825
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:00,155
What's going on?

826
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,451
The puddle.
I bet it's all mud underneath.

827
01:20:04,576 --> 01:20:06,328
Can you go around?

828
01:20:07,913 --> 01:20:11,041
Everything's marshy and wet.

829
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:12,626
Meyers, let's take a look.

830
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:14,294
Okay.

831
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,927
Huh.

832
01:20:24,429 --> 01:20:26,765
I think we can make it through.

833
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,600
Doesn't look bad, that side.

834
01:20:28,725 --> 01:20:30,519
- Think so?
- Yeah.

835
01:20:30,644 --> 01:20:33,855
Abubakar, can you drive through it?

836
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,858
Yeah. I've done it once.

837
01:20:46,827 --> 01:20:48,161
Wow.

838
01:20:48,286 --> 01:20:50,163
- Let's do it. I think we can make it.
- Guys, guys, guys.

839
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:52,249
If the water has been sitting
for a while,

840
01:20:52,374 --> 01:20:53,792
the ground will be very, very soft.

841
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:56,253
Meyers, nobody cares. Let's just do it.

842
01:20:58,505 --> 01:20:59,589
Then go ahead.

843
01:20:59,714 --> 01:21:01,675
I will walk.

844
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,597
Well?

845
01:21:07,722 --> 01:21:09,266
Yeah. We'll go, then.

846
01:21:10,976 --> 01:21:13,895
Just give it enough gas,
and we'll go right through.

847
01:21:17,065 --> 01:21:18,567
Have faith, brother.

848
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,028
God, I pray to you, better be right.

849
01:21:29,536 --> 01:21:30,620
Come on, now.

850
01:21:30,745 --> 01:21:32,497
Come on. Yeah.

851
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:34,583
More gas, more gas, more gas.

852
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:37,002
- Step on it.
- More gas.

853
01:21:37,127 --> 01:21:38,336
Let's go. Let's go.

854
01:21:38,462 --> 01:21:39,880
- Abubakar, let's go.
- Do it.

855
01:21:41,715 --> 01:21:44,092
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

856
01:22:00,358 --> 01:22:02,486
Oh, my gosh.

857
01:22:02,611 --> 01:22:03,695
Oh, that was good.

858
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:07,574
Shh. Here he comes. Here he comes.

859
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:10,535
Nobody say anything.

860
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,787
Hey, wipe off before you get in.

861
01:22:12,913 --> 01:22:15,624
Well, we don't have the faith
to walk on water.

862
01:22:15,749 --> 01:22:17,876
But we sure can drive through it.

863
01:22:31,389 --> 01:22:33,600
Rebels again?

864
01:22:33,725 --> 01:22:34,976
These ones look serious.

865
01:22:35,101 --> 01:22:36,269
Rebel or national?

866
01:22:36,394 --> 01:22:38,438
Does it matter?

867
01:22:38,563 --> 01:22:41,441
Nyanforth, don't say anything.

868
01:22:46,988 --> 01:22:48,281
Why so many in the car?

869
01:22:48,406 --> 01:22:50,575
We don't have a church van.

870
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:54,371
You have to pay for each passenger.

871
01:22:55,497 --> 01:22:57,666
We have very little money on us.

872
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:59,417
Huh?

873
01:22:59,543 --> 01:23:02,921
Pay. Or turn around and go back.

874
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:04,172
Do we even have money?

875
01:23:04,297 --> 01:23:07,217
- Bring out the little we have.
- Yeah.

876
01:23:10,011 --> 01:23:11,429
I have a toothbrush.

877
01:23:11,555 --> 01:23:14,599
Toothbrush? What are they
gonna use a toothbrush for?

878
01:23:14,724 --> 01:23:16,309
All right. All right.

879
01:23:16,434 --> 01:23:17,936
Quiet.

880
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:19,104
What are we missing?

881
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:21,147
- I need this pen.
- For what?

882
01:23:21,273 --> 01:23:23,233
No, this is good.

883
01:23:27,404 --> 01:23:29,656
This is all we have.

884
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:39,499
Uh, this is enough for five.

885
01:23:42,127 --> 01:23:44,337
Wait, wait. Here.

886
01:23:44,462 --> 01:23:46,923
- Please. Here.
- That's for petrol.

887
01:23:47,048 --> 01:23:48,383
- Take. Please take it.
- Okay.

888
01:23:48,508 --> 01:23:49,551
- Six.
- We don't have any more money.

889
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:51,052
That's it. That's all we have.

890
01:23:51,177 --> 01:23:53,638
- My friend, I said six.
- Wait.

891
01:23:53,763 --> 01:23:56,308
- I have something.
- What?

892
01:24:26,379 --> 01:24:28,590
Forkpah, Forkpah, Forkpah,
pay attention.

893
01:24:28,715 --> 01:24:30,008
Look at this.

894
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:35,138
Three, two, one.

895
01:24:35,263 --> 01:24:37,057
Dead.

896
01:24:37,182 --> 01:24:41,519
God. That's the last drop.

897
01:24:43,438 --> 01:24:45,106
All right.

898
01:24:45,231 --> 01:24:46,608
I knew it, chosen ones.

899
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:48,735
This is the end of the line.

900
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:50,278
We are not there yet.

901
01:24:50,403 --> 01:24:52,238
I know we are not there yet.

902
01:24:52,364 --> 01:24:55,200
But this is how far
your faith will get us.

903
01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:00,246
So much for, "We will be okay, brother.

904
01:25:00,372 --> 01:25:02,457
- We will be okay."
- We will be okay, brother.

905
01:25:02,582 --> 01:25:05,210
Yeah, we'll be okay.
We'll be okay walking to Freetown.

906
01:25:05,335 --> 01:25:08,672
Even a traveling band of miracle workers
cannot predict everything.

907
01:25:08,797 --> 01:25:10,799
Oh, Brother Abubakar, take it easy.
Where is your faith?

908
01:25:10,924 --> 01:25:14,427
Can't you see I'm easy? I'm so easy.
I've got faith... loads of it.

909
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:16,805
- I was just saying if I just...
- Guys.

910
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:19,724
There's a petrol station right here.

911
01:25:21,184 --> 01:25:22,560
You hear that?

912
01:25:22,686 --> 01:25:24,854
Come on. Let's go.

913
01:25:24,979 --> 01:25:26,147
- Come on.
- Brother Abubakar.

914
01:25:26,272 --> 01:25:28,566
- Abubakar.
- Faith. Faith!

915
01:25:28,692 --> 01:25:30,276
Let's go!

916
01:25:36,241 --> 01:25:37,659
Okay, it's okay.

917
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:40,453
They were asking for
$85 a gallon in Paynesville.

918
01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:43,248
That's $85 more than we have.

919
01:25:43,373 --> 01:25:45,458
Just say a prayer
and hope they are kind to us.

920
01:26:02,684 --> 01:26:05,520
You have been traveling for long?

921
01:26:05,645 --> 01:26:07,814
Yes, sir. We've been traveling for long.

922
01:26:07,939 --> 01:26:10,567
And it's not been easy.

923
01:26:10,692 --> 01:26:13,862
Not at all. It's not been easy.

924
01:26:22,162 --> 01:26:24,748
We will need your help.

925
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:30,295
We want to buy petrol,
but we don't have any money.

926
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:35,759
We can give anything...
everything that we have.

927
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:40,472
You've been traveling with your sons?

928
01:26:41,973 --> 01:26:43,767
They are not my sons.

929
01:26:43,892 --> 01:26:45,310
Not your sons?

930
01:26:45,435 --> 01:26:50,106
I guess, in a way, you can say they are.

931
01:26:50,231 --> 01:26:55,403
And you have all of them
in that tiny car?

932
01:26:55,528 --> 01:26:56,696
Yes.

933
01:26:56,821 --> 01:26:58,490
All the way from Monrovia.

934
01:26:58,615 --> 01:27:00,492
Monrovia?

935
01:27:00,617 --> 01:27:02,619
And where are you going?

936
01:27:02,744 --> 01:27:04,704
Freetown.

937
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:10,710
How far away from the border?

938
01:27:10,835 --> 01:27:12,212
Oh, not far.

939
01:27:12,337 --> 01:27:14,839
But you must be careful, hmm?

940
01:27:14,964 --> 01:27:17,634
The road is very bad.

941
01:27:17,759 --> 01:27:22,138
And even though you are close,
you still have to drive slowly.

942
01:27:22,263 --> 01:27:24,182
I will do that, sir.

943
01:27:24,307 --> 01:27:27,852
And soon, you will catch up
with your friend.

944
01:27:29,771 --> 01:27:32,649
Earlier on, a man came here

945
01:27:32,774 --> 01:27:35,610
looking for a bunch of men wearing white

946
01:27:35,735 --> 01:27:40,907
and claiming he was very anxious
to catch up with you.

947
01:27:43,326 --> 01:27:45,328
Don't worry.

948
01:27:45,453 --> 01:27:47,288
I will help you, hmm?

949
01:27:47,413 --> 01:27:49,624
I will help you.

950
01:28:05,098 --> 01:28:06,391
Open the trunk.

951
01:28:07,725 --> 01:28:09,310
- Give it to him.
- What?

952
01:28:09,435 --> 01:28:11,437
All of it.

953
01:28:22,323 --> 01:28:25,952
That should be enough to take you there.

954
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:11,956
We are not far from the border.

955
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,127
What if you don't find them, Ansa?

956
01:29:16,252 --> 01:29:19,339
- We will find them.
- And what if we don't?

957
01:29:19,464 --> 01:29:25,511
We must find them because if we don't...

958
01:29:25,637 --> 01:29:27,388
I will deal with you.

959
01:29:27,513 --> 01:29:29,307
I'll make sure that you

960
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:34,187
and any other person
you care about wish that we had.

961
01:29:47,158 --> 01:29:48,368
Help me.

962
01:29:48,493 --> 01:29:49,494
Is it okay now?

963
01:29:49,619 --> 01:29:51,788
Yeah, it's okay. We're good to go, guys.

964
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,214
Philip, let's go faster.

965
01:30:01,339 --> 01:30:02,966
Look, I can't go any faster.

966
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:05,259
We have to be careful of the tires.

967
01:30:05,385 --> 01:30:07,720
There are rocks all over the place.

968
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:09,347
I wish you guys could be
up front here to see it.

969
01:30:09,472 --> 01:30:12,558
If I should get out and walk,
we could get there faster.

970
01:30:17,605 --> 01:30:19,732
Hey!

971
01:30:21,567 --> 01:30:24,862
Keep going. Now we're
really making good time.

972
01:30:24,988 --> 01:30:26,781
- Philip.
- Yes?

973
01:30:26,906 --> 01:30:27,949
The rocks are very small.

974
01:30:28,074 --> 01:30:29,742
Oh, look. Look.
We just got two more bumps.

975
01:30:29,867 --> 01:30:32,495
No.

976
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,789
It is still bumpy.

977
01:30:34,914 --> 01:30:36,541
- The rebels.
- Abubakar.

978
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,667
Guys, come, come.

979
01:30:39,335 --> 01:30:41,295
- It's not good for my shoes.
- Did you see that one?

980
01:30:45,133 --> 01:30:46,509
I can't believe Abubakar
is making us do this.

981
01:30:46,634 --> 01:30:48,261
Philip.

982
01:30:48,386 --> 01:30:50,221
You're a good driver.

983
01:30:50,346 --> 01:30:52,640
- Hey, need some help?
- Hello.

984
01:30:52,765 --> 01:30:55,143
You have a good driver.

985
01:30:55,268 --> 01:30:57,103
He's a good man.

986
01:30:57,854 --> 01:30:58,938
Everywhere is clear.

987
01:31:00,398 --> 01:31:03,317
Philip, don't try me. I'm warning you.

988
01:31:03,443 --> 01:31:05,528
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- This is your last chance.

989
01:31:05,653 --> 01:31:08,823
Abubakar, you should get out
so that you can jog.

990
01:31:08,948 --> 01:31:10,366
How was the exercise?

991
01:31:10,491 --> 01:31:11,576
Tolerable.

992
01:31:11,701 --> 01:31:12,994
Scoot over.

993
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:15,413
I can't take this.

994
01:31:17,957 --> 01:31:18,958
Thank you.

995
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:21,085
Next time, I'll drive. You jog.

996
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:23,046
I think Menti's hungry.

997
01:31:28,718 --> 01:31:30,928
I'm ready for this trip
to be over, guys.

998
01:31:31,054 --> 01:31:33,056
Endure to the end, brother.

999
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:36,809
I don't think my end
can endure much more.

1000
01:31:36,934 --> 01:31:39,562
I wouldn't be opposed to a shower.

1001
01:31:39,687 --> 01:31:41,189
I wouldn't be opposed
to you having a shower.

1002
01:31:41,314 --> 01:31:43,066
When do you think
things will be back to normal?

1003
01:31:43,191 --> 01:31:45,359
- Normal?
- Yes.

1004
01:31:45,485 --> 01:31:46,736
Define "normal."

1005
01:31:46,861 --> 01:31:48,446
I don't know.

1006
01:31:48,571 --> 01:31:53,576
We can go outside and not talk about
all the things that we have seen.

1007
01:31:53,701 --> 01:31:57,747
The rebels, the killings,
and the hatred.

1008
01:31:57,872 --> 01:31:59,082
Never.

1009
01:31:59,207 --> 01:32:02,210
There will always be more of it
if we keep allowing it.

1010
01:32:04,045 --> 01:32:05,463
That's bleak, man.

1011
01:32:05,588 --> 01:32:07,298
He's right.

1012
01:32:07,423 --> 01:32:10,009
Maybe. Just seems bleak.

1013
01:32:10,134 --> 01:32:13,346
It is if you see it that way.

1014
01:32:13,471 --> 01:32:15,389
But the fact is

1015
01:32:15,515 --> 01:32:19,852
there are going to be permanent
consequences to all our actions.

1016
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:22,772
The families that were displaced,

1017
01:32:22,897 --> 01:32:27,026
the lives that were lost...

1018
01:32:27,151 --> 01:32:29,320
Those things
can never be back to normal.

1019
01:32:29,445 --> 01:32:32,323
And there will always be more of it...

1020
01:32:32,448 --> 01:32:37,578
more fighting, more wars, more racism.

1021
01:32:37,703 --> 01:32:42,083
Nothing that can be done
can make that better.

1022
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:45,294
But you cannot argue over spilled water.

1023
01:32:45,419 --> 01:32:49,090
You cannot dwell
on the injustice of the past,

1024
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:52,510
but rather anticipate
hope of the future.

1025
01:33:11,946 --> 01:33:13,197
Elders, look.

1026
01:33:14,615 --> 01:33:17,827
If we hurry, we can make it before dark.
Look. Just get your passports ready.

1027
01:33:19,203 --> 01:33:21,956
Anyone need their bags?

1028
01:33:22,957 --> 01:33:24,417
Anyone?

1029
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:25,710
Menti?

1030
01:33:25,835 --> 01:33:26,919
Selli? Anyone?

1031
01:33:27,044 --> 01:33:28,754
Get your papers ready.

1032
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,757
Anyone need their bag?

1033
01:33:31,883 --> 01:33:33,259
Forkpah?

1034
01:33:33,384 --> 01:33:34,886
- Brother Abubakar.
- Nyanforth.

1035
01:33:35,011 --> 01:33:37,263
Yes?

1036
01:33:58,242 --> 01:34:01,078
What were you thinking?!

1037
01:34:01,204 --> 01:34:03,581
That you don't have a passport
to get across the border?!

1038
01:34:03,706 --> 01:34:06,959
What, you think you could just show up
and shout scripture, sing a hymn,

1039
01:34:07,084 --> 01:34:09,045
and they'll let you cross?

1040
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:11,839
- That is not the way things work!
- We didn't know.

1041
01:34:11,964 --> 01:34:14,217
Some of us have never left
the country before.

1042
01:34:14,342 --> 01:34:16,385
Clearly! And we aren't
gonna tell them that!

1043
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:19,305
"Sorry, forgive us that we're
not abiding by your laws.

1044
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:21,933
We've never left the country."

1045
01:34:23,142 --> 01:34:24,268
I've been traveling for two days

1046
01:34:24,393 --> 01:34:27,271
with barely enough sleep
and barely enough food,

1047
01:34:27,396 --> 01:34:30,858
listening to your miracle stories
and faith-promoting coincidences.

1048
01:34:30,983 --> 01:34:33,444
And yet, not one of you
would just sit down to think

1049
01:34:33,569 --> 01:34:35,363
that if you would just take
a little time to prepare,

1050
01:34:35,488 --> 01:34:40,701
then God wouldn't have to work
so hard to watch out for you!

1051
01:34:54,924 --> 01:34:56,550
Look. I'm...

1052
01:34:56,676 --> 01:34:59,762
Look. I'm sorry, okay?

1053
01:34:59,887 --> 01:35:02,640
It's just that we've worked so hard,

1054
01:35:02,765 --> 01:35:06,769
and a lot has happened
to get us this far.

1055
01:35:06,894 --> 01:35:12,066
And it's been, like,
miracle after miracle.

1056
01:35:13,818 --> 01:35:16,153
Then why are you doubting?

1057
01:35:19,907 --> 01:35:23,369
Is faith supposed to be this exhausting?

1058
01:35:26,038 --> 01:35:28,457
Let's finish this.

1059
01:36:09,874 --> 01:36:12,418
You mind telling me
how this fits into the plan?

1060
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:18,841
There's nothing
we could have done differently.

1061
01:36:18,966 --> 01:36:23,137
All the preparation in the world
wouldn't have opened this bridge for us.

1062
01:36:23,262 --> 01:36:26,098
So, what do we do?

1063
01:36:27,767 --> 01:36:33,064
We find a place to sleep
and head back in the morning.

1064
01:36:46,744 --> 01:36:48,162
So, the scripture teaches us

1065
01:36:48,287 --> 01:36:50,706
that in the deal of faith
among the children of men,

1066
01:36:50,831 --> 01:36:52,792
God can do a miracle of wonder.

1067
01:36:52,917 --> 01:36:56,295
Therefore, he showed not himself
until after they had faith.

1068
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,672
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
- Yes, of course.

1069
01:36:58,798 --> 01:37:00,883
I want to show you.

1070
01:37:04,762 --> 01:37:06,639
Will you be willing to pray for peace?

1071
01:37:06,764 --> 01:37:08,557
Definitely, I will.

1072
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:17,316
At least we got to see
Sierra Leone, sort of.

1073
01:37:17,441 --> 01:37:19,527
Yeah.

1074
01:37:19,652 --> 01:37:23,989
But would the Lord bring us
this far only to turn us away?

1075
01:37:24,115 --> 01:37:26,700
Did we do all we can?

1076
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:36,460
Philip?

1077
01:37:36,585 --> 01:37:38,796
Where are you going?

1078
01:37:38,921 --> 01:37:41,924
Just going for a walk.

1079
01:37:42,049 --> 01:37:44,677
Look, stay by the car, would you?

1080
01:39:07,384 --> 01:39:11,347
What are we doing here
if we're going to be turned away?

1081
01:39:11,472 --> 01:39:14,391
What good is it?

1082
01:39:15,476 --> 01:39:17,144
You control everything.

1083
01:39:17,269 --> 01:39:20,189
Through your son, you've shown power

1084
01:39:20,314 --> 01:39:24,485
to even feed thousands.

1085
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:28,405
You've calmed the seas
and even walked on water.

1086
01:39:50,177 --> 01:39:52,555
Water.

1087
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:02,314
Thank you, God.

1088
01:40:02,439 --> 01:40:05,568
Walk on water.

1089
01:40:41,937 --> 01:40:43,230
Hey. Good morning.

1090
01:40:43,355 --> 01:40:44,773
Forkpah.

1091
01:40:46,275 --> 01:40:47,610
Selli.

1092
01:40:47,735 --> 01:40:48,861
It's a good day to teach.

1093
01:40:48,986 --> 01:40:50,696
Gaye.

1094
01:40:50,821 --> 01:40:52,031
Hey. Good morning.

1095
01:40:52,156 --> 01:40:54,366
Menti. Meyers.

1096
01:40:54,491 --> 01:40:55,492
Nyanforth.

1097
01:41:00,414 --> 01:41:01,415
Hey.

1098
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,250
Wake up.

1099
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:05,711
Guys, let's go.

1100
01:41:08,088 --> 01:41:10,049
What? What's happened?

1101
01:41:10,174 --> 01:41:12,468
- Good morning.
- Is it?

1102
01:41:12,593 --> 01:41:14,178
What did I miss?

1103
01:41:14,303 --> 01:41:16,597
A glorious sunrise.

1104
01:41:19,183 --> 01:41:21,935
- Good morning, Abubakar.
- Selli, good morning.

1105
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:23,771
- Good morning.
- Let's go.

1106
01:41:23,896 --> 01:41:26,523
Up. Hey, come on, guys.

1107
01:41:26,649 --> 01:41:28,359
We're going to Freetown today.

1108
01:41:28,484 --> 01:41:29,902
What? How do you know that?

1109
01:41:30,027 --> 01:41:36,992
Because you, my brother,
are serving an all-powerful God.

1110
01:41:59,556 --> 01:42:02,017
The Lord provides a way.

1111
01:42:03,769 --> 01:42:05,104
Yes, he does.

1112
01:42:05,229 --> 01:42:08,482
At this rate, we are going
to be here for a while.

1113
01:42:08,607 --> 01:42:09,817
Yes.

1114
01:42:09,942 --> 01:42:11,902
Got anything to do
to pass away the time?

1115
01:42:24,206 --> 01:42:26,542
Okay, guys.

1116
01:43:50,459 --> 01:43:53,378
There's a bunch, probably...

1117
01:43:53,504 --> 01:43:54,588
Abubakar.

1118
01:43:54,713 --> 01:43:58,008
- I gave them the Book of Mormon.
- Guys! Brothers, hey. Hey!

1119
01:43:59,218 --> 01:44:01,887
Do whatever he says. Please.

1120
01:44:09,812 --> 01:44:12,147
Pull the car over,
and get out, all of you.

1121
01:44:12,272 --> 01:44:13,273
Let's go.

1122
01:44:13,398 --> 01:44:16,360
Right there. Let's go.

1123
01:44:17,319 --> 01:44:18,904
Back off, all of you! Back off!

1124
01:44:19,029 --> 01:44:22,407
I'll kill every last one of you for helping
this Krahn, starting with him.

1125
01:44:22,533 --> 01:44:24,284
Move! Move back!

1126
01:44:24,409 --> 01:44:26,578
These young men are missionaries.
They've done nothing wrong.

1127
01:44:26,703 --> 01:44:28,205
Hey!

1128
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:29,498
What are you doing?

1129
01:44:29,623 --> 01:44:32,501
Hold it right there. Hey, you.

1130
01:44:32,626 --> 01:44:34,795
What are you doing? Huh?

1131
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:38,090
What is your authority? Who is that?

1132
01:44:38,215 --> 01:44:39,842
Who are you?

1133
01:44:39,967 --> 01:44:43,136
My name is Elder John Gaye.

1134
01:44:43,262 --> 01:44:44,555
Let him go.

1135
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,223
He is one of those people.

1136
01:44:46,348 --> 01:44:47,599
He is a Krahn.

1137
01:44:47,724 --> 01:44:49,685
I said let him go.

1138
01:45:01,446 --> 01:45:03,073
Where are you from?

1139
01:45:05,868 --> 01:45:07,911
I'm from Monrovia, sir.

1140
01:45:08,036 --> 01:45:13,041
I left my home and my family to serve
the people of Liberia for two years.

1141
01:45:13,166 --> 01:45:15,544
I'm a volunteer.

1142
01:45:15,669 --> 01:45:16,879
And you are all with him?

1143
01:45:18,964 --> 01:45:21,675
And you want to leave Liberia?

1144
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:26,138
Sir, we have been unable
to teach for over six months now

1145
01:45:26,263 --> 01:45:27,931
because of rebel fighting.

1146
01:45:28,056 --> 01:45:31,476
We are going to Freetown
to continue teaching

1147
01:45:31,602 --> 01:45:36,648
until conditions in Monrovia
are safe to return.

1148
01:45:38,567 --> 01:45:40,485
And you all made it here in this thing?

1149
01:45:40,611 --> 01:45:42,821
Yeah, on one tank of petrol.

1150
01:45:42,946 --> 01:45:45,782
With no flats

1151
01:45:45,908 --> 01:45:48,410
and very little damage
to the undercarriage.

1152
01:45:48,535 --> 01:45:51,121
And you... Why do you want
to deny them passage?

1153
01:45:51,246 --> 01:45:53,624
There is no place for any Krahn
in this country.

1154
01:45:54,833 --> 01:45:58,420
And you? Whose side are you on?

1155
01:45:58,545 --> 01:46:00,047
Hmm?

1156
01:46:18,315 --> 01:46:19,608
You weak, little Krahn lover.

1157
01:46:19,733 --> 01:46:22,486
I've sworn to protect
our great nation Liberia

1158
01:46:22,611 --> 01:46:26,281
by eliminating all filthy Krahns,
and he is a Krahn.

1159
01:46:26,406 --> 01:46:28,283
And so am I!

1160
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,546
Get them on the next ferry.

1161
01:46:41,672 --> 01:46:43,924
Wherever they need to go.

1162
01:46:44,049 --> 01:46:45,926
Now.

1163
01:48:51,551 --> 01:48:52,969
How did you know, Abubakar?

1164
01:48:53,095 --> 01:48:54,179
Know what?

1165
01:48:54,304 --> 01:48:58,308
How did you know about the ferry,
that we would make it across?

1166
01:48:58,433 --> 01:49:01,061
He had faith... faith we would.

1167
01:49:01,186 --> 01:49:02,354
How did you know?

1168
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:05,148
I didn't know. I didn't ever know.

1169
01:49:06,316 --> 01:49:07,776
Somewhere along the way,

1170
01:49:07,901 --> 01:49:11,446
between the mission office
and the rebel checkpoints,

1171
01:49:11,571 --> 01:49:13,698
between running out of petrol

1172
01:49:13,824 --> 01:49:16,326
but somehow always having enough,

1173
01:49:16,451 --> 01:49:18,537
or children fleeing from rebels

1174
01:49:18,662 --> 01:49:21,790
but smiling whenever they see you,

1175
01:49:21,915 --> 01:49:25,544
between hoping for the future
but fearing what was ahead,

1176
01:49:25,669 --> 01:49:28,505
it just doesn't make sense
to doubt anymore.

1177
01:49:29,965 --> 01:49:32,300
Thank you, Abubakar.

1178
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:43,145
Selli, when we get there,
don't let Sister Cunningham see you.

1179
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:45,021
You're kind of a mess.

1180
01:49:45,147 --> 01:49:47,566
If I stand next to Meyers,
I'll do just fine.

1181
01:49:47,691 --> 01:49:50,569
Hey, what do you mean? I look fine.

1182
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:56,992
- This is it.
- All right.

1183
01:49:57,117 --> 01:49:58,660
Let's go say hello.

1184
01:49:58,785 --> 01:50:01,454
My leg hurts.

1185
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:11,089
Elder Menti?

1186
01:50:11,214 --> 01:50:13,049
Elder Meyers?

1187
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:15,218
- Let's go say hello.
- Hey. All right.

1188
01:50:15,343 --> 01:50:17,387
Oh. Look at you.

1189
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:19,014
Oh.

1190
01:50:19,139 --> 01:50:20,432
Yeah.

1191
01:50:20,557 --> 01:50:21,766
- President.
- Elder, how are you?

1192
01:50:21,892 --> 01:50:23,018
I'm fine.

1193
01:50:23,143 --> 01:50:24,519
- You made it.
- Yes.

1194
01:50:24,644 --> 01:50:27,105
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Meyers, look at you.

1195
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:28,315
It's so good to see you.

1196
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:30,108
There.

1197
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:35,572
Elders.

1198
01:50:38,325 --> 01:50:40,785
Please, come in. Come in.
There's plenty of room.

1199
01:50:40,911 --> 01:50:42,245
Is there work?

1200
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:44,289
- Lots of work.
- Good.

1201
01:50:46,541 --> 01:50:47,584
Hello, president.

1202
01:50:47,709 --> 01:50:48,919
What are you doing?

1203
01:50:49,044 --> 01:50:52,964
Uh, I thought I should remove
the battery to keep it safe.

1204
01:50:54,389 --> 01:50:55,909
Everything is safe.

1205
01:50:59,095 --> 01:51:03,058
Brother Abubakar, you've done
everything I asked. Thank you.

1206
01:51:03,183 --> 01:51:04,809
It's a pleasure.
