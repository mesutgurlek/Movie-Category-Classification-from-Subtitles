<i>This is 2-5. Sitrep coming.
Continuing ahead, single file</i>

2
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
<i>2000 south, Adam Khan Kalay.
Everything is calm in the area. Over.</i>

3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,160
<i>6-0, this is 2-5 Dolly.
Dolly, over.</i>

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,480
2-5, this is 6-0. You are Dolly.
You are Dolly. Copy, out.

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,680
– He's up here.
– Get a logstat on 3-5.

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,120
3-5, this is 6-0, over.

7
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,200
<i>2-5, 2-5, this is 6-0. Over.</i>

8
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,920
<i>2-5, this is 6-0.</i>

9
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,520
– Fuck!
– Anders is hit!

10
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,360
– We need a medic here!
– Medic, now! Come on!

11
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,160
Can you see him?

12
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,320
– Anders has been hit.
– He's behind there.

13
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,040
– What is it?
– That was a 9-0.

14
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,880
– 9-0 about what?
<i>– Contact IED.</i>

15
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,120
9-0, 9-0, 6-0.
Who knows something? Over.

16
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Anders? Anders, Anders ...

17
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,400
Jones! Come here, tighten this.

18
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,560
Lasse, if you can,
just put something in there –

19
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,880
– to stop the bleeding, okay?

20
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
– Some gauze or bandages.
– Got it, got it.

21
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,440
6-0, this is 2-5.
Ready for a partial 9-liner. Over.

22
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
<i>1410. Over.</i>

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,760
– 3814.
– 6-0, copy that. Out.

24
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,000
– 381410.
– Here.

25
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,800
– Anders Holm. GV1, 2. batallion.
– I need a status on him right now.

26
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,720
6-0, status from Papa. We need a
complete 9-liner and a sitrep.

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,960
Medevac ETA 15.

28
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
He's not breathing.

29
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,600
Very weak breathing.

30
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,040
– When is that medevac coming?
– Come on, Anders.

31
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,600
Let's go. Not too high.
That's right.

32
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,400
– Keep his mouth open.
– I can't feel anything here.

33
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,720
– Fuck, man!
– Lasse, calm down.

34
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,280
– Come on, Anders!
– Five! That's fucking ...

35
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,920
– Where is that fucking helicopter?
– Lasse, calm down.

36
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,400
– Let's go, let's go.
– He has no pulse in his wrist.

37
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,320
<i>Double amputation.
Charlie is severely critical.</i>

38
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,200
– Okay, he's bleeding out now.
– Come on!

39
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,520
... 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

40
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,360
He isn't breathing,
and we can't find the pulse in his neck.

41
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,240
– He's gone.
– He's totally gone?

42
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,760
<i>We have ended CPR. We ...</i>

43
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,800
<i>We'll spend the time
on readying for transport. Out.</i>

44
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,960
6-0, copy that.

45
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,240
Are you alright?

46
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,120
I need you to stay focused. Okay?

47
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,920
As you probably know, Anders was
declared DOA at Bastion.

48
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,240
– How are the guys feeling?
– They're awful.

49
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
Especially my second rifleman, Lasse.

50
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,800
– What about you?
– None of the guys feel good.

51
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,040
We feel like walking targets.
The guys are powerless.

52
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,040
They can't do anything. The guys don't
see the purpose of patrolling ...

53
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,880
Hold on a sec.
Let's see this from their perspective.

54
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,520
The guys just lost a friend.
They're frustrated.

55
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm just saying
the assignments make no sense.

56
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,920
I've just lost one of my 21-year-olds, –

57
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,640
– who bled out right in front of me.
THAT makes no sense!

58
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,120
Of course it doesn't.
Go take care of the guys.

59
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,240
What are your thoughts on this?

60
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,920
It's been a tough day.
They need to let off some steam.

61
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,560
We need to take care of this.
I will patrol with them tomorrow and onwards.

62
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,280
Gather the guys at 20.30.
I'll brief them myself.

63
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,480
Do any of you have any doubts
about why you are here?

64
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,680
It's to secure and help the civil population, –

65
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,200
– so they can have a decent life
and rebuild their land.

66
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,000
I know you walk on patrol a lot,
and that you use a lot of energy.

67
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,200
But that's because we have momentum.
We're getting the civilians on our side.

68
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,200
That's why it's so important
that we show our presence in the area.

69
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,800
Where is he?

70
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
– Where is Julius?
– He's gone outside to play.

71
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,200
We just have to talk to Birgitte now.

72
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Hi, Maria.
Thanks for stopping by.

73
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,600
Julius has been in a fight
with one of the other boys today.

74
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,920
– Was it serious?
– Yes, he wouldn't calm down and

75
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,320
he bit the other boy in the shoulder.

76
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,360
Now, you yourself suggested that
we should have a talk, –

77
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,160
– you, me, and his head teacher.

78
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,480
Yes, of course, let's do that soon.
On Friday, I'll be off at 3.

79
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,600
– I could be here around 3.30.
– I'll just have a look in my calendar.

80
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,600
Just a moment, please.

81
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,440
Julius bit ...
Julius bit a boy.

82
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,920
Yes, he did, sweetie.
You can't do that.

83
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
When are we going home?

84
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,040
As far as I can tell,
it'll be a bit difficult find a time, –

85
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
– but let's see if we can't.
I have a lot to do on Friday but...

86
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
Julius?

87
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,920
Hey! It's time to go home.
Come on.

88
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,800
We need to go home now, Julius.
Figne is waiting for us.

89
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,120
Julius, come on now.
Julius, sweetie?

90
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,760
Julius?

91
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,680
Come, dad's calling tonight.

92
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,360
Come here.

93
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,920
Oh, wow!

94
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,400
– What is eight plus eight?
– That's so easy.

95
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,440
– Sixteen.
– You're so ugly.

96
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,080
– You're so annoying.
– No, you are.

97
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
What's twenty plus twenty?

98
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,720
– Forty.
– You look like an old guy called Morty.

99
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,960
Why are you such a fucking pain?

100
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,080
Alright, stop it. Turn off the TV,
and go sit at the table. We eat in 5 minutes.

101
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,880
Figne, I know he's annoying,
but just leave him be.

102
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,960
Alright, sit at the table.
Elliot, please sit at the table.

103
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,160
Sit at the table, so we can eat.

104
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,720
– Cut this.
– You want me to cut it?

105
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,960
"Dear mom, please cut this for me."

106
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,560
– You are not a "dear mom".
– You are such a little rascal.

107
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,960
Here, do the rest.
Get some ketchup if you want, guys.

108
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,600
Dad will be calling any minute now.

109
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,960
– What time is it?
– Only half past seven.

110
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,760
– That's a lot.
– Yeah, that is a lot, Elliot.

111
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,680
You can go watch some TV.

112
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,360
– I want some milk.
– Then go get some milk.

113
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,600
Can I have that?

114
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,920
Easy, easy, easy ...

115
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,920
You're such a good boy.

116
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,200
I can drink a lot ...
I can drink a lot of milk.

117
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,040
Yeah, you can drink a whole liter.
A whole carton.

118
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,640
That wasn't good for me.

119
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,280
No, that wasn't good for you.

120
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,080
Don't worry about it.
How are you?

121
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Who?

122
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,200
How old was he?
Are you alright?

123
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,960
Okay, good. Well, we're ...

124
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,760
We are fine.

125
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,000
No, we're fine ...

126
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,200
Well, they behave once in a while, you know.

127
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
And then they're so ...

128
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,040
... fucking annoying sometimes.
As always.

129
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah, good for me, right. Really funny.

130
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,320
You should look forward to 
coming home to those crazy kids.

131
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Mommy!

132
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,080
Elliot just woke up.
Could you call back in about two minutes?

133
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,360
Okay. Okay.

134
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,880
I love you too.
We'll talk soon.

135
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,560
I will. Bye, babe.

136
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,840


137
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,040
Lasse?

138
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,800
What's going on?

139
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,680
I want to go home.

140
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,160
Since that morning with Anders ...

141
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,840
He wasn't even supposed to be there.
He took my spot.

142
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,760
And he was blown to pieces.

143
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,360
I can't leave through these gates again.
I'm not worth two shits.

144
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,880
I can't send you home.

145
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,560
What I can do...

146
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,960
... is give you assignments
inside the camp for the next two weeks.

147
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,520
That way you won't have to leave
these gates for a while. And you can calm down.

148
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,640
If you still feel down after a couple
of weeks, we'll talk again.

149
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,320
Do you have any family?

150
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,680
Siblings or the like?

151
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,720
I have a younger sister.

152
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,760
She's 16.

153
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,160
– What's her name?
– Her name is Majida.

154
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,280
She's starting high school soon.

155
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,120
Fuck!

156
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,120
Call home.

157
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,640
I'll be back in 10 minutes
and we'll have some coffee.

158
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,040
Hello?

159
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,120
It's me. Hey.

160
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,320
Switch, guys.

161
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,400
– <i> Salam alaikum.
</i>– Hey, guys.

162
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,040
<i>Salam, salam.</i>

163
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Wanna come along? No?

164
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,280
Go away, go away!

165
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,240
– Go away.
– Keep away.

166
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,360
<i>Correct. EW reports,
that "the pale guys" are in the area.</i>

167
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,960
(speaking Arabic)

168
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,160
Stoffer, back in formation.

169
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,560
– In front of Michael?
– At the back. Now!

170
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,440
– Understood.
– Stoffer, go to the back now!

171
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,320
– That's the last time that happens.
– Understood.

172
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,080
– <i> 2–5, 6–0.
</i>– 2–5, over.

173
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,080
<i>Stop! Get out here!</i>

174
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,800
– <i> Get down!
</i>– What's going on?

175
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,840
<i>Sit down!</i>  I need a translator!
<i> Sit down! Sit down!</i>

176
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,640
Calm down. We need a translator right now.

177
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,120
Calm down, Rytter. Ease off.
We need a translator here.

178
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,320
Sit down, sit down.
Tell him to sit down.

179
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,880
Tell him to lift that up.

180
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,680
(Arabic)

181
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,400
His daughter is ill.
He needs help.

182
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,840
<i>Shut up!</i>

183
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,720
– Get Rytter in line right now.
– Rytter, come here. This way.

184
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,920
(Arabic)

185
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,200
He says, his daughter ...

186
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,640
"My daughter is ill.
Can you help me?"

187
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,880
Where is his daughter?

188
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,480
– She's inside the house.
– Anybody else in there?

189
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,800
(Arabic)

190
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,680
Tell him to calm the fuck down.

191
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,200
"She was burned here.
Can you help us?"

192
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,480
You have to calm down,
otherwise we can't help you.

193
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,720
– There, straight ahead. There, left!

194
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,760
– Our guys are behind that door.
– He says to stop.

195
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,360
He has to remove the women first.

196
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,360
– Look away.
– Look away? What do you think?

197
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
Can you guys see anything?

198
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,120
I can see two women.
Come on, dammit.

199
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,640
– Easy, easy.
– "Come inside."

200
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,680
Go away!

201
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,080
There right,
and women behind the door straight ahead.

202
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,400
There is a donkey over there.

203
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
– You stay there.
– Is it in there?

204
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,920
– Yes, that's his house.
– In here?

205
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,440
Get over here.

206
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,680
Confirmed. A mother and two children
and a girl with gauze on.

207
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,760
Okay. Jones?
Jones, get up here, now.

208
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,520
"Thank you for helping us.
We are poor people."

209
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,760
– Is it a burn?
– Yes. Left forearm.

210
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,120
<i>Salam alaikum.</i>

211
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,240
– Tell him, he's welcome to enter.
– I need Stoffer in here right now.

212
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,840
– What's he saying?
– "It's this girl."

213
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,160
Can you open this?

214
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,440
Can I take a look at that?
Can you ask her that?

215
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,360
It's stuck in her wound.

216
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,520
He has to tell the girl
it's going to hurt.

217
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,720
And he needs to hold her arm.

218
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Yes, it hurts.

219
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
There it is.

220
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,560
It's badly inflamed.

221
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,840
Tell him, I can only rinse it
with water. I don't have ...

222
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,480
"What if it doesn't get better,
then what?"

223
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm gonna put it in gauze,
but he has to rinse it daily with soap.

224
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,120
"Listen to her crying.
She can't sleep at night."

225
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,960
Tell them, if it gets worse,
they can come to the camp.

226
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,720
He knows where the camp is.

227
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,120
"Thank you so much."

228
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
There aren't any taliban here.
They're regular civilians.

229
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,520
The taliban comes sometimes. When we
leave, they'll be here right away.

230
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,080
– When were they here last?
– "As soon as you get here, they run away."

231
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,640
If we help you with the well
and the water, –

232
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,320
– could you help us with the mines?

233
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,280
(Arabic)

234
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,000
All they want is peace.

235
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,160
(Arabic)

236
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,880
He's ready for you down here.

237
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,720
<i>One second, okay?</i>

238
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,080
Okay, we're ready.

239
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
<i>Ready? And up!</i>

240
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,640


241
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880


242
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,880
Hey, it's me. Hello?

243
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,880
– <i> Hello?
</i>– Can you hear me?

244
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,360
<i>Yeah, hi, baby.</i>

245
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,720
Hey. Are you all there?

246
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,560
– <i> Yes, it's me and Julius.
</i>– Where is Elliot and Figne?

247
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,080
<i>Elliot's sleeping. Figne
doesn't want to talk today.</i>

248
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,320
Okay.

249
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,560
– Could I speak to Julius?
<i>– Yeah, he's right here.</i>

250
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,200
<i>Daddy?</i>

251
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,960
– How are you?
<i>– Good.</i>

252
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm sorry,
I didn't call last night, but ...

253
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,160
<i>That's okay.</i>

254
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,360
– And you're good?
– <i> Yes.</i>

255
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,200
– Is that Maria?
– Julius.

256
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,000
– Can I say hi?
– Someone wants to talk to you.

257
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,640
– Hi, Julius.
– <i> Hi.</i>

258
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,360
– How are you?
<i>– Good.</i>

259
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,240
I seem to remember, you owing me
a joke. Is that right?

260
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,960
<i>Yeah.</i>

261
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,560
– You wanna tell it?
– <i> Yeah.</i>

262
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,320
– Right now, or ...?
<i>– Yeah, now.</i>

263
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,440
Alright, I'm listening.
I'm listening.

264
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,720
<i>What?</i>

265
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,640
<i>Julius, tell it.
Here he is.</i>

266
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,760
Okay. Hi, Maria.

267
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,400
<i>Once there was a boy
at the swimming pool.</i>

268
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,280
<i>The lifeguard yelled at him:
"Don't pee in the water."</i>

269
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,400
<i>And the boy said:
"All the others pee in the water, too."</i>

270
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,920
<i>"Yeah, but not from the diving board"</i>

271
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,760
Not from the diving board?
Was that what you said?

272
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,480
That was really funny.

273
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,440
You know what, you win.
It was a lot funnier than mine.

274
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,800
– <i> Did you have a joke, Najib?
</i>– No, it was his turn.

275
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,680
Well, I don't want to interrupt.
Take care.

276
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,560
– <i> You too.
</i>– Goodbye, Julius.

277
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,360
It's me again.
I love you.

278
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,800
<i>We miss you, dad.</i>

279
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,280
Have a good day.
Just run inside, okay? Julius?

280
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,560
When you have binoculars, –

281
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,200
– you point it at the wall ...

282
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,480
Yes. Have a nice day.

283
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,280
Julius, I don't have time for this.

284
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,920
Don't do this.
I don't want to fight with you.

285
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,680
Have a nice day, okay? Run along.

286
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,280
No, you didn't just do that.
Why did you do that, Julius? Unlock the door.

287
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
I asked you nicely.
I can't leave Elliot by himself.

288
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,960
Come on. Go inside.

289
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Oh no, you don't! Alright, get out.

290
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,520
Elliot, you'll have to sit
here by yourself. Come on.

291
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,880
I have an RC here.

292
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,680
Alright, you don't have to  <i>confirm</i>  any more.
Just retreat.

293
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,960
– Down there.
– You can already see it from here.

294
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,040
You can see the antenna there.
It looks like a 105 grenade.

295
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,320
Good work, guys.
Get into position. Go back farther.

296
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,960
Left of the children
down by the road –

297
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,560
– we have a large artillery grenade.
Possible RC.

298
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,840
I hesitate to send it to the TOC,
until we find out, what we have to do.

299
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,480
I'm not so nervous about the danger,
because those girls stand so close to the road.

300
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,960
As long as they're there,
anything rarely happens.

301
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,680
– Butcher?
– What do you say, guys?

302
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,680
Hotel 1–5, this is 6–5.
Come to my position.

303
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,040
I'm walking here, Butcher.

304
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,760
– What's your best position?
– By the rock up there.

305
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,360
The rock up there?

306
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,400
– Butcher and I will go with you.
– Understood.

307
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,240
<i>6–5 Oscar, this is 6–0.</i>

308
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:58,640
<i>We expect to have green light
in this area in 3–0 mike.</i>

309
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,480
Copy that. We have gone into
position to monitor the IED we found.

310
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,880
6–5 Papa has put
Hotel 1–5 into position. We'll ...

311
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,760
<i>... stay here for the time being. Over.</i>

312
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,360
<i>This is 6–0. Copy, out.</i>

313
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,120
Do you hear that?

314
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,840
Yeah.

315
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,960
That's the sound of an engine.
He's there.

316
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,040
6–5, Hotel 1–5. Over.

317
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,200
<i>6–5 Oscar, Over.</i>

318
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,680
We can see one pax on a vehicle.

319
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,160
– Out.
– Take a 500 metre aim.

320
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,560
500 aim, 45 up.
Maintaining line of fire.

321
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,760
– <i> We have PID on a rifle. Over.
</i>– They ask about order of operations.

322
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,800
– Await.
– <i> 6–5 Oscar. Report from Papa.</i>

323
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,440
<i>Await until he has
made contact with the object.</i>

324
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,520
Hotel 1–5, copy. Out.

325
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,200
– What the hell is he doing?
– He's gathering the boys.

326
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,240
– He's lining them up.
– God dammit ...

327
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,600
And he starts digging.
Yes, I got it.  <i> Hostile intent.</i>

328
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,640
He's digging up the object.
They await an order.

329
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,360
Hotel 1–5, this is 6–5 Papa.
You have permission to fire.

330
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,360
This is Hotel 1–5,
Copy. Out.

331
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,560
– Can you get him?
– Yeah.

332
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,640
Fuck ...

333
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,360
He's taking a boy with him.

334
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,440
<i>We don't have a free shot. He's taken
one of the boys and he's driving away.</i>

335
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,400
– Where is he now?
– He's at about 5.

336
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,840
– 500.
– 500.

337
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,320
He's slowing down.

338
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,200
Isn't he?
Yeah, he's stopping.

339
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,160
– The boy runs away. This is it.
– Yes. Ready.

340
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,840
Hold.

341
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,280
Fire.

342
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58.320

343
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,000
– Hit. Ready to follow up.
– Ready to follow up.

344
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,760
– 67 up.
– 67 up.

345
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14.040
– Five right.
– Five right. Ready to fire.

346
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16.080
Fire.

347
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18.040

348
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19.800

349
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22.760
Hit.

350
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42.120
Marius, how will you explain to
your son that you have shot Mr. Beard?

351
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45.160
I don't know.
B for Bang?

352
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49.240
D for Dead?

353
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59.840
Do you know what this is, Elliot?
Do you know what this is?

354
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
– A shark.
– Yes.

355
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,320
– And do you know what this is?
– A motorcycle.

356
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,880
Yes. And do you know what this is?

357
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13.000
– A giraffe.
– Yes. Do you know what this is?

358
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15.480
– A space rocket.
– What?

359
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19.560
A space rocket. A space rocket!

360
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22.280
No, it's a spaceship.

361
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25.320
– Do you know what that is?
– That's daddy.

362
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29.040
– And what is that?
– That is a ...

363
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31.080
– Cannon.
– Cannon.

364
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40.680
– Figne, are you looking after Elliot?
– Yes!

365
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56.920
Hey.

366
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,280
– Are you sad?
– No.

367
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,520
– Have you had a good day at school?
– You don't need to ask about that.

368
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,560
– Why?
– Because I can say it myself.

369
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12.480
I know, you rascal. I just want
to know that you are doing well.

370
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15.000
Aww. Did you hit your head?

371
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19.160
I just want to know
you feel good.

372
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22.680
You need to tell me if something's wrong.

373
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27.000
– When is dad coming home?
– Is that all you think about?

374
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28.720
Mhm.

375
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36.400
He'll be here in three months.
It's not so long.

376
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41.240
Can I get a hug? What do I have
to do to get a hug?

377
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,280
Mom, Elliot has eaten something!

378
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46.920
– What did he eat?
– Mom!

379
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52.160
How many did you eat?
Elliot. Open your mouth.

380
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58.400
Is this Elliot?
The doctor is ready for you in room six.

381
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,320
Figne, take this and go sit
in the waiting room, please.

382
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,720
I'll be back as soon as possible.
Keep an eye on Julius, okay?

383
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15.040
He ate some paracetamol?

384
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19.600
Yeah, he puked some out, but I
don't know how many he has eaten.

385
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22.880
I'm just gonna put
a bandaid on your chest.

386
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26.640
We have to probe him,
so we can monitor him.

387
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30.400
And we have put in an NAC drop
and give him some charcoal.

388
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34.240
– I want my daddy ...
– He's not here right now, honey.

389
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40.080
Now you look here, Elliot.
This is going in your mouth.

390
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44.000
It'll be uncomfortable for a moment, –

391
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47.840
– but we have to do it, so we
can get all the pills up.

392
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52.520
– And here it comes down into your stomach.
– I'll take the pacifier.

393
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56.640
It will be a bit uncomfortable,
but your mother will be right here the whole time.

394
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59.920
Sit here, please.

395
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,080
And now it's important, Elliot,
that you lie completely still and open wide.

396
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,400
– Open the mouth. And suction.
– You are so good.

397
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,600
And we have suction.

398
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12.440


399
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19.200


400
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33.360
Let's see if we can't
wake them up.

401
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35.120
Figne?

402
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,800
Hey, sweetie.

403
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,440
Honey, don't cry.
I wish that I was there.

404
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,520
Maria ... Maria?

405
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25.640
I'll take the fives.

406
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39.640
– Need some sleep?
– No, I'm fine.

407
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47.440
– You have a lot on your plate right now.
– Yeah.

408
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51.280
When are you gonna stop going on patrol?

409
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55.600
Full House, 24

410
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15.760
Look at this.

411
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25.320
I'll report it to 3-5.

412
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29.840
3-5, this is <i> main gate.
</i> We have civilians headed towards <i> main gate. </i>

413
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33.160
<i> Copy that. </i>

414
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44.800
– I'll stand on the left.
– Copy.

415
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54.680
6-0, this is 3-5.
The four locals are now in London.

416
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58.480
They've been searched.
I'm here with the translator. Out.

417
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,600
Lars, close the gate.

418
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,920
(Arabic)

419
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,240
He says he has spoken to
our commander.

420
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13.600
If the Taliban were after them
that he would help.

421
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15.720
Copy that..

422
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20.720
6-0, this is 3-5. Local
Afghan man approximately 60-65 years old

423
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25.320
– seems to know "the commander".
He must be referring to KC.

424
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31.880
<i> Asalamu alaikum. </i>

425
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50.800
Although you patrol at day,
the Taliban comes at night.

426
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54.320
He says that the Taliban know
we helped his daughter.

427
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58.840
Now they want him to be a warrior for them,
otherwise they'll kill his family.

428
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,320
Tell him that we'll come tomorrow
and force the Taliban away from the area.

429
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,360
(Arabic)

430
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17.720
"I can't go home. We
have to stay here tonight."

431
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23.760
I'm sorry,
but I have to ...

432
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30.000
I'm sorry.
You have to go home now.

433
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35.240
Put your boy down.

434
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37.600
Put him down.

435
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42.880
Wait, wait.

436
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54.200
I myself have three children.
(translator translates)

437
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57.200
I understand your situation.

438
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,720
But in order for us to help you,
you will have to go home.

439
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,720
"Your children live in safety though."

440
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14.400
He says that if they go back,
they will be killed.

441
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20.720
"Take care of the children, and I'll leave."

442
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26.120
His children will be killed. We have
to go to the village in the morning anyway...

443
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28.520
Stop that right now.

444
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36.080
"What should I do?"

445
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40.120
We will be there tomorrow. We'll secure
the area, and force the Taliban out.

446
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44.800
We'll protect you
and your family. You have my word.

447
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48.640
Rytter, ready the gate.

448
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17.880
They can't stay here.

449
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34.280
There have been a low number of
<i> incidents </i> in AO.

450
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38.760
The assessment is, that they are waiting until
they understand our intention in the area.

451
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42.720
There has been
massive digging activity out there –

452
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46.920
– and they undoubtedly monitor
our every move.

453
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51.160
It's my job to be the merchant of death
as an intelligence officer.

454
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54.880
It won't be long
before we see a reaction.

455
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,560
They report that it is
very quiet down there today.

456
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,600
It could be a <i> combat indicator,
</i> that the locals have left the area.

457
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12.480
The Taliban may be ready
and waiting for us.

458
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15.600
If they are,
we'll just have to remove them.

459
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19.240
– Any risk reports?
– None.

460
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23.200
We're going down to see that family.
I'll take Lars, Jones, –

461
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27.280
– Michael, Butcher,
Stoffer and Lasse with me.

462
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32.320
We'll enter Compound 3 and
look in on the family.

463
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36.280
You'll continue to the other side,
and back us up from there.

464
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41.320
Look at this.
We'll all go down to the well.

465
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46.840
From the well, you'll go directly south
gain insight on Compounds 6, 7 and 8.

466
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48.880
Copy.

467
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52.320
6-0, 6-5 Oscar, Over.

468
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57.000
2-5 reporting,
very low levels of activity. Over.

469
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,520
<i> We are monitoring you – </i>

470
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,280
<i> – and don't have indications
of activity, either. Copy. Out. </i>

471
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14.400
Say that we are going in with weapons,
unless they say something.

472
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17.000
(interpreter in Arabic)

473
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24.880
– Room on the right.
– Blue door straight ahead.

474
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31.080
Room clear.

475
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33.240
Focus on the blue door.

476
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51.480
Fuck ...

477
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,280
<i> This is 6-0. </i>

478
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10.360
We're here. The aforementioned family,
we helped, we've localized them.

479
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14.800
They've all been killed.

480
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28.200
The boy was shot in the head.

481
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33.040
The girl was shot two three times
in the chest and neck.

482
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38.560
The mother was hit in the face.

483
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48.080
Take Lasse to 2-5. There is no
reason for him to be here.

484
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51.440
We'll come to you,
when we're done.

485
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53.960
Lasse. Lasse.

486
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56.480
Come here.

487
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,200
Look at me. Are you alright?

488
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,640
<i> 6-0. Over. </i>

489
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10.200
We'll stay for an additional 05
and then leave the village –

490
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14.240
– and go back
toward London. Confirm. Over.

491
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17.440
<i> This is 6-0. Copy that. Out. </i>

492
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20.640
(explosion)

493
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23.320
Get away, Jones!

494
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26.600
6-0, 6-5 Oscar. Out.

495
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31.280
– Can you see anything?
– No.

496
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34.920
– What about 2-5?
– 2-5 has our backs.

497
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37.680
<i> Can you gain insight? </i>

498
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41.800
I see nothing. All I see is
it's coming from the left side.

499
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45.120
– 2-5 has no insight!
– 2-5 has no insight.

500
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49.120
– I think the sound came from Compound 6
– There's nothing to see there.

501
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53.200
Boss! Lasse is hit!

502
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56.480
– What's the position?
– Give position.

503
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,240
– <i> I'm by the well!
</i> – He's out by the well.

504
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,560
2-5 has no insight!

505
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10.440
– Michael!
– He was hit in the neck! Help me!

506
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14.920
I need help right now!

507
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21.440
– Where was he hit?
– In the neck.

508
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23.960
Lasse, Lasse! Look at me!

509
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26.920
He's good. Let's take
him over here. Come on.

510
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33.320
– Michael, secure it.
– Got it. <i> Go! </i>

511
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42.280
– Butcher!
– Butcher's coming!

512
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48.320
– Jones! Where do you want him?
– Up here!

513
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53.920
Where was he hit?
Keep the pressure.

514
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58.920
2-5, this is 6-5. Send me a sitrep.
Are you in contact? Over.

515
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,560
– <i> This is 2-5. This is 2-5.
</i> – Stoffer!

516
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,440
<i> They are firing from several
directions. I have no insight. </i>

517
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,240
I've got you.

518
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13.080
Lasse, we are gonna cut up your shirt,
so Jones can check on you.

519
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17.520
Jones has to check on you.
Lasse? I've got you.

520
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22.520
– Where is that fucking medevac?!
– Michael, where can it set down?

521
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25.040
On the north side of the village.

522
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29.000
2-5, we have to sweep
a landing site. Get it going.

523
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33.800
<i> 2-5, I am engaged.
I can't do it. </i>

524
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38.720
– I've got you, Lasse.
– We need that fucking medevac!

525
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40.360
Get down!

526
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48.280
– Lars! Michael! Is everything alright?
– Yes. I don't see anything.

527
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53.240
2-5, this is 6-5. We have to sweep
a landing site. Reply, dammit!

528
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56.680
<i> This is 2-5.
I can't do it. Out. </i>

529
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59.800
– Hold it tight.
– Lasse, look at me. Are you there?

530
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,120
Lasse, look at me.
You'll make it. We are getting you home.

531
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,120
– Are you there, Lasse?
– Lasse!

532
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10.040
Lars and Michael, behind you!

533
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13.280
– Insight?
– That direction plus 200.

534
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19.160
2-5, I need a clear
enemy report. Come on!

535
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23.200
<i> I don't have a clear enemy report.
They are in a western direction. </i>

536
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25.520
Western direction?

537
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32.400
Where the hell are they?
Lars, I'm behind you. Insight?

538
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35.200
– Negative.
– Same as Lars.

539
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36.680
RPG!

540
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42.520
– I'm okay.
– Michael?

541
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45.200
Butcher, this is critical!

542
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49.920
– We need air support.
– 6-0, we need air support.

543
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52.880
His heart rate is dropping!
He's getting worse.

544
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55.800
Verify coordinate Compound 6.

545
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59.600
On the six?
I've got it.

546
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,160
– Lasse!
– What's happening, Jones?

547
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,360
– Lasse, look up.
– Lasse, look at us!

548
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,400
What's going on?

549
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11.600
We're not getting air support,
unless we have PID.

550
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15.040
– We need to get Lasse out of here.
– 7-5 wants to know who's in there.

551
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19.040
– I don't give a shit who's in there!
– I know, but it's 7-5 asking!

552
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23.000
Then tell them, I know who's in there!
We have to get out of here!

553
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27.920
We have PID on Compound 6.
Repeat: PID on Compound 6.

554
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31.240
Come on, god dammit!

555
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35.240
– 0-2 mike!
– 0-2 mike on air support!

556
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36.840
Jones!

557
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41.640
– Come on. Lasse, look at me.
– One, two, three!

558
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45.320
– Now look at me. There we go!
– He's back!

559
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47.880
Pancake around 15 Sierra!

560
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53.920
<i> Three, two, one ... </i>

561
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56.840
(explosion)

562
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,800
– Lasse, come on.
– I'll get the door.

563
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11.040
– Come on, Lasse!
– Nice and easy.

564
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15.840
– Lay him down.
– Hold his head.

565
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20.920
– Is there a helicopter for Lasse now?
– I have him right here.

566
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23.640
Easy. Easy, Stoffer.

567
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25.760
Step away, please.

568
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27.960
Breathe.

569
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31.360
Jones, we need you
in position.

570
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34.480
– Come on, Lasse!
– Protect him from the wind.

571
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37.320
Sit down. Nice and easy.

572
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40.040
Loosen the helmet a bit.

573
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42.960
You'll get some air.
That's okay.

574
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46.200
It's alright.

575
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49.480
Okay? Good work.

576
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53.280
Okay?
He'll be fine.

577
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56.080
It's alright to be sad.

578
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59.680
We're all sad.
It's completely alright.

579
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,960
Stoffer, it'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

580
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,040
– <i> Hey, hey! Get out of ...
</i> – Out of the vehicle. Let's go!

581
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,480
– There must be something ...
– I'll get him from the other side.

582
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,320
– Some guy has locked himself inside.
– I can see him through the window.

583
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15.400
Out! Out! Out!

584
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18.680
– <i> Out of the car. Now.
</i> – Get out.

585
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23.480
– No, there.
– Get him to lie down.

586
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26.400
– Get him down.
– I have him under control.

587
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31.880
Stay still, buddy. Okay?
Stay still!

588
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38.760
Nice and easy, buddy, alright?

589
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46.680
– 50% on the vehicle.
– Butcher, 50% on pat down!

590
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49.560
Stay still.

591
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53.160
Michael, we have a mobile phone.
Good work, boys.

592
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56.000
Now Michael will just
get the last E in.

593
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,360
Just as soon as we are done here
get them into the vehicle, and point them north.

594
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,480
(Arabic)

595
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,760
Now, do what I tell you.
I don't want any bullshit from you.

596
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10.800
Raven will follow them north.

597
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14.600
The mobile phone was clean.
Expect to release them in 02.

598
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23.280
<i> Please stand up. </i> Get up, guys.
You know what that means. Come on!

599
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25.960
Copy that.

600
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29.840
We'll release them in 01
So if you can follow them ...

601
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49.280
As you know,
Lasse was hit in the neck –

602
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53.480
– and flown to Bastion. Then
he was flown to England –

603
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58.000
– where they patched him up.

00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:19,260
I miss you

00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,960
NOT!

00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,260
Can't eat

00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,660
But the food is also

00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,660
really shitty!

604
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46.320
Awesome.

00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49.320
Thanks, boss

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.620
I heard that you

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.120
saved my life

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.120
Look out for each other

605
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38.720
– There's more.
– A sponge cake?

606
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42.360
– Now there's more cake for you.
– It's a new one.

607
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45.160
Another one. That makes it a 1000. Yay!

608
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:50.720
Oh, thank you. Come here. I'm keeping this.
I want this for myself.

609
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54.040
– Is he coming home for Christmas?
– Yes.

610
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59.480
– Whoops.
– It's amazing how you can keep it up.

611
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,560
That's just ...
That's just the way, it is.

612
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:13.040
– But Julius is reacting a bit these days.
– How so?

613
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15.880
Trouble at school and such.

614
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19.920
He just needs to adjust.

615
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26.320
He's at an age
where he starts to understand more ...

616
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29.760
... can express it more.

617
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52.720
Did you hear that my guys
made a deal with the locals?

618
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55.640
They bought a goat
and named it Richard.

619
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01,360
Where is it?

620
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,520
In a small enclosure next to my bunk.

621
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,920
I've seen more meat on a bouillon cube.

622
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13.200
– Do you have two minutes?
– Now?

623
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.960
– Ten minutes.
– Alright.

624
01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.360
– What's going on?
– The commander is in your office.

625
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.200
Got two guys from the Advocate Corps with him.

626
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.640
What's it about?

627
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.880
I don't know.

628
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.800
Okay. Thanks.

629
01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.040
– Hey, Claus.
– Commander.

630
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.520
What's this about?

631
01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.440
We have to interview you about
some claims regarding civilian casualties.

632
01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01,000
Although you are not charged, you
have the right to remain silent.

633
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,560
But we can't promise you won't
be charged at a later point in time.

634
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10.280
What would I be charged for?

635
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.640
So you want to make a statement,
do I have that right?

636
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.880
Yes.

637
01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.360
What do you want to ask about?

638
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.520
Can you confirm that you and your men
were present in Adam Khan Kalay –

639
01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.560
– on September 21 at 9:30?

640
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.840
I can confirm that.

641
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.720
We have been told that you
gave orders to attack Compound 6.

642
01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.320
– Is that correct?
– Yes.

643
01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.000
We were in close contact with the enemy.

644
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.640
And the enemy, that you refer to,
was located in Compound 6?

645
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,480
Yes. That's why,
we called for air support on it.

646
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.520


647
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.800
You are charged with bombing
a civilian target –

648
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03,240
– and thus caused the deaths
of 11 civilians.

649
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,640
What does that mean?

650
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,800
It means you are going home, Claus.

651
01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.680
There he is.

652
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.240
I want to hug him first.

653
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.920
– Are you gonna get that, Figne?
– No, I will.

654
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,200
I'm a manly man.

655
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,720
– I'll get it.
– Are you sure? Let's go.

656
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10.680
– I can't do it!
– I thought you were a man.

657
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.840
– What's in it?
– I'll get it.

658
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.320
We'll put the grey one here
and a white one on each side.

659
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.240
Thanks. There!

660
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.160
Then we'll ... Which one
should we put there?

661
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.640
Those. We should get those.

662
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.360
Is he asleep?

663
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.520
– I'm not asleep.
– No, Elliot.

664
01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02,320
We'll have an orange one there
and there.

665
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10.880
I'm almost done.
Can I see yours?

666
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.160
– We are almost done.
– You are such a little rascal.

667
01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.320
You are so silly.

668
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19.720
You need to tell me
why you've come home.

669
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34.600
I'm cold.

670
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33.720
I've received the case files:
testimony from your men, –

671
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38.120
– a video from a helmet cam, in which
you give the order for the attack on Compound 6.

672
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40.640
And some photographs.

673
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:45.080
I will contest their authenticity. I'll
to have them thrown out, –

674
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48.120
– because we have no idea
who has taken them –

675
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51.800
– although they claim,
they were taken at the scene of the crime.

676
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55.880
Their claim is that you
ordered a bombing of a civilian target –

677
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58.360
– without PID.

678
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02,840
– What is PID?
– It means if I saw the enemy there.

679
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,480
You are accused of violating
the Military Criminal Code, ¤ 36.2.

680
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,800
And what does that mean exactly?

681
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:16.000
It means that you have been
accused of killing civilians.

682
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.720
What is the penalty for that?

683
01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.280
It will probably be a jury trial,
in which the maximum penalty is four years.

684
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.480
But let's not anticipate events.

685
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.160
What do we do now?

686
01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.960
The most important question is, –

687
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.320
– if Compound 6
was a military or a civilian target.

688
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.400
That's the whole case.

689
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.680
Did you have PID, Claus?

690
01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.680
I had a strong assumption
that the Taliban where...

691
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.760
– I'll have to stop you right there. Did you have PID?
– I had a strong ...

692
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:56.120
I gotta stop you again.
You need to understand that, right now, –

693
01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:01,240
– it's assumed to be a civilian target.
People live there.

694
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,680
People's homes were bombed.

695
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:08,320
As far as I can tell from
the witness reports, –

696
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12.240
– nothing indicates,
that you had PID.

697
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.320
Does that matter? He says,
his men are wounded and bleeding.

698
01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.800
– It's his duty to save them.
– I understand that very well.

699
01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.720
But you have to understand, that to everyone
else, Claus is a soldier –

700
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.720
– who killed 11 people.

701
01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.920
Alright. Let me be
completely honest with you.

702
01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.520
In this store
I sell acquittals.

703
01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.560
Morality and ethics
is not my department.

704
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.680
The prosecution will claim,
that the case is about 11 dead civilians.

705
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.080
If you have even the slightest doubt,
that you had PID, –

706
01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.560
– they will try to get you convicted.

707
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.440
If you can say to me now
without a doubt that you had PID, –

708
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03,880
– there is a very good chance
I can get you acquitted.

709
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,960
It's that simple.

710
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15.200
I can't just lie.

711
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20.320
I didn't know,
who was in that house, Maria.

712
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24.440
It was my responsibility, and I have
to suffer the consequences.

713
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27.600
<i>You </i> must suffer the consequences?

714
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31.640
What about the children?

715
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34.840
What about me?

716
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43.040
We need you at home.
You have been gone for a very long time.

717
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48.560
– Julius is struggling with it.
– What the hell was I supposed to do?

718
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50.120
Huh?

719
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55.120
It's not about what you were supposed
to do, but what you do right now.

720
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,760
Would it help you
to go to prison for four years?

721
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,840
Would you get better?
Would the children get better?

722
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,960
We need you at home!
The children need you!

723
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12.160
I dropped that bomb.

724
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16.880
It was my decision.

725
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22.800
– I can't just blame my men.
– Alright, but then do what he says.

726
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27.400
Say you had fucking PID. Say,
you can't remember who confirmed it.

727
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:32.080
Maybe you killed eight children,
but you have three living ones at home!

728
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35.280
I'm sorry.

729
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37.480


730
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18.600
Claus, we'll go over here.
Maria, you have to sit over there.

731
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22.120
– Hey, boss. Good to see you.
– Hi.

732
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28.760
Hello.

733
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37.320
– Can I take your coat?
– How sweet. Thanks.

734
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44.000
That's your seat, Claus.

735
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49.200
You can just put your jacket here.

736
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57.240
Thanks.

737
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59.680
Take a seat, please.

738
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,840
Remember what we talked about.
When it gets hard, –

739
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14.240
– look at me and breathe, okay?

740
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17.840
It'll be alright.

741
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34.800
Claus, stand up.

742
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41.160
– Good morning. Please be seated.
– Thank you.

743
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47.520
Alright, today we're processing the case –

744
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:53.680
– the Military Prosecution Service
versus Claus Michael Pedersen.

745
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56.520
Claus Michael Pedersen,
is that you?

746
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58.320
– Yes.
– Good.

747
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,000
– Tell me when you were born.
– 04-02-80.

748
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:06,320
Yes, that is correct. And we can continue
the case with a statement.

749
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,480
Can I interrupt for a moment.

750
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12.240
The prosecution's evidence involves
these photographs, –

751
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15.840
– specifically, exhibit 35.

752
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19.840
I would like to question the
authenticity of these photographs, –

753
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23.080
– and I ask the court
to make them inadmissible.

754
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:26.480
Alright.
And what do you say?

755
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28.920
I don't agree.

756
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32.720
I will explain how we
acquired the photographs, –

757
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38.000
– and the authenticity of the photographs
was verified by the military police.

758
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42.960
Okay. Do you have any other remarks on your part?

759
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45.200
– No.

760
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48.000
This case is about –

761
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:52.800
– whether the defendant had the necessary
information to give orders to bomb, –

762
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56.240
– if Compound 6 a military target or not.

763
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:01,120
A recording from the helmet camera of
constable Lars Holm plays an important part –

764
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,920
– to the military prosecution.
That is the exhibit 27.

765
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10.160
It is the opinion of the prosecution –

766
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:15.720
– that the video clip shows
the basis of the decision of the defendant ...

767
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19.800
... Or lack thereof.
I will now play the video.

768
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28.000
<i> 6-5 Oscar, out. We're not
getting air support, unless we have PID. </i>

769
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30.480
<i> The TOC must be sure. </i>

770
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34.640
– <i> 7-5 wants to know who's in there.
</i> – <i> I don't give a shit who's in there! </i>

771
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36.960
<i> I know, but it's 7-5 asking! </i>

772
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,560
<i>Then tell them, I know who's in there!
We have to get out of here!</i>

773
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:46.240
<i> We have PID on Compound 6.
Repeat: PID on Compound 6. </i>

774
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49.040
Alright, thank you.

775
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52.480
In closing, there is the
photographic material –

776
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57.440
– delivered to the military police
in the English brigade.

777
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,600
They then transferred the material
to the Danish military police.

778
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,320
It's six photos.

779
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:09,160
I have to warn you that,
these are explicit images.

780
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11.840
Begin.

781
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15.200
Yes. Photo number one.

782
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21.520
And photo number two.

783
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26.400
Photo number three.

784
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30.160
And number four.

785
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35.080
Number five.

786
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41.360
And ... photo number six.

787
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48.440
Thank you.

788
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52.480
Does the defence have any comments?

789
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53.880
No.

790
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57.520
Alright, then we'll move on to the witnesses.

791
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,200
Jones is screaming.
Lasse's condition is critical, –

792
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,360
– so we call in a medevac
to get him out.

793
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:10.160
Immediately thereafter
we were hit by yet another grenade.

794
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,400
I attempt to gain insight
but I can't, –

795
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17.240
– so I seek cover by this wall
in the southwest corner –

796
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20.000
– of Compound 3
with Butcher.

797
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23.480
Butcher is Kenneth Jensen,
the communications officer?

798
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25.640
Yes, Kenneth Jensen.

799
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30.280
Then I get a report that
the Taliban are in Compound 6.

800
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34.280
Okay. Claus, at what time exactly ...

801
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39.360
... are you informed,
that the enemy is in Compound 6?

802
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42.040
I don't remember exactly.

803
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46.360
But you remember, that you have identified
Compound 6 as a military target?

804
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48.360
Yes.

805
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53.360
Alright. Before we continue,
you can just sit back down.

806
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57.240
I think we have a good overview
of the circumstances.

807
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59.800
Thank you.

808
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,160
(whispering)
Let's just continue down this road.

809
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,600
Alright.

810
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12.360
I would like to quote from exhibit 27a:

811
01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.120
"I don't give a shit who's
in there. We need to get Lasse out. "

812
01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.400
And shortly thereafter: "Tell them I know who's
in there. We have to get out of here."

813
01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.400
This is contrary to what you said.

814
01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.880
– No, it's not.
– Would you elaborate on that?

815
01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.720
You need to understand.

816
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.400
When I get a report that
they won't grant air support, –

817
01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:47.240
– but it's the only thing
that can save me and my men, –

818
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.760
– I see it as my duty to 
get it granted.

819
01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.480
Who told you,
where the enemy was located?

820
01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.040
I don't remember. Because we were
under heavy fire!

821
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,720
I don't remember!

822
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,000
2-5 is on the radio
and two men in contact with the enemy.

823
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11.360
Jones and Stoffer are fighting
to save Lasse's life.

824
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15.000
Oscar is in constant contact
with the TOC at home.

825
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17.280
I do not remember who said what.

826
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20.000
But you know
who is located in Compound 6?

827
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23.000
I react to a report that
the enemy is in there.

828
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26.280
Did you also know,
that there were women and children?

829
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42.400
– No, I did not.
– Okay ... Thank you, that's all I have.

830
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46.840
Does the defence have any questions
for the defendant?

831
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51.880
Yes. I have a few questions, thank you.

832
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56.200
Claus, when you say, –

833
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,800
– as we've heard in the clip
taken from a helmet cam:

834
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,000
When you say, "Tell them I know,
who's in there, "–

835
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,400
– what does that mean?

836
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:14.440
Does it mean "Lie and just say, that I know,
who's in there? "

837
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20.880
Or: ÒTell them I know. Confirm that
I know who's in there?"

838
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:27.320
– What does it mean, Claus?
– It means I had PID.

839
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:32.040
I didn't want to waste time
discussing it. –

840
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36.200
– Not with my men on the ground,
nor the people in TOC.

841
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38.480
That's all I've got.

842
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42.720
The defendant can sit back down next to their lawyer.

843
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55.440
– Okay, so let's write that there.
– Yeah.

844
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58.520
He buys two packets of plastic figurines.

845
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,720
The packet with the five figurines
costs a tenner, so that makes it ...

846
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,920
– What?
– Twenty.

847
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,360
Two times ten is twenty.

848
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10.280
48.

849
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13.240
48 + 20 + 18.

850
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16.920
... + 20 + 18.

851
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20.680
What is 24 + 18?

852
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25.400
8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ...

853
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28.520
There.

854
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35.840
42.

855
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43.360
Exactly. 42.

856
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47.560
– Are you tired?
– Nah.

857
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56.520
You know what Mom and I
are doing these days, right?

858
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59.720
– Seeing if you have to go to prison.
– Mhm.

859
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,120
Okay, lie down.

860
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.480
Dad?

861
01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.200
Is it true, that
you killed some children?

862
01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.960
Did you at any time observe
hostile activity from Compound 6?

863
01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00,480
No.

864
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,120
I'll make the assumption that
you, in the combat situation –

865
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,720
– didn't direct Pedersen's
attention toward that compound.

866
01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.600
That is correct.

867
01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.640
Did you at any time observe any
enemy activity in Compound 6?

868
01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.360
No.

869
01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.800
Since you didn't observe anything,
I'll assume –

870
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.920
– you didn't direct Pedersen's
attention toward that compound?

871
01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.520
– That is correct.
– Thank you.

872
01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:36.360
– I have no further questions.
– And the defence?

873
01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:40,920
Can you with 100 % certainty deny
that the enemy was located in Compound 6?

874
01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.440
– No, certainly not.
– Thank you.

875
01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.520
I would like to call the next witness.

876
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,200
Najib Bisma.
Welcome.

877
01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02,280
Just take a seat right there, Najib.

878
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,360
Take a seat, please.

879
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13.200
Does a company commander
normally patrol –

880
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16.240
– as much as
Claus Michael Pedersen did?

881
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20.640
That is, put himself in the 
line of fire like that?

882
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:25.440
Most bosses go on
a few patrols, but ...

883
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:30.320
Claus is the type that takes charge
and shows the way, –

884
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:35.080
– and he did that a lot
the last month or so down there.

885
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:39.800
– Did you think that was appropriate?
– There were pros and cons.

886
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45.720
You did talk about it with the defendant,
is that correct?

887
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:55.160
I mentioned it to Claus,
but that was for his own sake.

888
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57.520
How so?

889
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:05,440
Were you concerned about his judgment
in the time leading up to this incident?

890
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,520
No, not worried ...

891
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:11.800
According to your signed testimony –

892
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14.840
– you did have doubts about his judgment.

893
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18.880
I quote: "He had trouble
prioritizing important tasks."

894
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21.800
That is verbatim from your testimony.

895
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26.080
Claus is my friend. We started
at officer school together –

896
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29.880
– and I know his family,
so I was worried about Claus.

897
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32.760
At a personal level,
not as my boss.

898
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36.840
But he was your boss.
He was the head of a whole company.

899
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:43.600
Your boss exhibits, according to you,
signs of impaired judgment.

900
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47.600
He has difficulty prioritizing tasks –

901
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52.560
– and ends up in serious combat
with several wounded.

902
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:56.400
Then he orders the bombing of
a compound in the village.

903
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59.440
Did you consider, as next-in-command, –

904
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,920
– that something went terribly
wrong out there?

905
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:13.040
That is a difficult question because ...

906
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20.040
You can't imagine,
what it means to be out there.

907
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23.680
Claus is the most capable soldier
I know.

908
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:30.120
And ultimately it is our responsibility
to get our men back home in one piece.

909
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34.320
That is what we are there for.

910
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:38.480
But he shouldn't have been
out there with them.

911
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42.320
We should have been in the camp
with the overview.

912
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:50.320
That's all for me. Thanks.

913
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,160
Hey.

914
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,560


915
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11.440
I gotta do something, Maria.

916
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16.080
I gotta to do something.

917
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31.280
Hey. Come on.

918
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35.400
There there.

919
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46.640
Hey.

920
01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01,040
We need you. Hey!

921
01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.640
Yes, Kenneth Jensen,
or Butcher ...

922
01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.160
That is what we have mostly heard
you referred to as.

923
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.240
I was called Butcher, colloquially.

924
01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.760
It's a nickname.

925
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:42.920
– Where does it come from?
– That's a long story.

926
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:46.120
My father was a butcher.
And I have two brothers.

927
01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.320
– So we just got the nicknames Butcher.
– Butcher and Butcher.

928
01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.960
There was Little Butcher,
Medium Butcher, and Big Butcher.

929
01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.800
Okay good.

930
01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01,000
In this court, we have heard
the sound from a video clip, –

931
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:04,120
– in which you pass on
orders from the defendant –

932
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,920
– to bomb Compound 6.

933
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:12.240
At the time, did you know
the reason for that order?

934
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14.520
Yes, I did.

935
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18.600
It was me who told Claus, –

936
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21.920
– that I could see muzzle flashes
from Compound 6.

937
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23.880


938
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:29.400
Will the audience please refrain
from commenting?

939
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37.040
Could you repeat that?

940
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:42.640
I told Claus that I saw
muzzle flashes coming from Compound 6.

941
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:50.480
This is completely new to me.
How is it possible for you –

942
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:54.720
– to provide that information to the defendant
from your location behind the wall?

943
01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:00,120
We have heard several accounts
of how chaotic it was.

944
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,800
We have heard that you were lying in cover
with him behind the wall –

945
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,640
– and that you were
under heavy fire.

946
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11.920
We were, but the boss gets up
to gain insight –

947
01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.840
– on the compounds from which the shots
are coming. I get up behind him.

948
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.280
And then I see some muzzle flashes
coming from Compound 6 –

949
01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:23.640
– and the surrounding area,
and I inform him of this.

950
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.840
When we're back in cover
behind the wall, –

951
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.480
– he asks me to verify
coordinates on Compound 6.

952
01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.360
And then I can call TOC
and ask for the air support we got.

953
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:40.000
On the audio sequence from
Lars Holm's helmet camera –

954
01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:45.280
– nothing indicates that you or the
defendant did what you are now saying.

955
01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:48.840
I wasn't really near Lars.
I was behind the boss.

956
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.640
So I can't comment on what's
on that audio clip.

957
01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.120
I'm just telling you –

958
01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:58.680
– that it doesn't match your statement, –

959
01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:03,520
– but that it is very consistent
with your previous testimony.

960
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:06,800
May I just point out
to the court, –

961
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10.600
– that testimony is not signed.

962
01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.400
– Is that true?
– That is correct.

963
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.760
It is exhibit 23. There is nothing odious
about it not being signed.

964
01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.120
The witness was on his way to patrol,
when he testified.

965
01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.560
It was written
on a laptop in the camp –

966
01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.120
– and it was read through on the screen.

967
01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.720
I was just pointing it out.

968
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:34.240
– It has been noted.
– But back to you, Kenneth.

969
01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.600
It was made in Afghanistan,
a few days after the incident occurred.

970
01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.320
In it you don't mention any muzzle flashes –

971
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:47.720
– or any enemies around Compound 6,
none of this new information.

972
01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.720
I wasn't asked about those specifics, either.

973
01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.840
If I had been,
I would have answered.

974
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58.680
– You have to be asked specifically about that?
– Not necessarily.

975
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:03,800
But I wasn't asked. We had just been
in enemy contact two-three days before.

976
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:08,560
A man was critically wounded, and we were
on our way out in that same area again.

977
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12.960
Then I was questioned. And unfortunately, no.
I didn't mention anything about it.

978
01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:17.360
Obviously, I'm sorry about that.
But, well ... That's the way it is.

979
01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.320


980
01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.040
Does the prosecutor have anything else?

981
01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:34.440
Your company commander is in difficulties
and has been indicted for half a year.

982
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.280
The information
you're bringing forward now, –

983
01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.640
– would have been of significant importance
to both the man and his case.

984
01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.400
Do you want me to believe, –

985
01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.800
– that at no point
did it occur to you –

986
01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.080
– to share any
of this information?

987
01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:55.840
– It's been six months.
– Yes, it has. Sorry.

988
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,480
– Was that it?
– Yes, that was it. Thank you.

989
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,840
Does the defence have any questions
for the witness?

990
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.200
No, I can't seem to think of
anything right now.

991
01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:16.120
Then you are done.

992
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.760
You may leave or sit with audience,
if you so please.

993
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.720
The law is clear:

994
01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:32.800
The prohibition against arbitrary attacks
is of central importance –

995
01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:37.000
– in the protection of
the civilian population.

996
01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40,600
At no point has the defendant
been able to justify –

997
01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.400
– why he decided
to attack.

998
01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:47.600
He says someone in the unit identified
Compound 6 as a hostile target, –

999
01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:52.160
– but he hasn't indicated who or
specified further circumstances.

1000
01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.640
The court has heard me question every single
soldier in the vicinity of the defendant, –

1001
01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00,520
– who would have been
able to identify Compound 6.

1002
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:06,920
And one soldier, Kenneth 'Butcher' Jensen,
waited until court to inform us –

1003
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:11.840
– that he observed the muzzle flashes
and conveyed it to the defendant.

1004
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.640
I have no trust in
the witness, –

1005
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.400
– because in the sound recording –

1006
01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:21.640
– we can clearly hear the exchange of words
between the defendant and Butcher –

1007
01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:27.000
– up until the order: "I don't
give a shit who's in there."

1008
01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.160
And when next-in-command
in TOC insists on PID:

1009
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.120
"Tell them, I know
who's in there."

1010
01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.880
I see a man who disregards
the need of a civilian population –

1011
01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.800
– to save his
own guy, Lasse.

1012
01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:44.000
Is that understandable from a human perspective?

1013
01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.800
Yes.

1014
01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.360
We can probably all understand
the difficult dilemma.

1015
01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.320
But although we have
sympathy for the defendant, –

1016
01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.720
– who appears to be
a competent soldier and leader –

1017
01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00,840
– and although we must provide
Danish soldiers room for manoeuvreability –

1018
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,560
– in extreme circumstances,
no one is above the law.

1019
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,480
Otherwise, a judicial system is rendered superfluous.

1020
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10.960
If we in a case like this –

1021
01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.360
– let such a serious violation
of humanitarian rights slide, –

1022
01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.240
– we will end somewhere,
where we do not want to be.

1023
01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.200
Claus Michael Pedersen must be sentenced
because there is no doubt –

1024
01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:29.280
– that he intentionally disregarded
the elementary rules of engagement.

1025
01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.240
Basically, the penalty in ¤ 36.2 –

1026
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:37.040
– is prison for life.

1027
01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.480
Now, however,
this is a jury trial, –

1028
01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.280
– because the defendant did not have
the intention to kill civilians.

1029
01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.480
But their deaths are a direct
consequence of his decision.

1030
01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:55,000
The maximum penalty is four years.

1031
01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.640
It is my contention, that we
are close to that maximum.

1032
01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04,000
With these remarks, I rest my case.

1033
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,560
I would like to remind the court,
that it is the prosecutor –

1034
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11.400
– who has the burden of proof –

1035
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:15.280
– and must prove beyond any
reasonable doubt –

1036
01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:18.000
– that my client is guilty.

1037
01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.960
The point of contention was quite
simply, if my client had PID.

1038
01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28,400
My client says loud and clear,
that he did.

1039
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.920
The prosecutor claims that he did not.

1040
01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:38.360
But then we hear communications officer
Kenneth Jensen, Butcher, tell us –

1041
01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.080
– it was he, who saw the
muzzle fire coming from Compound 6.

1042
01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.160
That it was he who identified
Compound 6 as a military target –

1043
01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.760
– and not as a civilian target,
as the prosecutor claims.

1044
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.880
My client, Claus Michael Pedersen,
had PID.

1045
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03,040
If Danish soldiers, who put
their lives one the line, are prosecuted –

1046
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:08,400
– for violations of the military
criminal code, on conjecture, –

1047
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11.640
– THEN we'll be somewhere,
we do not want to be.

1048
01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.920
Therefore, I must call
for acquittal on all charges.

1049
01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:21.000
And with that, I rest my case. Thank you.

1050
01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.560
Now it's your turn, Claus Michael
Pedersen, you have the last word.

1051
01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:30.040
Do you have anything to add,
that has not already been said?

1052
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.720
No.

1053
01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.080
Then we will retire
and deliberate on the case.

1054
01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.160
The verdict will be handed down
on Thursday the 14th

1055
01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.240
Let me go in front.

1056
01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01,240
This one's good!

1057
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,880
– Here! Throw it.
– This one's good.

1058
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,240
Two!

1059
01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.920
– Dad?
– Yes.

1060
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.960
– Look at this rock.
– Did you found an nice rock?

1061
01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.880
– No. ...'s got a hole in it.
– What?

1062
01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.320
– Hold it like this.
– Show him a rock skip.

1063
01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.080
– Hello!
– Can you see me?

1064
01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:38.600
– How many fingers am I holding up?
– Two.

1065
01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.400
– Okay, are you ready?
– No!!

1066
01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:48.320
– What?
– What a weak shot.

1067
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.080
Yeah, it was a silly shot.

1068
01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.280
We will now pronounce the verdict.

1069
01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.800
Claus Michael Pedersen is acquitted.

1070
01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.920
The Treasury will pay the costs of the trial.

1071
01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.120


1072
01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01,560
Can I ... Can I ...
Can I please have order in the court?

1073
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:06,480
A reaction is understandable,
but please, refrain from it.

1074
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:11,560
Please sit down, and I will provide
the reasoning for the verdict.

1075
01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.960
The verdict is unanimous, –

1076
01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:22.600
– and that means
that we all three agree with the result.

1077
01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.640
– This is Afghanistan, right?
– Mhm.

1078
01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.040
– And that is Denmark, right?
– Mhm.

1079
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.320
And this is Madagascar,
that is South Africa –

1080
01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:56.760
– and this is Brazil,
and this is Italy.

1081
01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01,160
Or I mean ...
What was it?

1082
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,760
– USA.
– USA.

1083
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,680
– Come.
– USA. USA.

1084
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12.000
– Now go to bed. USA.
– Dad?

1085
01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.080
– Do you have to go away again?
– No. I don't.

1086
01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.920
– So you'll stay at home now?
– Yes.

1087
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31.120
Could you tuck me in tomorrow then?

1088
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35.120
Could you?

1089
01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.360
I sure can.

1090
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:43.520
– I love you.
– I love you too. Good night.

1091
