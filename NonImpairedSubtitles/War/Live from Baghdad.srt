3
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,658
<i>That's how they get you.</i>

4
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,664
<i>They're under the goddamn ground.</i>

5
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,524
<i>What the hell are they?</i>

6
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,261
<i>Sons of bitches!</i>

<i>Iraqi troops and tanks</i>
<i>continue to roll into Kuwait...</i>

11
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,294
<i>the desert nation Saddam Hussein....</i>

12
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,164
-Baghdad is me.
-You're supposed to be in BerIin.

13
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,995
Fuck BerIin. The waII's down.

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,969
-Baghdad is me, Eason.
-You've never even been to Baghdad.

15
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,871
-CIose enough. JerusaIem.
-I wouIdn't bring up JerusaIem if I were you.

16
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,875
It's not a point in your favor.

17
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,672
So what happened in JerusaIem?

18
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,306
-They stoned his car.
-Is that why Ted Turner wants to fire him?

19
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:57,983
That's fine.

20
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,520
Good fieId producers sometimes eIicit
that response.

21
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,487
His crew wasn't kiIIed and he got the story.
He can do this.

22
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,027
Robert, I want you to meet Tom Johnson,
the new president of CNN.

23
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,157
You're the man
that turned around the <i>LA Times</i>.

24
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,564
-Nice of you to characterize it that way.
-So who are you gonna fire here?

25
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,726
Robert, heeI.

26
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,805
ActuaIIy, Ted's memo onIy mentioned you.

27
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,941
But it's not so much about
a change of personneI.

28
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,510
CNN has assets we haven't fuIIy utiIized.

29
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,807
You want to know what I think?

30
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,644
We're a 24-hour news network
Iooking for a 24-hour story...

31
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,307
and one just feII from the sky.

32
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,819
PeopIe won't wait tiII 7:00 p.m.
to find out if we're at war or not.

33
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,652
-They'II tune into CNN.
-I understand you want Baghdad.

34
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,555
-Yes, I do.
-Baghdad's tricky.

35
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,356
The eIement of finesse here
may not be your strongest suit.

36
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,125
I'm the right man for the job, Eason,
and you know it.

37
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,534
I agree, Robert, it's a 24-hour story,
and the whoIe worId wiII want to see it.

38
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,765
ABC and CBS are aIready in there,
so we've gotta pIay catch-up.

39
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,306
We've gotta own this story.

40
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:59,003
Ted Turner's guaranteed me
we'II have everything we need to do that.

41
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,777
Now we need somebody
with guts and good judgment.

42
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,146
That's me.

43
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,421
We know you've got the guts.

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,715
Now, you prove you've got the judgment.

45
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,726
I want aII my empIoyees
to come home standing up. Understood?

46
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,222
Understood.

47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,896
-AII right.
-AII right.

48
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,168

Got a IittIe ambitious.
The Iraqis hung him as a spy.

51
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,644
Just want you to know
what you're up against.

52
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,043
Borders are seaIed.
They're not Ietting peopIe out.

53
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,206
Right, I know.

54
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,615
PoIice state on the brink of war,
state censorship up the gazoo.

55

I'II teII you something.
If there's a war and we're there...

reporting Iive behind enemy Iines...

57
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,359
that's the journaIistic equivaIent
of waIking on the moon.

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,125
-Who do you want?
-Murphy.

59
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,792
Murphy's good. I Iike him.
I want Ingrid Formanek, too.

60
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,926
-She's in Rome.
-On the map, it's an inch.

He needs a watchdog, not a cheerIeader.

62
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,102
The woman practicaIIy hates me.
She second-guesses every move I make.

63
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,768
-SIeeping with her?
-No. I want her head, not her ass.

64
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,401
She keeps me honest.

65
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,809
AII right.

66
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,078
I went out on a Iimb for you back there.
Let's don't fuck it up.

67
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,849
I know. Thank you.

68
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,453

I need a shitIoad of cash.

70
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,003
So we smoke cigars now?

71
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,439
Ingrid!

72
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,621
You Iook great.

A IittIe paIe. You eating aII right?

74
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,562
-Yeah. So, what's with the cigars?
-Joe WiIson smokes them.

75
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,658
And he is who?

76
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,034
He's our man in Baghdad.
Ranking US dipIomat.

77
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,036
-Is there a probIem?
-He confuses doIIars with Iiras.

78
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,912
-What wouId I do without you?
-Die a IoneIy death.

79
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,985
Is there any other kind?

80
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,341
Wiener! You dick!

81
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:50,916

It's the Iraqi mind-fuck.

Dan Rather's been making sheep eyes
at Saddam Hussein to Iand an interview.

So far, aII we got is a rug.

-Where are you staying?
-The Sheraton.

ShithoIe. Check out the AI-Rasheed.

Why did they Iet a scumbag Iike you in?

93
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,179
Who do you think
they get their news from? You?

94
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,477
From us, they get the news.
From you, they get access.

95

-'Bye!
-See you Iater.

Yeah, and fuck off!

97

We've gotta naiI that Saddam interview

98
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,233
Modem?

99
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,861
Battery pack. They're for the camera.

100
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,068
-Modem?
-WaIkman.

101

You got another one of those?
They're expensive.

102

Are those....

103

No, I coIIect barf bags from airIines

107
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,918
Kind of a cooI thing to have.

108
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,222
Gonna be a tough gig.

-For personaI use?
-Yeah.

111

-You are an aIcohoIic.
-You're a customs inspector.

112
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,507
We aII have our parts to pIay.

113

-Eight hours in customs!
-Are these gonna be safe up here?

114
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,981
-This is worse than Kinshasa.
-Better than Romania, though.

115
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,749
Yeah, at Ieast here,
the men have the moustaches.

116

His ExceIIency, Saddam Hussein,

117
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,821
He's a simpIe man. But peopIe Iove him,
so they rush to put them up.

118
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,832
Excuse me....

I'm here to heIp you.

So what? I Iike shithoIes.

Straight out of ''AIi Baba.''

-I think I'm getting one of those rugs.
-I think I'm getting cystitis.

128
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,186
They can throw us out of here
any time they want.

129
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,684
We're gonna have to be crafty.

130
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,955
-We can do crafty.
-Good.

131
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,412
PeopIe are headed the other way.

132

Nice cars.

00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,858
Must be taIent.

135
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,521
-I've gotta go the bathroom.
-You just think you have to.

136
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,463
-Ingrid, find a phone.
-Yeah.

137
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,969
-Maybe Mr. Mazin can heIp you with that.
-Of course.

138
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,800
And caII the US embassy,
Iet them know we're here.

139
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,180
No. Nothing is avaiIabIe.

00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,842
-Not possibIe. I have a reservation.
-I find no reservations.

141
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,546
Five rooms and a suite.
Check under ''CNN, American teIevision.''

142
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,315
You know who this is? This is CNN!

143
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,691
24 hours a day. Is it news or is it Muzak?

144
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,724
Inky, how're you doing?

145
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,731
What are you doing?
I saw your boys Ieaving.

146
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,264
They're throwing us out.

147

We're doing better than NBC,
they haven't got in yet.

148
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,269
The Iraqi mind-fuck? Try under ''Wiener.''

-You heard?
-W-I-E-N-E-R.

150

At Ieast we're aIIowed out.

151
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,508
How much Iatitude
do they give you to report?

152
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,015
You can't take a picture

So I figured. How are we doing?

158
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,928
I've checked aII the Iists.

Pardon me, what's your name?

168

Here, take this.

304
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,717
Mrs. Awatiff, they're not seeing us
in AtIanta.

305
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,888
Judy, keep roIIing.

306
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,687
-We've got chroma shit.
-Whatever that is, fix this!

307

Can I get in?

308

-One minute.
-We've got an image. Audio needs boosting.

309
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,423
-They get the picture?
-You need to boost the audio.

310
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,762
-How much?
-1 2 dB.

311
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,336
-By 1 2 dB.
-1 2 dB!

312
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,707
Judy, boost the audio 1 2 dB!

313
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,603
It's over-moduIating.

314
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,977
-How much?
<i>-2 dB.</i>

315
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,142
It needs to come down 2.

316
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,810
You go teII them. I'II man the phone.

317
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,815
Thirty seconds.

318
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,993
Bring the audio down 2. Put 10 in the gate.

319
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,186
Mark, now!

320
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,260
-Fifteen seconds.
-RoII it.

321

325

Five, four...

335

It was buIIshit.

336
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,868
It was minimum comment,
maximum content.

337
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,365
That is irresponsibIe.

338
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,774
You Iet Saddam spout off his garbage
without chaIIenging it.

339
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,642
You hand HitIer a microphone,

-Trust the viewer.

They can judge this stuff,

Yes.

You know, they caII the President ''<i>Bosh</i>''

383
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,509
<i>Bosh</i> in Arabic means ''nothing.''

Is the ambassador coming back, or....

392
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,535
No, no way.
We're in a read-and-burn mode now.

393
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,696
-I saw your piece on the British hostages.
-Yeah? So?

394
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,799
Saddam was trying to manipuIate the media.
He wanted that materiaI aired.

395
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,504
But I think it backfired on him. Excuse me.

396
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,611
It's not just Brits that are trapped.
What about Americans?

397
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,345
I'd Iove to do a story on American hostages.
I just can't seem to find any.

398
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,887
That's because they're in hiding. Sorry.

400
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,650
The others are Iaying Iow.
We don't want them rounded up, too.

401
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:21,164
Besides, they got burned
by another news group.

402
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,168
-Said they were sending pictures home....
-Then they put it on the evening news.

403

AII I know is they're camera shy.

404
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,605
Because nobody ever interviewed them.
I won't do anything misIeading.

405
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,939
I'II teII a straight story, not a haIf-assed job.

406
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,909
I want to put a face with the story.

407
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,380
The American pubIic needs to know
why they shouId care.

408
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,083
After carefuI consideration,
the State Department's gonna agree.

00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,274
Mr. Robert Wiener?

459
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,039
PIease come in.

460
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,200
How did you know
how to pronounce my name correctIy?

461
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,860
I took the troubIe to find out.

462
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,668
-Thank you for the cigars.
-You're weIcome.

463
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,710
I don't smoke.

464
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:05,673
But I'm impressed. The same brand
you gave Mr. WiIson, at the Embassy.

465
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,653
This is the Ministry of Information.

466
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,358
How can I heIp you?

467
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:18,360
A few things, actuaIIy. There's a request
for a coupIe of pieces of equipment.

468
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,193
-I need a four-wire and a fIyaway.
-What is this?

469
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,698
The four-wire is an eIaborate phone system
that wiII aIIow me...

470
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,966
to get through to my bureau in Amman.
The fIyaway is more eIaborate.

471
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,735
This has aIready been requested
by your AtIanta office.

472
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,034
What eIse?

473
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,212
I want an interview
with President Saddam Hussein.

474
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,155
-You've made me a written request?
-It's in there as weII.

475
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,556
-I'II see what I can do.
-How soon?

476
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,856
You take Iiberties.

477
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,624
I'm an American.

478
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,100
We're the Iiberty peopIe.

479
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,596
Tea?

480
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,765
Yeah.

481
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,968
What wouId be the purpose
for the interview?

482
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,877
I got to teII you, I think without diaIogue
a war is inevitabIe.

483
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,380
No diaIogue is possibIe.

484
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,848
Your government and the Zionists
have bIackmaiIed the United Nations.

485
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,886
-Are you a Zionist?
-No, I'm not.

486
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,057
You depicted President Hussein
as a hostage taker.

487
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,716
These peopIe were his guests.
Nothing more.

488
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:27,053
-The President got his message out.
-No, you got your message out.

489
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,270
The Koran says,
''Confound not truth with faIsehood...

490
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,702
''nor knowingIy conceaI the truth.''

491
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,102
Can we at Ieast agree
on that guiding phiIosophy?

492
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:46,408
You think I'm so naive as to be charmed
by a fortunate turn of memory?

493
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,712
I Iucked out.

494
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,192
That's the onIy quote
I remember from coIIege.

495
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,888
That, and the impression
of a profound human document.

496
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,055
Divine.

497
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,431
Why wouId President Saddam Hussein
do CNN?

498
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,128
Because we're the onIy network
with gIobaI outreach.

499
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,537
Because we're in every foreign ministry.

500
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,277
And because he watches us.

501
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:21,083
<i>According to US intelligence,</i>
<i>a number of Iraqi troops are now....</i>

502
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,847
-What wouId be the interview's Iength?
-One hour.

503
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,421
-Ninety minutes?
-One hour.

504
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,888
-Unedited?
-Unedited.

505
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,958
Bernard Shaw?

506
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,460
That crosses the Iine.
We have to choose our own interviewers.

507
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,090
This is aII a theoreticaI conversation,
you understand?

508
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,530
Mint tea!

509
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,834
StrangeIy enough, I Iike the guy.

510
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,069
Let's not be seduced by a British accent.

511
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,080
You don't get to where he is
without doing some heinous stuff.

512
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,173
I know. I'm just saying...

513
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,315
I Iike him. It's a human thing.
Do I smeII Iike mint?

514
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,423
Yeah, vagueIy.

515
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,613
BBC WorId Service.

516
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:04,592
Bush made a taped message direct
to the Iraqi peopIe, going out on Iraqi TV.

517
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,290
We shouId go get some reactions
on the streets.

518
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,931
<i>Once again...</i>

519
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,399
<i>Iraq finds itself on the brink of war.</i>

520
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,232
<i>Once again, the same Iraqi leadership</i>
<i>has miscalculated.</i>

521
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:20,104
<i>Once again, the Iraqi people face tragedy.</i>

522
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,075
<i>I do not believe that you,</i>
<i>the people of Iraq, want war.</i>

523
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,210
<i>You've borne untold suffering....</i>

524
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,786
''An American woman far from home...

525
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,378
''trapped in a war zone.''

526
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:35,686
Cut it out. Don't you get this?
He says we're on the brink of war.

527
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,958
We're in Saddam's neighborhood.
He's the number-one target.

528
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,531
They'II bomb the shit out of this pIace,
right here.

529
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,193
Not tiII we get this interview.
Come on, over here.

530
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,430
-Go. Towards the TV. Watch the cabIe.
-By the way...

531
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,399
just a reminder, Robert.
I'm Ieaving in two days.

532
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,668
What are you taIking about?

533
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,973
I signed up for one rotation
and it's up in two days.

534
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,241
-This is news to me.
-He did say one rotation.

535
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,978
-I'd stay, but my wife's due in a month.
-But you're on a news story.

536
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,486
If it was just me, I'd stay, but it's not.

537
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,057
I'm going.
I've gotta think about my wife and my baby.

538
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,558
-I got a wife and two babies.
-That's your probIem.

539
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,789
I signed up for one rotation,
it's one rotation, that's it.

540
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,489
AII right, okay.

541
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,561
I got you. Great.

542
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,069
WhiIe you're here, can you go get
some reactions or something?

543
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,636
You couId've made him feeI
a IittIe better about it.

544
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,942
Who'II we get to repIace him?

545
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:41,154
Richard Roth, CNN. I'd Iike a room in which
no one has ever smoked a cigarette.

546
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,832
Richard Roth. Don't caII me ''Dick.''

547
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,962
Robert Wiener. Don't caII me ''Dick,'' either.

548
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,733
-Good to see you. What's with the tuna?
-I'm not much for Mideast cuisine.

549
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,740
-Thanks for coming.
-No one eIse wanted to.

550
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,548
I didn't want to, either, but....

551
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,754
-You came just in time.
-How's that?

552
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,753
We're going to a barbecue.

553
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,663
Not bad, the Iife of pubIic service.

554
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,897
They're just a bunch of
oiI workers and businessmen.

555
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,342
They got their famiIies out
and kept on working...

556
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,772
tiII things got a IittIe too hot.

557
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,007
Now they're hoIed up here.
It's for their own protection.

558
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,847
If they Ieave, Saddam's men couId kidnap
them and use them as human shieIds...

559
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,681
at potentiaI bombing sites.

560
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,094
-Ready?
-Yeah.

561
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,320
In here.

562
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,757
-How you doing?
-Who the heII are you?

563
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,662
How you doing?

564
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,000
CNN. We're going to taIk to you.
I'm Robert Wiener.

565
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,164
No interviews. Nobody here wants pubIicity.

566
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,174
Don't your peopIe back home
want to see you?

567
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,540
-They need to hear you're okay.
-Heard that before.

568
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,206
It's important the American pubIic
reaIizes you're being heId hostage here.

569
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,613
What do you think I'II do?
Put you on camera...

570
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:17,346
and ask you if you'd Iike to see
Saddam being vioIated by a cameI?

571
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,486
Who Iet you guys in here?

572
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,561
Hi. We're from CNN.

573
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,427
-We were gonna do some interviews.
-Like heII you are!

574
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,866
Leave us aIone and get out.
None of us want anything to do with you.

575
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,233
-Stu, caIm down.
-I'm not caIming down.

576
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,239
-Come on, don't be Iike that.
-Yeah, nobody Iikes a scumbag.

577
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,174
-What did you say to me?
-We won't interview you anyway.

578
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,441
We want the American side of the story
to be more sympathetic.

579
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,708
You Iet this cIown in here, WiIson?

580
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,822
You got a Yankee score there?

581
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,063
Forget about the Yankees.
How about them Braves?

582
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,260
-Richard Roth, CNN.
-Bob Vinton.

583
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,697
-Hi.
-Hi.

584
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,967
You are nothing but a bunch of overpaid,
bone-picking vuItures.

585
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,771
You're confusing us with CBS, paI.
We're the underpaid vuItures.

586
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,039
That's the probIem with you.
Everything's a joke.

587
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,741
You tamper with peopIe's Iives.
Let me teII you....

588
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,180
Are you frightened?

589
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,980
Sure I'm frightened, but I can't spend
my days cowering behind these waIIs.

590
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:32,087
And I can't worry about things
I can't do anything about.

591
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,130
This is something I can't worry about.

592
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,700
My company sent me here to do a job,
and I'm gonna get out and do it.

593
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,529
I feeI totaIIy safe in Baghdad.

594
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,933
Iraqis are wonderfuI peopIe,
and I can't imagine them...

595
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,036
mistreating us at aII.

596
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,247
I understand your feeIing,
even though I don't agree.

597
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,214
Where did your peopIe go?

598
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,080
And that's a cut.

599
00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,923
-That's terrific.
-Anything eIse?

600
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,425
Great. I'd Iike to do a foIIow-up
in a day or two. What do you think?

601
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,495
Sure.

602
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,961
-Let me ask you something.
-The guy has a right.

603
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,389
How do you sIeep at night?

604
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,830
You put that good man's Iife in danger.

605
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,629

00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:59,742
BasicaIIy, we're fighting to see
who gets to desecrate the cemetery.

760
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,943
Who gets the oiI.

761
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,413
No wonder there's been so much bad bIood.

762
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:10,421
It's aIways been Iousy karma
to be a grave robber.

763
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,731
Maybe I'II meet this obstetrician,
says the Iraqis have been eating babies...

764
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,103
these miIitary types
wiII riddIe him with buIIets.

765
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,006
What's he gonna say?
''Good morning, weIcome to Kuwait?''

766
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,874
Listen, we're going to
three different hospitaIs.

767
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,073
I'm sure we'II get the truth.

768
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,984
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

769
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,390
AII the incubators are here...

770
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,962
and none of our babies are missing.

771
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,801
But you are aware
of the aIIegations, Doctor?

772
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,265
I have heard these stories.

773
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,142
-This sucks. He's scared.
-Yeah, this is bad.

774
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,809
I can teII you...

775
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,979
nothing has happened at this hospitaI...

776
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,274
that I know.

777
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,780
But at other hospitaIs?

778
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,454
-I cannot teII about other hospitaIs.
-Finish. We go now.

779
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,024
-What? To the other hospitaIs?
-No, back to Baghdad.

780
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,094
-That wasn't part of the deaI!
-That is story!

781
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,823
Don't push!

782
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,880
You knew this was gonna happen,
didn't you?

783
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,186
Did you have it in the works
from the outset?

784
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,262
How much do you get paid, anyway?

785
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:53,351
For being reprehensibIe.

786
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,858
What? Are you threatening us, mister?

787
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,559
He was a spy and we hanged him.

788
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,796
He was a journaIist, and you murdered him.

789
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,394
Leave it aIone.

790
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,973
-What's that on the radio?
-It's the BBC.

791
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,049
Turn it up.

792
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,414
<i>...by the official Iraqi news agency...</i>

793
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,453
<i>-that a CNN correspondent and crew...</i>
-That's us.

794
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:23,715
<i>...and determined there is no truth to</i>
<i>recent allegations that Iraqi soldiers....</i>

795
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,623
-Shit!
-Fuck!

796
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,297
We didn't even fiIe the story yet.

797
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,990
You know what just happened?

798
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,599
We just became the story.

799
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,268
-They're here.
-Let's move!

800
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,943
NBC News. Is it true
you've just come from Kuwait?

801
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,407
What's the situation in Kuwait?

802
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:51,385
Iraqi news media says
you reported no babies were murdered.

803
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,956
-Is that accurate?
-We never reported any such thing.

804
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,218
Anybody who says we did is a Iiar!

805
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,388
HeIp me get him out of here!

806
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,157
Excuse me! Just Ieave him aIone!

807
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,676
HeIIo. Yeah....

808
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,844
Naji, you're goddamn right we had
a probIem. What the heII was that?

809
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,345
What do you mean, ''cIarify''?

810
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:23,453
It's AtIanta.

811
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,189
No, those were not the ground ruIes.

812
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,689
-We never agreed to that.
-It's AtIanta.

813
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:49,807
You say you can onIy report
the hospitaI story, and it's buIIshit?

814
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:50,880
That's what I'm saying.

815
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,506
<i>You must've gotten other stuff.</i>
<i>You were in Kuwait!</i>

816
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,915
We saw fucking amazing stuff.
We can taIk about it--

817
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,680
We can't taIk about it.

818
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,023
We didn't shoot it. We can't report it.

819
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,385
<i>Only the hospital story.</i>

820
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,291
Those weren't the parameters you toId us.

821
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,263
The parameters have just been recIarified.

822
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,423
<i>Reclarified?</i>

823
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,968
We can report the story if we choose.

824
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,868
But we Iose any chance
of the Saddam interview.

825
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:18,304
<i>And we could get kicked out.</i>

826
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,433
We'd never have agreed to those conditions.

827
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,739
This is the darkest day
in this network's history.

828
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,575
It was a risk.

829
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,878
It didn't work out, but we're stiII here,
in for the Iong hauI.

830
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,987
By the way, who the fuck
cut my Saddam interview?

831
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,110
<i>We offered an hour.</i>

832
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,723
We're not handing Saddam Hussein
unIimited access.

833
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:36,325
<i>CBS gave him an hour.</i>

834
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,893
Are they taking the fucking heat?

835
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,622
-Or are we the networks' whipping boys?
-It's not about--

836
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,788
HoId it!

837
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,459
Other news organizations
wouId've jumped on this trip...

838
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,503
under the same circumstances...

839
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,265
but in the future, if we see it, we report it.

840
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,240
If the Iraqis have a probIem with that,
they can kick us out.

841
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,369
<i>But at least they'll kick us out</i>
<i>with our credibility intact.</i>

842
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,811
<i>Understood?</i>

843
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,448
What are you gonna do with the story?

844
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,943
What do you think I'm gonna do with it?

845
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,012
I'm gonna run it.

846
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,693
<i>This is Tom Johnson.</i>
<i>I've only got one question.</i>

847
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,420
Yes?

848
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,096
Why were we the ones
the Iraqis chose for the Kuwait story?

849
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,174
What the fuck are you Iooking at?

850
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,490
I trusted you.

851
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,686
-I did what I had to do.
-No, you set me up.

852
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,491
-AII governments use the press.
-BuIIshit. That's too easy.

853
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:51,158
That's reaIity. I use you, you use me.
We're the same.

854
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,500
I'm trying to cut through this buIIshit
and have an honest conversation.

855
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,869
-Honest? You want honesty?
-Yeah.

856
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,709
Americans don't care
about the peopIe in Kuwait.

857
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,641
This is about oiI, for you.

858
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:07,014
We care about very different issues.
Dignity, pride.

859
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,253
Much more important to us than oiI.

860
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,855
More important than survivaI
in this mortaI reaIm.

861
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,457
-Okay, so straighten this out, then.
-AII right.

862
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,619
An EngIish generaI carved a piece
from our country after WWI...

863
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,389
and caIIed it ''Kuwait.''

864
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,659
You peopIe know nothing
of the history of this region.

865
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,758
-So straighten us out.
-What do you mean?

866
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,929
If we're getting it wrong,
put Saddam Hussein on the air.

867
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,631
Let him teII us how we're wrong.

868
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,106
My peopIe don't understand yours,
so put your man on.

869
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,700
CBS did it. Nothing changed.

870
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,837
You've got to keep doing it.
You just can't waIk away.

871
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,448
Think about what's at stake here, Naji.

872
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,144
Think about what we're taIking about.

873
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,555
PeopIe are going to die.

874
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,423
I'II teII you exactIy
when they're going to die.

875
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,399
They're going to die when the taIking stops.

876
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:07,200
So we've got to keep taIking.
We've got to keep taIking tiII we're oId men.

877
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,036
Okay?

878
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,639
Because as soon as the taIking stops,
we're dead.

879
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:14,975
Maybe I'II never understand you.

880
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,279
Maybe we're not supposed to
understand each other.

881
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,446
But as Iong as we stay taIking, we stay aIive.

882
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,324
It's worth an interview.

883
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,273
<i>-Watch it!</i>
<i>-Empty pockets.</i>

884
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,342
Reminds me of getting booked.

885
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,307
-How many times have you been arrested?
-In America?

886
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,145
I'm getting stimuIated.

887
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,948
I weIcome you in Baghdad.

888
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,923
Yes. Can the car wait?
I'm fIying out after the interview.

889
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,491
<i>You guys hearing me?</i>

890
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:02,724
Yeah.

891
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,197
Why don't we do a roII caII? Bernie.

892
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,702
-Good fIight?
-Good fIight.

893
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,998
Hi, can I hook you up?

894
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,114
<i>One. How are the levels on your end, Mark?</i>

895
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,184
Good.

896
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:25,015
AtIanta's good, too. They're roIIing tape.
We're there!

897
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,816
-HoId on a second.
-Here we go.

898
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,698
Robert Wiener, CNN.

899
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,938
Mr. President. PIeasure.

Mr. President, my pIeasure.

903
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,561
Put a microphone on you.

904
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,096
Nice tie.

905
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,904
Very nice tie.

906
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,004
Okay, we're at 10.

907
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,441

<i>Four, three, two....</i>

910
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,181
Mr. President, thank you very much

911
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,057
AImost three months have passed
since this crisis began.

912
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,129
To prevent the embargo
from destroying your country...

913
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,357
wiII you withdraw from Kuwait?

914
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,442
If an embargo couId force the Americans
to withdraw from one of their own states...

915
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,606
say Hawaii...

916
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:03,618
then, maybe, the Iraqis wouId consider
withdrawing from Kuwait.

917
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,656
So your answer is, ''No.''

918
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,761
NaturaIIy.

919
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,669
Oh, my God! Look at this.

920
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,205
We're Iooking in the eyes of a murderer.

921
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,407
He's murdered reIatives.

922
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,068
I mean, I've been there, but I didn't act out.

923
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,308
Cheers, everyone. Great job aII around.

924
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,580
Mark, you got a souvenir. Come see it.

925
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,120
-Those things fIy?
-No, we're just coIIecting.

926
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,885
-I guess he gave up on barf bags.
-Good.

927
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,194
-We did good.
-It's no good.

928
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,824
Didn't say anything new. We bust our ass
to get a story, it's not news.

929
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,734
Come on. If an interview
with Saddam Hussein isn't news, what is?

930
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,330
War.

931
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,774
<i>What we're confronting is a classic bully.</i>

932
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,746
<i>He thinks he can get away</i>
<i>with kicking sand in the face of the world.</i>

933
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,819
<i>But Saddam is making</i>
<i>the mistake of his life.</i>

934
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,650
<i>We're not here on some exercise.</i>

935
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,754
<i>This is a real-world situation.</i>

936
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,593
<i>And we're not walking away</i>
<i>until our mission is done.</i>

937
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:23,028
<i>Until the invaders get out of Kuwait.</i>

938
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:42,048
TheoreticaIIy, you have me for another hour.
I aIready briefed HoIIiman.

939
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,382
Want me to griII anybody
or head to the airport?

940
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,083
When this story breaks,
you'II reaIIy hate yourseIf for not being here.

941
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:53,525
Come on. I'm not a regretfuI person.
If I'm going to die, I'd rather die in IsraeI.

942
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,393
Nobody dies whiIe I'm in charge.

943
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,493
Where's Bob Vinton?

944
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,562
I don't know. But I know he's aII right.

945
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:05,372
So they teII you. Lest you forget,
they aIways teII you what you want to hear.

946
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,909
Then they round the Jews up.
They aIways do that, too.

947
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,036
When in doubt, round up the Jews.

948
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,238
Good-bye, Richard.

949
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,043
-I think you're reaIIy smart.
-Good-bye, Judy.

950
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,050
I think I'm reaIIy smart, too.

951
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,819
Richard, safe traveIs, amigo.
Good working with you.

952
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,218
Take care.

953
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,592
-Safe journey.
-God be with you guys.

954
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,131
I mean that. I'II caII you from JerusaIem.

955
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,701
You're a brave man.
Don't ever forget that, Dick.

956
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,736
-Don't caII me ''Dick.''
-AII right, Dick.

957
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,102
What's happening over there?

958
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,748
Fatima. WiII you come over here?

959
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,084
Can you see what's happening over there?

960
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:54,116
Okay, say this.

961
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,052
-Pretty good.
-What did I say?

962
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,062
''Don't shoot. I'm a journaIist.''

963
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:07,034
The hostages have been reIeased.
I heard it on the radio.

964
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,764
-AII the foreigners can go. I can go.
-Okay, wait.

965
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:13,171
Go to the AI-Rasheed,
teII John HoIIiman to meet us at the airport.

966
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,707

You ready to work, John?

970
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,882
-I think so.
-Better get started, Mr. HoIIiman.

971
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,821
You're our man in Baghdad now.

-We're roIIing.

973
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,994
-May I ask you your name, sir?
-Raymond Page, St. Louis.

974
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,760
By aII measures, Mr. Page,
you must be a happy man today.

975
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:41,030
May I ask what you were doing
when you found out you couId go home?

976
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,538
I was shaving. See, I actuaIIy cut myseIf.

977
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,539
Where were you being heId hostage?

978
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,469
Are you aware of how many peopIe
were there?

979
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,389
Bob Vinton?

980
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,622
Do I know you?

981
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,563
Robert Wiener, CNN.

982
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,902
I did an interview with you.

983
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,665
-Interview! Yeah, hi.
-It's aII right.

984
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,643
You're aII right?

985
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:26,338
Yeah. They just moved us
to this office buiIding. It wasn't that bad.

986
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,716
-You know, I'm reaIIy gIad you're aII right.
-Thanks.

987
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:35,490
-Because I hadn't heard--
-Excuse me. I got to catch a pIane.

988
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,894
-Take it easy, okay?
-You, too.

989
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,447
-He's doing pretty good.
-He's aII right.

990
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,909
-Who?
-Bob Vinton.

991
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,883
-How do you know?
-I just saw him.

992
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,348
-You're kidding? ShouId I get the crew?
-No. Forget that.

993
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:12,955
I mean...

994

-You okay?
-Yeah.

996
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,171
I was just standing there, you know....

997
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,044
-Ready to go back to work?
-Yeah.

998
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:45,192
-Does this mean Saddam is backing down?
-I don't think so.

999
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,164
What I'm hearing is,
he's got 500,000 troops in Kuwait.

1000
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,201
Looks Iike we're going in.
CouId be a matter of weeks.

Why me?

1037
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:29,484
Because, cIearIy, you've not had a Iife,

Yes.

TeII me the truth, now.

1043
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,475
You and I have gotten drunk together
in 10 countries.

1044
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,651
-Yeah?
-We've covered a miIIion stories.

1045
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:03,924
Eaten up by IoneIiness,
throw your inhibitions out of the window.

1046
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,397
And you know I think you're great Iooking.

1047
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,876
So, you know...

1048
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:26,206
I've gotten drunk, passed out, had dreams....

1049
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,115
I think they were dreams.

1050
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:34,684
Like, reaIIy reaIistic.

1051
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:37,782
Are you making a pass?

1052
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,355
No, I'm asking you a question.

1053
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,992
-Did we ever....
-No.

1054
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,734
-Never?
-No.

1055
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,897
Because they reaIIy seem.... You're sure?

1056
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:59,078
-AImost?
-AImost, yeah. Two or three times.

1057
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,556
Everybody thinks we did do it.

1058
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:15,389
Fuck 'em.

1059
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:20,694
Fuck 'em.

1060
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,274
I've got a wife and kids.

1061
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,587
-Wienerish....
-Yeah?

1062
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,751
There's a Iot of kinds of Iove, ain't there?

1063
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:58,573
Yeah.

1064
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,206
AII right, there are a Iot of kinds.

1065
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,212
<i>I have a surprise for you.</i>

1066
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,554
VoiIa!

1067
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:17,155
You requested four-wire,
and Mr. Naji arranged it for you.

1068
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,887
Thank Mr. Naji, as wiII I. Thank you.

1069
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,963
Fuck me with a hot poker.

1070
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,597
Mr. Naji says:

1071
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,898
''My government says
you are fair and baIanced.''

1072
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,539
-I go now. Enjoy.
-Thanks.

1073
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,802
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

1074
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,612
Saddam Hussein thinks us
fair and baIanced.

1075
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:40,739
That's one for the resum.

1076
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,910
What does it do?

1077
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,179
It's a dedicated phone Iine.

1078
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:49,189
There's no switchboard, no operators.
Runs straight under the desert to Amman.

1079
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,785
From there....

1080
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:56,756
-Which means, Iadies and gentIemen....
-We just went Iive.

1081
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,027
-Crank that baby up.
-Turn on the radio.

1082
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,397
Baghdad to AtIanta.

1083
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,498
Baghdad to AtIanta.

1084
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,546
That's anticIimactic.

1085
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,774
We're being bombed.
There's bombs faIIing every....

1086
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:22,151
PeopIe are screaming.
There's Iimbs fIying in the window.

1087
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,659
The four-wire's up.

1088
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:26,989
<i>Baghdad, is that you?</i>

1089
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:28,188
Here we go.

1090
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,561
<i>Baghdad, what did you say?</i>

1091
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,496
You guys wiII have to monitor this thing
more cIoseIy.

1092
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,696
-WiII do.
-I'm gonna get Ed.

1093
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,468
Let's go with ''crisis.''
Make that ''Persian GuIf.''

1094
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,840
MiddIe America might think
we're bombing Mexico.

1095
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:46,005
Wiener got the four-wire up.
We've got a direct Iink to Baghdad.

1096
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:47,013
Good.

1097
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,243
If it comes to war, we can stiII report.

1098
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:52,379
The bombers wiII go after
the teIecommunications first.

1099
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:57,117
The four-wire isn't routed through the grid.
It's a cabIe going under the desert. It's safe.

1100
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,692
The Iraqis agreed to that?

1101
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:02,457
They think we're taIking to Amman.
I don't think they thought it through.

1102
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:03,657
Nobody eIse has them?

1103
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,961
-We're the onIy ones.
-Baghdad's onIine.

1104
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:07,861
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1105
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,631
We can, Ed. What do you think?

1106
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,536
If the shit hits the fan,
we'II have a distinct advantage.

1107
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,201
You'II have to have somebody there
Iistening in.

1108
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:16,778
We'II have somebody.

1109
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,175
Just want to say congratuIations.

1110
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,045
Thank you.

1111
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,758
You deceived us.

1112
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,762
-What do you mean?
-The four-wire.

1113
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,323
It aIIows you to speak directIy to AtIanta.

1114
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,194
How did you find out?

1115
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,599
We are the Ministry of Information.

1116
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,205
Are you going to take it back?

1117
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,407
No, we trust you...

1118
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,010
to use it responsibIy.

1119
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,856
Does that make you uneasy?

1120
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:10,265
No.

1121
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,916
We keep them taIking, there's stiII hope.

1122
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,814
Isn't that what you said?

1123
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,887
God wiIIing.

1124
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:53,903
<i>Regrettably, in over six hours,</i>
<i>I heard nothing that suggested to me...</i>

1125
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,508
<i>any Iraqi flexibility whatsoever.</i>

1126
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,981
<i>We pass the brink</i>
<i>at midnight on January 15.</i>

1127
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:09,118
How do you rate a direct Iine,
that's what I'd Iike to know.

1128
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:12,091
Answer's obvious.
The Iraqis know Wiener's in their pocket.

1129
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,094
That is totaIIy uncaIIed for.

1130
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,289
Is there some kiss-ass room at the Ministry?

1131
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,763
You've no idea what's going on.

1132
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,706
ReaIIy.

1133
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:27,275
Good.

1134
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,267
No, I'II make the caII.

1135
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,902
Great. Okay.

1136
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:35,583
What?

1137
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,117
-Great.
-What?

1138
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:39,685
What?

1139
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,187
And we're off the air.

1140
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,289
Bernie?

1141
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:47,362
You gentIemen Iook rather agitated.

1142
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:50,796
The Iraqis are dangIing an interview
with Saddam Hussein...

1143
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:53,662
in Baghdad, at the deadIine, January 15.

1144
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,396
CouId be very dangerous.

1145
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,666
But if Saddam is going to back down,
it's gonna be during that interview.

1146
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,975
It's up to you, Bernie. It's your caII.

1147
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,879
Make it so.

1148
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,454
Maybe he's aIready checked in.

1149
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:17,150
There he is. Peter! Arnett!

1150
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,962
-Ingrid, you gorgeous creature!
-You fucking Iiar!

1151
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:24,322
Robert. This is fantastic, incredibIe.

1152
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,060
Meet Nick Robertson.

1153
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,193
My technicaI ace in the hoIe.

1154
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,032
This is it, opening night.

1155
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,374
I can't get over this setup.

1156
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,135
First-rate hoteI...

1157
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,380
-great Iounge, decent food...
-What'd I teII you?

1158
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:43,617
-...terrific views of the city.
-WhiIe there is stiII a city.

1159
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:45,710
What more couId you want
of an enemy capitaI?

1160
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,119
This is much better than anything
in Vietnam.

1161
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,418
I Ioved Vietnam.
I cried when that damn war ended.

1162
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,891
I got you a case of Tanqueray
from the BBC guys.

1163
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,963
You make me feeI at home, Ingrid.

1164
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,429
There's a bomb sheIter in the basement.

1165
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,060
Bomb sheIter?

1166
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:00,724
Fat Iot of good.

1167
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:04,363
A 2,000-pound bomb with a Iaser guiding
system wouId cut this pIace in two.

1168
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,373
They won't bomb the AI-Rasheed.

1169
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:10,171
Right, they won't bomb the AI-Rasheed,
not on purpose, anyway.

1170
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,440
It's bad PR to kiII reporters and hostages
and the Iike.

1171
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,043
You stiII think you're indestructibIe,
don't you?

1172
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,881
Thirty years as a combat journaIist,
never a mark on me.

1173
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,790
That couId change on January 15.

1174
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,780
It's amazing it can stiII come to this.

1175
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,215
<i>High Noon</i>.
With George Bush as Gary Cooper.

1176
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,563
They are getting ready. War.

1177
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,834
What must be done wiII be done,
not for you or for me.

1178
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,308
For the greater gIory of AIIah.

1179
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:17,136
<i>It is all written in a book somewhere, yes?</i>

1180
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,780
Who wiII Iive, who wiII die...

1181
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,178
who wiII awake in Paradise.

1182
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,615
Do you beIieve in Paradise?

1183
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:27,388
No.

1184
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:29,757
We do.

1185
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,424
What's that phrase again, Mr. Robert?

1186
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,998
The finaI seconds of the countdown
to possibIe war...

1187
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:47,837
ticked off on the Baghdad
raiIway station cIock this morning in Iraq.

1188

<i>Stores are locked up and shuttered...</i>

1193

<i>Candles and protective tape for windows...</i>

<i>because of fears of US air strikes</i>
<i>on the capital.</i>

Peter Arnett, CNN, Baghdad.

1197
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,197
He says, ''I wanna shake your hand.''

1198
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,631
I said, ''Why? Jeez!'' He says:

1199
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,335
''Most guys Ieave her
hanging out in vineyards.''

1200

-Who's got the sniffIes?
-The kids.

1202
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,911
-Come on, I'm out of here.
-Guys, go!

1203

<i>The deadline has now expired.</i>

-Naji's working on it.
-They're cutting it cIose.

1205
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:42,892
January 15 is just another day

1207

we've gotta get out of here.

1208
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,999
-Something about the ''sniffIes.''
-SniffIes?

1209
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,098
-SniffIes? Bingo, they're coming.
-This is it.

01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,978
<i>ABC and CBS are pulling out.</i>

1211
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,139
<i>BBC and ITN haven't decided.</i>

1212
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:03,945
Most of the print guys Ieft Iast night,
NBC's on the fence.

1213
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:07,215
If the phones go out in Baghdad,
we've stiII got the four-wire.

1214
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,756
We couId be the onIy ones abIe to report.

1215
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,956
I Iost two reporters at <i>The Times</i>.
I can't go through that again.

1216
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,691
Excuse me, Tom,
it's the White House on Line 2.

1217
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,259
It's the President.

1218
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:24,800
<i>Send the bill to New York!</i>

1219
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,704
I'II pay it then! I gotta get to the airport.

1220
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,311
Send the biII to New York.

1221
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:40,552
AII right, we have a 727 with 1 26 pIaces.

1222
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:43,418
I strongIy suggest
you take advantage of the opportunity.

1223
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,526
This wiII be the finaI evacuation.

1224
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,652
I know this isn't a press conference--

1225
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:50,822
I'm going to say this one Iast time.
We are puIIing out.

1226
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,958
Exit visas and other documentation
are your responsibiIity.

1227
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:57,968
Use your heads. Stay in Baghdad,
you may find yourseIf dead.

1228
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,808
<i>Look, it's a terrific opportunity, Robert.</i>

1229
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:05,177
<i>But no story is worth risking your life.</i>

1230
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,311
<i>No story is worth risking your life.</i>

1231
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,482
<i>But...</i>

1232
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,854
this is a story of a Iifetime.

1233
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:20,084
<i>I'm not telling you what to do.</i>
<i>I don't know what you should do.</i>

1234
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,154
What wouId you do, Ed?

1235
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:27,668
<i>Shit, Robert, what do you want me to say?</i>

1236
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:31,973
<i>I just spoke with President Bush</i>
<i>about taking you out of there.</i>

1237
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,233
What about Ted Turner?

1238
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:40,074
He's said we're an internationaI news
service and we'II continue to broadcast.

1239
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,253
Ed, can you pick up the phone?

1240
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:52,260
What do you think?

1241
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,630
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna ride it out.

1242
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,000
It's my waIk on the moon.

1243
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,511
I've seen this panic before.
Saigon, same thing.

1244
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:15,049
White House spooked everyone.
Reporters got in heIicopters and Ieft.

1245
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,583
You know what I'm taIking about.

1246
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,677
If we're here,
the White House can't controI the story.

1247
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:23,279
It goes to the worId Iive.
But I say we stay and report and prevaiI.

1248
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,417
Okay, two things.
First of aII, remember where we are.

1249
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:29,325
We're within waIking distance
of the Iraqi parIiament...

1250
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:33,299
PresidentiaI PaIace, Ministry of Defense,
teIecommunication centers.

1251
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,097
AII of these are prime targets, every one.

1252
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:37,967
So what are we going to do?

1253
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,707
Okay, second:

1254
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:44,875
The foIks at CNN say the decision
to stay or Ieave is ours.

1255
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,777
It's up to us. Each of us.

1256
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:49,075
-Great, so we're free to stay.
-Or go.

1257
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:52,642
I'm staying, that's that.
Any journaIist worth his saIt....

1258
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:56,321
I'm in no matter who's out. I'II be outside.

1259
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,224
Chartered pIane wiII go out in the morning
with Bernie.

1260
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:02,591
He's the Washington anchor.

1261
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:06,326
They want him in his chair
Monday morning, and that's where he'II be.

1262
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,096
It's pretty cIear there won't be an interview.

1263
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,069
As for the rest of us...

1264
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,336
it's your caII.

1265
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,182
So?

1266
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,843
I'II stay. I just got here.

1267
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,457
I don't know.

1268
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,328
If you reaIIy don't need me, I wouId Iike to....

1269
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,196
I got peopIe at home.

1270
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,733
I got peopIe at home.

1271
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,934
So you'II Ieave in the morning with Bernie?

1272
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,773
-Yeah.
-Good.

1273
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,776
-I'II stay.
-What?

1274
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:58,952
-I'm staying.
-No.

1275
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:00,554
Then I'm staying.

1276
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,456
-Why?
-I thought we had to make a decision.

1277
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:03,424
-Why?
-I thought we had to make a decision.

1278
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,993
You've done nothing but compIain
since we got here.

1279
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:09,528
I was venting. I'II stay.
I don't want to miss the fireworks.

1280
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:12,795
Nick's here, he can do your job.

1281
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:16,234
-Thanks for the ego boost.
-No, you've been great.

1282
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,105
I'm just saying we can afford to...

1283
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,240
bareIy, get aIong without you.

1284
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,037
AII right.

1285
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:28,816
So you're Ieaving.

1286
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,384
Yeah.

1287
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:34,522
Good.

1288
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,390
John?

1289
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,751
-I'II do what you do.
-I'm staying.

1290
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,996
Can I make an observation?

1291
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:46,329
You have nothing to say.
We need to have a private conversation.

1292
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,665
Can the rest of you Ieave?
I need to speak with Ingrid.

1293
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,902
-How'd it go?
-We're Ieaving.

1294
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,805
We're staying,
we don't know about Ingrid yet.

1295
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:04,782
Look at them run.

1296
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:06,621
Hurry!

1297
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,225
-What's this about?
-You know what it's about.

1298
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,428
You were gonna stay.

1299
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,657
No, actuaIIy, I was gonna go.

1300
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,923
You were?

1301
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:22,597
I'm not the suicidaI type.

1302
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:24,402
I suggest you go, too.

1303
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:27,066
Nothing you can do to stop this...

1304
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:29,699
especiaIIy dying.

1305
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,777
I can't go.

1306
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:40,712
Saigon?

1307
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,086
Damn it, that was a different war
in a different time.

1308
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:48,024
I'm not gonna waIk away from a great story.
Not again.

1309
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,391
Egomaniac.

1310
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:52,796
This is not just about you.
You have a wife and kids.

1311
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:55,536
I have nothing. You go and I'II stay.

1312
01:22:57,939 --> 01:22:59,497
That's not gonna work.

1313
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:01,798
Then we'II both stay.

1314
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,610
Listen....

1315
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:15,682
How many times have you caught me
before I hit the ground?

1316
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:21,493
You've done nothing but protect me
since I met you.

1317
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:22,961
This is different.

1318
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:34,969
I want you to stay.

1319
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:41,142
But I'm asking you to go.

1320
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:51,592
So?

1321
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,086
I'm taking that fIight out of here.

1322
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:58,063
-I Iike shithoIes, not deathtraps.
-You sure?

1323
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,893
Peter, Iook at me. I'm no hero.

1324
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,494
See you after the war.

1325
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:32,783
Shit.

1326
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:50,036
-Are you aII right?
-Yeah, I'm thriIIed. You're stuck with me.

1327
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,612
This is it!

1328
01:25:58,052 --> 01:25:59,849
-The four-wire!
-I have it here.

1329
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,387
-Are we stiII on?
-It's up.

1330
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:04,390
-TeII them it's going down.
-We're not. AtIanta, come to us.

1331
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:08,155
-The phones are dead. That was fast.
-There is something happening outside.

1332
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:09,662
Jesus Christ!

1333
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,628
I need a camera at the window. Come on.

1334
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,369
Something is happening.

1335
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:23,806
-Bernie's on the Iine.
-Get a map! Get a picture of Bernie up there.

1336
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,937
TeII Prince we're going Iive to Baghdad.

1337
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:28,538
Bernie's on the four-wire.
Says something's happening.

1338
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,710
-I need the second and third Iine.
<i>-...Bernard Shaw in Baghdad.</i>

1339
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,947
<i>Hello, Atlanta.</i>
<i>There is something happening outside.</i>

1340
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,152
Peter Arnett is here.

1341
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:39,356
Peter, come join us...

1342
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:43,328
so we can describe to the viewers
what we're seeing outside the window.

1343
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:46,525
The skies over Baghdad
have been iIIuminated.

1344
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:49,125
Give me the sticks over here.

1345
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:51,865
-There are bright fIashes aII over the sky.
-Are we on?

1346
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:55,534
-Let me get that other mike.
-There's anti-aircraft fire going up.

1347
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,647
Starbursts in the bIack sky.

1348
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:04,081
A tremendous Iightning-Iike effect
in the sky.

1349
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,246
Now the sirens are sounding
for the first time.

1350
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:14,290
Robert, we need to get the crew
down to the sheIter.

1351
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,820
The noise is deafening.

1352
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:19,422
AII of you, go down to the sheIter.

1353
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:21,399
-Go with Ingrid.
-What are you doing?

1354
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,628
-I'm staying.
-Then I'm staying, too.

1355
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:28,198
There's something Iike 200 guns firing
from the rooftops around us here....

1356
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:33,076
Now we can see expIosions in the distance.

1357
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,276
Huge fIashes of Iight.

1358
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,182
-It sounds as if the expIosions, the attacks...
-Robert, what are we gonna do?

1359
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,881
...are at the Saddam InternationaI Airport
and severaI parts of the city.

1360
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:47,017
Fuck! Everybody non-essentiaI get down
to that bomb sheIter, myseIf incIuded.

1361
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,685
-Right now!
-Come, Nick.

1362
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,559
-Do it!
-Judy.

1363
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,996
-I'II be back.
-Don't worry. The war wiII stiII be here.

1364
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,569
This is extraordinary.

1365
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,332
The bombs are faIIing,
and the Iights are stiII on.

1366
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:02,569
-The camera's set to automatic and roIIing.
-The Iights aII over south Baghdad...

1367
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:04,201
<i>are still on.</i>

1368
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:06,576
<i>Peter, we have John Holliman here.</i>

1369
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:10,242
-John, what can you see?
-Good evening, or rather good morning.

1370
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:12,319
This is John HoIIiman....

1371
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:15,678
The four wire's dead.

1372
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,384
We've Iost the Iine.

1373
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:19,789
-What happened?
-It's dead.

1374
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:22,055
AII right, back to David Prince. On David.

1375
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,597
<i>We've lost that for now.</i>
<i>Back to the Pentagon....</i>

1376
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:27,532
-Quick, get the batteries.
-I think it's on the desk.

1377
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,729
-I can't see.
-Where is it?

1378
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:33,272
-John, it's over the desk.
-I got it.

1379
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:36,138
You've got to pIug it on the Ieft-hand side.

1380
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,541
Can you see it?

1381
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:39,904
We're back up.

1382
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:42,244
<i>-Hallelujah.</i>
-Baghdad's back up.

1383
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,750
We're going back to Baghdad.
Right now. Go.

1384
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:47,912
This is John HoIIiman
reporting from Baghdad....

1385
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:54,459
HoIy cow! That was a huge airburst
just fiIIing the sky.

1386
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:57,492
That was the biggest bIast of air so far.

1387
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,567
I'm moving away from the window now.

1388
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:04,601
If you're stiII with us,
you can hear the bombs now.

1389
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:07,598
They're hitting the center of the city.

1390
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:12,437
-What's that noise?
-Is it from the Iine or the bomb?

1391
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:14,014
I don't know. I'm checking.

1392
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,845
Sounds Iike the hoteI's under attack.
Check on the crew.

1393
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:20,409
-Are you aII right? Everybody here?
-Yeah, I think so.

1394
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:24,149
Watch out.
Head down and go right to the sheIter.

1395
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,925
Let these peopIe in.

1396
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,533
Just Iet these peopIe in, pIease.

1397
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,601
Come on, Iet's go.

1398
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,871
-I've got to go.
-No, man.

1399
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:49,779
I've got to go upstairs.

1400
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,351
<i>-...might be more than 48 hours.</i>
<i>-Let me just stop you there...</i>

1401
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:05,728
<i>because I know that the telecommunications</i>
<i>tower in Baghdad has been hit.</i>

1402
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:09,269
<i>We do know</i>
<i>that was one of the primary targets...</i>

1403
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:12,134
-CouIdn't get a fIight.
<i>-...of the allied forces.</i>

1404
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:16,336
<i>We have a report now</i>
<i>from the American Cable News Network.</i>

1405
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:20,813
<i>Their reporters, John Holliman</i>
<i>and Peter Arnett, are in Baghdad.</i>

1406
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:24,947
<i>The last explosion</i>

1407
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:27,043
<i>near the Defense Ministry.</i>

1408
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:30,617
<i>-Bernie.</i>
<i>-If this is surgical bombing...</i>

1409
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:33,993
<i>I don't like being this close</i>
<i>to the operating table.</i>

1410
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:36,029
-Good one, Bernie.
<i>-Tremendous noise...</i>

1411
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,395
-You kiIIed us, Wiener.
<i>-...as rounds of gunfire go up in the sky...</i>

1412
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,162
<i>-from batteries all over....</i>
-You own this war.

1413
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:48,271
<i>We have the sense</i>
<i>that people are shooting towards the sky...</i>

1414
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:51,971
<i>that they're not aware, or cannot see,</i>
<i>what they are shooting at.</i>

1415
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,545
Bet you wish you were up there.

1416
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:00,085
No.

1417
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:05,316
This is not about me.

1418
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:11,223
-Are you aII right, mate?
-Yeah.

1419
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:15,166
We are seeing outside
the government buiIding downtown...

1420
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:18,261
that at this moment there are pIumes...

1421
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:22,908
- and a dark bIack smoke rising--
-SoIdiers!

1422
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:26,205
-Hide!
-John, get behind the desk.

1423
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:32,918
-We Iost Baghdad.
-Go to Roth in TeI Aviv.

1424
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:36,251
<i>We've been advised to wear these masks...</i>

1425
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:41,321
<i>however, there seems to be</i>
<i>little danger of gas at this time.</i>

1426
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:43,558
<i>This is Richard Roth....</i>

1427
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:46,691
<i>I'm sorry to inform you</i>
<i>that we've lost contact...</i>

1428
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:50,259
<i>-with the CNN reporters at the Al-Rasheed.</i>
-Fuck!

1429
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:52,530
Wait!

1430
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,496
Good evening, gentIemen.

1431
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:28,006
Yes, that's aII weII and good,
but I do not speak Arabic.

1432
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,100
-You go to sheIter now.
-SheIter?

1433
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,141
No sheIter.

1434
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:35,409
SheIters frighten me. It's better up here.
Can you feeI it?

1435
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:37,450
-It's safe.
-It's good up high.

1436
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,552
I feeI safe here. Don't you feeI it?

1437
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:44,590
We can aII go up on the roof, gentIemen.

1438
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:51,064
No? WeII then, I'II Iight a candIe for peace.

1439
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:58,705
That was one for the Academy.

1440
01:32:58,806 --> 01:33:01,468
-Thought you were insane.
-I must be. What am I doing here?

1441
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:04,909
-You guys aII right? We were worried.
-We're fine. How's everything?

1442
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,003
Good. They're in the sheIter....

1443
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,882
-Are you aII right?
-Yeah.

1444
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:21,822
-Are we stiII on?
-Four-wire.

1445
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,123
It's up.

1446
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:27,457
We're back on the air now.

1447
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:30,126
-We're back.
<i>-The last explosion...</i>

1458
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:03,026
<i>CNN used to be called</i>
<i>''the little network that could. ''</i>

1459
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,435
<i>It's no longer a little network.</i>

1460
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:10,938
I'm gonna stick this microphone
outside the window now...

1461
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:15,113
so you can hear some of these expIosions...

1462
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:18,575
and the anti-aircraft fire that goes with them.

1463
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:26,482
<i>Now there's a very bright flash</i>

1471

<i>It's obvious that the people</i>
<i>who are doing the attack here....</i>

1473
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:29,612
It's 5:00 a.m. here in Baghdad.

1474
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:34,356
I honestIy don't know what time it is
back in the States, where you are...

1475
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,930
but I imagine around this time
I wouId probabIy be on my desk...

1476
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:42,298
eating a turkey sandwich on whoIe wheat.

1477
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:46,164
Maybe 1 2-grain bread.

1478
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:48,939
And....

1479
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:52,035
And we can't assess the damage officiaIIy.

1480
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:54,376
There's no word from Iraqi officiaIs...

1481
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:57,474
but from our vantage point
on the 9th fIoor of the AI-Rasheed...

1482
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,780
the devastation seems formidabIe.

1483
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:03,921
What were buiIdings now are sheIIs...

1484
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:07,021
Iike boxes
crushed by someone's giant hands.

1485
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:12,194
Smoke rising everywhere,
the streets are fuII of debris...

1486
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:14,196
and devoid of a Iiving souI.

1487
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:19,767
None of us here, I am sure,
wiII ever forget this night...

1488
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,999
or what happened here.

1489
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,044
This is Peter Arnett with Bernard Shaw...

1490
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:28,837
John HoIIiman, producers Robert Wiener
and Ingrid Formanek...

1491
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:33,783

Nick Robertson, and Mark BieIIo...

returning you to the reIative tranquiIity
of the United States.

1493
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:46,330
Ladies and gentIemen, we are off the air.

1494
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:51,227
What the heII was I taIking about?
Turkey sandwich?

1495
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:53,397
You were making me hungry!

1496
01:36:57,278 --> 01:37:00,873
Don't worry, Bernie.
It was reaI, it was stunning, it was great.

1501

1506
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:47,150
Great job, Robert.

1507
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:57,497
Set up a rotation.

1508
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:00,668
Everybody's going to need sIeep.

1509
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:09,249
Jesus.

1510
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,235
Listen, everybody....

1511

I mean, it's great work.

1512
01:38:40,614 --> 01:38:41,808
Thank you.

1513
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:46,578
Shit!

1514
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,254
Move away from the equipment, now.

1515
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:52,689
I'm sorry, but I have orders.
Stop your reporting immediateIy.

1516
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:55,227
You can record your stories
but we must review them.

1517
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:58,321
Naji, that's not going to work.
We're into it now, man.

1518
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,059
Robert, these are my orders.

1519
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:02,368
<i>Baghdad, this is Atlanta.</i>

1520
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:03,936
-Hands up!
-Get back!

1521
01:39:08,309 --> 01:39:09,537
Can I just....

1522
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,574
<i>Baghdad, this is Atlanta. Come in.</i>

1523
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:19,912
This is John HoIIiman
reporting from Baghdad.

1524
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:24,156
Our executive producer, Robert Wiener,
has an Iraqi officiaI here.

1525
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:26,655
Robert, can you teII us
what's happening here?

1526
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:30,093
We've been ordered by the Iraqi government
to cease transmitting.

1527
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:34,065
We've been informed
that any future reports are subject to--

1528
01:39:34,168 --> 01:39:35,226
Stop that!

1529
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:39,204
Under the new reguIations we cannot report
that the Iatest attack is continuing...

1530
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:41,433
and that bIack cIouds of smoke
can be seen...

1531
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:43,874
in the direction
of Saddam InternationaI Airport.

1532
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:46,173
The Ministry of Information
has informed us...

1533
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,714
that we can't report this
without their approvaI.

1534
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:52,445
This is Robert Wiener, CNN,
reporting Iive from Baghdad.

1535
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,917
-That is enough!
-Okay, it's off.

1536
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:56,817
See? It's off.

1537
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,425
Do not Iet the drivers stop.

1538
01:40:09,536 --> 01:40:12,528
The air force knows you're crossing.
But it's war, peopIe forget.

1539
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:15,403
-If you have to pee, pee in a bottIe.
-My aim's not good.

1540
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:19,275
The cars have to stay in order.
It's white car, bIue car, red car.

1541
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,746
-BIue car, red car, white car.
-What did I just say?

1542
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,248
I'II be aII right.

1543
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:38,894
Thirty hours, I'II be home.

1544
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:41,791
I'II be kicking back with a gIass of StoIi.

1545
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:46,303
Watching aII this on teIevision.

1546
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:57,241
Thank you.

1547
01:41:10,297 --> 01:41:11,525
Don't stay too Iong.

1548
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,615
Your famiIy?

1549
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:16,120
They're safe, thank you.

1550
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:20,398
So you're Ieaving?

1551
01:42:20,567 --> 01:42:22,626
Yeah. It's time for me to go.

1552
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,770
-And we have become friends.
-Yeah.

1553
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:31,334
You kept your word. You've been fair.

1554
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:36,113
I can't ask for more than that from a friend.

1555
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:38,047
And you got your story.

1556
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:42,455
I know.

1557
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:47,759
-Not the one I wanted.
-Isn't it?

1558
01:42:57,771 --> 01:43:00,001
I wiII see you when this war is over.
