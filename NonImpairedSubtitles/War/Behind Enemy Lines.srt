1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:06,887
I'm John Davis. I'm the producer
of Behind Enemy Lines.

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:10,125
JOHN DAVIS: With me is Wyck Godfrey.
WYCK GODFREY: Hey.

3
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,487
JD:
Wyck is the executive producer.

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,043
We'll do the commentary
from the producer's view.

5
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:20,885
Both of us worked on this film for
years. It's been about six years now.

6
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,693
The movie started with an idea. . .

7
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:27,846
. . .when Scott O'Grady
was shot down over Bosnia.

8
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:33,690
The idea was we could make a movie
that dealt with an American pilot. . .

9
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:36,128
. . .who's down behind enemy lines. . .

10
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:41,492
. . .where there were terrific obstacles
in being able to bring him out.

11
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,851
This pilot had to survive
on his wit and cunning. . .

12
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,891
. . .and just sheer determination
to survive.

13
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:54,048
We could make a movie that would be
exciting, that would bring to bear. . .

14
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:59,646
. . .all the technology the Navy and the
Air Force would make at our disposal.

15
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:05,052
If we could get a director who could
bring visualization and reality. . .

16
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:09,451
. . .maybe we could do something
that was exciting and different.

17
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:17,082
WG: It was John Moore and Zak Penn's
idea to open with a beautiful image. . .

18
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:22,248
. . .of soldiers planting trees. They
later become the mystery of the movie.

19
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:27,891
JD: We wanted a director who'd bring
a freshness. We went after John Moore.

20
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:32,684
He'd directed commercials
and music videos in Europe. . .

21
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:35,891
. . .where directing commercials
is an art form.

22
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:41,685
John, when he came on board, had
this vision, this fresh perspective.

23
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:47,485
I think John knows every kind
of military aircraft weapon.

24
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:52,648
Doesn't he know how to use hand
grenades, land mines and all that?

25
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:55,890
WG:
I think he's had some experience.

26
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,931
Here's the carrier,
the USS Carl Vinson.

27
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:05,288
We had Navy cooperation, which was one
of the big struggles of this film. . .

28
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:10,442
. . .because one of the things
John Moore, and we, wanted. . .

29
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:15,084
. . .was to shoot this action
in a way that no one had seen before.

30
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,689
So we went out at sea for a week.

31
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:22,329
While they were doing
their carrier qualifications. . .

32
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:27,846
. . .we would basically jump up on deck
when they weren't landing planes. . .

33
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:32,490
. . .get a scene and jump back down.
You can see a bit of it here.

34
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:38,882
JD: John said shooting on a carrier
is like living in a tin drum. . .

35
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:44,332
. . .with someone pounding on it
all day. Something's always going on.

36
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:49,732
Planes landing, taking off. We were
fortunate they allowed us on board.

37
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:55,291
September 1 1 th occurred a few months
after we finished shooting that.

38
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,882
We would've never been allowed on.

39
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:02,843
The access we had was amazing, and
probably won't be allowed for years. . .

40
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:06,932
. . .given the high state of military
alert that we're all on now.

41
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,607
BURNETT:
Four more days.

42
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:13,528
JD: It was a very long process
negotiating with the Navy.

43
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,850
We were fortunate
to befriend some pilots.

44
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:20,085
At one point, the project had stalled.

45
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,484
One of the pilots, Captain Kennedy,
came to me.

46
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,691
He was getting ready to retire
from the Navy.

47
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:31,484
He said, "This movie has to be made.
I'll help you with the process.

48
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:36,443
I'll help you with the carrier
and with the Department of Defense.

49
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:40,089
Get interested again in this project.
Get it moving. "

50
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,485
That was a key point. After that,
he introduced us to pilots. . .

51
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:49,887
. . .and we were able to get this sense
that the movie is really based on:

52
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:55,161
These are ordinary men, not Top Gun
pilots. They don't ride motorcycles.

53
00:03:55,373 --> 00:04:00,493
They have families. They're the kids
next door who always wanted to fly.

54
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,282
They're ordinary men
who can do extraordinary things.

55
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:07,252
That's what Owen Wilson is
in this movie.

56
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:10,485
He's the navigator.
That was Owen's idea.

57
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,722
He was the pilot.

58
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:14,691
-He made the change in the script.
WG: Right.

59
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:20,849
JD: He basically helped us play up
that idea of an ordinary individual.

60
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:25,848
He certainly is everyman,
and he was casted for that reason.

61
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:29,489
The idea was to make this real
and go against type.

62
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:33,487
Make Owen feel like the pilots
we had met.

63
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:38,648
We had to negotiate with the
Department of Defense over the script.

64
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,848
They like accuracy and
they're sensitive about things.

65
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:48,652
Intense negotiations. We didn't want
to compromise the film's integrity. . .

66
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:54,968
. . .but we needed access to
the helicopters, the aircraft carrier.

67
00:04:55,533 --> 00:05:00,084
We were able to find
a middle ground on some issues. . .

68
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,850
. . .and then, boom,
we were off and running.

69
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:10,290
WG: You'd think they wouldn't want to
show guys play football on the deck. . .

70
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:15,288
. . .but it came while we were shooting,
we decided to open the movie. . .

71
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,487
. . .with something
more fitting with Owen. . .

72
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,250
. . .and the character.
It was a bit more light.

73
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:26,645
We originally had a big
action sequence in the air. . .

74
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:32,962
. . .but it didn't fit the idea of them
in the Adriatic with nothing to do. . .

75
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,689
. . .and this really pulled it off.

76
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:40,489
JD: We want to thank the NFL for
supplying that football that we lost.

77
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,043
WG: We only knocked about 1 8
of them into the ocean.

78
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:52,166
JD: Gene Hackman was the first actor
hired on the film.

79
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:57,242
It was important to me--
I was doing Heartbreakers with Gene.

80
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:01,645
This is the sixth movie I've done with
him-- To get him involved.

81
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:06,489
The studio felt when Gene signed on
the part had weight and bearing.

82
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,042
WG:
He's a real anchor for movies.

83
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,853
JD: But John hadn't directed
a movie before.

84
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:15,449
I got Gene to accept
a first-time director.

85
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:18,292
I wanted to keep Gene
from meeting him.

86
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:24,130
I was afraid if Gene met him and
didn't like him, I'd be in trouble.

87
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:30,090
With first-time directors and actors,
you've got to be fairly clever.

88
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:35,128
Gene asked me, "When will I meet
this director?" I kept saying, "Soon. "

89
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:39,242
He went to do another film.
By the time he came back. . .

90
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:44,652
. . .it was time to go to Europe
and shoot the movie, so we were safe.

91
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:51,042
WG: I guess Gene met John in Slovakia
the day before he started shooting.

92
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:57,048
-I know that's not Burnett.
BURNETT: Captain, good to see you.

93
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:59,892
JD:
Gene Hackman green-lit this movie.

94
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,411
This movie was done for a price.
This is a $40 million movie.

95
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:09,846
Which, in action movie parlance,
is a low-budget movie.

96
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:14,092
Gene only worked
on the movie five weeks. . .

97
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,882
. . .but it feels like
he's on the movie the entire time.

98
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:22,649
Getting him on board for that period
of time so we could afford him. . .

99
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:27,881
. . .and using him the way we did in
this film, gave the studio a sense. . .

100
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:32,365
. . .that no matter who else
we brought in, it was anchored.

101
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:37,733
Gene has a foreign audience and
he'll turn in a brilliant performance.

102
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,528
His performance fit
what we're trying to accomplish. . .

103
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:47,167
. . .which was a real movie,
21 st century war action picture.

104
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,682
WG: The next step was to find out
who that guy would be.

105
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:57,883
As you can see, Owen was who we went
with. Gene thought it was a good idea.

106
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,045
We felt Owen wasn't a movie star yet.

107
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,681
We felt like we could break him. . .

108
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:08,085
. . .Iike Bruce Willis had never done
an action film before Die Hard...

109
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,485
. . .and Keanu Reeves had never done
an action film before Speed.

110
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:17,488
Owen really pulled off something
that I think people--

111
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:21,851
People were surprised to see him
in a movie like this.

112
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,443
His sort of irreverent tone
in the beginning. . .

113
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:28,531
. . .is what people bring
from his other films.

114
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:31,161
Then he transforms through this film.

115
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:36,049
-You'll see him doing more action.
JD: I saw him in the Tom Dey picture.

116
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,689
Wyck, can you help me on the name
of that picture?

117
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:44,085
Shanghai Noon. I saw him
in Shanghai Noon. That convinced me.

118
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,689
His charisma in that,
he played an action role. . .

119
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:51,846
. . .it was comedy and action.
His charisma there convinced me. . .

120
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:56,843
. . .that he could pull this off. Gene
saw that movie and was supportive.

121
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:02,252
We went to the studio as a
united front and said, "We want Owen.

122
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:06,685
He can do it. We could interest him
in doing the role. "

123
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:11,245
Tom Rothman, to his credit,
understood it and went with it.

124
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:16,971
It wasn't an obvious choice,
but it's what makes the movie work.

125
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:21,163
-Sir, about the football--
REIGART: I have your letter--

126
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:25,764
JD: You make an action movie,
the foreign component is important.

127
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:31,246
Action movies do really well foreign.
They can do well in Germany and Japan.

128
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:35,846
You can do more business foreign
than domestically.

129
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:40,683
So having the right action movie
and the right cast is important.

130
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:45,165
Gene will help us foreign.
Owen will help us foreign also.

131
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:49,082
The most important thing
that will help us in Europe--

132
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:54,248
This conflict took place on European
soil. There's relevancy there.

133
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,691
For Japan, the special effects
and action will prove exciting. . .

134
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,892
. . .in the way they like
to see their high-tech action films.

135
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:07,046
WG: This is the one main scene
Owen and Gene are in together.

136
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:12,048
When we started shooting with Owen,
he has a tendency to show up. . .

137
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:18,289
. . .and look at the scene and say,
"I wouldn't say this, I'd say this. "

138
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,685
Since he's a good writer
and may get. . .

139
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:26,482
. . .an Academy Award nomination
for Tenenbaums--

140
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,487
But the night before he shot this,
he was a bit nervous.

141
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,845
I said to him, "Owen, you can't
rewrite this scene tomorrow.

142
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:39,888
You have to memorize it. Gene will
kill us if we try to change it. "

143
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,887
And he showed up and knew his lines.

144
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:49,253
JD: Gene never once got mad at anybody
on this movie, which is great.

145
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,284
He got mad at John once.

146
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:56,084
WG: He got mad at us once when we
shifted around some lines in a scene.

147
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:02,488
Gene works very hard to get his scenes
down days before he shoots them.

148
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:08,490
So, in all fairness, you don't want
to show up the same day and say:

149
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,087
"We thought about doing it this way. "

150
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,443
He put a stop to that early on.

151
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:19,171
JD: Gene's a professional. He shows up
two, three minutes before you shoot.

152
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,564
He doesn't chat with anybody.
He does his scene. . .

153
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:27,889
. . .then leaves the set right after
and goes back to his trailer.

154
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:32,888
He's all about business,
but every single take is great.

155
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:44,091
The toughest thing about being
a producer on location far away. . .

156
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,690
. . .is having to be away from your
family. Wyck's wife was pregnant. . .

157
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,088
. . .had two children just before. . .

158
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,292
. . .and needed to be on the ground
for the entire period.

159
00:11:55,653 --> 00:12:01,205
Our company was shooting three movies,
so we were all moving around.

160
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,689
Wyck was on location.
I came to visit. . .

161
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:11,327
. . .and was overwhelmed by the fact we
were shooting in a Third World country.

162
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:17,046
The technology and support systems
were very rudimentary.

163
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:21,047
It was inexpensive to shoot
where we were shooting.

164
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,409
The construction costs
were very cheap. . .

165
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:29,003
. . .but you were shooting
in a Third World country.

166
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,643
WG:
We shot the film in Slovakia.

167
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:38,048
Which is Czechoslovakia split in two:
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. . .

168
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:43,247
. . .which is primarily the sort of
farming part of that country.

169
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,885
It was pretty brutal. Tough situation.

170
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,011
Between that and shooting
on a carrier. . .

171
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:55,446
. . .it was the hardest physical
production I've ever been involved in.

172
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:59,447
JD: Wyck had a tough time on the
aircraft carrier getting room service.

173
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,762
[MAN GIGGLES]

174
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,493
-Dad, I gotta go.
-We're very proud--

175
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:10,205
WG: The only thing that allows you to
sleep is because you're so exhausted.

176
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:14,645
They're landing aircraft on your head
until 2:00 a.m. . .

177
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:17,413
. . .and start again at 6:00 a.m.

178
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:22,084
So you don't get much sleep.
Somehow, by the third or fourth day. . .

179
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,688
. . .you can sleep through anything.

180
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,289
The problem is that you're
working around their plan.

181
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:33,891
They have a number of planes to get
down and up to get their qualifications.

182
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,845
You're given three hours.

183
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:40,683
If you're not off the deck,
you'll have a plane land on your head.

184
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,050
For a movie that you need
a lot of control in. . .

185
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:50,647
. . .to get these scenes,
it was amazingly difficult.

186
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:55,489
JD: The scene coming up, which is
going to be the shoot-down sequence. . .

187
00:13:55,733 --> 00:14:00,443
. . .created more anxiety for us
than any other aspect of the movie.

188
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:03,685
Again, we did this movie
for a price. . .

189
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:08,245
. . .so we had to be clever with how
to shoot the shoot-down scene.

190
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:15,082
Our access to models technology and
other computer effects was limited.

191
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:21,807
So to put this together and make it
look real was the ultimate challenge.

192
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:25,922
WG: We wanted to shoot
as much as possible, real.

193
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:32,049
There was a point where they wanted us
to do this entire sequence CGl.

194
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:38,249
It was controllable. But we wanted
as much real F-1 8 footage as possible.

195
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:44,204
So we shot this in California,
air-to-air. We shot from the ground. . .

196
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:49,845
. . .which is this shot. Up in the air.
Then we had to put in the missiles.

197
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:53,568
There's nothing better
than seeing those real jets.

198
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:59,846
JD: You have three technologies here:
live-action, air-to-air photography. . .

199
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:04,848
. . .computer-generated effects,
and you're going to have models.

200
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:11,123
I've come to believe that models
are very tough to make look real.

201
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:16,885
The models are my least favorite.
The computer-generated missiles. . .

202
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:21,968
. . .after months and months of
finessing them, playing with them. . .

203
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:25,611
. . .and working on them, fairly good.

204
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:31,649
I guess we all feel this sequence
fulfilled our expectations 900/0 .

205
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,769
We were frustrated. . .

206
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,971
. . .we couldn't go the last 1 00/0 .

207
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,852
The models technology
given to complete this. . .

208
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,851
. . .was just so difficult. . .

209
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:47,087
. . .to bring that level of reality we
wanted. There were some compromises.

210
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,289
You probably won't notice. . .

211
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:54,926
. . .but every time we see a shot we're
not happy with, it sticks in our side.

212
00:15:55,533 --> 00:16:00,049
WG: Some of these were shot on a stage
with a gimbal and a mockup F-1 8. . .

213
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:03,689
. . .and you mapped in the background.

214
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:12,246
Another useless joyride
at the cost of--

215
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:16,566
JD:
A producer has to always. . .

216
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:21,443
. . .do what's possible in a situation.
A producer is always compromising.

217
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:26,084
The idea is not to compromise
the quality of the film.

218
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,292
The studio will force you
to compromise on the budget.

219
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:36,130
The director has to compromise on his
vision because you can't afford it.

220
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:39,683
But you've got to keep him
from being discouraged.

221
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:44,290
The actors have to compromise
on what they want to say and do.

222
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:47,849
They're part of a process.
It has to work together.

223
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:51,602
The producer is the person
in the middle. . .

224
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:55,448
. . .trying to keep everybody on course
and moving forward.

225
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:00,365
Keeping people from being discouraged
when making a compromise. . .

226
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,843
. . .that is in the best interest
of the film.

227
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:08,366
And/or keeping the film
from getting shut down by the studio.

228
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:13,170
If you don't make your budget,
the studio can start cutting pages.

229
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:18,363
Nobody wants to do that. Sometimes,
before you get your movie made. . .

230
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:22,572
. . .the studio is gonna force you
to agree to your budget.

231
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:27,682
They'll have the power to keep you
from varying from that budget.

232
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:34,042
So it's very difficult being
a producer on a movie such as this.

233
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:40,647
You want to achieve so much, yet there
are tradeoffs that have to happen.

234
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:50,689
WG: One thing we did on the ground
because John Moore wants everything. . .

235
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:54,603
. . .and in particular,
all of the hardware you see.

236
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:58,089
The tanks, and the guns, and the--

237
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:03,043
All of that stuff was constantly
trying to be squeezed down. . .

238
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,847
. . .by the studio
for budgetary reasons.

239
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:09,887
"You can't have five tanks, just two. "
We were squeezing. . .

240
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:13,842
. . .and finding a way to get him
as much as he needed. . .

241
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,970
. . .to fill out the scenes.

242
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:21,929
JD: lsn't that you flying the plane?
WG: Oh, yeah.

243
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:26,282
Here's the introduction. . .

244
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,402
. . .of our sniper assassin,
played by Vladimir Mashkov.

245
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:34,690
He's a huge Russian actor
and directs theater.

246
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:37,123
He's one of their big stars. . .

247
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:42,453
. . .and he really carries a great,
quiet sense of menace.

248
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:48,044
JD:
These missiles are all CGl.

249
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:51,843
It stands for
computer-generated imagery.

250
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:56,891
STACKHOUSE: I don't. Call my turn.
BURNETT: Just slice left. Hard.

251
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:59,091
STACKHOUSE:
Jesus Christ.

252
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,170
Where is it?

253
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:06,888
JD: It's funny, the director wanted
to shoot the movie in Sarajevo.

254
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:11,251
WG: Our first compromise.
He wanted to shoot it in Croatia.

255
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,961
It was just a little bit too hairy.

256
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:18,729
But Slovakia, in terms of
the back country, is a good match.

257
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:22,448
Bratislava's not so bad
because at least it's a city.

258
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:27,847
But some of the places we shot were
30 miles from the Ukraine border. . .

259
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:31,045
. . .up in the mountains, and it was--

260
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:36,447
There were times we hopped in
four-wheel drives to get to a site.

261
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:39,123
It was as secluded as could be.

262
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,292
JD: But cell phones worked
throughout this entire country.

263
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:47,287
You could always get anybody
on the phone in the U.S.

264
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:50,923
One day I talked to John,
he was scouting locations.

265
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:55,769
I was trying to convince him not
to go to Sarajevo and get shot.

266
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:59,602
He tried to convince me
that Sarajevo was now safe.

267
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:02,247
It was something I didn't buy.

268
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:08,847
During our conversation, he says,
"I'm surrounded by armed guards.

269
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:14,292
I'm at a border. They want me to get
out of the car. I'll call you back. "

270
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:18,645
I had visions that our director was
gonna be arrested as a spy.

271
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,890
Fortunately, he was able
to call me back later. . .

272
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:26,684
. . .and get himself out
of whatever jam he was in.

273
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,772
WG:
Here's the model shots.

274
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:33,285
JD: These are the model shots
which I was particularly unhappy with.

275
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,489
But I think that. . .

276
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:40,648
. . .they came out fairly well
after we were able to massage them.

277
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:45,210
There's a lot of color correction
to try to make them look real.

278
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:51,045
There was some fog we put into the
shots to make it feel more natural.

279
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:56,291
WG: It's one of the most positively
reviewed sequences in the movie.

280
00:20:56,493 --> 00:21:02,204
So all the stuff you obsess about
doesn't matter to everyone.

281
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,292
JD:
lf you don't obsess. . .

282
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:08,811
. . .it's never going to be as good
as it should be or can be.

283
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:13,046
Even if you don't get everything
you want, if you obsess. . .

284
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:17,968
. . .convinced it'll be a disaster,
somehow you get it good enough.

285
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,606
And hopefully great.

286
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:23,322
Shit!

287
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,486
JD:
The movie's editing is interesting.

288
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:34,089
Basically, the director gets 1 0 weeks
after shooting.

289
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:39,208
Technically, you're not allowed
to interfere with him. John was great.

290
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:40,926
He brought us in.

291
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:46,207
When I was in Slovakia, I convinced
him on the set at a weak moment. . .

292
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:51,567
. . .to let me go in the editing room
and take a look.

293
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:55,686
Now, while he's shooting,
I'm looking at the movie.

294
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:58,532
I could tell the movie was working.

295
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:05,081
I was able to tell that the movie
had a fantastic look.

296
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:09,684
The cinematography was working well
with his camera technology. . .

297
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,208
. . .to tell a story.

298
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,449
The movie had this feel.

299
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:20,006
From there, John Moore showed us both
the film very early on. . .

300
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:25,124
. . .and we were able to discuss
with him choices he was making.

301
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:29,002
A first-time director,
he wanted everything in the movie.

302
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:33,485
As time went on, he realized
that he had a story to tell.

303
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,648
He learned that well
and picked it up quickly.

304
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:42,887
As a producer, you're constantly going
in the editing room. . .

305
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:47,291
. . .trying to impart into the director
a sense of objectivity. . .

306
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:52,481
. . .about how one might improve
the storytelling or improve the pace.

307
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:57,851
Wyck and I enjoyed our time
in the editing room with John.

308
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:01,326
It's a lot of fun being
in the editing room.

309
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:05,608
It gives you a sense
of the making of the movie. . .

310
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:08,247
. . .in its little bits and pieces.

311
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:13,766
These little details very much
add up to the pace. . .

312
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:17,130
. . .and the quality of the storytelling
in the movie.

313
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:24,610
-A hell of a party, sir.
-I really like Christmas.

314
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:28,286
JD:
The editing room is not a democracy.

315
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:32,287
In a film, there's supposed
to be one vision.

316
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:37,607
A producer has got to support that.
The vision needs to be the director's.

317
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,451
If you have seven visions,
and they're all in a movie. . .

318
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:46,686
. . .it'll be chaos. The movie won't
be as good as it should.

319
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,852
It could be a disaster.

320
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,328
Editing is never a democracy. . .

321
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:56,288
. . .but if you have a good relationship
with your director. . .

322
00:23:56,533 --> 00:24:01,687
. . .the producer can have tremendous
impact on how the picture is cut.

323
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:08,889
WG: Part of the process is when
the studio gets involved.

324
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:14,651
We test the movie. They'll have a lot
of input and insight with fresh eyes.

325
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:21,247
Part of our job is to listen to those
ideas and figure out the best way. . .

326
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,850
. . .to put the ones that are important
and work for the movie in. . .

327
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,849
. . .while massaging the ones
that may not be additive.

328
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:36,845
JD: The studio and the audience
will be involved in the editing.

329
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:40,682
Because what we do is test
a movie with an audience.

330
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:44,642
When you do that,
you can hear and feel the audience.

331
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:48,249
You know when they're into it,
when they're bored. . .

332
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,651
. . .when something's working
that excites them emotionally.

333
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:55,890
And then, in the end,
we do a focus group.

334
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:59,409
But it's more important
to feel an audience.

335
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:05,045
A lot of times, you need to use that
input to further refine your movie.

336
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:10,652
Shit. Squeeze right here.

337
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:15,445
JD: When you first see a film
with an audience, you're terrified.

338
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:19,925
You have no idea--
The director's even more terrified.

339
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:26,567
If people are gonna like the film
or not like the film and not respond.

340
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:32,285
You don't know. You can have a sense.
You can hope. You can have a feeling.

341
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:37,368
I go into those screenings and we've
worked enough on the picture. . .

342
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:42,211
. . .so you like it. You've gotten it
into the shape where you. . .

343
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:44,489
. . .are somewhat happy with it.

344
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:49,721
WG: You've seen it so many times you
don't know how people will respond to it.

345
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:53,602
You've forgotten how you felt
the first time you saw it.

346
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:57,692
JD: That's a good point.
You've read the script 50 times. . .

347
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,642
. . .you've seen the picture five,
six, seven times before.

348
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:08,048
The audience is a fresh,
objective opinion on a picture.

349
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:12,007
WG: It takes you back
to when you green-light the film.

350
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:18,607
That was when you thought this would
be a commercial, satisfying movie.

351
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:25,088
It's a year and a half later, you're
finally seeing if you were right.

352
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,811
Oh, God.

353
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:33,446
JD: The screening process
always turns up something.

354
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,890
It always turns up some unexpected. . .

355
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:40,489
. . .piece of information that you need
to react to.

356
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:45,530
This picture tested very well
the first time we tested it.

357
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:49,288
But what became obvious
is we had too many endings.

358
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:54,448
We had three or four. The challenge
was, "How do we give it one ending. . .

359
00:26:54,693 --> 00:27:00,450
. . .but create enough closure with all
the story sub-elements and subplots. . .

360
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:04,652
. . .so the audience feels
sufficiently informed at the end?"

361
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:11,241
Frankly, I had a sense we had too
many endings, but I liked them all.

362
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:15,088
I wasn't sure that we had
to do something about it.

363
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,893
The audience was very clear
about that.

364
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:23,651
When the movie was over for them
emotionally, the movie was over.

365
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:29,843
Now this scene, Wyck, you want
to describe what it was like. . .

366
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:33,489
. . .getting those pieces
of aircraft on that mountain?

367
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:38,682
We showed up and the production
designer had, on this mountain. . .

368
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:42,130
. . .burned a whole swatch of land. . .

369
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:44,968
. . .and laid out the pieces
of the plane.

370
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:48,489
I said, "John, how come
the whole plane is laid out there?

371
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,803
Didn't they land separately?"

372
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:55,848
We hadn't even begun
to shoot the shoot-down sequence.

373
00:27:56,053 --> 00:28:00,251
We didn't do that sequence
until we got back to Los Angeles.

374
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:04,082
But you can't tell
that the entire plane's there.

375
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,245
We shot around it pretty well.

376
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:12,052
One of John's favorite shots.
It was 7 in the morning.

377
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,450
He loved the guys
coming over the mountain.

378
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:19,851
This was the most removed location
of the entire movie.

379
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:24,251
We were as high on a mountain
as you could get in Slovakia.

380
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:28,241
We were always in danger
of not making it to the site.

381
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:31,286
Rain would have washed out the roads.

382
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:34,809
It was a miracle we got out
of this location.

383
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,370
JD: The other problem was that
this movie was shot in the winter.

384
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:43,488
This particular scene was shot
in November, I believe.

385
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:48,284
The sun disappeared here
probably about 3:30 or 4:00.

386
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:52,972
So you had a very short day
to work with.

387
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,852
Given that we had a short schedule. . .

388
00:28:56,053 --> 00:29:00,285
. . .it's very important the director
knew exactly what he wanted. . .

389
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:02,927
. . .how to get it,
and to move quickly.

390
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:06,563
WG: We only had about 7 1 /2 hours
of daylight.

391
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:10,846
It was really difficult.

392
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:21,450
Casting the soldiers was pretty easy.
We went and got the Slovakian army.

393
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,082
We went to them and said:

394
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,688
"We need to use. . .

395
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:32,849
. . .your Russian-made armory, and
we need to use the tanks and stuff. "

396
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:38,081
All of our great extras are actually
the elite soldiers of Slovakia.

397
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:44,090
So they understand organization,
they understand discipline.

398
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,643
And in terms of using them,
it worked out great.

399
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:53,450
You'd say, "We need you here. " They'd
be there. You can't fake the training.

400
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:58,847
When they come through Hach later,
you'll see how professional they are.

401
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:00,691
They're the real deal.

402
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:07,281
One thing about Slovakia, rather
than Canada, which we thought about. . .

403
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:12,653
. . .is that all of our extras
truly have that Eastern European look.

404
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,731
The Muslims are all Muslims.

405
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:20,484
A lot of our extras or smaller cast. . .

406
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,645
. . .were Croatian, from that territory.

407
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:27,050
There was a sense
of realism to the casting.

408
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:32,925
JD: And these elite soldiers swore
their allegiance to the director.

409
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,646
When the studio tried. . .

410
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:38,289
. . .to enforce a shorter schedule,
they were there. . .

411
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:41,969
. . .to hold them at bay,
and that was helpful.

412
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:52,083
WG: Again, that was probably
one of the easiest things.

413
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:58,488
The government of Slovakia fought very
hard to get us to come to Slovakia.

414
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:04,683
There's so much filming in the Czech
Republic, Slovakia gets the leftovers.

415
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:09,688
So when you go and make a deal
with Slovakia to use. . .

416
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:12,048
. . .their stages in Bratislava. . .

417
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:15,805
. . .for a military film,
you've got a good line. . .

418
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:20,524
. . .to get the government to put
pressure on the military to help.

419
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:26,012
JD: I still remember my first day
in Slovakia, driving to the set.

420
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:31,845
We were at a studio,
and there were soldiers in the street.

421
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:35,807
This is not near the studio,
this is in Bratislava.

422
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:40,524
They were stopping people and
they were searching their cars. . .

423
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:44,046
. . .and checking their l.D.s.
I was thinking:

424
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:49,409
"Boy, this certainly feels like
a different place to shoot a movie. "

425
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,492
WG: The scene where Owen is running
and escaping earlier. . .

426
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:58,446
. . .he was doing his own stunts.

427
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:03,209
We had mortars exploding around him
and one blew up in his face.

428
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:06,883
He looked up after it was over and. . .

429
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:10,843
. . .was very calm about it:
"Okay, let's do it again. "

430
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:12,526
From that, we knew. . .

431
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:17,893
. . .we wouldn't have trouble getting
Owen to do any difficult stunt work.

432
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:22,684
JD: It's nice not having a prima donna
in a movie like this.

433
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:28,243
It'll be hard work and you'll have
to get in there and do your takes.

434
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:33,368
Be in crappy weather, and in different
locations. Really bust your ass.

435
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:37,687
Owen was able and willing
to do that.

436
00:32:37,853 --> 00:32:43,849
WG: Here was the first thing we shot.
The first day was up on this mountain.

437
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:47,409
Again, a very difficult location
to get to.

438
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:50,849
-What is that?
-Sorry, sir. There's interference.

439
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,805
The homing beacon.

440
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,651
Well, shut it off.

441
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:59,688
WG: Between Stephanie Austin,
our line producer, and l. . .

442
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:03,249
. . .you're dealing with every crisis
of the day.

443
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:07,850
The day before you shoot,
one helicopter is stuck at the border.

444
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:13,451
The gyroscope on your picture
helicopter is stuck in Venice. . .

445
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:18,090
. . .you can't get it out. Everything
has to be handled days before.

446
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:23,248
You know shooting in these locations,
there's gonna be a problem.

447
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:28,283
You kind of have to have the solutions
lined up. John Moore's. . .

448
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:33,482
. . .very good when he knows what
to expect, but doesn't like surprises.

449
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:36,486
I don't think any directors
like surprises.

450
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:41,206
Your best thing is to be ahead
of him as much as possible.

451
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:46,885
JD: This whole set Gene is on now,
the interior of the carrier. . .

452
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,044
. . .was all built in Slovakia.

453
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,889
It was a massive set.
It took up three sound stages.

454
00:33:54,133 --> 00:34:00,049
You could walk from one end of the
ship to the other on these stages. . .

455
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:05,202
. . .and go from porthole to porthole
to corner to curve, and it really--

456
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:09,884
It really felt, once you were inside
this set, it was so elaborate. . .

457
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,044
. . .that you were on a carrier.

458
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:16,166
When I was on the real carrier,
I was surprised how well. . .

459
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,086
. . .we were able to capture that feel.

460
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:24,885
WG: The designer and art director,
Nathan Crowley and Patrick Lumb. . .

461
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:30,685
. . .took tours of carriers before the
film had officially been green-lit. . .

462
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:35,648
. . .and took pictures and got the
layout. So when we got to Slovakia. . .

463
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:40,841
. . .we could duplicate it and enhance
it visually where we needed to.

464
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:46,008
The job they did is one of the things
that's phenomenal about the movie.

465
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:50,451
It has a great look
and a great sense of place.

466
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:55,490
The contrast between what's going on
on the ship and outdoors. . .

467
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:59,089
. . .it's one of the things people
really respond to.

468
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:04,646
It's so beautiful outdoors and you cut
to the ship and it's claustrophobic.

469
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:11,128
It's like, "We can't do anything to
get our guy in this open space back. "

470
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,291
JD:
And the music here. . .

471
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:19,442
. . .was the creation of Don Davis,
our second composer.

472
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:23,562
When you work with a first-time crew--
We had a first-time director. . .

473
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:27,284
. . .who was brilliant,
a first-time DP. . .

474
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:33,250
. . .basically, a first-time production
designer and a first-time composer.

475
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:36,371
The first-time composer
didn't work out.

476
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:40,123
So we had to go back
and bring Don Davis in. . .

477
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,087
. . .who came in with not a great amount
of time left.

478
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:48,645
He had six weeks to write the score
and get it orchestrated. . .

479
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,646
. . .and for us to cut it
into the picture.

480
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:55,283
We felt fortunate that so many
first-time people. . .

481
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,491
. . .so many were able
to do what was needed.

482
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:03,007
The element that didn't work,
we were able to replace.

483
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:07,087
WG: This is a scene that keeps you
on your toes as a producer.

484
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:11,645
We were supposed to shoot this
down in the hangar. . .

485
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:17,450
. . .but Gene had just had enough. It was
so loud and such bad conditions. . .

486
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:23,484
. . .that he didn't want to run
a two-page dialogue scene down there.

487
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:27,845
While John was shooting another scene,
we were running around. . .

488
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:31,762
. . .Iooking for a place,
and we found the admiral's bridge.

489
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:35,608
You never see a scene shot
in a real admiral's bridge.

490
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:40,210
Earlier in the scene, a plane lands
and it makes you go:

491
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:44,127
"Wow, they're shooting this
on an aircraft carrier. "

492
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:49,572
It worked out. There wasn't a lot of
room to move around with the camera.

493
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:54,484
We didn't have a choice.
Otherwise we wouldn't have our scenes.

494
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:58,925
JD: There's a lot of guerrilla
filmmaking involved in this movie.

495
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,089
Our director was up to that. . .

496
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:06,687
. . .because he was used to conditions
like this and preferred them.

497
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:15,923
WG: You're lugging cameras off
the deck, you're running around. . .

498
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:19,404
. . .you know, scout locating and. . .

499
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:23,925
. . .you do whatever needs
to sort of get things done.

500
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:29,250
You lose weight from running
on stairs. The food's not so good.

501
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:32,007
JD:
There's no elevators on carriers.

502
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:38,004
Only big ones on the outside that
carry up helicopters and aircraft.

503
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:40,847
WG:
This was shot in lovely California.

504
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:45,803
JD: We wanted to add an extra
scene once the movie was shot.

505
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,528
Create another little action
opportunity scenario.

506
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:56,247
I was sitting out there without sun--
Without a hat, or any suntan lotion.

507
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:59,450
It was 1 02 degrees
the day we shot this.

508
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:01,763
I got very sunburned.

509
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:05,329
I was amazed that we were able. . .

510
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:10,328
. . .to make this look like
it was shot in Slovakia.

511
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:12,410
This is all July. . .

512
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:16,043
. . .outside of Los Angeles,
Angeles National Forest.

513
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:22,164
WG: When we looked at it, between
the first and second radio contact. . .

514
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,244
. . .nothing happened for Owen.

515
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:29,089
Something happened for Gene,
he was told he had to move his guy.

516
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:32,006
Owen just ran through the woods.
We felt. . .

517
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:36,247
. . .we had to add something,
to put more tension in his voice. . .

518
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:40,412
. . .when he got news they weren't
gonna pick him up.

519
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,563
Here we are back in Slovakia.

520
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:58,202
JD: Now Owen, again, just worked
in unbearable conditions. . .

521
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:02,645
. . .given that most actors
are in a controlled environment. . .

522
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:07,005
. . .and aren't asked to do things
that Owen's been asked to do.

523
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:10,211
He just did it. He was a trooper.

524
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:14,042
It was never too much to ask,
he was always there.

525
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:19,242
He was always dirty and working
in dirty outdoor conditions. . .

526
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:22,525
. . .and up to the task.
I think that it shows.

527
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:27,045
When an actor really wants
to play a role and wants. . .

528
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:31,411
. . .to be in the moment,
his performance is reflective of that.

529
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:33,609
This guy didn't phone it in.

530
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:38,324
This is a guy who really wanted
you to believe his character. . .

531
00:39:38,573 --> 00:39:43,522
. . .and what he went through.
He suffered to create that for us.

532
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,171
No.

533
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:49,012
Negative. Negative.

534
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:56,011
JD: An actor like Owen makes your job
easier, except he's a great writer. . .

535
00:39:56,213 --> 00:40:00,365
. . .and he's gonna want to rewrite
his part. And other actors. . .

536
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:05,203
. . .will have to adjust to what
he comes up with. It's a challenge. . .

537
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:10,123
. . .to get him to plan far enough
ahead of time that everybody knows. . .

538
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:16,130
. . .and the actors can have rehearsed
what they'll do in relation to Owen.

539
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:20,252
Somebody who's willing
to give his all makes it easier.

540
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:23,405
WG:
When Owen signed on to do the movie. . .

541
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:28,482
. . .the character was more gung ho.
The Tom Cruise in Top Gun character.

542
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:32,562
Owen signed on after speaking
with us and the director. . .

543
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:36,652
. . .with the idea that we would
alter the character to fit. . .

544
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:41,967
. . .what he represented and what was
a contemporary American pilot.

545
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:45,883
We'd done some of the work,
but when he showed up. . .

546
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:49,887
. . .we had a ways to go.
We were rewriting opening scenes. . .

547
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:54,485
. . .where he's talking about
wanting to go fly for rock stars. . .

548
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:58,481
. . .when he got there.
When he showed up it was tense.

549
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:01,486
He'd throw out suggestions
and new scenes.

550
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:05,572
Part of our job was to figure out
which ones we could do. . .

551
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:10,249
. . .and talk to the studio because
most of them were great ideas. . .

552
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:13,451
. . .but some of them
had larger implications.

553
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:19,131
Was Gene gonna read it and go,
"This wasn't what I signed on for"?

554
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,611
At the end of the day, we negotiated
everything with everyone.

555
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:29,524
It satisfied Owen and Gene.
That's where we got to where we were.

556
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:33,402
JD: Now Owen's makeup and hair
ended up being. . .

557
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:39,125
. . .a very important point
of contention with the studio.

558
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:42,046
The studio is interested
in his look. . .

559
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:46,690
. . .from his haircut and the look
of his injuries when he's running.

560
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:49,572
They want him handsome enough. . .

561
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:52,611
. . .that people are gonna
want to look at him.

562
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:56,527
We want it realistic
so people are gonna believe it.

563
00:41:56,733 --> 00:42:01,011
So we took Owen out
and did a hair and makeup test.

564
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:03,807
We cut his hair
and we all looked at it.

565
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:06,049
And it didn't look right.

566
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:10,571
We had to cut it again,
which pissed off Owen.

567
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:16,528
After we got the hair set,
we went through the makeup tests.

568
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:20,766
It was getting Owen on location
and doing the makeup. . .

569
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:24,562
. . .and getting the studio the film.
Then they had input.

570
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:27,964
The director and the producers
all had. . .

571
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:31,443
. . .their perspective
on what it should be.

572
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:38,087
One of the big negotiations was
getting his hair and look right.

573
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:44,522
The nose is Owen's. There was no
prosthetic makeup applied there.

574
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,890
WG: We had him bloody
the first day of shooting.

575
00:42:48,093 --> 00:42:49,845
The studio called, saying:

576
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:52,653
"We can't have him this bloodied up.

577
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:55,083
People aren't gonna want to watch.

578
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:59,047
You need to build
to a level of makeup. "

579
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:03,690
JD: That was a good point
on their part. Again, it's why. . .

580
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:07,488
. . .having a lot of perspective
on a film is helpful.

581
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:10,282
You just need one decision maker.

582
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:15,290
That's what the director should do
and what he did well here.

583
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:18,769
If people look at a film
from their perspective. . .

584
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:22,727
. . .people can have input
that's gonna be helpful.

585
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,412
Move.

586
00:43:24,973 --> 00:43:26,565
REIGART:
They're right on him!

587
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:32,646
WG: I can explain
the part in the SCIF.

588
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:34,923
When we showed up to shoot this. . .

589
00:43:35,173 --> 00:43:39,530
. . .the scene was about trying to
figure out which one was Burnett.

590
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:45,291
And Rodway, who plays our marine,
was the one who. . .

591
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:48,730
. . .figured out which one was Owen.

592
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:52,283
We arrived and started
the video playback. . .

593
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:54,927
. . .which is a rear-projection screen. . .

594
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,567
. . .the actors were there going:

595
00:43:57,773 --> 00:44:00,492
"What are we saying?
That's clearly him. "

596
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:05,403
The design didn't fit and that
was the first time we saw it.

597
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:08,081
The actors were right.

598
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:12,605
John and I said, "Give us 1 0 minutes. "
And we ran off. . .

599
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:16,010
. . .got the script and rewrote it
as you see it. . .

600
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:21,128
. . .such that it's about, "What happened
to him, why did he quit moving?"

601
00:44:21,813 --> 00:44:27,410
On the ground here
in the mass graves, we had--

602
00:44:27,613 --> 00:44:29,365
There was graphic stuff.

603
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:32,451
Obviously we wanted
to make the film PG-1 3. . .

604
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:37,329
. . .so we really had to look
at the way it came out.

605
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:43,210
In John's initial cut there was tons
of shots of dead bodies and babies.

606
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:46,086
It really sort of pounded home. . .

607
00:44:46,293 --> 00:44:50,002
. . .the gruesome nature of what
Burnett was going through.

608
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:56,607
We managed to pull that off without
having to show as much explicit stuff.

609
00:44:57,853 --> 00:45:02,847
Right here you still get the sense
they're in a bunch of dead bodies.

610
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:06,165
JD:
John Moore earned his name Moore.

611
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:10,442
That's what he always
wanted was more.

612
00:45:10,693 --> 00:45:13,526
WG: When we said,
"You can't do this," he goes:

613
00:45:13,773 --> 00:45:16,606
"The name's not John Less,
it's John Moore. "

614
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:20,806
JD:
This is one of those instances. . .

615
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:24,130
. . .where the studio
was probably right.

616
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:30,681
He could've made the scene so horrific
that it would have been tough. . .

617
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:35,330
. . .for American audiences not to get
thrown out and be overwhelmed.

618
00:45:35,493 --> 00:45:40,521
Yet he was able to create the horror
of what he wanted to do. . .

619
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,644
. . .without losing the scene.

620
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:47,011
It was a good compromise
on all parts here.

621
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,807
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

622
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:58,128
JD: The pilot who originally
got shot down in Bosnia. . .

623
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:02,685
. . .basically hid for three days.
And radioed in, got picked up. . .

624
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:05,527
. . .and never considered
himself a hero.

625
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:12,012
He did what he wanted to do, which
was survive. He was the first to say:

626
00:46:12,173 --> 00:46:14,926
"I was not heroic,
it was just survival. "

627
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:19,132
This is a lot more active character.

628
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:23,207
This is a person who is
using his ingenuity. . .

629
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:29,050
. . .to really move himself around,
who is being aggressively pursued.

630
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:34,367
I don't think Scott O'Grady, after
his first encounter over there. . .

631
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:38,003
. . .was actually pursued.
I think he was able to hide.

632
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,488
WG:
Anyone involved in Scott's story. . .

633
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:44,083
. . .would look at this
and say not much is familiar.

634
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:46,443
We weren't intending it to be.

635
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:48,883
When he got shot down--

636
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:54,605
There have been numerous people
shot down over the years.

637
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,412
It lends itself
to an interesting movie.

638
00:46:57,653 --> 00:47:02,932
JD: It did have an impact. We saw the
Discovery Channel piece on O'Grady.

639
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:06,245
I was most moved by
his family's reaction. . .

640
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:12,204
. . .not knowing if he was alive and
not knowing what would happen.

641
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:17,367
Having to sit through it with the rest
of the country-- It was very public.

642
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:22,165
And agonize over
what was gonna happen.

643
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:26,847
That really made us
want to bring the family into this.

644
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:31,325
The family was worked in
to create that perspective. . .

645
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:34,804
. . .because a lot of us
are fathers and wives. . .

646
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:41,009
. . .and could imagine having a son
trapped and the anguish we would feel.

647
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:43,010
--shot at, I believe him.

648
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:45,204
What do you expect me to do?

649
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:47,847
Command says I gotta sit on my hands.

650
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:53,690
WG: The political construct
is fictional, not from Scott's story.

651
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:58,409
The whole idea that Gene Hackman's
under the thumb of NATO. . .

652
00:47:58,653 --> 00:48:03,010
. . .and can't do anything
through most of the movie.

653
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:06,723
We're part of a coalition,
and then we have to--

654
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:11,404
We can't just march in.
We have to think of the big picture.

655
00:48:11,653 --> 00:48:17,250
That was something the writer created
and allowed us to get Gene Hackman. . .

656
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:20,803
. . .because he created this
character on the ship.

657
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:29,001
JD: This is an important negotiation
we had with the DOD, right here.

658
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:31,807
It was over whether Gene. . .

659
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:37,451
. . .is gonna pick up the phone
in the next couple of seconds or not.

660
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:42,403
The basis of that was
the Department of Defense felt. . .

661
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:48,643
. . .Iike Gene's character, if he picked
up the phone, would be insubordinate.

662
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:54,729
He would be using the press
in a manner that wasn't military.

663
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,252
It happens a lot.

664
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:59,803
WG: What's funny is, for the
regular audience member. . .

665
00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:05,406
. . .this is a heroic thing Gene does.
It's one thing people are cheering.

666
00:49:05,653 --> 00:49:07,245
He figured out a way. . .

667
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:11,930
. . .to propel the movie forward,
to propel his cause forward.

668
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:14,852
Look at it from
the military standpoint.

669
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:18,403
They think he's breaking
the chain of command.

670
00:49:18,613 --> 00:49:23,403
JD: So the negotiation resolved itself,
he looks at the card. . .

671
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:27,851
. . .and doesn't pick up the phone,
you cut to the reporter.

672
00:49:28,053 --> 00:49:30,613
AERNOUT: It's also unclear what,
if any impact--

673
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:33,443
WG:
This is Aernout Van Lynden. . .

674
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:38,607
. . .a famous European reporter
for Sky News.

675
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:41,202
John Moore grew up idolizing him. . .

676
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:46,049
. . .because he was in Lebanon and
these horrible situations reporting.

677
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:49,728
When we got to Slovakia, he said,
"I want Van Lynden. "

678
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:53,648
He called the guy and said,
"We've got a reporter. . .

679
00:49:53,893 --> 00:49:57,408
. . .I'd like you to play him. "
Aernout got down there.

680
00:49:57,613 --> 00:50:01,925
Unfortunately, he had to leave
about halfway through production. . .

681
00:50:02,093 --> 00:50:07,611
. . .because the fighting began in lsrael
and he went to cover it.

682
00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:24,206
JD: Originally we were gonna do
the entire movie in English.

683
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:31,572
The decision was made
to subtitle the Bosnian soldiers.

684
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:36,085
It created a problem because we
had to teach them the language.

685
00:50:36,293 --> 00:50:39,922
WG: We had cast the movie thinking
that they were. . .

686
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:43,244
. . .going to speak English
with phony accents.

687
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:45,927
And the studio said:

688
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:51,122
"You know what, for authenticity's
sake they should speak the language. "

689
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:57,010
The problem was the actors
we had cast didn't speak Croatian.

690
00:50:57,213 --> 00:51:00,011
We had--
We had to bring in translators. . .

691
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:04,411
. . .teach them the lines.
It was all very last-minute.

692
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:08,652
JD: And I was quite nervous
because I once did a movie. . .

693
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:12,363
. . .where we had to teach
Japanese actors English. . .

694
00:51:13,093 --> 00:51:18,804
. . .because the director felt everybody
should be speaking the same language.

695
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:23,450
And the Japanese who
learned English for the picture. . .

696
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,526
. . .could never get
that moment of connection right.

697
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:31,732
It was like a one- or two-second
disconnect delay. . .

698
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:35,203
. . .where they would deliver
their lines.

699
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:38,729
Which we couldn't render
in the editorial process.

700
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:42,608
We were quite nervous here,
but it worked out great.

701
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:44,724
WG:
There's precedents for both.

702
00:51:44,973 --> 00:51:48,363
Hunt for Red October and
Clear and Present Danger...

703
00:51:48,573 --> 00:51:52,248
. . .those movies figured out a way
for you to believe. . .

704
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:56,122
. . .the foreign-speaking characters
would speak English.

705
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,727
They filmically used devices.

706
00:51:59,013 --> 00:52:04,326
There are World War Il movies that
have the characters speaking German.

707
00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:05,762
It was a tossup.

708
00:52:05,973 --> 00:52:08,407
JD:
I hope Bosnian critics don't kill us.

709
00:52:08,613 --> 00:52:12,003
WG: For accent.
JD: Yeah, exactly.

710
00:52:12,693 --> 00:52:15,207
WG:
We're coming into the mine sequence. . .

711
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:18,450
. . .which was one
of the action sequences. . .

712
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:24,325
. . .where we thought we weren't gonna
be able to do for budgetary reasons.

713
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:31,170
At the last minute, we found a location
and a way to shoot it affordably.

714
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:35,127
It's some people's favorite
sequence in the movie.

JD:
It's one of my favorites.

716
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:42,447
I never imagined this sequence
this way when the script was written.

717
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:46,003
And the sequence we had
was pretty exciting.

718
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:48,807
But this is even more visual.

719
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:51,004
It was a great solution.

720
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:54,928
Constantly, when you don't
have enough resources. . .

are creative and better.

If you throw too much money
at a movie in a situation. . .

723
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:06,406
. . .the movie can really
not reach its potential.

724
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:10,492
A lot of times, when you
have to compromise and improvise. . .

00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:13,645
. . .you come up
with fabulous solutions.

726
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:18,927
WG: We actually did soil
and air samples from this location.

727
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:22,006
It was a Communist-era
industrial factory.

728
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:26,041
Nobody could tell us what
they were manufacturing. . .

729
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:28,363
. . .when we scouted the location.

730
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:31,645
We were thinking,
"We better check this out. "

731
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:33,212
JD:
I hope it's not anthrax.

WG: Fortunately, the air
and soil were fine.

734
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,289
JD:
That's a thing to worry about. . .

735
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:46,207
. . .when you go to
a formerly Soviet-occupied country.

You're going to factories and places
to work and bringing a crew.

737
00:53:51,653 --> 00:53:54,451
You've got to expect the unexpected. . .

[CHILD LAUGHS]

740
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:09,046
JD: When you're dealing with
a tight budget. . .

741
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:12,922
. . .and a first-time director,
you need time to plan.

742
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:15,363
The more time you have to plan. . .

743
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:19,048

of being able to deal. . .

. . .and a short shooting schedule.

746
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:30,484
We had no money on this movie
and very short days.

747
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:34,766
The director wanted a winter look
which helped the movie.

748
00:54:34,973 --> 00:54:38,568
That gave us very little sunlight
to deal with.

749

WG: Here's a Photo-Sonic shot.
This was the bullet buffeted.

750
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:47,846
But John used a Photo-Sonic camera.
You can see the shell go up midair.

751
00:54:48,093 --> 00:54:52,325
You can tell the gun was blown away.
It's an amazing shot.

752
00:54:52,493 --> 00:54:55,644
Very difficult to get in-camera.

753
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:59,090
JD: But with a first-time director,
a lot of times. . .

754

. . .they don't understand budget.

755
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:05,844
You can actually get them
to do more with less.

00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,284
Once they understand and
do their next pictures. . .

. . .they need money to do
what was inexpensive the first time.

758
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:19,331
John didn't know any better. He had
to create solutions and plan a lot.

759
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:22,929
We had a short schedule.
We were gonna have to move.

He's working with a first-time DP,
his DP, who gave us a great look.

761
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:31,802
Working with his DP helped a lot.
He could be quicker.

762

When the DP auditioned for me. . .

makeup sequences.

764

I was impressed that he didn't
use a lot of external lighting.

765
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:55,362
We shot this in Wyck's backyard.

WG: Trashed it.

767
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:35,891
The stunt that we just saw,
Owen did himself.

768
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:38,522
It was the first day
Gene was on the set.

When he looked up and saw Owen
doing that stunt. . .

with professionalism. . .

it gave Gene a comfort level.

00:56:53,733 --> 00:56:55,928
Owen, it was his favorite thing.

774
00:56:56,173 --> 00:57:00,689
He ran through the mines
with explosions going off behind him.

775
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,445
He had a blast doing it.

776
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:07,812
JD: We had his agent chase him
through, which sped him up a bit.

777
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,524
WG:
Gene walked up to John.

778
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:15,004
John was all harried because
he was meeting Gene.

779
00:57:15,173 --> 00:57:18,131
They talked and Gene goes,
"Get back to work. "

780
00:57:18,373 --> 00:57:19,931
John said, "Yes, sir. "

781
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:23,043
I don't know. You tell me, sir.

REIGART OVER RADIO:
The hard bit's over. You--

783
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:31,282
WG: This is one of the scenes
where it originally was written. . .

784
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:35,845
. . .in a way in which Owen
kind of loses it for a second.

785
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:42,328
He is sleep-deprived and
he makes a reference to his pilot. . .

786
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:46,247
. . .that implies that he kind of thinks
he's still alive.

787
00:57:46,493 --> 00:57:51,408
That spurned Hackman into saying,
"Let's talk about something else. "

788
00:57:51,613 --> 00:57:56,403
He snaps him back into it
and gets his head back into it.

789
00:57:57,893 --> 00:58:01,249
We looked at it and the studio felt. . .

790
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:05,731
. . .that we didn't support
that idea through the movie.

791
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:11,206
That he was at a place where he would
literally lose his mind for a minute.

792
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:16,208
Because he snapped back into it,
they didn't feel like it worked.

793
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:20,122
So we had Owen instead,
off camera, reference. . .

794
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:24,446
. . .that he's feeling guilty
about leaving Stackhouse behind.

00:58:24,693 --> 00:58:27,412
--garbled.
Let's talk about your gear.

796
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:30,002
How's it holding up?

797
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:40,492
JD: It's important for a producer to
give a sense of comfort to an actor.

798
00:58:40,693 --> 00:58:45,005
That there's somebody to talk to
when he needs to complain.

799
00:58:46,213 --> 00:58:49,842
It's important that a producer
doesn't get involved. . .

800
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:54,564
. . .with an actor's performance.
But that he talks to the director.

801
00:58:55,173 --> 00:58:57,767
And that the director communicates.

802
00:58:57,973 --> 00:59:00,851
You can create anarchy
on a set otherwise.

803
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:05,803
I think that certain actors are
trying to please multiple people.

804
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:08,402
That can create a tough situation.

805
00:59:08,613 --> 00:59:14,051
You're with an actor to make them feel
warm, comfortable and supported.

806
00:59:14,293 --> 00:59:17,126
You're there when they have a problem.

807
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:21,647
It's important that any
performance-related questions. . .

808
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:25,647
. . .go to the director
and the director communicates them.

809
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:32,162
I've seen producers talk to actors
to give input on performance.

810
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:36,690
I really think that it is
a bastardization of what we do.

811
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:41,801
WG: Whenever Owen had any big
problems with the script. . .

812
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:48,327
. . .John, he and I would hash it out
so that we were on the same page.

813
00:59:48,573 --> 00:59:53,806
A thing that can happen is the
director can go off with the actor.

814
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:58,564
All of a sudden they're shooting
and you're not recognizing the scene.

815
00:59:59,213 --> 01:00:00,805
We tried to avoid that.

816
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:04,005
JD: The director has a responsibility
to let you know. . .

817
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:07,843
. . .if he's gonna make any changes
to the script.

818
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:19,004
The score in this movie could be
an essential additional element.

819
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:25,010
This is one of those movies where
a score makes it 1 0 or 1 50/0 better.

820
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:28,131
You want to take advantage
of that if you can.

821
01:00:28,373 --> 01:00:32,810
There's emotional moments that
the score can help drive home.

822
01:00:33,013 --> 01:00:37,643
They can create a theme,
a sense of movement of action.

823
01:00:37,893 --> 01:00:42,045
And I think that if
the score's working right. . .

824
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:46,605
. . .the overall movie is gonna just
feel more organically whole.

825
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:50,129
--then return to the helo.

This is Colonel--

827
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:58,326
WG: For this scene we had little time.
We had to get it in one shot.

828
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:02,612
John put it on a Steadicam
and revolved around them.

829
01:01:02,853 --> 01:01:06,323
It may have not been the way
he wanted to design it.

830
01:01:06,693 --> 01:01:10,368
With three characters talking,
you want to shoot all three.

831
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:15,687
Due to the situation and planes
landing, we just had to get the scene.

832
01:01:15,853 --> 01:01:20,290
We were gonna be off the ship
in two days and couldn't make it up.

833
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:24,526
That's a case of a first-time director
thinking on his feet. . .

834
01:01:24,693 --> 01:01:30,006
. . .trying to make a problem
into an asset.

835
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:36,205
JD: Getting back to the music--
The process was very interactive.

836
01:01:36,413 --> 01:01:41,612
Don Davis would score a piece of the
movie and we would go to his house.

837
01:01:41,853 --> 01:01:44,890
He has a studio.
And we would listen to it.

838
01:01:45,053 --> 01:01:48,363
We'd comment, he'd make changes
and we'd come back.

839
01:01:48,573 --> 01:01:52,851
He worked with us.
It's most like the script process. . .

840
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:56,608
. . .I've ever experienced
with music before.

841
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:02,185
We had a short time
to get it to work right.

842
01:02:02,433 --> 01:02:06,665
The composer was willing
to work with everybody.

843
01:02:06,913 --> 01:02:10,826
I think we were able to quickly
take a part of the movie. . .

844
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:15,111
. . .that was in disastrous shape
and turn it into a plus.

845
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:20,271
WG: Coming up here is one
of my favorite scenes.

846
01:02:20,473 --> 01:02:23,351
The scene in the back of the truck.

847
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:27,023
Which was intended and
I think accomplished. . .

848
01:02:27,233 --> 01:02:31,351
. . .in making you feel the surreality
of what Owen's going for. . .

849
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:33,589
. . .and the oddness of this place.

850
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:37,308
The fact that the kids
in the back of the truck. . .

851
01:02:37,473 --> 01:02:40,670
. . .are drinking Coke
and listen to rap music.

852
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:47,067
There's this bizarre disconnect with
what he's doing, trying to survive.

853
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:50,031
Suddenly, he's in a truck
with teenagers.

854
01:02:50,193 --> 01:02:53,583
Who are still teenagers,
even though they're--

855
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:59,072
JD: Originally we wanted to introduce
the idea they're weekend warriors.

856
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:03,465
They're holding down jobs
and conducting everyday lives.

857
01:03:03,673 --> 01:03:06,392
And on the weekends they go fight.

858
01:03:06,593 --> 01:03:09,949
And originally we had
a great scene constructed. . .

859
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:14,146
. . .where he fell into a foxhole
with some weekend warriors.

860
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:17,823
They were talking about
having tickets for a concert.

861
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:23,147
They were conversing and it really
created a connection between. . .

862
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:26,673
. . .the reality of war
and everyday life.

863
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:31,748
This was a good solution.
We couldn't do in the new script. . .

864
01:03:31,993 --> 01:03:34,143
. . .that same series of scenes.

865
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,347
I think that this really drove home. . .

866
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:42,189
. . .the idea that this war in
particular had part-time combatants.

867
01:03:42,713 --> 01:03:47,343
WG: It's also the time in the movie
where Owen makes a connection. . .

868
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:52,428
. . .with the people of the country who
are the victims of what's going on.

869
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:56,421
He has an opportunity to see
what they're going through.

870
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:59,864
It ties you in emotionally
to what's happening. . .

871
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:04,311
. . .rather than it just being
pure action the whole way through.

872
01:04:06,033 --> 01:04:10,106
JD: There's a scene coming up
where Owen pulls out a Coke.

873
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:13,663
I've been asked
if Coke paid us for that.

874
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:17,952
-They didn't. They got free publicity.
WG: Right.

875
01:04:21,793 --> 01:04:23,909
-You have water?
-Water?

876
01:04:24,113 --> 01:04:27,230
WG: These actors in the truck
are guys we found. . .

877
01:04:27,393 --> 01:04:31,068
. . .just local high-school actors
in Bratislava.

878
01:04:31,313 --> 01:04:36,262
She's actually
a stunt woman in Slovakia.

879
01:04:36,593 --> 01:04:40,632
As you'll see coming up,
she'll have reason to use her skills.

880
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:45,662
All of them were just people we'd
called in before shooting and said:

881
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:48,745
"Do you want to be
in an American movie?"

882
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:54,581
The kid, Babic, I think
really has a great presence.

883
01:04:54,833 --> 01:05:00,590
They're all such sweet kids who had
never been in a movie, obviously.

884
01:05:00,793 --> 01:05:02,272
BABIC:
--NWA, Public Enemy.

885
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:05,465
WG: They had fun
and Owen had fun with them.

886
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:11,822
He appreciated the fact that they
were not really actors, but doing it.

887
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:16,311
JD: Kind of doing it for the first
time in a big American movie.

888
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:18,708
BURNETT:
That's good. That's good.

889
01:05:21,153 --> 01:05:23,826
JD: Helicopters drove us nuts
because John. . .

890
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:29,070
. . .was such a military enthusiast.

891
01:05:29,273 --> 01:05:33,585
He so knows his details
that if a nose cone wasn't right. . .

892
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:36,870
. . .he wouldn't shoot with us.
So we went all over. . .

893
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:39,229
. . .making sure the helicopters. . .

894
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:42,227
. . .were authentic,
including the nose cones.

895
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:47,587
WG: Hach, which was built from scratch
by the production designer.

896
01:05:48,313 --> 01:05:50,429
This you'll see on the DVD. . .

897
01:05:50,593 --> 01:05:54,347
. . .there's a much more intense version
with more violence.

898
01:05:54,553 --> 01:05:58,785
This is the one area of the movie
where John just went for it.

899
01:05:58,993 --> 01:06:02,702
He wanted it to feel like warfare.

900
01:06:02,913 --> 01:06:06,667
He wanted everything to feel
as harsh, brutal and loud. . .

901
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:09,985
. . .as anything anyone had seen before.

902
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:15,671
And when we saw the first cut,
it was fantastic. But it was R-rated.

903
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:20,303
That's when we had to start
to make the decision:

904
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:24,432
"Is this a film we want
to release PG-1 3 or R-rated?"

905
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:26,942
And we released it as a PG-1 3.

906
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:31,749
JD: For my tastes, the longer version
was a little too gratuitous.

907
01:06:31,953 --> 01:06:32,988
WG:
And I loved it.

908
01:06:33,153 --> 01:06:34,268
[MAN LAUGHS]

909
01:06:39,993 --> 01:06:44,987
WG: We shot this entire sequence in
Hach in five days, five shooting days.

910
01:06:46,153 --> 01:06:47,347
Both the interior--

911
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:51,347
JD: These are the only women
in the movie, the ones seen here.

912
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:52,952
I'm sorry, go ahead.

913
01:06:53,193 --> 01:06:55,502
WG:
The interiors we shot last.

914
01:06:55,713 --> 01:07:00,150
We actually shot that part
you just saw, the destruction, first.

915
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:04,949
Then we went and got these dialogue
scenes and the action inside.

916
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:07,303
It was at the end of the shoot.

917
01:07:07,513 --> 01:07:10,630
We were all extremely exhausted. . .

918
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:14,223
. . .and at our wits' end.
Fights every day.

919
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:15,582
EJUP:
Of what?

920
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:21,382
JD: This is being shot
close to Christmas, year 2000.

921
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:26,502
There was a determined attempt
to finish and get everybody home. . .

922
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,385
. . .for Christmas.

923
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:32,063
That was the movie's theme,
"Be home by Christmas. "

924
01:07:32,273 --> 01:07:38,587
WG: John would've liked more time
to shoot this, but it was impossible.

925
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:43,066
People had scheduled trips back.
They were on to other movies.

926
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:47,903
We were shooting into the night.
That's why we shot interiors last. . .

927
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:52,544
. . .because we knew we could
control it and go longer if we had to.

928
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:57,429
We ended up getting it in five days,
which was kind of a miracle.

929
01:07:57,633 --> 01:08:00,705
America government for shit! Now go!

930
01:08:05,713 --> 01:08:10,150
WG: We brought that tank in
and had to do that shot three times. . .

931
01:08:10,313 --> 01:08:12,622
. . .to get the explosion just right.

932
01:08:12,953 --> 01:08:15,990
There's a huge safety issue
with tanks.

933
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:22,263
You've got them moving around, you've
got soldiers who drive the tanks. . .

934
01:08:22,513 --> 01:08:28,190
. . .trying to listen to a first AD
who doesn't know their language.

935
01:08:28,433 --> 01:08:32,312
We'd have to clear everything out
while moving the tanks. . .

936
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:34,225
. . .to get them in position.

937
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:39,746
But obviously, safety's first,
and that slowed us down quite a bit.

938
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:41,744
JD:
I always wanted my own tank.

939
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:46,344
It'd be a great thing to drive
your kids to school in.

940
01:08:46,553 --> 01:08:48,942
WG: You could probably buy one.
I think they're on the market.

941
01:08:49,113 --> 01:08:50,102
JD:
Yeah.

942
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,708
WG:
This area here is on the DVD.

943
01:08:55,873 --> 01:09:01,266
You'll see where the more brutal
execution-style violence came in.

944
01:09:01,473 --> 01:09:04,863
That was a problem.
You can have violence. . .

945
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:10,101
. . .but when they're pure executions,
that sends you over into the R rating.

946
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:14,142
People look at this
and wonder how this is PG-1 3.

947
01:09:14,393 --> 01:09:18,989
But that's a negotiation,
it's our job and the studio's job. . .

948
01:09:19,233 --> 01:09:22,111
. . .to show them a version,
make some trims.

949
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:25,391
And get to a place
where you get the rating. . .

950
01:09:25,553 --> 01:09:30,149
. . .but you've also gotten
the movie you want.

951
01:09:35,433 --> 01:09:38,789
JD: It's not collaborative.
The board will look at it. . .

952
01:09:38,993 --> 01:09:42,986
. . .say what the rating is and
tell you what their issues are.

953
01:09:43,233 --> 01:09:45,349
Then you go and address them.

954
01:09:45,593 --> 01:09:51,065
You can do it partially and re-submit
and sometimes get the rating you want.

955
01:09:51,873 --> 01:09:56,424
There's a theory that if you submit
enough, they'll get tired of it. . .

956
01:09:56,673 --> 01:09:58,903
. . .and give you what you need.

957
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:03,984
They see the film, come up with
a judgement and give you their notes.

958
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:07,822
It's like a ref at a football game
who calls holding.

959
01:10:07,993 --> 01:10:11,668
It's in the eye of the beholder.
Was that holding or not?

960
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:17,343
So it's good that you can re-submit.
Sometimes you can negotiate.

961
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:21,108
Because sometimes
their first opinions. . .

962
01:10:22,513 --> 01:10:25,550
. . .will be somewhat difficult
to understand.

963
01:10:28,313 --> 01:10:31,544
WG: One of the things that got
us through Hach was. . .

964
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:34,512
. . .we had about four units shooting.

965
01:10:34,673 --> 01:10:39,588
We had a second unit shooting
outside while we were inside.

966
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:44,384
We had an aerial unit shooting
some of the helicopter air-to-air.

967
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:46,863
And a unit shooting the inserts.

968
01:10:47,913 --> 01:10:50,427
By the end of the show in Slovakia. . .

969
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:56,431
. . .we had anybody who could
hold a camera shooting some stuff.

970
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,589
JD: There's a lot of guerrilla
filmmaking that went on.

971
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:05,065
It helped having a director
who was used to picking up a camera. . .

972
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:07,224
. . .and shooting it himself.

973
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:10,711
That enabled us to do a lot of this.

974
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:16,743
The first-time DP, Brendan Galvin,
did a spectacular job.

975
01:11:16,993 --> 01:11:19,143
He could move so quickly. . .

976
01:11:19,353 --> 01:11:24,985
. . .and could light a scene without
using a tremendous amount of lights.

977
01:11:25,233 --> 01:11:27,952
It was very helpful.

978
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:37,790
We saw tests of the film. The DP
came out and auditioned for us. . .

979
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:43,983
. . .shot the film and makeup tests.
We saw early shots on the mountain. . .

980
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,942
. . .with Owen that we did
before we started the movie.

981
01:11:48,153 --> 01:11:51,225
Always impressed with what
he was able to do.

982
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:56,746
I think he's wonderful. The look
is fresh and works well for the film.

983
01:11:56,953 --> 01:12:00,389
Cinematography and the idea
worked well together.

984
01:12:00,873 --> 01:12:05,503
WG: Well, obviously it was such
an external, an outdoor movie. . .

985
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:11,703
. . .we were relying upon the weather
and what was expected at the time.

986
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:15,025
It was the warmest,
driest winter they'd had. . .

987
01:12:15,433 --> 01:12:16,707
. . .in 55 years.

988
01:12:16,913 --> 01:12:20,303
We went in thinking
we'd be shooting in the snow. . .

989
01:12:20,553 --> 01:12:25,069
. . .and clouds, which would've helped.
But a lot of times it'd be sunny.

990
01:12:25,313 --> 01:12:29,511
We'd have to throw up some screens
or wait for a cloud.

991
01:12:29,753 --> 01:12:32,745
The weather didn't help
him at all. . .

992
01:12:32,953 --> 01:12:36,070
. . .and the third act
takes place in the snow.

993
01:12:36,233 --> 01:12:40,272
We'd fully expected it to be
all real snow by then.

994
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:43,186
But a lot of it we had to make.

995
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:52,304
JD: Somebody's always watching,
the producer or line producer.

996
01:12:52,513 --> 01:12:56,392
You can very easily
get your day re-positioned. . .

997
01:12:56,593 --> 01:13:00,268
. . .or destroyed based on what happens.

998
01:13:00,513 --> 01:13:04,142
Rain, in a situation where
you're not expecting it. . .

999
01:13:04,353 --> 01:13:08,187
. . .and you can't move to a cover set,
can cost you a day.

1000
01:13:08,353 --> 01:13:11,663
And there's no such thing
as weather insurance.

1001
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:15,587
Weather's a factor.
Sometimes a studio will forgive you. . .

1002
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:18,552
. . .if it was beyond your control.

1003
01:13:18,713 --> 01:13:22,262
An act of nature
and you just didn't get your day.

1004
01:13:22,513 --> 01:13:24,469
Sometimes they won't relent.

1005
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,864
They'll go, "You had 55 days
to shoot, that's it. "

1006
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:32,504
And you won't wanna have to take
pages out or compromise a scene.

1007
01:13:32,873 --> 01:13:36,183
So you always have a cover set.

1008
01:13:36,353 --> 01:13:41,302
But it can take two or three hours
to get to it, so it's not useful.

1009
01:13:41,553 --> 01:13:45,910
Weather can play a big factor
on how much time you have to shoot.

1010
01:13:46,153 --> 01:13:51,625
WG: On this, we rarely had a cover set.
Because of Gene's schedule. . .

1011
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:56,748
. . .we shot all this stuff on the skiff
over the course of four weeks. . .

1012
01:13:56,953 --> 01:13:59,911
. . .and the rest
of the movie is outdoors.

1013
01:14:00,153 --> 01:14:04,624
So we were really at the whims
of the weather.

1014
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:09,270
We were always told by the studio,
"You can't wait for clouds.

1015
01:14:09,473 --> 01:14:13,261
You can't say you're not
shooting because it's sunny. "

1016
01:14:13,713 --> 01:14:15,908
We kind of made the best of it.

1017
01:14:16,153 --> 01:14:21,307
For the most part, you don't notice
the continuity problems.

1018
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:25,592
JD: They showed a Jack Lemmon film,
Days of Wine and Roses...

1019
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:29,871
. . .where the film was shot at
"golden hour," as the sun sets.

1020
01:14:30,113 --> 01:14:35,426
I was amazed they could schedule it
so they'd shoot only those two hours.

1021
01:14:35,673 --> 01:14:39,507
You couldn't do that given
the cost of modern filmmaking.

1022
01:14:40,113 --> 01:14:45,506
You can't wait for your weather,
especially with this price-range film.

1023
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:51,066
You've just gotta work with the hand
you're dealt with.

1024
01:14:51,273 --> 01:14:55,186
REPORTER: This is bound to spoil
NA TO's hope of an exit from the--

1025
01:14:56,553 --> 01:15:02,867
JD: Don Davis' music helped create
an additional emotional component.

1026
01:15:03,113 --> 01:15:07,868
AERNOUT: --Burnett's death comes
as another blow.

1027
01:15:08,113 --> 01:15:10,104
JD:
David Keith was a real champ.

1028
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:13,709
He took the movie
back to the Carl Vinson...

1029
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:17,070
. . .right in the middle
of the Afghan War.

1030
01:15:17,273 --> 01:15:22,791
And we had a premiere on the deck
of the Carl Vinson for the crew.

1031
01:15:23,713 --> 01:15:28,662
WG: We promised we'd find
them wherever they were at the time. . .

1032
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:33,304
. . .so they could see it first because
a lot of them are in the movie.

1033
01:15:33,473 --> 01:15:38,501
A lot of the guys on deck and in
the football scene are from the ship.

1034
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:43,586
They really appreciated it.

1035
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:47,106
It was great for them
to be a part of it.

1036
01:15:47,353 --> 01:15:50,550
JD: Owen accidentally shot down
the helicopter. . .

1037
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,704
. . .when he was firing his gun.

1038
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:56,866
We needed a new helicopter
after take two.

1039
01:15:57,873 --> 01:16:00,262
That's why he cusses there.

1040
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:03,382
You've got to be shitting me!

1041
01:16:03,553 --> 01:16:09,025
WG: This is in Kosice, Slovakia.
It was probably our most--

1042
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:14,591
It's a city in northeast Slovakia,
close to the Ukraine border.

1043
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:19,668
Basically they found a potato field
and threw them out there.

1044
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:23,064
It was towards the end
of production. . .

1045
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:27,272
. . .and we wanted to get that
sort of stark look.

1046
01:16:29,473 --> 01:16:33,671
JD: John Moore took a helicopter
and literally searched. . .

1047
01:16:33,913 --> 01:16:39,590
. . .over a two-week period
every inch of Slovakia. . .

1048
01:16:39,953 --> 01:16:44,105
. . .to make sure he had locations
that really optimized. . .

1049
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:47,106
. . .what he wanted to do
in those settings.

1050
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,470
The look of the film is a testimony. . .

1051
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:53,670
. . .in how dogged he was
in doing his research.

1052
01:16:53,913 --> 01:16:58,509
And the fact that he had
a helicopter to scout locations.

1053
01:17:00,153 --> 01:17:04,863
WG: He actually took the helicopter
and took it to Croatia.

1054
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:07,945
He wasn't satisfied with Slovakia.

1055
01:17:08,193 --> 01:17:12,664
JD: We found out and said, "Don't
think you're gonna shoot in Croatia.

1056
01:17:12,913 --> 01:17:14,710
-We can't get insured there.
WG: Permits.

1057
01:17:14,953 --> 01:17:18,912
JD: We can't get permits
and the studio will have a fit.

1058
01:17:19,153 --> 01:17:22,748
So get your ass back to Slovakia. "

1059
01:17:23,353 --> 01:17:27,983
I think that he was gonna see
if he could fool us a little bit.

1060
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:33,665
Like we wouldn't know where the border
was or notice we were in Croatia.

1061
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:35,904
WG:
This originally was scripted--

1062
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:40,828
One of the things we wanted
to capture with the Tracker's suit. . .

1063
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:46,312
. . .it was supposed to be
a Sarajevo Olympic sweat suit. . .

1064
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:50,705
. . .and this was to be an Olympic
memorial. But we couldn't get. . .

1065
01:17:50,873 --> 01:17:56,903
. . .the Olympics to let us use
their logo, the four, five rings.

1066
01:17:57,113 --> 01:17:59,911
And we couldn't get that signet. . .

1067
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:04,061
. . .of the Sarajevo Olympics,
so we had to fudge it.

1068
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:06,548
That was one battle we lost.

1069
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:12,472
The Tracker's backstory is that
he was a biathlete in the Olympics.

1070
01:18:13,353 --> 01:18:18,666
And now, given civil war, he's using
his talents for his own purposes.

1071
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:22,661
Instead of shooting at targets
he's shooting at people.

1072
01:18:22,993 --> 01:18:25,029
You'll be safer here.

1073
01:18:32,553 --> 01:18:38,469
JD: It was another tattoo from a
concentration camp that he could be. . .

1074
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:42,871
. . .identified with the person
you thought was Burnett.

1075
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:48,062
WG: The tattoo he has in Hach
and shows people is one moments. . .

1076
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:54,343
. . .where you realize he's a badass.
He's been to prison, he's out now.

1077
01:18:54,593 --> 01:19:00,304
It was a fun way to give you his
backstory without being expository.

1078
01:19:00,473 --> 01:19:03,226
This is a guy that's not a nice guy.

1079
01:19:03,393 --> 01:19:04,428
[MAN CHUCKLES]

1080
01:19:27,713 --> 01:19:32,389
WG: The most difficult physical
production by far was this scene. . .

1081
01:19:32,713 --> 01:19:34,385
. . .on the frozen lake.

1082
01:19:34,593 --> 01:19:39,303
We had to build this frozen lake
with wax.

1083
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:44,507
And it took probably four days longer
than we thought it would. . .

1084
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:47,307
. . .to shoot this sequence coming up.

1085
01:19:47,513 --> 01:19:52,143
So many things, with the Army coming
in and the helicopter footage. . .

1086
01:19:52,313 --> 01:19:54,702
. . .and the guns having to work.

1087
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,707
And it was freezing. We were
into the heart of winter here.

1088
01:19:58,953 --> 01:20:01,672
We only had seven hours of daylight.

1089
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:06,270
And it was really brutal conditions.

1090
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:11,263
This was the biggest hurdle to get
over from a production standpoint.

1091
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:16,188
By the end of it
we were all dead tired.

1092
01:20:17,353 --> 01:20:18,945
JD:
Unfortunately not dead.

1093
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:20,102
[MAN CHUCKLES]

1094
01:20:20,673 --> 01:20:25,747
WG: The snow here is all fake.
It's manufactured snow.

1095
01:20:26,073 --> 01:20:32,069
The lake he slid on was made
with a sort of wood base underneath.

1096
01:20:32,313 --> 01:20:35,544
The art director and production
designer poured. . .

1097
01:20:35,713 --> 01:20:40,104
. . .thousands of gallons of hot wax
and had to let it dry.

1098
01:20:40,313 --> 01:20:44,192
Every couple of days,
it'd get torn up from filming on it.

1099
01:20:44,353 --> 01:20:50,030
The night before they'd pour another
layer of wax to give that lake a feel.

1100
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:55,142
The reason we have a lake up there
is because John said, rightly so:

1101
01:20:55,313 --> 01:21:00,068
"The rescue can't take place
if the helicopters can put down. "

1102
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:04,988
Because that's what they would do.
They'd put down, hop out and fight.

1103
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:08,463
We weren't gonna be able
to construct a sequence. . .

1104
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:14,230
. . .where you had to have an entire
Bosnian military on one side. . .

1105
01:21:14,553 --> 01:21:18,432
. . .but to also shoot the action
of the U.S. military.

1106
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:23,224
It was more effective to have
them fight the battle from the air.

1107
01:21:23,433 --> 01:21:28,553
We put Owen on a frozen lake
to explain why they can't put down. . .

1108
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:34,669
. . .which you'll hear Hackman
or one of his soldiers say later.

1109
01:21:36,073 --> 01:21:40,908
JD: This is one of my favorite shots
coming up. This is the elevator. . .

1110
01:21:41,153 --> 01:21:45,863
. . .on the aircraft carrier that moves
the equipment up and down.

1111
01:21:46,033 --> 01:21:49,469
And in a moment you'll see
the opposite elevator.

1112
01:21:49,673 --> 01:21:55,782
John has his camera on the elevator,
giving us this great shot of Gene.

1113
01:21:56,033 --> 01:22:00,265
Those elevators move up and down
incredibly quickly.

1114
01:22:00,513 --> 01:22:05,667
WG: They transport the planes
from the hangar bay onto the deck.

1115
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:11,465
She's a member of the military
from the Carl Vinson...

1116
01:22:11,713 --> 01:22:15,342
. . .who we cast when we arrived
on the ship.

1117
01:22:15,593 --> 01:22:18,027
-How long has that been on?
ANALYST: Seven minutes.

1118
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,269
You've gotta be very familiar--

1119
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:25,268
JD: Again, this is all constructed
in Slovakia. . .

1120
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:28,425
. . .where Gene is right now
on a sound stage.

1121
01:22:30,073 --> 01:22:33,986
And the detail and the realism
they were able to capture. . .

1122
01:22:34,593 --> 01:22:37,630
. . .when you go on the actual ship,
was amazing.

1123
01:22:37,793 --> 01:22:41,468
Again, this is all on a sound stage.
All this stuff.

1124
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:44,511
WG: This is a real satisfying point
in the movie.

1125
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:50,384
Unlike a lot of Gene's roles, he's
been fairly impotent in this movie.

1126
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,305
We got a great reaction. . .

1127
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:56,069
. . .when he finally makes
the decision to go.

1128
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:06,666
The Tracker leaving Bazda to die.
This used to be a larger story line.

1129
01:23:06,913 --> 01:23:12,670
The Tracker's competition with Bazda,
who's Lokar's right-hand man.

1130
01:23:12,913 --> 01:23:18,192
At some point the idea was that Lokar,
feeling the noose tighten. . .

1131
01:23:18,513 --> 01:23:23,223
. . .starts to weed-out the people
that could turn on him later.

1132
01:23:23,553 --> 01:23:29,583
The idea was-- In the scene earlier,
by the memorial, we cut this out. . .

1133
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:32,870
. . .he tells the Tracker,
"Take Bazda with you. "

1134
01:23:33,033 --> 01:23:35,672
You get the sense he's gonna kill him.

1135
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:46,621
JD: Sometimes there are subplots
you write in a script.

1136
01:23:47,073 --> 01:23:50,509
When the movie's put together,
it's too long. . .

1137
01:23:50,753 --> 01:23:54,792
. . .and the subplot isn't as important
as you thought it was.

1138
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:58,549
So those subplots get minimized. . .

1139
01:23:58,753 --> 01:24:03,065
. . .so other story elements
can move at a better pace.

1140
01:24:06,073 --> 01:24:12,228
WG: This actor playing Bazda is
a local Bratislavan actor named Marko.

1141
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:15,272
I forgot his last name.
He was fantastic.

1142
01:24:15,513 --> 01:24:20,985
We brought Eyde Belasco,
our Fox casting director, to Slovakia.

1143
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:27,422
And she and I looked for local talent
while John scouted locations.

1144

We'd find somebody

He'd sort of go, "Yes, no, yes, no. "

of weeks on the location in Slovakia.

And then we convinced him to work on
the carrier, which was months later.

I thought this should be
very patriotic.

He didn't wanna hit it
as hard as I did.

So we compromised. There was a piece
he wanted me to give up on earlier.

He said, "I'll trade you that

The night before you shoot,
you'd sit down with the commanders.

1186
01:27:47,153 --> 01:27:51,908
You would compare schedules

when they'd need to land the planes.

1189

Every night you'd be up
until midnight negotiating.

1190
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:08,671
And you'd be up shooting the next
morning by 7:00 when it got light.

about the way the movie ended up.

in San Diego on the base. . .

experience for them. They loved it.

recruiting booms for the U.S. Navy.

"All we do is make movies.

Being able to show them this and
talk to them after was very emotional.

There were more shots
Owen takes, bullet hits.

1209
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,222

He was back the next day doing action
sequences with a separated shoulder.

see he's favoring his right arm.

he said, "This is nothing. "

of a lot of editing and re-editing.

It was very hard
for us to get it right.

Initially John cut it as pure action,
and it wasn't emotionally satisfying.

emotional element. . .

being action to being about something.

to finish what this was all about.

right. So many things are going on.

helicopters, which is like the cavalry.

There's action, there's so much
going on, it was so complex.

It was hard to get the music to play

executive. This was her first movie.

1285
01:35:13,513 --> 01:35:18,348
She did a great job fighting
some of the studio battles for us.

1286
01:35:18,593 --> 01:35:24,509
Don Davis came in in a pinch
and helped us with the music.

1287
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:28,070
Brendan Galvin, who was the DP.

1288
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:32,988
And lastly, Tom Rothman
and Hutch Parker. . .

1289
01:35:33,153 --> 01:35:37,510
. . .president and chairman of Fox,
helped get this off the ground. . .

1290
01:35:37,673 --> 01:35:40,233
. . .were very helpful
whenever we needed money.

1291
01:35:40,393 --> 01:35:41,428
[MAN CHUCKLES]

1292
01:35:41,593 --> 01:35:45,632
And John Moore, who did a great job,
who's a great friend of ours.

1293
01:35:45,793 --> 01:35:49,581
And had a great first movie.
Thanks, John.

1294
01:35:49,753 --> 01:35:52,267
WG:
Thanks for sitting with us.

1295
01:36:00,073 --> 01:36:04,146
JD: What am I most proud and happy
with when all is said and done?

1296
01:36:04,393 --> 01:36:06,861
The fact that I like the movie.

1297
01:36:09,273 --> 01:36:12,185
WG: I'm just proud that it's
up there on screen.

1298
01:36:12,353 --> 01:36:16,869
It's a much bigger movie
than any of us expected it to be.

1299
01:36:26,233 --> 01:36:29,669
JD: Whenever a movie gets made,
you look back and go:

1300
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:33,826
"How many times was it impossible
that this was gonna happen?

1301
01:36:33,993 --> 01:36:38,703
How many times were we dead?
How many times did we come back?"

1302
01:36:38,913 --> 01:36:41,950
And at the end, when it's done,
you go:

1303
01:36:42,113 --> 01:36:46,345
"I don't know how we did it,
but thank God we did it. "

1304
01:36:46,513 --> 01:36:50,347
WG: It's amazing. You tend to forget
all the fights you have. . .

1305
01:36:50,593 --> 01:36:53,869
. . .and embrace the people
that helped you. . .

1306
01:36:54,073 --> 01:36:57,270
. . .no matter how many times
you fought with them.

1307
01:36:57,473 --> 01:37:01,068
JD: I lived with this project
for six years.

1308
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:04,430
And it was dead three times.

1309
01:37:06,033 --> 01:37:09,469
I almost gave up on it until
a Navy pilot said:

1310
01:37:09,633 --> 01:37:15,071
"You can't give up on it,
you just gotta keep at it. "
