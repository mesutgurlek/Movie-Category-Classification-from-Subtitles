1
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,505
# Nobody knows
the trouble I've seen #

2
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,012
I know.

3
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:00,175
# Somebody knows
the trouble I've seen #

4
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,516
This thing has knocked out more guys
than Joe Louis.

5
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:05,851
The winner and still champion...

6
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:08,187
[Klinger] Captain, may I
be excused from this detail?

7
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:10,693
- My nylons are baggin' all around the knees.
- Get bigger knees.

8
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,992
Corporal, you're gonna have
to do better than this.
I want this floor clean enough to eat off.

9
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:17,864
- Easy. It's already cleaner
than the tables in the Mess.
- Keep scrubbing!

10
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:21,803
- Ah, what a festive mood
people get in at a G.I. Party.
- Oh, shut up.

11
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,272
[Frank] Major Houlihan, I hope you
and your nurses are doing a good job.

12
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:27,242
- We can hold up our end. Why
don't you go and hold up yours?
- [Frank] Very well.

13
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,245
When you finish checking that machine,
check it again.

14
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:31,247
- Frank, how long are you gonna be here?
- Ten minutes.

15
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,579
Wake me when he's gone.
[Inhaling Deeply]

16
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:37,052
- Those aren't even connected.
- Told you this was a "tankless"job.

17
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:40,386
You crazy guy!
Frank, go make yourself useful.

18
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,427
- I'm a supervisor. I don't have to be useful.
- Well, you're doing a great job.

19
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,724
Oh, go stuff a goose.

20
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,924
- Put a little elbow grease
into that, Corporal!
- I'm all out of elbow grease.

21
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:52,491
- Don't talk back to me!
- Yes, sir!

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,006
- You did that on purpose, you Lebanese lout!
- Hold it. What's goin' on here?

23
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,847
I saw the whole thing.
Frank tried to eat Klinger's mop.

24
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,609
- Burns, I put you in charge of this detail.
- Doin' a great job, Colonel.

25
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:05,118
- He's already washed his face and his shirt.
- At the same time.

26
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:09,180
- Why is it taking so long?
- Nobody's following orders,
and they're all grumpy.

27
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,691
- Not true. I'm Grumpy.
- He's Sneezy.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,558
- He's Bashful.
- She's Dopey.
- Wash your mouth.

29
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,087
Okay. Just get it done.
Let's all try to get along.

30
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:22,262
- # Get along, little doggie #
- I had a long little doggie once.

31
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,635
- It was a dachshund.
- Oh, a little hot dog. What happened to him?

32
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:28,540
- He got mustered out.
- I relish these conversations.

33
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,546
- Will you knock off the silliness?
- Knock yourself off, goofball.

34
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:35,208
I was invited to the Goof Ball,
but I didn't have a thing to wear.

35
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:38,480
- Colonel, they're making me sick.
- <i>[Potter] Me too.</i>

36
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:41,750
- Please. I just mopped the floor!
- And look at it! It's filthy!

37
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:45,691
That's right. Criticize my work. I mop my
heart out, and that's all the thanks I get?

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,526
- Don't talk back to me! I'm an officer!
- But you're no gentleman.

39
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,864
- Oh, can it, nurses! Check the surgical packs.
- [Able] Checking, checking.

40
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:55,926
- [Bigelow] Checking packs like crazy.
- <i>[Margaret] Put a lid on it!</i>

41
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:59,098
- It's been this way all day, sir.
No discipline.
- Okay, okay.

42
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:04,237
- Let's all try to work together,
make the best of it.
- [All] Okay. Here we go.

43
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:07,941
- [Potter] I'm getting out of here.
- You heard the colonel. Have fun!

44
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:10,007
Yeah.

45
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:13,848
- Oh.
- Ooh. Hiya, Father!

46
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:17,722
- Any luck, Father?
- We have a winner here. I found the mail.

47
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:20,420
- <i>[Potter] Bingo. You're a genius.</i>
- Not really.

48
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,656
Mail's just in time.
Everybody's chewing each other up.

49
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,029
Oh, heavens!
I have another surprise.

50
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,558
- Don't tell me. You got Mildred
in one of your bags.
- No, Colonel.

51
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:31,265
It's that movie you requested,
your favorite Western.

52
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,830
Hot damn!
Things are lookin' up.

53
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,709
Never mind what I told you before! Forget
the instrument packs and clean these shelves.

54
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:40,680
- They're filthy. There's dirt all over them.
- All right.

55
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:44,549
- Come on, now. Step on it!
- Frank, if you say "step on it"
one more time, I'll step on you.

56
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:47,247
- Well, then, move it, then! Move it!
- Shut up, Frank!

57
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:50,257
Nurses, will you pipe down?
I can't hear myself yell.

58
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:53,260
Mind your own business, Captain.
I'll handle this.

59
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:58,288
You're messing up my floor!
Will you quit walking on my clean floor?

60
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:00,732
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>
<i>Colonel Potter would like...</i>

61
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,770
to address the personnel
personally.

62
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:05,567
- There you go, sir. Just keep
your finger on that button.
- Thank you, Corporal.

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,600
[Clears Throat] This is good news.
I know you've been working your butts off...

64
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:14,775
excuse me... and you're all
as itchy as a dog at a flea circus.

65
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:17,841
[Chortles]
First of all, there's mail.

66
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,547
- [All Cheering]
- Yea! What's mail?

67
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:26,060
<i>That oughta cheer you up.</i>
<i>And after supper in the Mess Tent,</i>
<i>I've got a treat for everybody...</i>

68
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:28,322
something you're all
gonna love to see.

69
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,864
- Gypsy Rose Lee!
- Doing a fan dance.

70
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:35,335
<i>It's my kind of entertainment,</i>
<i>my all-time favorite movie.</i>

71
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:40,136
I'm saving the title till show time,
after chow in the Mess Tent.

72
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,233
So bye-bye
and buy bonds.

73
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,108
- <i>I shouldn't have said that.</i>
- <i>[Radar] Take your finger off the button.</i>

74
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,375
- <i>[Potter] What?</i>
- <i>[Radar] They can hear what you're saying.</i>

75
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,714
Maybe I'd better handle this. [Clears Throat]
Colonel Potter is now finished...

76
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,049
with his message
to the 4077.

77
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:56,454
- See, sir, if you don't take your finger off...
- I know. I just forgot.

78
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:07,467
- Hey, Beej, you got a pen?
- Why? Somebody mail you a pig?

79
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,993
- I need something to write with.
- Here. Try this. But I think it's out of ink.

80
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:15,475
- Very cute. Hey, Frank, lend me your pen.
- No, thank you, pal.

81
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,670
- What do you mean, no?
- N-O, no.

82
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:21,147
- <i>Why not?</i>
- You'll ruin it. The point's
used to the way I write.

83
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:24,743
- It's used to stupid?
- Oh, stuff it in your Valpak.

84
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,379
- Hey, Hawk, guess what Peg sent me.
- A pony?

85
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:31,482
No. A Dutch apple crumb pie.
It's delicious. Try some.

86
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:35,427
- Mmm-mmm. This is really crummy.
- Yeah, I know.

87
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:38,625
- I mean, it's awful.
- What? You gotta be kidding.

88
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,464
Would a dying man kid?
[Simulates Retching]

89
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:43,834
Geez. Frank, let me have
some of that shoe polish.

90
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:46,499
- <i>[Frank] What for?</i>
- I want to get this rotten taste
out of my mouth.

91
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:49,668
- You have no taste.
- I did before I had that pie.

92
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:52,212
- All right. I'll eat it all myself.
- I'll be one of your pallbearers.

93
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,477
[Mock Laughing] Just don't bury me
in that shirt you brought me from Seoul.

94
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,418
You're knocking my gift?
I picked that shirt out myself.

95
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:02,012
- No wonder it's irregular.
- What do you mean?

96
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,490
I mean one sleeve
is longer than the other.

97
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:09,121
- No, no, no, no, no. That's not true.
- [Grunts]

98
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:13,031
- <i>Wear it yourself.</i>
- I will. I'm gonna put on this lovely shirt...

99
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,035
and go visit the nurses in it.

100
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:18,800
- There.
- [Laughs Hysterically]

101
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:24,973
Perfect. Nothing wrong
with this shirt.

102
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,708
Creep.

103
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,442
- <i>[Able] Who is it?</i>
- Quasimodo.

104
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,646
- <i>[Laughing] What do you want?</i>
- I'm here to ring your bells.

105
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:36,247
- Come in.
- Ladies.

106
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:39,782
- [All] Hi.
- On behalf of the officers
and gentlemen of the 4077 th...

107
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:44,821
and myself, I invite you to dinner and a movie
in what is accurately called the Mess Tent.

108
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,527
- Please R.S.V.P. In this ear.
- No.

109
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:50,230
- This ear does not accept no for an answer.
- Well, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:52,899
- That's the only answer this mouth has.
- Where are you going?

111
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:56,967
We've been invited to dinner at "l" Corps.
Wine, tablecloths, silverware.

112
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:59,673
- Pilots.
- What does a pilot have that I haven't got?

113
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:03,445
- A plane.
- Why settle for a plane
when you can have a fancy?

114
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:07,545
We're tired of this place,
and we're tired of the same people.
We wanna see somebody fresh.

115
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:10,887
- I've always been fresh with you.
- Not tonight.

116
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,086
- What if I got on my hands and knees?
- No.

117
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,186
- What if I got on your hands and knees?
- Not a chance.

118
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:19,097
Well, I'm not gonna ask again.
A man has to have some dignity.

119
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,003
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Yes?

120
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,198
- <i>It's me. Frank.</i>
- Oh, what do you want? I'm busy.

121
00:07:25,273 --> 00:07:28,538
- <i>I wanted to talk to you.</i>
- Oh, all right.

122
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,703
- <i>Well, I was wondering</i>...
- Frank, you can come in.

123
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,940
- <i>I can?</i>
- Yes.

124
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:36,108
- <i>Really?</i>
- Oh, will you get in here?

125
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:41,947
Place looks just the same.
You know, you look lovely in this light.

126
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:44,992
The war's been very kind
to you, Margaret.

127
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:47,323
- Is that it?
- No!

128
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:50,296
I want you to sit with me
at the movie tonight. Just as a friend.

129
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,731
- Just as a friend, I accept.
- You see?

130
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:55,463
Even though you're engaged,
we can still be civil to each other.

131
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:58,131
- You're right.
- And after the movie, I can walk you back here.

132
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:01,471
- That'd be nice.
- If it isn't too late, we can
play war games like we used to.

133
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,611
- Frank.
- It was such fun, Margaret!

134
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,582
You'd hide under the covers and pretend it
was a tent, and I'd be a bomb and drop on you.

135
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:13,610
<i>Frank, you bombed out!</i>
<i>You lost!</i>

136
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,316
And Donald Penobscott won.

137
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:21,055
[High-Pitched Laugh]

- We all know that.

especially rutabaga, lima beans and liver.
