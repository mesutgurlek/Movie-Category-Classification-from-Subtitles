1
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:47,243
Some people hear their own
inner voices...

2
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:49,051
with great clearness...

3
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:52,354
and they live
by what they hear.

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,521
Such people become crazy...

5
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,861
or they become legends.

6
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,004
Tristan Ludlow was born
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves.

7
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,603
It was a terrible winter.

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,674
His mother almost died
bringing him into this world.

9
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:25,390
His father, the Colonel,
brought him to me.

10
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,625
I wrapped him in a bearskin
and held him all that night.

11
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,068
As he grew into a man...

12
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,572
I taught him the great joy
of the kill...

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,404
when the hunter
cuts out its warm heart

14
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,468
and holds it in his hands...

15
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:47,514
setting its spirit free.

16
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:52,075
Colonel Ludlow had three sons...

17
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,714
but Tristan was his favorite.

18
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,815
I had had sons too.

19
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,628
But they were gone now...

20
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,129
forever.

21
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,593
It was a very bad time.

22
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,036
The Colonel had tried
to help the People...

23
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,742
but it was no use.

24
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:20,474
So he decided
to go his own way.

25
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:27,081
He wanted to lose the madness
over the mountains, he said...

26
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,248
and begin again.

27
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,833
"Lose the madness, "he said.

28
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,699
And so we lived for many years...

29
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,965
and the boys grew strong.

30
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:57,646
Alfred was the older brother...

31
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,744
old even for his years.

32
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:04,291
Samuel was the youngest.

33
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:07,691
There was nothing these brothers
would not do for him.

34
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:10,196
They watched over him
like a treasure.

35
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,399
One year--

36
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:17,131
I am an old man
and cannot remember the year.

37
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:20,197
But it was the Moon
of the Red Grass...

38
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:22,970
when Isabel Ludlow,
their mother...

39
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:25,205
went away for the winter.

40
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:29,238
She said the winters
were too cruel for her.

41
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:32,150
She said she was afraid
of the bears.

42
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:35,618
She was a strange woman anyway.

43
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:53,304
That spring, though,
she did not return.

44
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:59,471
And, after that,
she did not come much to see us.

45
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:03,684
Alfred wrote her many letters...

46
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:07,187
but Tristan refused
to speak of her.

47
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:10,588
His world was here with me.

48
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:18,089
Every warrior hopes a good death
will find him...

49
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,191
but Tristan couldn't wait.

50
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,528
He went looking for his.

51
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,643
Tristan!

52
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,152
Here.

53
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,392
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:51,983
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir.

55
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,549
- Can you breathe?
- Yes.

56
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:55,721
Move your hand.
Take it away.

57
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,494
You're a stupid,
half-brained jackass.

58
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,129
- Yes, sir.
- One Stab put you up to this?

59
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,103
You deserve to be dead.

60
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:10,268
God knows how you've
lived so long.

61
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:12,278
It'll be all right, son.

62
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,159
I have these letters...

63
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:37,227
many letters.

64
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:39,705
Read them.

65
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,708
They are from all of them.

66
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:44,508
Ludlow...

67
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,307
Isabel...

68
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,245
Samuel...

69
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:49,977
the whole family...

70
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:52,815
the whole story.

71
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:55,981
It is all written here.

72
00:06:57,258 --> 00:07:00,386
April 13, 1913.

73
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,258
Dear Isabel:

74
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,289
I am not fool enough to try
to reorder a life already lived...

75
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:10,804
but I fear I have not done well raising
our sons alone in this wild place.

76
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,341
What did I know of children?

77
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:17,002
I was trained to lead men.

78
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:19,308
This is infinitely harder.

79
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,814
Dear William:

80
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:25,613
You take too much responsibility
on yourself, as always.

81
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:28,314
Our sons are finding their own paths.

82
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,654
They are willful, certainly,
but then...

83
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:34,889
who are you and I
to complain of willfulness?

84
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:37,396
As for Samuel,
I have big news.

85
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:39,399
At a Harvard tea
for Amy Lowell...

86
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:43,369
he met and instantly loved
Miss Susannah Finncannon.

87
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:46,235
I know it will
surprise you greatly...

88
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:49,071
but they are engaged.

89
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:52,806
He will bring her to Montana
this summer to meet his brothers...

90
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,313
and you.

91
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:57,146
So, William,
please behave yourself...

92
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:01,245
and be as charming
as only you can be.

93
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:05,925
There he is.

94
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,490
- How the hell are you?
- Good. And you?

95
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:17,861
- Samuel. Good to see you, boy.
- Father, how are you?

96
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:19,428
- Good to see you.
- Hello.

97
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:27,103
This is my fiancee, Susannah.

98
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:29,479
- Hello.
- Miss Finncannon.

99
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:33,951
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

100
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:37,650
- This is Alfred.
- How do you do?

101
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:42,695
- Here's youog, miss.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:45,596
- It's a horse.
- That's a strange-looking animal.

103
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,658
This is Finn.
He's a champion.

104
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,830
You like ex otic-looking dogs then,
Miss Finncannon?

105
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,771
Very much, Mr. Ludlow.

106
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,772
- Please call me Susannah.
- All right.

107
00:08:57,845 --> 00:09:00,336
- He's just plain old Alfred.
- Shut up.

108
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:05,742
- Where's Tristan?
- He's off somewhere. You know him.

109
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,312
He'll welcome you home tonight
or I'll know the reason why.

110
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,854
Miss Finncannon, please.
Did you have a good journey?

111
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,331
She is such a lovely creature.

112
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,337
But I fear the loss
of her parents...

113
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:28,171
has given her
a certain fragility.

114
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:31,177
I think she feels very alone
in the world.

115
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:35,679
But she has found a new family now,
hasn't she?

116
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:38,650
The German military is ready
to use chaos in Croatia...

117
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:42,849
to justify actions that could plunge
the entire civilized world into--

118
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:46,825
The word " civilized" has no place
in discussing the affairs of this world.

119
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:52,032
Mother told us of your sympathy
for the social reformers.

120
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,927
You make it sound like a disease.

121
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,698
No, I'm in agreement.

122
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:01,332
You mother told me all about One Stab.
She says he was a great warrior.

123
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,841
Yes.

124
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,401
He has a bag of scalps
to prove it.

125
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,639
But don't worry.

126
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,650
He's devoted to Father now.

127
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:12,447
Rather, they're devoted
to each other.

128
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,215
Can he speak English?

129
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:16,722
Stab, speak English?

130
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,226
He wouldn't lower himself
to speak English.

131
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:25,098
But watch out because
he understands it perfectly well.

132
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,868
There's Tristan.

133
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,951
- Don't they feed you?
- Not much.

134
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,794
- You smell.
- Miss me, did you?

135
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,802
- Still hung over?
- Still drunk.

136
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,609
Isn't she amazing?

137
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,542
So this is Tristan.

138
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,806
And does he speak English?

139
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,486
For God's sake.

140
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:36,492
Miss Finncannon,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

141
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,334
I hope you and Ugly here...

142
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,203
find every happiness together.

143
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:50,282
Don't mind my brother. Your dog
has more breeding than he has.

144
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,039
This is Mother's room.

145
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,543
It's lovely.

146
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,443
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Pet.
- And you, miss.

147
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:24,950
Thank you.

148
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,025
- Which one?
- It's this one.

149
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:43,936
Angelica Susannah.

150
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,967
Hello.

151
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,701
You must be Isabel Two.

152
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,675
I've already met your mother
and father.

153
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:30,178
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

154
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,516
When I was 1 3,
I was sent away...

155
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,582
to boarding school.

156
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:41,993
I hated it.

157
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,493
May I help you?

158
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:50,993
You're marrying Samuel.

159
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,698
That's right, I am.

160
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,741
I'm marrying Tristan.

161
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,178
We'll be sisters.

162
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,048
I see you two have met.

163
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:05,847
Isabel Two is letting me help.

164
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:09,822
Would you like a rest?
You must be exhausted.

165
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,358
No, not at all.
This is so refreshing...

166
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:16,362
all this grandeur,
this unexpected...

167
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,694
gift from God.

168
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:23,066
It doesn't seem like much of a gift
in a hard winter, I assure you.

169
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:25,563
Where's Samuel?

170
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,938
Inside. I could tell your father
wanted him all to himself.

171
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:33,943
- You're very generous.
- No, just happy.

172
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,144
Stop mooning over her
and come in here.

173
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,917
Samuel wants to know
about the calves from Cheyenne.

174
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:45,458
Get in here.

175
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,654
Please excuse my father.

176
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,565
It makes him feel young and powerful
to treat us like we're idiot children.

177
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:04,273
For all His countless blessings,
may God's holy name be praised. Amen.

178
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:10,848
Tell Father what you were saying
about Vienna.

179
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:13,079
- What's that?
- It's the Kaiser.

180
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:16,846
He won't stop them
from annihilating Serbia.

181
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:18,949
Let's not talk about war, please.

182
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:23,192
Susannah hears
that England's mobilizing.

183
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:25,959
We're stuck out here
while all this is going on.

184
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:29,764
- Thank God.
- You wouldn't want us to evade a duty.

185
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:32,806
- Wouldn't I ?
- Father, with respect--

186
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:36,270
Please excuse me
for being late.

187
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:39,369
I packed so carefully,
I couldn't find anything.

188
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,547
Thank you.

189
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:53,322
Would you like some--

190
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:03,459
As evening fell
a maiden stood

191
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:07,098
At the edge of a wood

192
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,541
In her hands lay the reins

193
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:13,842
Of a stallion

194
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,506
And n'er I'd seen

195
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:17,482
A girl as fair

196
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:20,782
Heard a gentler voice anywhere

197
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,583
Whispered, alas

198
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:24,214
She belonged

199
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,851
Belonged to another

200
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:30,419
Another, forever

201
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,663
Yes, she belonged to

202
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:37,101
The twilight and mist

203
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,065
Dear Isabel:

204
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:46,010
How strange to have a cultivated woman
in the house again...

205
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,240
and how intoxicating.

206
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:51,773
To have all three of my sons
under my roof again...

207
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:55,185
fills me with such a deep,
quiet satisfaction...

208
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,519
that I thank God.

209
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,477
There's a friend of yours.

210
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:03,322
A dollar says
he brings her back.

211
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:51,600
Whoa.

212
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,867
Easy.

213
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:18,662
You got it.

214
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:33,177
Nice work.

215
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,607
You all look
like ice cream cones.

216
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,877
I know you would have.

217
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:43,821
Ready. Here we go.

218
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,296
Go easy on him, Susannah.

219
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,166
Alfred, you take over.

220
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,830
I must talk to Tristan.

221
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,306
You've disgraced the Colonel's name.

222
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:07,335
- Nice shiner.
- I hit her back.

223
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:16,721
She's got me spinning.

224
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,451
I'll bet.

225
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:22,393
She's got these ideas
and theories, and she's so--

226
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,998
What?

227
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:30,867
Nothing.
How'd you break the mare?

228
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:33,905
She's what?

229
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:39,338
She's sort of passionate.

230
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,573
- She a virgin?
- Good Lord, Tristan.

231
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:43,707
- You brought it up.
- Of course she is.

232
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,411
Are you?

233
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:53,155
- Yes, I am.
- Going to wait till you're married?

234
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,361
See, she says--

235
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,455
Susannah thinks that--

236
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,859
We won't wait.

237
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:07,930
And you're afraid
you won't meet her expectations?

238
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,838
I guess I am.

239
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:14,711
Sort of. I don't know.
Should I be?

240
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:16,976
Samuel, God bless you.

241
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,951
You are good
at everything you try.

242
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,715
I'm sure it will be the same
with fucking.

243
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,653
Tristan, really.

244
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:26,556
- She's my future wife.
- You're not going to fuck her?

245
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:32,155
I'm planning to be with her.

246
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:33,927
I recommend fucking.

247
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,128
- You're impossible.
- You brought it up.

248
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,545
My point!

249
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,638
Good morning,
Colonel Ludlow.

250
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,301
Tristan's hunting.
He didn't do it.

251
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,038
You don't have to worry
about Tristan.

252
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:22,946
Meet John T. and James O' Banion.
They own the mer cantile store.

253
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:27,510
- Morning, James, John T., Sheriff.
- Morning, Alfred.

254
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:32,286
We're looking for a man we heard
might be in this part of the country.

255
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,123
Name is Tom Cullen.
Here's a likeness.

256
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,998
What did he do?

257
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,658
Do you recognize him?

258
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,130
- Yeah, I recognize him.
- We got him.

259
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:48,299
This fellow passed by here...

260
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,468
maybe four or five years ago.

261
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:54,377
Did some work here
on his way to San Francisco.

262
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:56,608
He hoped to book passage
to Australia.

263
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:00,248
Or Hong Kong.
I can't remember.

264
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,754
- Can you remember?
- Hong Kong.

265
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:10,056
- What is he wanted for?
- He--

266
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,223
That would be
of a private nature.

267
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,962
" Private nature" ?
You hold a public office, Sheriff.

268
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,829
Gentlemen.

269
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,576
"There came a low hiss,
a horrid sound...

270
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:37,384
that made Rikki Tikki Tavi
jump back two clear feet.

271
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,391
And then out of the grass...

272
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,394
rose up the head
and spread hood of Nag...

273
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,453
the big black cobra."

274
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:46,123
I can read another story.

275
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:49,100
The Germans broke through
at Armentieres.

276
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:52,730
The British are trapped
in the Belgian lowlands.

277
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,707
- This paper is a week old!
- Calm down.

278
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,743
With my fluent German,
I could become an officer.

279
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,405
And lead other boys to the slaughter
and be slaughtered yourself.

280
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,539
The men who served under you
worshipped you.

281
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,378
They were all damn fools.

282
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,783
This is a turning point
in history.

283
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:08,286
- How can we--
- What?

284
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:10,220
How can we not
be part of this?

285
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,088
- You taught us--
- To think for yourselves.

286
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,957
- And to defend what's ours.
- Yes, what is ours!

287
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:18,497
We've already lost two cousins.

288
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:22,057
Don't talk at me as though
I've never seen a war!

289
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:27,338
Not a war like this.

290
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:32,003
They said that about the war
of secession and the Indian wars.

291
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:35,275
They say it to sell newspapers.

292
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,613
These are not the Indian wars.
We're fighting against naked aggression!

293
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,415
There will be no more talk of wars
in this house! Damn it!

294
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,124
I'm sorry, Susannah.

295
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:51,830
I'm going to Canada to enlist.

296
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,028
I'm going with him.

297
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,476
I'm sorry, my love.

298
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,577
I meant to tell you tonight.

299
00:25:14,654 --> 00:25:17,987
I know you'll understand.
It's the only honorable thing to do.

300
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:31,469
What's that?

301
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,972
It's a book my father wrote...

302
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:39,734
to try to convince the government
to alter their policies...

303
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:42,043
towards the Indians
in the Dakotas.

304
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:47,546
Samuel won't change his mind.

305
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,053
Change it for him.

306
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:00,432
What happened between them?

307
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:04,202
Father says
she never liked it here.

308
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,934
I think they loved mostly the idea
of each other.

309
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,554
Don't let him go.

310
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:28,561
I'll take care of him.

311
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:32,222
October 14, 1914.

312
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,055
My dear Isabel:

313
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:36,595
Today our sons are leaving home...

314
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:40,258
to defend an England
they have never seen.

315
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:43,131
I am unable to stop them.

316
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:53,877
I have tried to shelter our sons
from all the madness...

317
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:57,007
and now they go to seek it.

318
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:51,102
Be careful.

319
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:16,152
You don't have to go.

320
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,544
Good-bye.

321
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,475
Don't worry, Father.

322
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,983
Take care.

323
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,116
I'll bring you
the Kaiser's helmet.

324
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,164
Bring yourself back.
That would please me more.

325
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,233
Yes, sir.

326
00:30:46,986 --> 00:30:49,079
- Take care of Samuel.
- I will.

327
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,277
Colonel Ludlow told me:

328
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:51,248
"Ride with them to Calgary.

329
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:54,047
Bring back the horses. "

330
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,782
"Damn fools, "he called them.

331
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:02,624
The Colonel
would not have his sons...

332
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:05,823
ride off to war
on old nags...

333
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:08,458
damn fools or not.

334
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:27,218
Let's join them.

335
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:30,221
Bring your plate.

336
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:35,726
He'll be back.

337
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:39,060
May we join you?
Sit down.

338
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:42,396
Feeling lonely in there.

339
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:43,901
Sit here.

340
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:48,106
What's her name, Two?

341
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,234
Lady. Tristan's Lady.

342
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,177
In the story,
Tristan's lady was Isolde.

343
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:57,011
- Do you know who Isolde was?
- No.

344
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:01,954
Your daughter needs an education.

345
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:07,084
She can read and write, Colonel.
School might be awkward for her.

346
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,788
- I'll teach her myself.
- May I help?

347
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:15,266
Yeah. I'll teach her
history and mathematics.

348
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:20,033
With your permission, Decker,
and yours, Pet.

349
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:21,334
What do you think?

350
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:30,144
What will she do
with all this education?

351
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:33,344
She'll live a richer,
fuller life, of course.

352
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,613
She's a half-breed.

353
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,452
Not in this house.

354
00:33:38,524 --> 00:33:41,857
- Tristan calls me a half-breed.
- He does?

355
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:44,362
He says I'm half gopher
and half hawk.

356
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,736
- After her chores.
- Yeah.

357
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:56,741
- To us all.
- To you, sir.

358
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,778
- And you, miss.
- And to the boys.

359
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,500
Get back to your unit.

360
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:32,669
Those boys are boring.

361
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,975
I'd rather have you
watching my back.

362
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:41,352
Go, mate.

363
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:05,209
February 3, 1915.

364
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:07,870
Dear Susannah:

365
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:10,711
The horror of this place
is indescribable.

366
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:15,481
Nothing is
as I thought it would be.

367
00:35:15,554 --> 00:35:18,546
Keep your distance!
Keep your spacing!

368
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:21,787
Tonight, as I prayed for the souls
of those who died so terribly...

369
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,556
yet so bravely...

370
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:26,621
I admit that I also prayed
for personal glory.

371
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:30,294
Is that wrong to want
to distinguish myself gloriously...

372
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,599
in combat as my father did?

373
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,664
Tristan and Alfred
watch over me so carefully...

374
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:37,470
I may never get the opportunity.

375
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,712
Charge!

376
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:04,495
Goddamn it!

377
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:07,505
- Where are you hit?
- It's just a scratch.

378
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:14,543
Susannah, I see now...

379
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:18,071
not that my father was right,
but that I was naive.

380
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,142
- Let me up, damn it!
- Stay down!

381
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,848
Fall back!

382
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:26,084
Still, we place our bodies
in God's keeping.

383
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:28,592
We go into battle honorably...

384
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:30,185
full of confidence...

385
00:36:30,262 --> 00:36:32,093
with His name on our lips.

386
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:34,655
- We're pinned here.
- We'll wait.

387
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:51,476
- Give him a hand.
- Help him down.

388
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,172
Goddamn.

389
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:35,023
Susannah:
I try to guard against despair...

390
00:37:35,094 --> 00:37:39,963
but there are moments when it seems
that all human decency is broken down.

391
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:42,193
Alfred will recover
from his wounds...

392
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:45,863
but he and Tristan seem
to have drifted apart, or worse.

393
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:48,532
I cannot understand it.

394
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:50,871
I miss you more
than you can imagine.

395
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:55,603
You are all that is clean
and cool and pure.

396
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,543
I close my eyes
and think of you.

397
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:04,385
I now regret that we listened
to everyone and waited to marry.

398
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:07,391
Even more, I regret that I left
before we could be together...

399
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,552
as we planned, my beloved.

400
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,861
Please stay on at the ranch
and wait for me.

401
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:17,232
Don't let Father worry.

402
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,870
I know God's mercy
will protect me...

403
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,532
aided considerably
by Tristan...

404
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:24,906
who seems to be in France
less to fight the Germans...

405
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:27,070
than to act
as my nursemaid.

406
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:31,643
Be well, my love.

407
00:38:31,717 --> 00:38:33,742
Your own, Samuel.

408
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:38,218
Captain needs me to translate
this before tonight's reconnaissance.

409
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,191
- Alfred will want to see you.
- I'll be there.

410
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,319
- Yeah?
- Go on.

411
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:07,944
Where's Samuel?

412
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,113
He's translating.
He'll be here.

413
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:12,453
Boy, that's a good one.

414
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,992
- Vino?
- Put that away.

415
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:23,130
- They said you'll get a medal.
- Yes.

416
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:26,797
- They're sending me home.
- I'm glad for you.

417
00:39:26,872 --> 00:39:29,102
I'm an officer.
I belong with my men.

418
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:30,539
Horseshit.

419
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,305
What's left of them.

420
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:36,314
MacKenzie was just brought in.
His leg's turned bad.

421
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:38,584
- He said--
- What?

422
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,608
- He said--
- What?

423
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,376
What is it?

424
00:39:42,454 --> 00:39:46,117
He said your brother volunteered
to take his place...

425
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:48,159
on the reconnaissance
with the captain.

426
00:39:48,227 --> 00:39:51,390
Goddamn it!
I told you to stay with him!

427
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,631
- I'm here!
- Where? I can't see.

428
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,300
I can't move!

429
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:55,173
I'm coming!

430
00:43:20,606 --> 00:43:22,972
I got you now.

431
00:43:24,943 --> 00:43:27,207
You're doing good.

432
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:30,047
We're going home.

433
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:05,414
God, no!

434
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:51,624
Goddamn you, God!

435
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:01,417
Tristan, it's me.

436
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,426
March 20, 1915.

437
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:12,936
Dear Father and Susannah:

438
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:17,600
I am being discharged from the Army,
but I cannot come home yet.

439
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:20,270
I will ask Grandfather Ludlow
in Cornwall...

440
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:22,575
to let me join him at sea.

441
00:47:24,082 --> 00:47:26,778
As for our beloved Samuel...

442
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:29,320
all I can send home
is his heart.

443
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,322
Alfred will bring it back.

444
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,623
He should be buried
up in the box canyon...

445
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:38,959
where he used
to draw the birds.

446
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,932
Your son, Tristan.

447
00:47:59,551 --> 00:47:59,918
He certainly was the best
of all of us, wasn't he?

448
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,649
He certainly was the best
of all of us, wasn't he?

449
00:48:09,861 --> 00:48:11,294
Good night.

450
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:29,569
What you saw
before Samuel left--

451
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,509
Please, don't--

452
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:35,519
No, I want to.

453
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:43,720
It is Samuel I loved.

454
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:48,156
All right.

455
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:56,169
Tristan will be back someday.

456
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:01,601
Your father will be pleased.

457
00:49:08,286 --> 00:49:12,382
Susannah was to return to Boston
on the morning train...

458
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:14,891
but a norther blew
for three days...

459
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,053
and drifted over the tracks.

460
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:22,566
The Colonel insisted
she stay on until spring.

461
00:49:23,635 --> 00:49:27,298
The house was too empty,
he said.

462
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:30,899
This was still her home,
he told her.

463
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:36,413
He should have let her go.

464
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:40,281
But how could he have known
what would happen?

465
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:47,886
She was not to blame.

466
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:51,759
She was like the water
that freezes in the rock...

467
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,094
and splits it apart.

468
00:49:55,834 --> 00:50:00,271
It was no more her fault
than it is the fault of the water...

469
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:02,966
when the rock shatters.

470
00:50:13,852 --> 00:50:15,786
You know how much I --

471
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:19,156
You know how much
I loved Samuel.

472
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,854
And I think you know--

473
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:35,468
Out of respect for him,
I wanted to say it here.

474
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,304
I think you know that...

475
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,713
I'm in love with you.

476
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:48,318
From the first moment
I saw you...

477
00:50:48,386 --> 00:50:50,479
like in a novel.

478
00:50:56,728 --> 00:51:02,257
That's my mother's overblown
romantic imagination coming out in me.

479
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:13,000
You're not making this
very easy for me.

480
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:15,940
Sorry.

481
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:21,275
Is there any hope
that you could learn to love me?

482
00:51:23,688 --> 00:51:26,020
Not the way you love Samuel,
of course...

483
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:30,027
but enough to--

484
00:51:33,832 --> 00:51:36,027
We could make a life together.

485
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:38,701
A happy life.

486
00:51:43,441 --> 00:51:45,136
I don't think so.

487
00:51:49,614 --> 00:51:53,345
Sounds like you're not sure, though.
Maybe there's a chance?

488
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:04,554
- What?
- I can only cause you pain, Alfred.

489
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:09,525
Why not let me
be the judge of that?

490
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:22,245
I didn't break it,
but I can fix it.

491
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:25,749
I can put the damn wheel back on
and take it off myself.

492
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:27,751
Go take a nap.

493
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:42,492
- What?
- Look!

494
00:53:28,713 --> 00:53:30,977
I'm going into town if--

495
00:54:13,992 --> 00:54:15,926
Welcome home, son.

496
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:32,761
I couldn't save him.

497
00:55:32,837 --> 00:55:35,271
Of course you couldn't.

498
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:48,117
It's all right.

499
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:19,649
Have a nice ride today?

500
00:56:31,729 --> 00:56:33,663
Excuse me, Father.

501
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,344
Tristan, please.

502
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:05,747
When are you planning
to be married?

503
00:58:05,823 --> 00:58:07,586
Good morning.

504
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:14,487
Damn you.

505
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:16,965
You will marry her.

506
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,096
- Make an honest woman of her?
- Yes!

507
00:58:23,341 --> 00:58:25,332
God damn you to hell.

508
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:29,669
Yes, I will marry her,
if she'll have me.

509
00:58:29,747 --> 00:58:31,738
If she'll have you?

510
00:58:35,853 --> 00:58:37,787
Do you love her?

511
00:58:40,024 --> 00:58:43,152
Or did you seduce her
just to spite me?

512
00:58:43,227 --> 00:58:44,819
That's not what I did.

513
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,329
- What about Samuel?
- What?

514
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,095
You tell me about Samuel.

515
00:58:51,169 --> 00:58:54,229
We all loved Samuel.
Samuel is dead.

516
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:55,932
How convenient for you.

517
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:00,600
Because you love her,
I will forgive you for that.

518
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:03,841
Once. You say that again,
and we're not brothers.

519
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:15,859
You know you can't make her happy.

520
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,827
I'm gonna try.

521
00:59:20,398 --> 00:59:21,990
You will fail.

522
00:59:36,414 --> 00:59:38,348
I'll be leaving today.

523
00:59:49,093 --> 00:59:51,288
I wish you both all the best.

524
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,072
- Good-bye, son.
- Wish me luck.

525
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,573
Good luck.

526
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:35,063
September 7, 1915.

527
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:37,073
Dearest Mother:

528
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:41,737
I think I may have found
my place in this world.

529
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:46,249
Helena is a city
turned modern overnight...

530
01:00:46,317 --> 01:00:49,286
bursting with all the energy
and vitality...

531
01:00:49,353 --> 01:00:51,412
of our times.

532
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:53,787
I feel alive here.

533
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,963
There is much opportunity
for anyone...

534
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,095
who dedicates himself
to his labors.

535
01:01:07,171 --> 01:01:11,369
Already, I have acquired a reputation
for honesty and fair dealing...

536
01:01:11,442 --> 01:01:16,812
and I am pleased to call some of
Helena's most influential citizens...

537
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,940
my friends.

538
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:23,112
They are determined to see
this city grow, as am I.

539
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:25,553
We're proud of you.

540
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:31,128
Mother, thank you
for your kind letter.

541
01:01:31,195 --> 01:01:32,719
You knew my hopes.

542
01:01:32,797 --> 01:01:37,461
That you understand my disappointment
is a great comfort to me.

543
01:01:39,036 --> 01:01:42,802
Every night I pray for the grace
to forgive Tristan.

544
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,808
I know you understand.

545
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:48,310
Your loving son, Alfred.

546
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:45,803
Quit it!

547
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,361
Quit it!

548
01:03:03,621 --> 01:03:05,054
Goddamn it!

549
01:03:41,992 --> 01:03:45,985
If we have a boy,
I'd like to call him Samuel.

550
01:03:47,331 --> 01:03:50,095
And if it's a girl, Isabel.

551
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:55,934
I'll still love you.

552
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:59,601
You'll tolerate me
because of how much I love you.

553
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:15,124
Nothing.

554
01:04:28,606 --> 01:04:31,473
I heard from your mother.

555
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:35,638
She says Alfred has hooked up
with those damn O' Banion brothers.

556
01:04:35,713 --> 01:04:41,515
- He's doing well.
- Alfred will do well wherever he is.

557
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:45,146
- Except here with us.
- That's my fault.

558
01:04:45,222 --> 01:04:48,919
- I didn't say that.
- Couldn't save Samuel either, could I ?

559
01:04:48,993 --> 01:04:52,087
Don't you dare say that.
That was in God's hands.

560
01:04:54,231 --> 01:04:55,721
Was it?

561
01:04:57,902 --> 01:05:01,668
Colonel! Lost a couple calves
near Camas Canyon.

562
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:04,071
- Might be a grizzly.
- My grizzly?

563
01:05:19,757 --> 01:05:22,851
- You take him, Tristan.
- Damn right I will.

564
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:47,139
I don't know why Tristan
did not kill that damn old bear.

565
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:49,551
The Old Ones say:

566
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,645
"When a man and an animal...

567
01:05:51,722 --> 01:05:53,815
have spilled each other's blood...

568
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:56,223
they become one. "

569
01:05:57,761 --> 01:06:00,491
I said four beers,
Mr. Sachtleben.

570
01:06:00,564 --> 01:06:02,555
And I said no Indians.

571
01:06:05,402 --> 01:06:09,395
- He's quite civilized, I assure you.
- Yeah?

572
01:06:09,473 --> 01:06:11,407
- Give him a beer.
- Stay out of it.

573
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:14,069
- My father said four.
- He heard me.

574
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,112
We're about to reach an understanding.

575
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,410
Just give him a goddamn beer!

576
01:06:18,482 --> 01:06:21,246
Stay out of it!

577
01:06:21,318 --> 01:06:24,253
Damn you.
You're a damn fool.

578
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:27,017
You're spoiling for a fight
with a man who outweighs you.

579
01:06:27,091 --> 01:06:30,424
As we speak, he's sear ching
for some kind of a weapon.

580
01:06:30,494 --> 01:06:32,018
Isn't that right?

581
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:35,429
To split your stupid skull
and kill you and good riddance.

582
01:06:35,499 --> 01:06:36,932
Leave it!

583
01:06:38,002 --> 01:06:41,438
- Yes, sir?
- I want four beers, now.

584
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:47,675
The lousy owner says
he doesn't want to serve Indians.

585
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:53,578
Get back.

586
01:06:54,785 --> 01:06:56,946
Do you see this man?

587
01:06:57,021 --> 01:07:01,287
Do you?
His name is One Stab.

588
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:05,385
He's a venerated Cree elder and has
counted coup on hundreds of his enemies.

589
01:07:05,462 --> 01:07:08,454
He's our friend.
He's thirsty.

590
01:07:35,392 --> 01:07:40,830
I think it was the bear's voice
he heard deep inside him...

591
01:07:40,898 --> 01:07:44,800
growling low
of dark, secret places.

592
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,775
Were you going to say good-bye?

593
01:09:44,188 --> 01:09:45,849
How long will you be gone?

594
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:49,992
Not long.
A few months.

595
01:09:55,866 --> 01:09:58,460
I can make it better for you.

596
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:06,634
If we'd had a child...

597
01:10:10,547 --> 01:10:13,345
or if I were pregnant,
would you still go?

598
01:10:16,386 --> 01:10:17,819
Yes.

599
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:22,826
Just give me a chance.

600
01:10:22,893 --> 01:10:24,326
Don't do that.

601
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,035
Look at me.

602
01:10:37,908 --> 01:10:40,172
Please, look at me.

603
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,024
I'll wait for you.

604
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,694
However long it takes.

605
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,463
I'll wait for you forever.

606
01:11:25,956 --> 01:11:28,390
Will he come back?

607
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,891
I don't know.

608
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,098
Stab says yes.

609
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:21,943
April 20, 1918.

610
01:12:22,012 --> 01:12:23,946
Dear Tristan:

611
01:12:24,014 --> 01:12:27,108
It has been months now,
and still no word.

612
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:30,782
The only sign
that you are alive...

613
01:12:30,854 --> 01:12:35,621
is a tattered parcel that arrived today
from New Guinea...

614
01:12:35,692 --> 01:12:37,284
covered with strange writing...

615
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:40,956
and containing what appears to be
a native bracelet.

616
01:12:42,332 --> 01:12:44,800
Meant for me, I presume.

617
01:12:44,868 --> 01:12:46,802
But perhaps not.

618
01:12:48,272 --> 01:12:51,799
Do you still care to know
what is happening here?

619
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:54,639
Cattle prices continue to fall...

620
01:12:54,711 --> 01:12:56,975
and winter seems never ending.

621
01:13:00,617 --> 01:13:02,551
Why don't you write?

622
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:07,317
Are you afraid to tell me
you're never coming back?

623
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:14,020
Alfred continues to do well.

624
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:19,801
His business has expanded to include
financial concerns in Chicago...

625
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:21,303
and Washington.

626
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:23,305
I don't pretend to understand.

627
01:13:23,373 --> 01:13:26,536
He wants us to send Isabel Two
to boarding school in Chicago...

628
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,170
but she adamantly refuses
to leave the ranch.

629
01:13:29,246 --> 01:13:32,010
I think she, too,
is waiting for you.

630
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:36,313
I have nowhere
to send this letter...

631
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:40,522
and no reason to believe
you wish to receive it.

632
01:13:47,931 --> 01:13:50,024
I write it only for myself.

633
01:13:51,935 --> 01:13:56,429
I will hide it away with all the things
left unsaid and undone...

634
01:13:56,506 --> 01:13:58,440
between us.

635
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:09,078
December 1 2, 1 9 1 9.

636
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:11,120
Dear Susannah:

637
01:14:12,289 --> 01:14:14,985
I have become a hunter.

638
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:24,293
Tell Stab there are creatures here
that cannot even be found in books.

639
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:30,531
I have killed them all.

640
01:14:51,828 --> 01:14:54,422
All we had is dead.

641
01:14:54,498 --> 01:14:56,090
As I am dead.

642
01:14:57,434 --> 01:14:59,163
Marry another.

643
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:17,115
Colonel, it looks like
we've got company.

644
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:41,139
- I have come to ask for your blessing.
- My blessing?

645
01:15:41,211 --> 01:15:43,543
You see, these gentlemen and--

646
01:15:43,613 --> 01:15:46,480
And a great many others,
I might add.

647
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:49,644
They're urging me
to run for office.

648
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:52,244
- What office?
- The United States Congress.

649
01:15:52,322 --> 01:15:54,722
That's how highly
we think of your son.

650
01:16:02,499 --> 01:16:05,593
And what do you gentlemen
hope to get out of this?

651
01:16:08,572 --> 01:16:10,335
I beg your pardon?

652
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:13,843
I've spoken plain English, sir.
What do you want for yourselves?

653
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:17,607
Father, I don't think
that these gentlemen--

654
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:20,707
Did you ask that question
or do you believe these gentlemen...

655
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:24,015
would back you out of patriotic duty
and your inestimable worth?

656
01:16:24,087 --> 01:16:27,113
You forget yourself, Father.
I am no longer a child.

657
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:29,283
Colonel, the Congress--

658
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,556
Congress is government, sir.
I worked for the government once.

659
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,062
The issues that we--

660
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:38,431
Indians! Indians were
the issue in those days.

661
01:16:39,936 --> 01:16:42,029
There is nothing as grotesque...

662
01:16:42,105 --> 01:16:44,699
as the meeting of a child
with a bullet...

663
01:16:44,774 --> 01:16:47,607
or an entire village slaughtered
while sleeping.

664
01:16:47,677 --> 01:16:50,805
That was the government's resolution
of that particular issue.

665
01:16:50,881 --> 01:16:54,248
I've seen nothing since then
to persuade me it's gained...

666
01:16:54,317 --> 01:16:56,785
in wisdom, common sense
or humanity.

667
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:04,788
Gentlemen, my father, for whom
I have the deepest respect...

668
01:17:04,861 --> 01:17:10,060
says that the government
has neither wisdom nor humanity.

669
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:14,502
I will then consider it
my absolute duty as my father's son...

670
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:19,804
to bring both wisdom and humanity
to the United States Congress.

671
01:17:21,878 --> 01:17:25,575
I thank you for your blessing.
Gentlemen.

672
01:17:39,329 --> 01:17:43,265
- Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars.
- Yes. Certainly.

673
01:17:57,347 --> 01:18:00,248
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

674
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:23,298
I don't know what to say.
Tristan's always been wild.

675
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:28,708
- You love him for that.
- Do I ?

676
01:18:32,215 --> 01:18:34,183
I suppose I do.

677
01:18:36,019 --> 01:18:37,680
He does love you.

678
01:18:43,493 --> 01:18:45,393
She's to be your brother's wife.

679
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:53,335
Yes, though you better
remind him of that fact.

680
01:18:53,403 --> 01:18:54,995
He's not here
to defend himself.

681
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:59,508
No, but I see you are here
to defend him and what is his...

682
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:03,842
even though
he's abandoned her and you.

683
01:19:03,913 --> 01:19:06,780
I won't even speak
of who else he abandoned.

684
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:08,511
Damn you, boy.

685
01:19:08,585 --> 01:19:11,782
Don't you blame my son
for Samuel's death!

686
01:19:11,855 --> 01:19:14,824
Samuel chose to be a soldier,
and soldiers die...

687
01:19:14,891 --> 01:19:16,950
sent to their slaughter
by men in government.

688
01:19:17,027 --> 01:19:18,858
Parasites like you!

689
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:20,725
Damn and blast you!

690
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,630
Damn you.
And damn you too!

691
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,362
Shut your mouth.
Leave her out of this!

692
01:19:26,436 --> 01:19:28,563
Get out of my house
and get off my land.

693
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:32,301
Why? Because I want
to serve my country as you did?

694
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:35,538
Or because, like you,
I love a woman who doesn't love me?

695
01:19:36,613 --> 01:19:40,413
He used her and deserted her,
your darling Tristan.

696
01:19:40,483 --> 01:19:42,178
Alfred, don't. Please.

697
01:19:42,252 --> 01:19:44,049
I loved her!

698
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:47,980
I love her still.

699
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:54,424
He stole her from me.
If you want to know the truth...

700
01:19:54,497 --> 01:19:57,864
he stole her from Samuel
before the war.

701
01:19:57,934 --> 01:19:59,993
God help me, I'll kill you.

702
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:06,271
Here.
Read your darling Tristan's letter.

703
01:20:13,516 --> 01:20:14,983
You deserve to be happy.

704
01:20:44,514 --> 01:20:48,109
Late that night we found
the Colonel on the floor...

705
01:20:48,184 --> 01:20:51,119
beside a cold fire.

706
01:20:51,187 --> 01:20:52,950
He could not move.

707
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:57,285
His hair turned white overnight...

708
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,794
and he became an old man.

709
01:21:01,197 --> 01:21:05,293
And after that,
Tristan sent no more letters.

710
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:09,134
As the years passed by...

711
01:21:09,205 --> 01:21:12,299
we would hear that someone
had seen him on a ship...

712
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:16,311
going up some river
no white man had gone up before.

713
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:20,315
Stories came to us.

714
01:21:20,383 --> 01:21:22,874
Strange stories.

715
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,383
And then, for years,
there was nothing.

716
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:34,826
He was lost to us.

717
01:21:34,898 --> 01:21:37,492
That was all we knew.

718
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:41,333
But every year,
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves...

719
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:47,001
I would dream that the bear's voice
inside him had grown silent...

720
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:50,739
and that Tristan might again
come to live in the world.

721
01:21:51,815 --> 01:21:53,840
But then the winter would come.

722
01:21:54,918 --> 01:21:56,852
And then another spring.

723
01:21:57,921 --> 01:22:01,015
And still he stayed away.

724
01:22:30,954 --> 01:22:32,785
What the hell is he doing?

725
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,944
She's a mean old bitch,
but she's yours.

726
01:23:39,355 --> 01:23:40,788
Welcome home.

727
01:23:48,865 --> 01:23:51,356
Old man!
Where's Father?

728
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:19,394
He had a stroke some years ago.

729
01:24:19,462 --> 01:24:21,657
He can't talk now.

730
01:24:26,903 --> 01:24:28,495
Hello, Father.

731
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,884
He wants to celebrate.

732
01:25:07,777 --> 01:25:09,210
I'm happy too.

733
01:25:40,143 --> 01:25:42,168
Father, this is for you.

734
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:50,813
" Colonel William Ludlow,
from his son Tristan."

735
01:25:51,988 --> 01:25:53,853
I didn't know.

736
01:25:56,693 --> 01:26:00,595
These are boars' tusks,
made by a Javanese warrior.

737
01:26:00,663 --> 01:26:02,756
He, too, was a great man.

738
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:25,348
I have other things for Mother
and Little lzzy and Susannah.

739
01:26:30,793 --> 01:26:32,226
What is it?

740
01:26:42,538 --> 01:26:44,301
Alfred and Miss Susannah...

741
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:46,967
were married several years ago.

742
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:52,477
Your brother's a congressman now.

743
01:26:54,217 --> 01:26:56,651
They have a big, new place
in Helena.

744
01:27:01,724 --> 01:27:04,318
It's as it should be.

745
01:27:04,393 --> 01:27:07,658
Cattle prices dropped
after the war ended.

746
01:27:09,232 --> 01:27:12,133
The Colonel don't seem to care.

747
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:14,192
He lost nearly everything he had.

748
01:27:16,205 --> 01:27:17,695
We'll make it back...

749
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:21,676
on horses or something else
if we have to.

750
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,218
He's saying that your brother
voted for the Volstead Act.

751
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:33,744
Did he? You suggesting
I become a bootlegger?

752
01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:37,520
Good money in bootlegging,
if you know what you're doing.

753
01:27:37,593 --> 01:27:39,220
Screw the government.

754
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:41,229
Screw them.

755
01:28:43,159 --> 01:28:45,627
Forever turned out
to be too long.

756
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:49,130
I know.

757
01:29:00,009 --> 01:29:01,874
Here.

758
01:29:01,944 --> 01:29:04,310
I don't want it.

759
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,286
They told me
that this was magic...

760
01:29:15,358 --> 01:29:19,294
that whoever wore it
would be protected.

761
01:29:26,969 --> 01:29:28,402
Keep it.

762
01:29:48,057 --> 01:29:50,582
Don't you want to see Alfred?

763
01:29:52,228 --> 01:29:54,856
It's probably better
that I don't.

764
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:01,832
Tell him hello...

765
01:30:01,904 --> 01:30:04,566
and congratulations.

766
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,813
He likes you.

767
01:30:49,552 --> 01:30:50,985
Welcome home.

768
01:30:52,955 --> 01:30:54,388
Isabel?

769
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,655
I want you to have him.

770
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:03,564
I have something for you too.

771
01:31:03,632 --> 01:31:05,566
I brought it back.

772
01:31:06,635 --> 01:31:09,069
It's from lerapetra.

773
01:31:09,138 --> 01:31:11,038
- That's in--
- Crete.

774
01:31:11,107 --> 01:31:13,234
- Yeah.
- I know where it is.

775
01:31:13,309 --> 01:31:16,244
Your father taught me
European history.

776
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:21,609
A little girl.
That's me, right?

777
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,481
Thank you.

778
01:31:52,515 --> 01:31:55,382
Okay, we'll see you
in a few days.

779
01:31:58,354 --> 01:32:00,288
Don't wait on me.
I'll be fine.

780
01:32:01,857 --> 01:32:05,953
It was then that Tristan came
into the quiet heart...

781
01:32:06,028 --> 01:32:08,121
of his life.

782
01:32:08,197 --> 01:32:11,792
The bear inside him was sleeping.

783
01:32:14,036 --> 01:32:16,971
It is hard to tell
of happiness.

784
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:20,634
Time goes by...

785
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:23,473
and we feel safe too soon.

786
01:32:24,847 --> 01:32:27,816
- I heard the oddest news.
- Yes?

787
01:32:27,883 --> 01:32:29,316
Yes.

788
01:32:30,386 --> 01:32:32,980
Tristan...

789
01:32:33,055 --> 01:32:34,488
is back.

790
01:32:36,725 --> 01:32:38,659
Yes, I know.

791
01:32:40,396 --> 01:32:41,829
You know?

792
01:32:43,065 --> 01:32:44,999
How do you know?

793
01:32:49,004 --> 01:32:50,437
I saw him.

794
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:56,875
He had the audacity
to come here just to see you?

795
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:59,676
He wanted to see you,
but thought you'd get upset.

796
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,250
He might be right.

797
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,694
What did he--

798
01:33:13,762 --> 01:33:15,525
What did he say?

799
01:33:15,598 --> 01:33:17,031
He said to say hello...

800
01:33:18,267 --> 01:33:20,132
and congratulations.

801
01:33:24,273 --> 01:33:26,002
Silly me.

802
01:33:27,776 --> 01:33:30,210
He told you the news?

803
01:33:31,447 --> 01:33:33,779
What do you think?

804
01:33:36,352 --> 01:33:39,378
Come on.
It's perfectly absurd.

805
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:42,586
Marrying Isabel Two.

806
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:46,890
God, she's practically our sister.

807
01:33:48,631 --> 01:33:51,566
She can't be more than,
what, 19?

808
01:33:52,635 --> 01:33:54,102
Twenty.

809
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:57,503
I can't imagine what the hell
Decker is thinking of...

810
01:33:57,573 --> 01:33:59,973
to allow this.

811
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:03,569
Perhaps he's thinking
of his daughter's happiness.

812
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:10,516
Happiness?
With Tristan?

813
01:34:11,887 --> 01:34:15,914
You, of all people,
should know how impossible that is.

814
01:34:15,991 --> 01:34:18,425
I'm not Isabel Two.

815
01:34:28,504 --> 01:34:30,597
June 2, 1921.

816
01:34:30,673 --> 01:34:32,106
Dear Tristan:

817
01:34:32,174 --> 01:34:35,769
I was so pleased to hear
of your coming marriage.

818
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,409
Your father must be very happy.

819
01:34:40,482 --> 01:34:42,780
Isabel Two is like
a daughter to him...

820
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,455
as she was named
after your own mother.

821
01:34:47,523 --> 01:34:51,459
It seems as though it was always
meant to be, doesn't it?

822
01:34:57,366 --> 01:34:58,890
Damnation.

823
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:31,225
Samuel Decker Ludlow.

824
01:36:39,468 --> 01:36:41,402
Dearest Tristan:

825
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:46,904
Alfred and I were delighted
to hear of your son's birth.

826
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:50,911
We hoped for a child of our own,
but of that I despair.

827
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:54,244
I know Alfred thinks of you often.

828
01:36:54,316 --> 01:36:57,752
I look forward to the day when we
all might see one another again.

829
01:37:01,824 --> 01:37:04,588
Your son bears a proud
and noble name.

830
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:06,423
I know he will live up to it.

831
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:13,597
Please give my love
to Isabel Two...

832
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:16,263
and to your father
and everyone else.

833
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:18,966
Yours always, Susannah.

834
01:37:30,185 --> 01:37:32,779
Evening, gentlemen.

835
01:37:32,855 --> 01:37:35,722
Been meaning to talk to you
about one or two things.

836
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:37,224
By all means.

837
01:37:37,292 --> 01:37:39,760
As you know perfectly well...

838
01:37:39,828 --> 01:37:41,762
we handle the liquor around here.

839
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:45,891
Now, you've been
a small-time operator.

840
01:37:45,968 --> 01:37:47,959
An amateur, frankly.

841
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:51,972
Lately, your shipments
have been getting a little fat...

842
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,474
and my patience
has been getting a little thin.

843
01:37:54,543 --> 01:37:58,479
So the next time
you get in our way...

844
01:37:58,547 --> 01:37:59,980
will be the last time.

845
01:38:01,216 --> 01:38:04,117
Excuse me.
I appreciate it.

846
01:38:04,186 --> 01:38:07,019
Perhaps you're wondering
why you're not dead already.

847
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:10,820
Because your brother
is Congressman Ludlow.

848
01:38:10,893 --> 01:38:13,157
And that's it.
That's all.

849
01:38:19,735 --> 01:38:21,327
Kenneth. Thomas.

850
01:38:48,096 --> 01:38:49,757
Can't you just say hello?

851
01:39:03,612 --> 01:39:07,480
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Tristan.

852
01:39:16,225 --> 01:39:18,625
- Who's this young man?
- This is Samuel.

853
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:27,726
She's beautiful.

854
01:39:33,742 --> 01:39:35,175
Let me see.

855
01:39:43,485 --> 01:39:47,945
- Who is this lady?
- I'm your Aunt Susannah.

856
01:39:50,993 --> 01:39:54,759
I used to know your Uncle Samuel
who died in the war.

857
01:39:58,867 --> 01:40:02,132
- You look like him.
- That's what Grandpa says.

858
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:08,468
He was very brave and very good.

859
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:10,273
Grandpa says that too.

860
01:40:10,345 --> 01:40:14,042
Grandpa says I can have
Uncle Samuel's gun when I'm bigger.

861
01:40:14,116 --> 01:40:16,050
Would you come and see it?

862
01:40:22,357 --> 01:40:24,882
I'd love to.

863
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,393
Sometime.

864
01:40:29,031 --> 01:40:32,660
- He's a fine boy.
- He is.

865
01:40:34,536 --> 01:40:39,303
- Is Father well?
- As well as can be expected.

866
01:40:44,379 --> 01:40:46,904
- I wish--
- Pardon the intrusion.

867
01:40:48,717 --> 01:40:52,153
Excuse me.
We're ready for your speech now.

868
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,017
I'll be there in a minute.

869
01:40:54,089 --> 01:40:55,522
Thank you.

870
01:41:10,405 --> 01:41:13,670
- We'll meet again soon?
- I'd like that.

871
01:41:45,407 --> 01:41:46,840
What's this?

872
01:41:54,216 --> 01:41:56,150
Go and get Tynert.

873
01:42:00,689 --> 01:42:03,055
I think you missed a bump, Stab.

874
01:42:21,810 --> 01:42:23,072
Jesus!

875
01:42:23,145 --> 01:42:25,909
Sir, we have information
that you're transporting goods...

876
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:27,915
in violation
of the Volstead Act.

877
01:42:27,983 --> 01:42:30,850
If you mean a case of I rish whiskey
for my father, I am.

878
01:42:30,919 --> 01:42:32,511
Give it up.

879
01:42:33,588 --> 01:42:35,055
He'll be disappointed.

880
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:09,419
Hold him down.

881
01:43:10,692 --> 01:43:12,489
Let's get out of here.

882
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:15,792
- There's an envelope in his pocket.
- Now.

883
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:26,533
My brother told you
to stay out of our way.

884
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,476
Put him in the car.

885
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:15,144
- I don't want to see him.
- Father--

886
01:45:37,339 --> 01:45:38,806
I'm so very sorry.

887
01:45:46,014 --> 01:45:48,778
Father won't see me, even now?

888
01:45:50,352 --> 01:45:54,083
He blames the government
for Isabel's--

889
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:03,963
There's something
we have to talk about.

890
01:46:05,867 --> 01:46:09,496
The officer you beat
almost died.

891
01:46:10,805 --> 01:46:12,739
Now, everyone understands...

892
01:46:14,876 --> 01:46:17,811
but you'll have to plead guilty...

893
01:46:17,879 --> 01:46:19,312
serve 30 days.

894
01:46:19,381 --> 01:46:22,077
And the one who shot his gun?

895
01:46:24,552 --> 01:46:26,486
He was...

896
01:46:27,722 --> 01:46:29,189
reprimanded.

897
01:46:30,258 --> 01:46:34,092
- The O' Banions?
- Nothing.

898
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:36,925
You have to let it go.

899
01:46:36,998 --> 01:46:41,094
It was a terrible, tragic accident.

900
01:46:41,169 --> 01:46:43,831
Listen to me.

901
01:46:43,905 --> 01:46:46,669
You let this go now.

902
01:46:46,741 --> 01:46:49,175
You got in over your head.

903
01:46:53,748 --> 01:46:55,545
I'll need a minute.

904
01:47:37,325 --> 01:47:39,259
I'm so sorry.

905
01:47:41,463 --> 01:47:43,454
We all loved her.

906
01:47:46,735 --> 01:47:48,168
How are you?

907
01:47:49,938 --> 01:47:51,371
I'm fine.

908
01:47:59,314 --> 01:48:01,145
We never get to see you.

909
01:48:06,988 --> 01:48:09,923
I gave a speech the other day.

910
01:48:09,991 --> 01:48:12,255
- You did?
- Yes.

911
01:48:12,327 --> 01:48:14,921
My first public engagement.

912
01:48:23,338 --> 01:48:27,672
It was on the responsibilities
of women in--

913
01:48:34,349 --> 01:48:36,283
It's good to see you.

914
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:04,473
I'm sorry.

915
01:49:13,388 --> 01:49:16,186
I still sometimes dream...

916
01:49:16,257 --> 01:49:18,521
that I'm the mother
of your children.

917
01:49:29,237 --> 01:49:30,727
I wanted her to die.

918
01:49:33,908 --> 01:49:36,877
Maybe I even wanted Samuel to die.

919
01:49:43,585 --> 01:49:46,850
You had nothing to do
with Samuel's death.

920
01:49:46,921 --> 01:49:49,287
And you had nothing to do
with Isabel's death.

921
01:49:51,593 --> 01:49:53,026
Didn't I ?

922
01:49:55,263 --> 01:49:56,696
Go home.

923
01:49:59,868 --> 01:50:02,200
Go home to Alfred.

924
01:50:28,963 --> 01:50:30,396
Where were you?

925
01:50:32,133 --> 01:50:34,397
I just went out for a walk.

926
01:50:34,469 --> 01:50:38,405
I needed a walk.
What are you doing home?

927
01:50:38,473 --> 01:50:41,237
Your doctor rang,
said you missed your appointment.

928
01:50:41,309 --> 01:50:43,800
I called home.
You weren't here. I --

929
01:50:44,879 --> 01:50:46,904
I feel very tired.

930
01:50:48,316 --> 01:50:50,079
I'm going to bed.

931
01:56:58,686 --> 01:57:02,782
You have won her.
I am bringing her home.

932
01:57:02,857 --> 01:57:04,688
Alfred.

933
01:57:41,062 --> 01:57:43,155
I followed all the rules:

934
01:57:45,399 --> 01:57:47,663
man's and God's.

935
01:57:49,570 --> 01:57:51,162
And you--

936
01:57:53,074 --> 01:57:54,507
You followed none.

937
01:58:00,581 --> 01:58:03,015
And they all loved you more.

938
01:58:07,088 --> 01:58:09,852
Samuel, Father...

939
01:58:14,095 --> 01:58:17,690
and even my own wife.

940
01:58:29,276 --> 01:58:32,609
I'd like a moment
alone with her.

941
01:59:16,824 --> 01:59:18,416
When Samuel died--

942
01:59:23,664 --> 01:59:26,428
When Samuel died, I cursed God.

943
01:59:36,744 --> 01:59:40,009
Did I damn everybody around me
as well as myself?

944
01:59:43,684 --> 01:59:48,621
You are not damned.

945
01:59:48,689 --> 01:59:51,624
I won't allow that.

946
01:59:52,693 --> 01:59:55,355
You're not damned!

947
02:00:39,073 --> 02:00:41,507
Samuel,
this is a gentleman's gun.

948
02:00:41,575 --> 02:00:43,873
It's smaller,
but it's just as powerful.

949
02:00:43,944 --> 02:00:47,471
That's what you want
when you grow up, isn't it? A gun.

950
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:51,718
Samuel, come here!

951
02:00:57,792 --> 02:01:02,957
Run along now. Go with Pet.
Get him in the house.

952
02:01:06,667 --> 02:01:08,726
He's a fine boy.

953
02:01:14,441 --> 02:01:16,705
You know we're not here
to arrest you.

954
02:01:33,694 --> 02:01:36,288
You take me to the woods
so my boy won't see.

955
02:01:37,398 --> 02:01:38,922
I don't want my boy to see.

956
02:01:41,135 --> 02:01:42,693
Let's get on with it.

957
02:01:45,539 --> 02:01:47,734
- Father.
- Colonel Ludlow, sir.

958
02:01:48,776 --> 02:01:50,641
What's going on here?

959
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:53,946
What's going on here?

960
02:04:13,087 --> 02:04:17,114
You don't have to be a genius to know
they'll come after you for this.

961
02:04:18,292 --> 02:04:19,725
Yeah.

962
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,433
Yeah?

963
02:04:30,971 --> 02:04:34,372
I want to ask you
to watch over my children.

964
02:04:37,644 --> 02:04:39,578
Watch over Samuel.

965
02:04:48,422 --> 02:04:50,447
Brother, it would be an honor.

966
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:17,446
How much I wanted
to take scalps...

967
02:05:17,518 --> 02:05:19,782
but it was not my kill.

968
02:05:35,702 --> 02:05:38,796
That night,
we buried the bodies...

969
02:05:38,872 --> 02:05:43,809
and dumped the car in a deep pool
in the upper Missouri.

970
02:05:43,877 --> 02:05:46,971
I remember when he was a boy...

971
02:05:47,047 --> 02:05:51,643
I thought Tristan would never live
to be an old man.

972
02:05:51,718 --> 02:05:54,653
I was wrong about that.

973
02:05:54,721 --> 02:05:58,487
I was wrong about many things.

974
02:05:58,559 --> 02:06:02,655
It was those who loved him most
who died young.

975
02:06:03,897 --> 02:06:07,833
He was a rock
they broke themselves against...

976
02:06:07,901 --> 02:06:10,836
however much
he tried to protect them.

977
02:06:12,306 --> 02:06:15,002
But he had his honor...

978
02:06:15,075 --> 02:06:17,339
and a long life...

979
02:06:17,411 --> 02:06:20,175
and he saw his children grow...

980
02:06:20,247 --> 02:06:22,841
and raise their own families.

981
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:29,856
Tristan died in 1963...

982
02:06:29,923 --> 02:06:33,359
in the Moon of the Popping Trees.

983
02:06:33,427 --> 02:06:36,692
He was last seen
up in the north country...

984
02:06:36,763 --> 02:06:40,028
where the hunting was still good.

985
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:42,694
His grave is unmarked...

986
02:06:42,769 --> 02:06:45,704
but it does not matter.

987
02:06:45,772 --> 02:06:49,367
He had always lived
in the borderland anyway:

988
02:06:49,443 --> 02:06:53,209
somewhere between this world
and the other.

989
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:34,412
It was a good death.
