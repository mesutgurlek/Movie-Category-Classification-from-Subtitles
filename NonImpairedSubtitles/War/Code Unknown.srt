1
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,003
Alone?

2
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,968
Hiding place?

3
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,764
Gangster?

4
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,642
Bad conscience?

5
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,085
Sad?

6
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:01,811
Imprisoned?

7
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:10,441
CODE UNKNOWN

8
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:14,961
Incomplete tales of several journeys...

9
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,002
Anne!

10
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:32,570
Jean? Hi...
What are you doing here?

11
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:33,603
Where's Georges?

12
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,087
Away.
Went 3 weeks ago.

13
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:36,248
Where to?

14
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:37,681
Kosovo.

15
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:41,252
Why? Has something happened?

16
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,327
What's your problem?

17
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,284
What's going on? What's wrong?

18
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:48,446
I'm not going back.

19
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:51,562
Why, if you don't mind me asking?

20
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,567
Look, I'm in a hurry.
Tell me what's wrong as we walk.

21
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,242
When's Georges back?

22
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:01,206
No idea.
You know what your brother's like.

23
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,927
Is it so urgent?

24
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:04,852
How did you get to Paris?

25
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:07,962
On the 1st train.
I've been here an hour.

26
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:08,970
What?

27
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,051
Your fucking door code's changed!

28
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:13,324
Why didn't you call me?

29
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,490
I got the answer-phone.

30
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,089
Sorry.

31
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:22,933
I need a place.

32
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:25,805
- Sorry?
- Here in Paris.

33
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:28,485
- How come?
- I fucked off.

34
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:31,210
You did?

35
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,607
I can't stand him.

36
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:38,970
Is that all?

37
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,527
He's doing up the old barn.

38
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:44,169
So? Hold on,
you must be hungry, too.

39
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:12,011
In the bath, I can't hear the phone.

40
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:13,046
What?

41
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:14,371
Forget it.

42
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,411
Aren't you hungry?

43
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,932
Now where were we?
Oh yes, what's your Dad up to?

44
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,168
He's renovating the barn.

45
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,412
So?

46
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,213
To live in when I take over.

47
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,405
So?

48
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:36,491
- So, I'm not staying.
- Really?

49
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,690
Why not?
Wasn't your dream to run the farm?

50
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:42,365
No, never. That was his dream.

51
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,492
Okay.

52
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:48,217
This isn't really the time or place.

53
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,528
I'll get Georges to call, okay?

54
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:51,965
I'm not going back.

55
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:56,326
You should know by now
you must do what your father says.

56
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:59,490
Later, you can make
your own mind up.

57
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:00,846
I already have.

58
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:05,046
We'll talk it through later,
now is not the time.

59
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:08,530
The show opened last night,
I got to bed at 4.30...

60
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:11,377
I just have time
to glance at our press...

61
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:15,376
...and in precisely 48 minutes,
I have an important meeting.

62
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,853
Go easy now on my poor little soul.

63
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,655
Here, take the keys.
The code is 48B13.

64
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:26,533
If you're tired,
you can stretch out on the couch.

65
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,012
I'll be back by 12.

66
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:31,092
Let's be clear:
you've seen my place...

67
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:32,890
...there's not room for 3.

68
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:34,053
Got that?

69
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,652
Remember the code?

70
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:39,409
See you later.

71
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,815
If anyone calls,
let the answer-phone get it.

72
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,010
What's with you?

73
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,010
Was that a good thing to do?

74
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,257
What?

75
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,098
Do you feel that was right?

76
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:07,816
Fuck you.

77
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,656
You stupid or what?

78
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,820
You're going to say sorry
to the lady.

79
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,777
Fuck you.

80
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:17,015
Let go of me!

81
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,658
Who the hell are you? Let go!

82
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:21,774
Now, say sorry.

83
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:27,691
Didn't you hear me? Say sorry!

84
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:35,255
Let go, you fuck!

85
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:37,932
It's beyond belief!
What's going on?

86
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:40,772
Clear off out of here! Hooligans!

87
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:42,092
Unbelievable!

88
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,975
Hold on, I can explain.

89
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:45,852
Don't go.

90
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:48,452
This young man humiliated the lady.

91
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,936
Just let go of me!

92
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:53,897
Let go of him! Are you mad?

93
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:56,659
Why are you picking on him?

94
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,177
Is it your problem?

95
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:02,815
Who asked your opinion?

96
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:05,332
Do you know what he did
at least?

97
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,731
Ask before you leap in.

98
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:10,934
- What's going on?
- He hit me.

99
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:12,098
- Typical...
- What?

100
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:13,338
He hit me!

101
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,141
Maybe you could tell her why?

102
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:18,699
Do you mind telling me
what's going on?

103
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,941
I don't see why I should...

104
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:26,733
But everyone seems interested,
so I'll tell you.

105
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,614
The lady... Wait there, please.

106
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,417
And you stay here!

107
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,503
Don't go sneaking off.

108
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,615
Get the fuck out of my way!

109
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,176
Let him go, for God's sake!

110
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,739
Stop... Calm down, Jean!

111
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:47,580
Break it up!

112
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:49,664
What's going on here?

113
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,064
What's he done?

114
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:54,823
They put on quite a show.

115
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,463
Wait, I can explain.

116
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,064
That's a smart idea.

117
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,893
I'll tell you
if you give me the chance.

118
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,663
This boy, this young man...

119
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:12,177
...humiliated a woman begging
outside the bakery...

120
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:13,500
What woman?

121
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:15,821
The one with the yellow bag.

122
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:17,661
Victor...

123
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,497
He threw a scrunched up bag...

124
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:27,942
Come here.

125
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:36,906
...sitting there,
putting off customers.

126
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,465
We're not inhumane, but...

127
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,344
- Thank you.
- Can we go?

128
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:43,379
You can come
and make a statement if you wish.

129
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:46,259
- Who'll look after...
- Can I have my ID?

130
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,420
ID!

131
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,339
Can I have my ID back, too?

132
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,981
I doubt it. What do you think?

133
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:57,266
Come along to the station first.
Understand?

134
00:10:58,227 --> 00:10:59,501
Understand?

135
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:01,896
Good...

136
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:04,176
Take his details.

137
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:07,105
Please, this way.

138
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:14,220
I've done nothing wrong.
I'm coming of my own free will.

139
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:15,542
Don't make trouble.

140
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,100
You don't need to touch me.

141
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,420
I'll come, no problem.

142
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:22,540
If you don't comply,
I'll put the cuffs on. Okay?

143
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,817
Come on.

144
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:35,457
...In the vaulted cellar
of a badly damaged oil press.

145
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,506
Our group includes
Mark Henderson of Newsweek...

146
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:43,139
...myself and a dozen KLA fighters.

147
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,508
Originally,
we were aiming for Drenica...

148
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,703
...to meet up
with an even smaller group...

149
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:52,662
...but our plans changed.

150
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,548
I tried writing often...

151
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:58,178
...but gave up.

152
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,462
I didn't know what to say.

153
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,543
Outside, it's very quiet.

154
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,300
The firing stopped hours ago.

155
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:09,023
Waiting is the worst.

156
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,420
Antoine's 5 on May 11.

157
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:15,545
I hope to be back in Paris by then.

158
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:18,343
Eve promised
I'd have him for the day.

159
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:22,547
"Break a leg" for your play.

160
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,627
Chin up, it'll be crap.

161
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,666
You won't get this in time,
but you'll be great.

162
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,948
Sorry for my behavior
on our last day.

163
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,229
If you see Jean-Pierre...

164
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,346
Yes?

165
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,865
What?

166
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,339
I don't have time, I have a fare.

167
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,305
When?

168
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,145
What did he do?

169
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,788
How many cops came?

170
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:00,623
They took him away again?

171
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:06,703
Call Aystan and Meyssa,
I'm on my way.

172
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,341
Can you slow down, please?

173
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:20,505
Sorry, sir, I'm in a big hurry.

174
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:22,943
It's very important.

175
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,904
I don't want to end up in hospital
because of you.

176
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:29,988
Are you deaf?
I said, slow down.

177
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,784
Sorry.

178
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:34,345
What the...

179
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:39,428
I'm sorry.
I'll drop you at the taxi stand.

180
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:42,626
I don't believe this!

181
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:50,147
Sir, there's a taxi right there.

182
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,471
I'm very sorry.
There's absolutely no charge.

183
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:00,742
What a nerve!

184
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:13,150
Rokia?
Put your mother on.

185
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:19,346
You can leave that there.
Just dump it on the chair.

186
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,742
Leave your script there, too.
You know it, I hope?

187
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:25,102
Of course.

188
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,702
Great.
So we can go without a net.

189
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:32,473
We'll take it from
just after he locks her in.

190
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,346
The camera is the door.

191
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:37,269
You can play it straight at us.

192
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,272
Luc, ready to roll?

193
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:41,703
I'm ready.

194
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:44,986
Should I read his part?

195
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,513
That'd be good.

196
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:57,388
You hear him lock the door.
You go to make sure.

197
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,152
The door is indeed locked.

198
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,349
It's locked,
you will never get out.

199
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:09,664
Sorry?

200
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:12,633
You will never get out.

201
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,953
What do you mean?

202
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,345
I mean you will die here.

203
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,667
Is this a joke?

204
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:27,669
Not for me.

205
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,867
For you neither, I'm afraid.

206
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,155
Look at the ceiling.

207
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,392
Do you see the light fitting?

208
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:56,433
It's an inlet for gas lighting.

209
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:01,788
See now why I asked
if you had a lighter?

210
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:05,797
You could use it to blow us both up.

211
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,434
Okay, what do you want?

212
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:11,153
Nothing.

213
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:14,273
I have nothing against you.
Nothing at all.

214
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,310
I like you.

215
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:19,472
You just fell into my trap.

216
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:23,035
What do you mean,
I fell into your trap?

217
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:25,548
It means you're going to die.

218
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,869
I merely want to watch you die.

219
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,637
Please, stop now.

220
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:44,030
You've had your fun.
Now, let's forget all about it, okay?

221
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:47,514
I'm expected home.
I have no time for games.

222
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,948
Neither have I. Believe me.

223
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:54,474
Can you hear a whistling noise?

224
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:57,311
From the ceiling.

225
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,269
Soon, you'll be able to smell it.

226
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,108
Stop...

227
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,037
Stop, please.

228
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,029
Let me out! Please!

229
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,109
You're wasting our time.

230
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,191
What do I have to do?

231
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,230
Show me your true face.

232
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,109
What?

233
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,632
Your true face.

234
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,478
What do you mean?

235
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,559
What do you want?

236
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,115
I want to see your true face.

237
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,312
Not your lies nor your tricks.
A true expression.

238
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,431
What do I have to do?

239
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,433
Be spontaneous.

240
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,278
React to what's happening.

241
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,309
How?

242
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:17,831
Hello.

243
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:34,961
Beets. That's all there is.

244
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,084
...They turned the apartment
upside down.

245
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,850
We had a house full.
Everyone saw it.

246
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,403
The shame of it.

247
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,885
And your son?

248
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,888
He's a good boy.
He's never done any harm.

249
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,446
He's the eldest. He helps a lot.
He's a good boy.

250
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,004
I know...

251
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:25,008
They beat and shamed him.

252
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,084
May Allah punish them.

253
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:28,966
He did nothing wrong.

254
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,685
They had no choice
but to let him go.

255
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:34,162
They had nothing on him.

256
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:38,205
I don't know
who brought this upon him.

257
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:43,967
I cooked f. Y.
and took it to the homeless...

258
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,969
...but all my sacrifices are in vain.

259
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:48,804
I have no power.

260
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:51,167
You must protect him.

261
00:23:58,212 --> 00:23:59,770
Do you have anything of his?

262
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:44,647
We must never forget
where we come from and who we are.

263
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:46,650
We are not sons of slaves.

264
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:52,762
Your son is a proud, honest boy.
His heart is pure.

265
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:57,487
But he sees a lot of whites,
as you know.

266
00:24:58,894 --> 00:25:01,886
Someone disapproves
and wants him to return.

267
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,686
Return where?

268
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:05,049
Home.

269
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,573
To the land of his ancestors.

270
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:12,653
That's ridiculous.
Who could possibly want that?

271
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,167
I have no idea.

272
00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:25,854
It's the same one
who bewitched Salimata...

273
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:27,568
...and made her mute.

274
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,005
What have we done to him?

275
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:33,087
Salimata's illness is different...

276
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:38,407
...While Lica and M.Rioara
delivered the calf...

277
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:41,687
Uncle Nelu gave instructions
on his mobile from Rome:

278
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:44,967
when to pull, how to cut the cord...

279
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,688
...rub the calf with straw...

280
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:50,046
It was their first time, you see?

281
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:52,971
Mobile phones are wonderful.

282
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:55,211
M.rioara's cousin, Georghe, has one.

283
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:58,168
He says that in some places...

284
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,446
...you can call without paying...

285
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:01,884
...because...

286
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:04,564
...there's some kind of trick, see?

287
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:06,455
I wouldn't know.

288
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:09,412
You've never used a mobile?

289
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,206
Only when someone lent me one.

290
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:15,053
But when you called home?

291
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:19,324
- Granny!
- Yes?

292
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,766
When you used to call home?

293
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,568
I used a public call box.

294
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:26,051
Nicu, go see where he is.

295
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:10,653
Maria!

296
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:45,015
...Cost half
what Vasile brought back.

297
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,537
There must have been 350-400 people
at the funeral.

298
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:51,064
From Cluj even.

299
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,381
He was an important man.

300
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,621
And they're self-important.

301
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:58,862
You'd rather they chuck
the old man in a hole?

302
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,783
What if we did that to you?

303
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,100
It's true, Mama!

304
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:04,375
You must respect people's labor.

305
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:06,894
You don't work for people to gossip.

306
00:31:07,105 --> 00:31:09,858
Same for Dumitru.
But Papa keeps harping on.

307
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:13,854
Do Nuta and Nicu
like their father being abroad?

308
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,215
Not to mention me!

309
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:17,576
But you don't stop jabbering.

310
00:31:18,466 --> 00:31:19,899
True enough.

311
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:23,544
Quiet now
so Mama can look round in peace.

312
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:26,062
Nicu, give me that chocolate.

313
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,860
That's your third bar.
Give it to me!

314
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:30,215
How many were there?

315
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:32,098
I don't remember. He's okay.

316
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:33,261
Give me that!

317
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:36,774
It's beautiful.

318
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,494
Very good.

319
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:51,540
Where did the couch come from?

320
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:54,625
Ciocan gave it to Dumitru
for helping out...

321
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,545
when he was home.

322
00:31:58,347 --> 00:31:59,541
Lovely.

323
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:04,020
- Do you like it?
- Sure, it's fine.

324
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:07,057
Shame there's no chairs with it.

325
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:09,223
She has delusions of grandeur...

326
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,021
...but who knows
if she'll need all that.

327
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:13,455
Don't listen to him.

328
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:17,896
Sorin's parents said
they'd be better in his house...

329
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:20,986
...since ours won't be ready
for the wedding.

330
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,656
Of course,
his is bigger, better...

331
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,267
...and lots more besides.

332
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:28,256
- You don't like this one?
- Yes I do!

333
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:30,584
- But Sorin doesn't?
- He does.

334
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:33,098
It's not finished, that's all.

335
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:34,503
Of course...

336
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:37,538
They want to make us feel grateful.

337
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,581
Sorin's mother says Nuta
may be too young.

338
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:43,222
Women's tales.
His father gave me his word.

339
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,705
If they don't want the house,
Florica can have it.

340
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:49,025
Then, she might even find a man.

341
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:51,345
Shut up, Papa, you're drunk.

342
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,152
Hi, it's Georges.

343
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:05,188
Thanks.
Can you put Jacky on?

344
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:11,381
Hello, my man.

345
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:15,624
I called from the airport
but your line was busy.

346
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:21,150
Groggy, but I'm okay.

347
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:23,666
I'll be in tomorrow at 10.

348
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:27,551
How do the photos look?

349
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:30,824
Sorry?

350
00:35:32,274 --> 00:35:35,789
Maybe 20 km from Drenica.
I wrote it on the roll.

351
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,552
She needs glasses.

352
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,268
Precisely!

353
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:45,747
When did he fly out?

354
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:47,948
Via Kabul?

355
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,390
Yeah, I heard it on the radio.

356
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:54,824
No, I was in Tirana at the time.

357
00:35:57,275 --> 00:35:59,470
Anne's home.
I'll call you back.

358
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:02,867
You know where to get me.

359
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:05,303
See you tomorrow.

360
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:12,909
Good morning, sir.

361
00:36:15,115 --> 00:36:16,309
Good morning, miss.

362
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,785
You okay?

363
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:21,591
I'm okay.

364
00:36:25,155 --> 00:36:27,465
I hope the bath doesn't overflow.

365
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:29,105
Me, too.

366
00:36:57,396 --> 00:36:58,750
Hello, you.

367
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,632
Does the heating work?

368
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,674
It was totally overhauled
4 years ago.

369
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:08,270
If you wish,
I'll show you the boiler.

370
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:12,079
Now we come to what was
the music room.

371
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:13,751
This way...

372
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,480
A superb room.

373
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,273
The paneling provides
excellent acoustics.

374
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:24,909
Very pretty.

375
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,557
Strange lighting, though.

376
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:35,718
Why are there no windows?

377
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:38,796
They're walled up and concealed.

378
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,674
For the acoustics, I guess.

379
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:41,951
Hold on...

380
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:47,521
Can you hear the silence?

381
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:50,190
Quite amazing with all that traffic.

382
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,799
What's behind this door?

383
00:39:58,202 --> 00:40:00,033
A hallway to the stairs.

384
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:02,802
The key was lost.
I'll have a copy cut.

385
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:04,230
No, thanks, I don't.

386
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:05,636
Unfortunately, I do.

387
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:11,474
Maybe you have a?...

388
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:12,672
Sorry, no.

389
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:15,443
Excuse me.
My briefcase is next door.

390
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:17,873
I'll get a light and be right back.

391
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,600
She's too head-on to camera.

392
00:40:30,603 --> 00:40:32,195
The mark fell off...

393
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:34,200
...during the pan...

394
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:39,996
Shot 16, take 4.

395
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,399
Action!

396
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:50,439
...Almost 3,000 square meters.
2,800 to be precise.

397
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:54,553
The trees and hedges
ensure total privacy.

398
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:55,879
So I see.

399
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:57,799
Shall we go on?

400
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,754
Everything is
in excellent condition.

401
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:11,433
The windows, doors, wallpaper...

402
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,801
The floor's been varnished.

403
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:22,436
Does the heating work?

404
00:41:22,645 --> 00:41:25,398
It was totally overhauled
4 years ago.

405
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:27,960
If you wish,
I'll show you the boiler.

406
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,997
Now we come to what was
the music room.

407
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:33,440
This way...

408
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:36,278
A superb room.

409
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:40,358
The paneling provides
excellent acoustics.

410
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,840
...Then, there's the inspector
who begins...

411
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:41,801
...to link the crimes
and build a profile of the killer.

412
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:45,086
He's helped by his own personality...

413
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:48,487
...being very similar to the realtor's.

414
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:50,406
What happens to you?

415
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:53,805
I can't tell you.
It'd spoil the surprise.

416
00:42:54,008 --> 00:42:55,919
When's the film coming out?

417
00:42:56,128 --> 00:42:59,165
No idea.
We haven't finished shooting yet.

418
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,407
Christmas, I guess, or the New Year.
I've truly no idea.

419
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:05,316
There you are, sir.

420
00:43:06,248 --> 00:43:07,124
Bones all gone.

421
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:08,647
Thank you, miss.

422
00:43:09,648 --> 00:43:11,843
What service! Look and learn.

423
00:43:13,248 --> 00:43:15,126
Are you back from a war zone?

424
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:17,759
How does it feel, civilization?

425
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:20,919
I feel an urge to do my expenses.

426
00:43:21,129 --> 00:43:22,357
Seriously?

427
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:24,924
Seriously, it's not too bad.

428
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:27,484
It's all so obvious. At first.

429
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,281
Then, the crunch comes.

430
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:30,399
Meaning?

431
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:32,482
I don't know...

432
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:36,199
Over there, it's simple.
Here, life is complicated.

433
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:41,281
There, it's hard at first.
Then you get into the swing of it.

434
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,684
Did you bring
your dentist's address?

435
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,403
Sure... You want it now?

436
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,884
No. So I don't forget.

437
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,558
It comes and goes.
It doesn't hurt now...

438
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,408
...but press and it's agony.

439
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,808
I know... I'll give you
the address afterwards.

440
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,728
- Seen Martin yet?
- No.

441
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,928
He's in a terrible way.

442
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,559
It's almost moving.

443
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,441
What happened?

444
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,529
Julie hit him with it.
She took the kids and moved out.

445
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,164
I called all morning.

446
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,930
I only arrived 2 hours ago.
Claudine...

447
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,689
...He could get off...

448
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:20,201
...except the captain
had his passport on board.

449
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:23,403
To disembark for a month
with his passport...

450
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:25,806
...he had to prove he had a job.

451
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,640
Ashore, he met a fellow Malian...

452
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:32,882
I booked a window table.

453
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,129
Mister Traore?

454
00:44:36,651 --> 00:44:38,607
That's right, Amadou Traore.

455
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:40,529
I'll just check.

456
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,370
This is fine.
Let it go, we're here now.

457
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:49,727
If you want...

458
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:54,967
So?

459
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,688
So, what? Oh, right...

460
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:01,967
So the guy from Mali promises
to find him a job.

461
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:04,045
They ask the captain...

462
00:45:04,252 --> 00:45:07,050
...to give back the passport
once he's hired.

463
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,646
The captain agrees.

464
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:14,243
1 hour later, the Malian returns,
panting as if he's run miles.

465
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:16,841
He says his boss will hire him...

466
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:21,092
...but needs his passport
to confirm his particulars.

467
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:23,889
The captain hands it over...

468
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:27,483
...but tells my father to stay put
as a guarantee.

469
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:30,886
Sorry, sir,
your booking was for 7.30.

470
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:32,008
It's now 8.15.

471
00:45:32,173 --> 00:45:34,767
The window tables
are very popular...

472
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:36,452
It's 8.15 already?

473
00:45:41,453 --> 00:45:44,172
Well, never mind.
Can we have the menu?

474
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:45,772
Coming right up.

475
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:51,043
Say...

476
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:53,773
...is that a watch?

477
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,287
Don't you like it?

478
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:03,289
So-so.

479
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,770
So, he had to stay on the boat?

480
00:46:17,014 --> 00:46:21,212
Yes. The only way from his cabin
to the gangplank...

481
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:24,805
was past the captain's cabin,
whose door was wide open...

482
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,210
...so no one could leave unseen.

483
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:30,374
There was a bigger boat alongside.

484
00:46:37,015 --> 00:46:37,925
Sorry.

485
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:40,369
It's not ours.

486
00:46:40,575 --> 00:46:41,325
Isn't it?

487
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:45,167
If someone asks,
it's behind the bar, okay?

488
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:47,727
What are you drinking?

489
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:51,492
- How about you?
- Don't know.

490
00:46:51,695 --> 00:46:55,530
Our house cocktail is light
and a real thirst-quencher.

491
00:46:56,816 --> 00:46:57,805
Sound good?

492
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,884
- A cocktail and a Perrier.
- Fine.

493
00:47:22,736 --> 00:47:24,727
So, what did he do?

494
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:30,170
He pulled on two pairs of pants...

495
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:32,811
...several shirts and sweaters...

496
00:47:33,257 --> 00:47:34,576
...and left the rest.

497
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:37,450
He climbed ashore via the other ship...

498
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:40,607
...and got his passport back.

499
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:42,326
Cool!

500
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:47,848
My Dad can tell you stories
like that for days on end.

501
00:47:52,097 --> 00:47:53,212
Have you chosen?

502
00:47:58,178 --> 00:47:59,327
One cocktail...

503
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:01,573
...and a Perrier.

504
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:06,249
Found anything you like?

505
00:48:08,938 --> 00:48:09,688
Not yet.

506
00:48:09,898 --> 00:48:12,287
Take your time.
The kitchen closes at midnight.

507
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,570
...That you have to photograph
death and destruction...

508
00:48:23,778 --> 00:48:25,894
...so I know what war is?

509
00:48:26,098 --> 00:48:28,533
Starving kids
so I know what famine is?

510
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,252
What a dumb assumption!

511
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:33,576
Don't get worked up,
it'll ruin your meal.

512
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:36,375
We won't see eye to eye, Francine.

513
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:38,650
For you, it's theory.
For me, real life.

514
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:41,578
But you can't say that
in your photos.

515
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:43,769
True.

516
00:48:43,979 --> 00:48:45,776
So, why do you do it?

517
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:50,607
Back on your favorite argument?

518
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:51,815
Why not?

519
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:54,453
If I can't attack my friends,
who's left?

520
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:57,219
Me, darling. I'm your punchbag.

521
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:00,098
Look over by the wall.

522
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,576
The black kid who hassled Jean.
Don't let him see...

523
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:34,176
Hi there, Maria!

524
00:49:34,381 --> 00:49:37,293
Mihai Popa!
How are you doing?

525
00:49:37,501 --> 00:49:38,820
Well. Very well.

526
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:40,417
So I see.

527
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:42,259
We do our best. And you?

528
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:43,371
I'm fine, too.

529
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,458
On your way home?
Jump in.

530
00:49:45,661 --> 00:49:46,411
Don't worry.

531
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:49,579
It's on my way.
You have a big, heavy bag.

532
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:02,700
- When did you get back?
- A few weeks ago.

533
00:50:02,902 --> 00:50:05,097
- And you?
- Last week.

534
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:08,410
- How's Mirela?
- Very well.

535
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:11,941
She nannies for a couple,
both doctors.

536
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,052
Where?

537
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:14,297
Dublin.

538
00:50:15,102 --> 00:50:18,174
I look after the garden
and everything else.

539
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:20,654
I'm only here for shearing.

540
00:50:20,862 --> 00:50:22,659
You've landed on your feet.

541
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:24,295
You could say.

542
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:29,018
What about you? How was Paris?

543
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:30,812
Fine.

544
00:50:31,022 --> 00:50:32,296
Find a job?

545
00:50:33,062 --> 00:50:35,338
A good one. In a school.

546
00:50:35,543 --> 00:50:37,693
Great! How long did you stay?

547
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:39,734
- 4 months.
- Is that all?

548
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,414
I missed the children.

549
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:44,700
And Dragos missed you, eh?

550
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:46,858
We're here.

551
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:54,972
Thanks.

552
00:50:55,183 --> 00:50:56,218
My pleasure.

553
00:50:56,423 --> 00:50:57,742
Your house looks good.

554
00:50:58,143 --> 00:50:59,576
- Is it finished?
- Nearly.

555
00:50:59,783 --> 00:51:01,819
- When's the wedding?
- Spring.

556
00:51:02,823 --> 00:51:04,576
Go on... Thanks again.

557
00:51:04,784 --> 00:51:06,854
Are you going to Olteanu's wedding?

558
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,099
Ask Dragos.

559
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:11,376
If there's drink, he'll come.
It'll be good.

560
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:12,494
I hope so.

561
00:51:12,704 --> 00:51:13,978
Say hello to Dragos.

562
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:16,414
And to Mirela in Dublin.

563
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,865
Hello, Nathalie, it's Anne...
Anne Laurent.

564
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:31,661
Never mind.
Can I speak to Georges?

565
00:52:32,546 --> 00:52:33,456
Is he?

566
00:52:34,226 --> 00:52:35,978
When will he be back?

567
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,104
Doesn't Jacky know either?

568
00:52:40,267 --> 00:52:42,064
No, it doesn't matter.

569
00:52:44,347 --> 00:52:46,303
Ask him to call me, will you?

570
00:53:56,709 --> 00:53:57,744
Hello, Mrs. Becker.

571
00:53:57,949 --> 00:53:58,859
Hello.

572
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:01,627
Did you write this?

573
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:02,579
No.

574
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:05,297
I didn't write anything.

575
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,306
Won't you read it, at least?

576
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:09,261
I don't have my glasses.

577
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,342
I didn't write anything.

578
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,866
I don't write notes like that.

579
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,018
Are you sure?

580
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,858
You would tell me, wouldn't you?

581
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,463
- I don't know what you want.
- Nothing.

582
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,107
I thought it was your writing.

583
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,060
I'm sorry.

584
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,749
So am I.

585
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,504
...In the distance, far off,
are lights...

586
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,349
...yellow lights, twinkling.

587
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,461
I see them through the walls.

588
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,820
Shapes coming toward the house.
I can't identiry them.

589
00:54:47,031 --> 00:54:49,420
They want to get in.

590
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:52,868
They bang and scrape
on the walls and door.

591
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:55,669
Then the door bursts open...

592
00:54:57,871 --> 00:54:59,270
I wake up...

593
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:01,463
...and try to jump up...

594
00:55:01,671 --> 00:55:03,389
...but I can't move.

595
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:07,789
No sound comes out.
I implore Allah to help me.

596
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:12,665
As I'm praying,
I hear loud laughter behind me.

597
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:14,700
Then, I screamed.

598
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,187
Youssuf woke and turned a light on.

599
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:20,383
I was hysterical:

600
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:25,669
...there was no one there
who could've laughed.

601
00:55:30,992 --> 00:55:32,948
That's when the migraines started?

602
00:55:33,152 --> 00:55:34,551
When I get them...

603
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:36,151
I can't even move.

604
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:40,391
It's as if someone's driving a stake
through my head.

605
00:55:41,632 --> 00:55:43,429
What did the white doctor say?

606
00:55:44,392 --> 00:55:47,066
He's just a friend of Amadou's,
he gave me some pills.

607
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:53,749
"Dear Papa, I'm leaving.
Please, don't try to find me. Jean. "

608
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:47,547
...I have no idea!

609
00:56:48,874 --> 00:56:50,831
It can't have been the kid.

610
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:54,914
She wouldn't sign it,
"a defenseless child". It's dumb!

611
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:57,788
A 10-year-old girI
wouldn't write that.

612
00:56:58,195 --> 00:56:59,947
It's an old person's writing.

613
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:01,634
It must be the neighbor, then.

614
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,426
So?

615
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:04,512
So, either you believe her or not.

616
00:57:04,715 --> 00:57:06,034
It's as simple as that?

617
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:08,146
Not simple, inescapable.

618
00:57:08,355 --> 00:57:11,074
If you do, call the cops.
If not, forget it.

619
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:13,914
- Or ask the kid's parents.
- Ask them what?

620
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:16,868
"Do you hit your child?
Torture her ever?

621
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:18,588
"Why is she always screaming?"

622
00:57:18,795 --> 00:57:20,308
Tricky, eh?

623
00:57:25,196 --> 00:57:26,834
Chablis or Sancerre?

624
00:57:27,036 --> 00:57:28,389
I don't give a shit!

625
00:57:30,996 --> 00:57:32,429
You don't care, do you?

626
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:35,389
I do, but you got the letter.
Not me.

627
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:38,948
- I can't decide for you.
- You could fucking help!

628
00:57:40,236 --> 00:57:43,228
It's too easy
just to wash your hands of it.

629
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:46,792
I never hear her crying.
I don't even know her.

630
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,554
I don't know her parents.

631
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,111
I met the old lady three times.

632
00:57:51,316 --> 00:57:54,673
Not my problem!
Can you get that into your head?

633
00:58:06,877 --> 00:58:08,913
It's never your problem.

634
00:58:09,117 --> 00:58:11,153
When there's trouble, you're gone.

635
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:13,951
- Of course, you're right.
- Aren't I?

636
00:58:24,158 --> 00:58:27,707
Why don't you grow up and stop
letting others decide for you?

637
00:58:27,918 --> 00:58:29,829
And you never run away?

638
00:58:30,038 --> 00:58:31,949
Eh? What about your son?

639
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:33,796
Your needle's stuck!

640
00:58:35,238 --> 00:58:36,796
What are you getting at?

641
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:09,949
What if I was expecting a child?

642
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,158
What are you saying?

643
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:14,713
I'm pregnant.

644
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:18,349
What if I was pregnant?

645
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,198
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not a joke.

646
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:24,310
I aborted while you were away.

647
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,549
Did you?

648
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,113
You decide.

649
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,313
Is there a problem?

650
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,999
What is this?

651
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,556
Do you expect me
to take you seriously?

652
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,954
No, I don't.

653
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,711
Have you ever made someone happy?

654
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,794
Tell me.

655
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,833
Is there a single person
you have made happy?

656
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:03,591
No.

657
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:46,475
Didn't you want some rice?

658
01:01:55,124 --> 01:01:57,035
...Is that setting a good example?

659
01:01:58,244 --> 01:02:00,394
What's Salimata going to think?

660
01:02:01,604 --> 01:02:04,073
Later on,
what will the children think?

661
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:05,561
Answer me.

662
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:08,154
- But there was a group of them.
- Nonsense!

663
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,844
- The teacher said...
- She can say what she wants.

664
01:02:12,045 --> 01:02:15,401
You'd rather believe a white shrew
than your own son?

665
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:19,001
The mother who told the teacher
caught her son red-handed.

666
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:20,035
And the teacher said?

667
01:02:20,245 --> 01:02:23,794
She raises him single-handed.
She can't cope.

668
01:02:24,285 --> 01:02:26,435
I check his pockets every morning.

669
01:02:26,645 --> 01:02:28,954
- I'm talking to my son.
- And I'm talking to you!

670
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:31,395
I won't be silenced
because I'm sick.

671
01:02:31,605 --> 01:02:32,833
What's the teacher say?

672
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:35,606
The woman caught her son
smoking weed.

673
01:02:35,806 --> 01:02:37,717
He gave 3 names,
including Demba.

674
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:40,440
And as the only black kid,
he's the guilty one.

675
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:41,123
Quiet!

676
01:02:41,326 --> 01:02:43,237
He'll end up in jail, too.

677
01:02:43,446 --> 01:02:47,041
Wash your mouth out!
Amadou is innocent.

678
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:49,714
Look how they all follow
his example.

679
01:02:49,926 --> 01:02:52,076
He hangs out with white girls...

680
01:02:52,286 --> 01:02:54,800
...instead of looking out
for his brother.

681
01:02:55,006 --> 01:02:56,917
As for your daughter...

682
01:02:57,126 --> 01:02:59,765
...look at her,
with her yellow crew cut!

683
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:02,002
Demba, answer me truthfully.

684
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:04,117
What have I done to you?

685
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:05,839
Be quiet!

686
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:08,684
I can't hear myself think.

687
01:03:09,687 --> 01:03:12,076
Demba, I want to believe you...

688
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:15,204
...but if you lie to me...

689
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:18,247
...you'll regret it all your life!

690
01:03:18,447 --> 01:03:19,641
Well?

691
01:03:21,407 --> 01:03:22,681
It was François.

692
01:03:23,247 --> 01:03:25,807
He took my jacket
in the school yard.

693
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:27,880
Who is François?

694
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:34,125
He's the kid whose mother
went to see the teacher.

695
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:38,685
He said he'd give my jacket back...

696
01:03:39,648 --> 01:03:41,559
...if I gave him 100 francs.

697
01:03:42,808 --> 01:03:45,447
I said I didn't have that much...

698
01:03:45,808 --> 01:03:47,685
...but he just laughed.

699
01:03:48,168 --> 01:03:49,999
He threw my jacket down...

700
01:03:50,448 --> 01:03:51,881
...and trampled on it.

701
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:54,038
He said...

702
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:57,320
I was lucky he didn't ask for 200

703
01:03:57,808 --> 01:04:01,357
...and if I didn't bring him
100 francs...

704
01:04:01,568 --> 01:04:02,762
...the next day...

705
01:04:04,688 --> 01:04:06,519
I wouldn't recognize my jacket.

706
01:04:09,169 --> 01:04:13,447
He said I'd just have to steal
the money from home.

707
01:04:16,729 --> 01:04:18,082
He still has my jacket.

708
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:19,438
Meaning?

709
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:22,360
I didn't give him the cash.

710
01:04:22,969 --> 01:04:24,846
That's why he was angry...

711
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:27,287
...and fingered me.

712
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,041
Is that the truth?

713
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:35,293
...If you desire the spleen...

714
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:41,292
...and will laugh yourselves
into stitches, follow me.

715
01:07:44,695 --> 01:07:46,606
That gull Malvolio...

716
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,284
...has come to court my lady...

717
01:07:58,096 --> 01:07:59,848
...in yellow stockings...

718
01:08:02,176 --> 01:08:03,973
...cross-gartered...

719
01:08:09,256 --> 01:08:11,247
...most villainously!

720
01:08:14,096 --> 01:08:17,406
I have dogged him
like his murderer.

721
01:08:17,856 --> 01:08:19,813
He obeys every point of the letter.

722
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:22,247
He does smile his face...

723
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:25,968
...into more lines...

724
01:08:26,137 --> 01:08:30,176
...than is in the new map
with the augmentation of the Indies.

725
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:32,528
You never saw such a thing.

726
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:35,535
I can hardly forbear
hurling things at him.

727
01:08:38,537 --> 01:08:41,097
I know my lady will strike him.

728
01:08:43,177 --> 01:08:44,405
If she do...

729
01:08:47,097 --> 01:08:48,974
...he'll smile...

730
01:08:49,137 --> 01:08:51,413
...and take it for a great favor.

731
01:09:32,179 --> 01:09:33,737
Anyone out there?

732
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:37,658
...To make a new life.

733
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:39,895
When's he coming back?

734
01:09:41,099 --> 01:09:42,168
I've no idea.

735
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,413
I miss him.

736
01:09:47,459 --> 01:09:50,531
I miss him, too.
We all miss him.

737
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:52,377
He doesn't miss us.

738
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:55,653
He'll be sad all by himself.

739
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,972
He won't be all by himself.

740
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,777
There's his brother
and all his family.

741
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:06,137
He'll take a new wife
half my age.

742
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,575
Show some respect
for your father!

743
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,611
Where is he going?

744
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,139
If he was here...

745
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,409
Very far.

746
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,376
What would you say
if he was here?

747
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,253
Stop wanting
to be so strong.

748
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,212
He'll be traveling
a long time.

749
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,569
How?

750
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,812
First, by car.

751
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:28,138
Then, on a boat.

752
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:30,411
Then, by car again.

753
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,652
Will he ever come back?

754
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:35,374
Remember Uncle Ak,.

755
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:40,170
Did he come back?
Safi's still waiting...

756
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:42,372
Papa is old, you know.

757
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:44,775
It's his home.

758
01:10:44,981 --> 01:10:46,539
Where?

759
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:48,810
Africa.

760
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:52,298
Where is Africa?

761
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,694
- When?
- 2 weeks on Monday.

762
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:21,905
Ion Fratila's wife
is driving us to Halmeu...

763
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,744
...near the border.

764
01:13:25,826 --> 01:13:28,943
- How many of you?
- 5 so far. You'll make it 6.

765
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:32,299
Anyone from the village?

766
01:13:34,707 --> 01:13:36,538
Have a think about it.

767
01:13:36,747 --> 01:13:38,339
It's a good opportunity.

768
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:40,341
Don't you think, Mama?

769
01:13:41,347 --> 01:13:43,338
I'll have to talk to Dragos.

770
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:45,902
Of course.

771
01:13:49,267 --> 01:13:51,303
- Do you want one?
- Thanks.

772
01:13:52,987 --> 01:13:54,864
I can't see Papa saying no.

773
01:13:56,347 --> 01:13:58,383
I said, I'll talk to Dragos.

774
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:06,827
...Thought that he'd be married soon...

775
01:14:07,028 --> 01:14:10,418
...and so he'd have a house
ready to live in.

776
01:14:12,468 --> 01:14:14,777
It took us most of spring.

777
01:14:16,188 --> 01:14:19,703
François lent a hand
despite him being so busy.

778
01:14:20,988 --> 01:14:21,977
But no!

779
01:14:23,348 --> 01:14:25,145
His lordship didn't like it.

780
01:14:31,268 --> 01:14:33,338
How come François called you?

781
01:14:33,548 --> 01:14:35,106
He's concerned.

782
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:39,468
Why? About me?

783
01:14:44,269 --> 01:14:46,385
He should mind his own business.

784
01:14:46,589 --> 01:14:47,499
He wanted to help.

785
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:49,745
That's why he's doing all this?

786
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:52,861
Because of the bulls?

787
01:14:55,269 --> 01:14:56,668
He should be happy.

788
01:14:57,309 --> 01:15:00,142
He'll get more for his.
He needs all he can get.

789
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:06,987
Where's Jean now?

790
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:11,027
What are you asking me for?

791
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:16,698
I have no idea.

792
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,108
How would I know?

793
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:24,669
I'm too busy to run after him.

794
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,708
In any case, he's right...

795
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,506
...there's no future here.

796
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:35,822
At least,
he won't have to get up at 5 a. M.

797
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:38,660
He can laze about all he likes.

798
01:15:39,511 --> 01:15:41,467
What? Isn't it the truth?

799
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:44,669
Do you lot in the city
get up at 5 a. M.?

800
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:48,870
You know.
You blazed the trail for him.

801
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:55,549
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

802
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:56,740
It's okay.

803
01:16:00,831 --> 01:16:02,583
The truth isn't like that.

804
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,829
Are you hungry?

805
01:16:11,352 --> 01:16:12,546
No, thanks. Really.

806
01:16:12,752 --> 01:16:14,424
Even after your drive?

807
01:16:14,632 --> 01:16:16,350
Honestly, Papa, don't worry.

808
01:16:24,992 --> 01:16:27,631
How are things?
Acting going well?

809
01:16:28,192 --> 01:16:29,705
I'm getting on fine.

810
01:16:32,112 --> 01:16:34,148
I've just shot a thriller.

811
01:16:34,832 --> 01:16:37,107
You must go and see it
when it's released.

812
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:44,864
You'll have to write me
with the title when it's finished.

813
01:16:47,113 --> 01:16:50,150
Prettier every day.
Far too good for you.

814
01:16:53,673 --> 01:16:57,552
The way you're going,
next time I won't recognize you.

815
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:04,784
It'll be called The Collector...

816
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:06,787
Probably.

817
01:17:11,913 --> 01:17:13,666
What are you going to do?

818
01:17:16,994 --> 01:17:18,268
About what?

819
01:17:18,474 --> 01:17:19,873
"About what"?

820
01:17:20,514 --> 01:17:23,028
- About looking for Jean?
- Nothing!

821
01:17:24,714 --> 01:17:28,389
It's been 6 weeks.
He should know where he belongs.

822
01:17:31,274 --> 01:17:33,708
He'll come back when he wants or...

823
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:35,263
Or what?

824
01:17:36,034 --> 01:17:36,989
Or...

825
01:17:43,154 --> 01:17:44,143
Excuse me.

826
01:17:47,515 --> 01:17:49,392
I left the pump running out there.

827
01:17:58,435 --> 01:17:59,504
I feel sorry for him.

828
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,467
That won't help him.

829
01:18:05,355 --> 01:18:06,947
What are you going to do?

830
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:14,387
...And no noise! Understand?
No speak!

831
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:18,148
If they find you, finito I'amore!
Get it?

832
01:18:18,356 --> 01:18:22,395
Okay, boss. No worry.
We understand, boss.

833
01:18:24,196 --> 01:18:27,871
Do business in box, okay?
Nothing dirty up there.

834
01:18:28,076 --> 01:18:30,590
They smell you,
it's like they hear you!

835
01:18:30,796 --> 01:18:31,865
Get it?

836
01:18:32,076 --> 01:18:33,191
Yes, boss.

837
01:18:37,036 --> 01:18:40,824
In Paris, wait for me to open up.
Don't get excited.

838
01:18:41,036 --> 01:18:42,833
Wait till we get to depot.

839
01:18:43,036 --> 01:18:45,311
Of course, boss. We wait.
Thank you.

840
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:47,712
That's all. Have a nice trip.

841
01:18:49,837 --> 01:18:52,067
...Believe that little Francoise...

842
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:55,065
...has already entered Your kingdom.

843
01:18:56,757 --> 01:18:59,271
In Your goodness, grant us...

844
01:19:00,317 --> 01:19:02,831
...that we might one day share with her...

845
01:19:03,997 --> 01:19:05,316
...in eternal life.

846
01:19:05,517 --> 01:19:07,985
Through Jesus Christ, Amen.

847
01:21:42,682 --> 01:21:45,196
...The second day,
on the road from Ghurian to Herat.

848
01:21:45,962 --> 01:21:48,635
They separated us.
I was left in a totally dark room.

849
01:21:49,682 --> 01:21:51,718
A Taliban fighter
appeared every 2 hours...

850
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:54,800
...silhouetted in the doorway,
pointing at me.

851
01:21:55,002 --> 01:21:56,959
"You French," he'd say...

852
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:00,961
...before miming cutting his throat.

853
01:22:02,003 --> 01:22:03,402
Absolutely charming.

854
01:22:04,683 --> 01:22:07,117
After 2 days, the guy was replaced.

855
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:10,192
A new guard turned up.
He had a flashlight...

856
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:12,155
...and asked in perfect English...

857
01:22:14,843 --> 01:22:16,356
I felt so relieved.

858
01:22:17,203 --> 01:22:19,433
I told him my story:

859
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,918
...photographer,
big misunderstanding, etc...

860
01:22:22,123 --> 01:22:24,193
He listened and said...

861
01:22:27,284 --> 01:22:30,515
I thought he seemed reassuring,
so I told it again...

862
01:22:30,724 --> 01:22:32,555
...slowly and more clearly.

863
01:22:33,084 --> 01:22:36,838
First time round,
I'd garbled half of it.

864
01:22:38,124 --> 01:22:40,684
When I'd finished,
he looked at me and said...

865
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,001
It was all he could say...

866
01:22:45,164 --> 01:22:47,155
...but he didn't even know
what it meant.

867
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:50,234
In the end, Phil got us out...

868
01:22:50,444 --> 01:22:52,275
...by using his contacts at CNN.

869
01:22:53,884 --> 01:22:56,398
You can mention it to Francine.
It'll make her laugh.

870
01:22:59,685 --> 01:23:02,563
In my cell,
I thought about what she said.

871
01:23:02,765 --> 01:23:05,643
Don't tell her,
she'll be even more unbearable.

872
01:23:07,685 --> 01:23:10,722
It's easy to talk about
"ecology of the image"

873
01:23:10,925 --> 01:23:13,758
...and "value
of the non-transmitted message".

874
01:23:14,285 --> 01:23:16,515
What matters is the end result.

875
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:20,759
I guess she finds it all
too bothersome.

876
01:23:22,645 --> 01:23:24,124
After all, she could be right.

877
01:23:25,525 --> 01:23:27,197
How would knowing help her?

878
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:33,354
I don't think
I'm fit for life in peace.

879
01:23:33,566 --> 01:23:35,921
What you call "peace" at least.

880
01:23:38,366 --> 01:23:42,279
4 days in Kabul now,
waiting for something to happen.

881
01:23:42,806 --> 01:23:46,321
People are polite but wary.
I can hardly blame them...

882
01:25:08,129 --> 01:25:10,643
...Excellent!
Did your husband make it?

883
01:25:10,849 --> 01:25:11,520
Yes.

884
01:25:12,129 --> 01:25:14,723
You can tell.
It's nothing like that gutrot.

885
01:25:14,929 --> 01:25:15,964
Here, son.

886
01:25:16,169 --> 01:25:17,648
Where's Lenutza?

887
01:25:17,849 --> 01:25:19,646
Lenutza left 2 weeks ago...

888
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:23,478
...to meet her sister in Italy
and work picking grapes.

889
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:26,399
She went with a big group.

890
01:25:26,609 --> 01:25:28,327
Who has her card?

891
01:25:29,009 --> 01:25:29,964
I've no idea.

892
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:31,888
Who has Lenutza's card?

893
01:25:32,089 --> 01:25:32,999
What?

894
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:35,849
Who bought Lenutza's yellow card?

895
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:38,803
That new girl from Aliceni maybe.
Mirela.

896
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,204
That's right. Mirela...

897
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:44,722
A few days before Lenutza left,
4 people from Aliceni arrived.

898
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:47,125
One of them bought her card.

899
01:27:01,892 --> 01:27:03,962
What are you so upset about?

900
01:27:04,772 --> 01:27:06,569
- Are you homesick?
- No!

901
01:27:07,012 --> 01:27:09,004
I wanted to sell newspapers.

902
01:27:10,493 --> 01:27:11,812
What do you mean?

903
01:27:13,253 --> 01:27:15,813
Before I left, I called Lenutza.

904
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:19,964
She promised me
her license to sell papers.

905
01:27:20,373 --> 01:27:22,204
She wanted to go home.

906
01:27:23,533 --> 01:27:25,444
Can't you just apply?

907
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:28,087
I was deported a few months ago.

908
01:27:29,253 --> 01:27:30,527
You'll find something.

909
01:27:30,733 --> 01:27:31,643
Of course...

910
01:27:33,293 --> 01:27:34,282
Sure I will.

911
01:27:43,374 --> 01:27:45,092
One day, in Certeze...

912
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:48,492
I gave some money
to a gypsy beggar.

913
01:27:49,574 --> 01:27:52,646
She was so dirty,
I ran to wash my hands...

914
01:27:53,254 --> 01:27:55,324
...to avoid catching a disease.

915
01:27:55,894 --> 01:27:57,725
She simply disgusted me.

916
01:27:59,494 --> 01:28:00,609
So?

917
01:28:02,014 --> 01:28:03,493
Last winter...

918
01:28:04,414 --> 01:28:06,166
...on Boulevard St. Germain...

919
01:28:06,374 --> 01:28:09,923
...a well-dressed man
was about to give me 20 francs...

920
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,013
But when he saw

921
01:28:17,615 --> 01:28:19,173
...my outstretched hand...

922
01:28:19,655 --> 01:28:23,364
...he threw the bill into my lap
as if I nauseated him.

923
01:28:29,175 --> 01:28:33,248
I rushed back here
and hid myself in the attic.

924
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:37,126
I cried my eyes out all day.

925
01:28:37,655 --> 01:28:40,044
It was so embarrassing.
Do you see?

926
01:28:47,256 --> 01:28:48,405
You can't take it.

927
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:52,895
You don't measure up.

928
01:28:57,096 --> 01:28:58,575
- Say what?
- I love you.

929
01:29:00,216 --> 01:29:02,127
- I love you, too.
- But I really love you.

930
01:29:02,696 --> 01:29:04,448
- Really truly?
- Really truly.

931
01:29:04,896 --> 01:29:05,646
True true?

932
01:29:05,856 --> 01:29:06,845
True true.

933
01:29:11,976 --> 01:29:12,852
Pierrot!

934
01:29:16,337 --> 01:29:17,452
Don't move!

935
01:29:17,657 --> 01:29:19,136
Wait! Don't move.

936
01:29:47,818 --> 01:29:49,888
What do you think you were doing?

937
01:29:50,098 --> 01:29:52,089
Can't you see it's dangerous?

938
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:54,497
But there's a balloon!

939
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:07,732
If you do that again,
you'll get your first ever smack!

940
01:30:07,938 --> 01:30:09,849
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Dad.

941
01:30:10,058 --> 01:30:11,696
I feel sick.

942
01:30:27,579 --> 01:30:28,807
Get out of here.

943
01:30:29,419 --> 01:30:31,375
I can't let you out of my sight.

944
01:30:39,819 --> 01:30:41,218
We have to move.

945
01:30:41,419 --> 01:30:42,169
What?

946
01:30:42,739 --> 01:30:45,094
I can't live on the 20th floor...

947
01:30:45,299 --> 01:30:47,130
...always worrying he'll fall.

948
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:50,933
Let's stop there.

949
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,855
And start where?

950
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,618
From the top, of course.

951
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:57,809
Really?

952
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,218
Just winding you up.

953
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,013
No, the shot after all the gurgling...

954
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:08,053
when you say:
"I love you, too... "

955
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,771
Why bother? It was fine.

956
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:12,572
Except for the plane.

957
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,130
What plane?

958
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,376
You can hear a plane fly over.

959
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,013
Okay, kids, let's do it!

960
01:31:24,781 --> 01:31:26,339
I love you, too.

961
01:31:27,301 --> 01:31:28,859
Sorry. Let's try again.

962
01:31:37,101 --> 01:31:38,614
Okay, here we go!

963
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:44,413
I love you, too.

964
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:56,739
Okay, calm down.

965
01:32:05,262 --> 01:32:08,015
Can we just calm down?
We've lots to get through.

966
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:09,211
I'm sorry.

967
01:32:10,342 --> 01:32:12,219
Down to business.

968
01:32:29,023 --> 01:32:30,820
Recess is now ended.

969
01:32:32,143 --> 01:32:35,419
Let's try to act grown up
and get some work done.

970
01:32:43,903 --> 01:32:46,337
Is it so hard to tell him
"I love you"?

971
01:32:48,143 --> 01:32:49,542
No, not really.

972
01:33:15,944 --> 01:33:16,899
Thank you.

973
01:33:17,304 --> 01:33:18,942
Here, for you.

974
01:33:19,144 --> 01:33:21,533
Thank you.
Beautiful car, sir.

975
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:47,262
Excuse me...

976
01:34:47,747 --> 01:34:49,624
...aren't you a top model?

977
01:34:51,787 --> 01:34:53,698
Honestly, with your looks...

978
01:34:53,907 --> 01:34:56,102
...you just have to be in that line.

979
01:34:58,947 --> 01:35:00,904
I'm in the biz, too.

980
01:35:01,388 --> 01:35:02,616
Wouldn't guess, eh?

981
01:35:03,108 --> 01:35:05,064
You wouldn't, would you?

982
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:08,501
I was at the gym.

983
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:11,027
So, miss...

984
01:35:12,788 --> 01:35:14,460
Don't talk to commoners?

985
01:35:17,348 --> 01:35:19,145
Didn't offend you, did I?

986
01:35:19,348 --> 01:35:22,465
I wonder
if you're one of these rich...

987
01:35:23,228 --> 01:35:25,503
...beautiful people from high society.

988
01:35:27,028 --> 01:35:27,778
No?

989
01:35:31,829 --> 01:35:33,421
A shy little typist, then?

990
01:35:33,629 --> 01:35:37,463
Waiting for Prince Charming
to race up in his Ferrari.

991
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:38,818
Is that it?

992
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:41,940
I don't get it.

993
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:45,221
How can you be so beautiful
yet so arrogant?

994
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:53,587
That's not very nice!

995
01:35:54,429 --> 01:35:56,863
What am I going to do by myself...

996
01:35:57,229 --> 01:35:58,947
...in the big, bad city?

997
01:35:59,709 --> 01:36:01,028
Tell me that.

998
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,747
What do you say?
Isn't that a cheap trick?

999
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:08,418
Maybe I'm not good enough for her.

1000
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:12,067
For the lady to be in the subway
with the tramps...

1001
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:14,301
...there must be a reason.

1002
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:16,819
It's the chauffeur's day off.

1003
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:19,349
Yeah, that must be it.

1004
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,343
What about you, ma'am?

1005
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:26,903
What do you think?

1006
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:29,428
Nothing? Is that so?

1007
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,741
Shame! She doesn't think.

1008
01:36:40,631 --> 01:36:42,189
Now what will you do?

1009
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,347
Stand me up again?

1010
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:48,102
Hop off into the next car?

1011
01:36:48,311 --> 01:36:49,710
It's too easy...

1012
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,621
Why? Do I smell?

1013
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:54,460
Is that it?

1014
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:59,226
I'm just a little Arab
looking for a little affection.

1015
01:36:59,431 --> 01:37:01,103
Like everyone else.

1016
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:03,744
Nothing doing?

1017
01:37:05,992 --> 01:37:06,902
Never mind.

1018
01:37:49,553 --> 01:37:51,066
You crazy jerk!

1019
01:38:02,473 --> 01:38:03,826
Who's a jerk?

1020
01:38:04,473 --> 01:38:05,986
Shame on you!

1021
01:39:07,515 --> 01:39:08,834
I'll see you around.

1022
01:39:09,355 --> 01:39:10,550
Don't worry.

1023
01:39:39,076 --> 01:39:40,065
Thank you.
