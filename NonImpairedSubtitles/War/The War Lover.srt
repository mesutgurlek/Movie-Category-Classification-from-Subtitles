1
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,759
Beat you to it, Sully.

2
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,310
- Got an alarm clock, lieutenant?
- Up here.

3
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,835
Capt. Rickson
could use an alarm clock.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,592
Or dynamite, maybe.

5
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,149
Up, captain!
Grab your socks.

6
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,919
- You blast him out. I got work.
- I'll try.

7
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,629
Briefing's at 0500.
You got 20 minutes for breakfast.

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,230
Come on, sir.
Time to get up.

9
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,000
Briefing's at 0500.
You got 20 minutes for breakfast.

10
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,388
All right?

11
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,711
Buzz, come on.
Rise and shine.

12
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,390
Let go of that pillow!

13
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,074
That's my down-girl pillow.

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,756
You tell a girl, "Go ahead.
No, no, honey, not with your hands."

15
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,430
The minute she lays her head
down on that pillow...

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,035
- What time did you get in last night?
- Two, 3.

17
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,472
I don't remember.
But it was worth it.

18
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,034
I think.

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,917
Remember when we could
get up when we pleased?

20
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,000
A hot breakfast waiting for us.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,355
Not have to go out before daylight.

22
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,909
Get shot at by a lot of guys
we don't know...

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,640
...and don't like their job
any better than we do.

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,429
The only trouble with this war is,
it begins too early in the morning.

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,989
- Bolland, you're out of clean socks.
- My apologies.

26
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,911
You need a personal maid.

27
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,959
If they didn't fence off those
WAFs, I'd have me one.

28
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Save me flushing them
out of the woods every night.

29
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,798
Not supposed to fraternise
with the natives.

30
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,276
It's against rules and regulations.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,560
Rules are for sergeants.

32
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,753
Come on, Buzz, will you?

33
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,354
- What's the hurry?
- We'll miss breakfast.

34
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,913
Bolland, sometimes
I worry about your love life.

35
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,593
Well, don't bother.

36
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,912
Remember, you're not in a
monastery. You're in the Air Force.

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,230
Thanks for reminding me.

38
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,758
Hey, come on, Buzz.
Will you hurry up?

39
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,799
Know what else you're gonna have
to learn before you're a good pilot?

40
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,916
How to relax.

41
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,350
- Hi, Marty.
- Greetings.

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,356
Morning, Lynch.
How's your dog?

43
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,238
How's Superman this morning?

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,551
Try and keep us on course
for a change, huh?

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,033
- There's a dance tonight.
- I'll have to call my girl.

46
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,873
- Where is she?
- Boston. Getting home from a dance.

47
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,350
- Where do you bet they send us today?
- Riviera for water sports.

48
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,590
Or Palm Springs to get a suntan.

49
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,593
Today's target, gentlemen, Kiel.

50
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,593
As you can see,
a short run across the North Sea.

51
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,828
Kiel is important because
of enemy submarine pens.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,878
Here they are, in this inlet
just south of the harbour.

53
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,636
Hitting these pens will protect our supply
lines for Operation Torch in North Africa.

54
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,192
As group commander, Col. Emmet will
be in the lead ship of the lead squadron.

55
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,557
You will take your instructions
from him. Colonel.

56
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,279
Capt. Rickson will lead
the low squadron.

57
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,670
Capt. Woodman, the high.

58
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,876
Most of the flying will be
over water.

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,952
Don't get your hopes up
that this will be a nice milk run.

60
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,795
Reconnaissance reports a flak corridor
running through the target area.

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,157
And fighter attacks can be expected.
Stay together.

62
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,711
Keep your formations tight
and drop your bombs when I do.

63
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,395
And remember,
no broken field running.

64
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,437
This is a team effort.

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,070
Navigators and bombardiers
will remain for navigation briefing.

66
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,276
That's all, gentlemen.

67
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,279
Max, get the flak area.
Come on, Bolland.

68
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,795
- What's the hurry?
- <i>The Body</i>'s waiting.

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,190
Well, figure it out for yourself.

70
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,635
- This is our seventh mission, right?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,270
We average three a week for the
next six weeks. That's 18, right?

72
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,193
- Well, 18 and seven is 25, right?
- Right.

73
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,794
We should be home in time
for the World Series.

74
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,269
- Farr, that's crazy figuring.
- How come?

75
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,592
Do you know the chances of all of us
coming through 25 missions alive?

76
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,638
- I mean, mathematically.
- Don't tell us. I hate math.

77
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,038
Hey, Prien, that medicine's rotgut.

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,510
Why don't you take that belly of yours
and have it operated on?

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,958
My stomach was all right
back home.

80
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,429
Why didn't you leave it there
instead of sticking us with it?

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,559
Hey, no one in the whole 8th Air Force
drives a car like Buzz.

82
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,436
It looks like a woman's sewing circle.
How's your stomach, Prien?

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,670
Okay, captain.
Any chance of an abort?

84
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,355
Mother Chicken is reading the
tea leaves. Bolland, check the cockpit.

85
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,795
- Max, check your bomb load.
- Right.

86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,270
- What's all this?
- Overflow. Preflight okay, sir.

87
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,510
- Engine?
- All checked out.

88
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,592
I was losing manifold pressure on
number three. Check the blower?

89
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,069
You got a brand-new supercharger.

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,799
Oxygen?

91
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,758
Oxygen system's okay.
Full load, 450 pounds pressure.

92
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,388
- Gas?
- Tank's filled up to 2800 gallons.

93
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,630
Oil, all okay.

94
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,030
- What are we carrying, Max?
- Big stuff. Eight 1000-pounders.

95
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,478
Rickson will be pleased. He's got his
heart set on blowing up the Continent.

96
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,632
Hey, sir, captain?

97
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,995
Okay, Blackie.

98
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,074
Like me to stay behind,
look after the house?

99
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,958
You wanna live,
don't you, Junior?

100
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,714
Yeah. Yeah, that's the general idea.

101
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,348
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.

102
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,277
Number two.

103
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,239
Hit it.

104
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,879
Number one.

105
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,593
Number three.

106
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,034
Number four.

107
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,396
<i>- Clear for tak eoff, colonel:</i>
- Roger.

108
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,951
Roger. Rolling.

109
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,188
<i>- Max, we all clear down there?</i>
- Yeah, fine.

110
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,990
<i>Spee<i>d up, Zebra 3:</i>
<i>Clear for tak eoff:</i>

111
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,275
Zebra 3. Roger.

112
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,078
Gear up.

113
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,949
First time I went up on a plane,
I was 17. It was a dawn like this.

114
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,714
Dawns are for copilots, Bolland.

115
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,358
To all positions, all positions.
Test-fire guns.

116
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,272
<i>Test-fire guns:</i>

117
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,068
There's something to look at, Bolland.
There's something to look at.

118
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,948
Save your ammo.

119
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,796
<i>Save your ammo: And look, let's see
<i>a few hits today for a change, huh?</i>

120
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,471
Number two. Tighten it up.

121
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,119
<i>Stay in close:</i>

122
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,916
Number three, stay in close.
You're all by yourself out there.

123
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,799
Yes, sir. Joining the party.

124
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,439
We're at 11,000.

125
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,636
On oxygen, everybody. On oxygen.

126
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,675
Prien, check in.

127
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,237
<i>- Snap into it, Prien:</i>
- Okay, captain. Ready to check.

128
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,799
<i>- Lamb?</i>
- Check.

129
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,520
<i>- Handown?</i>
- Okay, mine's on.

130
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,473
- Right.
- Brindt speaking. On oxygen.

131
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,837
- Farr speaking. Me too.
- Brag's okay.

132
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,879
<i>- Junior?</i>
- It's not working.

133
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,238
<i>It's a wonder you can get your pants on</i>
<i>by yourself, Junior: Farr, fix his mask:</i>

134
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,152
Sure, captain.

135
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,313
- Lynch, where are we?
<i>- We're over the North Sea:</i>

136
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,948
Over the North Sea.
Could you be more specific?

137
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,473
<i>Just follow the lead ship:</i>

138
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,916
I don't want advice, Lynch.
I want our position now.

139
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,877
We're approaching the coast, colonel.
What do you think?

140
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,796
- Looks like solid cloud cover. Chong?
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

141
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,190
- What are the chances?
- Not very good, sir.

142
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,989
We've lost contact. Probably
close to the IP, but I can't be sure.

143
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,550
I'll get a report
on the alternate targets.

144
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,429
This is Fat Gal Red.
This is Fat Gal Red.

145
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,957
Requesting operations report.
Zenith eight and nine.

146
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,439
Come in, Operations.

147
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,678
<i>Zenith eight and nine,</i>
<i>last report unfav ourable:</i>

148
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,392
- All the targets are covered.
- Those weather guys missed it today.

149
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,710
Wanna try a chance shot
through the cloud cover?

150
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,997
No other military targets in this area.
We'll have to abort.

151
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,355
This is Fat Gal Red
to all padlocks.

152
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,799
<i>Solid cloud cover over all targets:</i>
<i>Mission aborted: Follow me:</i>

153
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,959
<i>We're taking a 180-degree <i>turn</i>
<i>to the right:</i>

154
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,033
<i>Repeat, 180-degree <i>turn to the right:</i>

155
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,954
<i>On signal, bombs will be dropped</i>
<i>in the sea:</i>

156
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,951
Not my bombs.

157
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,072
- What about the solid cloud cover?
- We're going under it.

158
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,398
- What about Emmet?
- I'll handle Emmet.

159
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,319
Let's worry about the target, Bolland.

160
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,348
<i>Max, I'm taking you down</i>
<i>for a closer look:</i>

161
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,273
<i>Stay on the nose gun</i>
<i>until we get to the IP: Got it?</i>

162
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,829
And listen, I want
as much speed as I can get.

163
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,230
Keep the bomb bays closed
until the last minute.

164
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,389
<i>Sure, captain:</i>

165
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,232
Attention, crew. Attention, all crew.
We're going in low. We're going in low.

166
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,358
<i>Bragliani, Farr, we're in the front now:</i>
<i>Kee<i>p your eyes open:</i>

167
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,909
<i>That goes for you too, Junior:</i>
<i>Stay on your toes:</i>

168
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,231
I'm sorry, captain. I can't get on my
toes. There's not room enough.

169
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,312
<i>Careful, Junior,</i>
<i>or I'll stop your allowance:</i>

170
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,790
Lynch, as soon as we get visibility,
set our course for the IP.

171
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,269
- What altitude do you figure on?
- About 9000.

172
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,238
Isn't that pretty low for bombing?
We'll be expected to...

173
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,073
Listen, Lynch, you navigate.
Let me do the flying.

174
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,196
Prien, they all tightened up
back there?

175
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,837
<i>Yes, sir:</i>

176
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,549
Here we go.

177
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,148
Altitude, 8500.
That was a pretty good guess.

178
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,958
- Warm up the automatic pilot.
- Right.

179
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,350
Lynch, have you picked up
the target course?

180
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,193
Hold her steady
on 038 degrees.

181
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,350
Right, 038 degrees.

182
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,638
Look what we've got here.

183
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,635
<i>- You ready, Max?</i>
- Hand her over.

184
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,919
She's all yours.

185
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,198
There's your submarine pens.

186
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,873
<i>Bomb doors open:</i>

187
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,157
<i>Get them dead centre:</i>
<i>Dead centre, Max:</i>

188
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,514
Dead centre.

189
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,429
Bombs away!

190
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,953
Giving her back to you, Buzz.

191
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,271
I got it.

192
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,238
What about that? The squareheads
can't even shoot straight.

193
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,316
What were you saying?

194
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,437
That was pretty good.

195
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,511
Goodness has nothing to do with it.

196
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,232
Bandits, three 190s at two o'clock.

197
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,277
Handown, Bragliani,
they're coming in on your side.

198
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,034
Max, stay in the nose gun,
understand?

199
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
- Bandit, three o'clock level.
- Max, coming in, 11 o'clock high.

200
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,469
Junior, Prien, get him
when he passes underneath.

201
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,075
Everybody all right?

202
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,152
Just fine, lieutenant.

203
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,949
- The krauts never got in range.
- That's all right with me.

204
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,318
They must have hit Braddock.
His number-one engine's smoking.

205
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,312
He's trying to blow out the fire.

206
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,553
Why didn't he stay close to me?

207
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,674
Hey, what was all that junk
that went past us?

208
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,354
I knew you couldn't
get out of these crates.

209
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,518
Now you listen to me.
That's not gonna happen to us...

210
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,280
...not while I'm flying this bucket.

211
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,911
<i>Lieutenant, would you</i>
<i>please come down here?</i>

212
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,433
I'll be right there.

213
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,953
<i>- Buzz, lose altitude: Prien's sick:</i>
- Sick, or scared?

214
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,395
What's the difference?
Get us down.

215
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,711
Yes, sir.

216
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,311
All right, everybody.
Snap out of it.

217
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,198
<i>You're all still alive:</i>

218
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,197
- Or are you?
- My heart's still beating, captain.

219
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,713
<i>That's a good sign, Handown:</i>

220
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,153
All right, take over.

221
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,200
Yes, sir, we fell behind
on the turn.

222
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,758
Yes, sir, we fell behind
on the turn.

223
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,798
I used maximum power and
pulled up with the group.

224
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,633
- After you dropped your bombs.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,479
- What did you drop them on?
- The target, sir.

226
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,315
The target? With solid cloud cover?
Come on, Rickson.

227
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,074
We found a hole.
We had about six-tenths visibility.

228
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,073
- At what altitude?
- About 9000.

229
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,271
Eight thousand five hundred, sir.

230
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,228
- How's your hearing, Rickson?
- Very good, sir.

231
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,039
In fact, all your reactions
are good, aren't they?

232
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,634
You're about the hottest pilot
in the whole group.

233
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,712
Yes, sir. I guess I am.

234
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,034
Except for one thing. You're
insubordinate and irresponsible.

235
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,394
- Me?
- You heard my order...

236
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,472
...for the 180-degree turn, and you
deliberately abandoned formation.

237
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,509
It wasn't deliberate. We ran into a little
bit of heavy haze, and I lost contact.

238
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,592
And then you happened
to find yourself over the target.

239
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,990
It says in regulations
if a target of opportunity...

240
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,675
Don't tell me what it says in regulations.
This target didn't present itself.

241
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,035
You defied mission orders.
You went after it.

242
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,919
You went over a heavy flak corridor
at too low altitude...

243
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,798
...and risked every man
in your squadron.

244
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,997
I risk their lives every time
I take them off the ground.

245
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,037
Don't I, sir?

246
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,958
Anyway, we got through this one
all right. No one was hurt.

247
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,111
Except Braddock.

248
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,399
That was later, sir,
and it wasn't flak.

249
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,710
I'm sending Reconnaissance over to
photograph the submarine pens in Kiel.

250
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,633
And I think it'll show
that we clobbered them, sir.

251
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,711
It had better.

252
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,758
You may go.

253
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,834
One moment, Rickson.

254
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,274
Your navigator's Lt. Lynch,
I believe.

255
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,637
When you were lost in the haze,
why didn't he give you your bearings?

256
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,155
I guess you'd better ask him, sir.

257
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,754
You were gonna say
something, lieutenant?

258
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,676
No, sir.

259
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,031
That's all.

260
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,551
So I said to him,
"Let's go to London next leave."

261
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,550
I've done my dancing.
How about a little food?

262
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,956
Very good, Bolland.
Very, very good.

263
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,319
Excuse me.

264
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,078
Could you direct me
to the Eighth Avenue subway?

265
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,958
My name is Rickson.

266
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,952
What's yours?

267
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,991
Daphne Caldwell.

268
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,993
Daphne Caldwell,
Lt. Bolland.

269
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,235
- How do you do?
- Hello.

270
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,153
Bolland, you get the table.
I'll get the booze.

271
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,079
- Do you come from around here?
- No. I work in Cambridge.

272
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,952
- Hush-hush?
- Yes. A defence project.

273
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,751
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.

274
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,314
I'm a tourist.

275
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,439
Booked for 25 first-class missions.
Today was my seventh.

276
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,871
You're upset about something,
aren't you?

277
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,838
I was watching you
when you came in.

278
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,468
I had a date with a man named Pitt.

279
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,269
I've just been told he was
on a mission, didn't come back.

280
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,194
I'm sorry.

281
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,234
- There you go, Daphne.
- Thank you.

282
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,233
I never argue with luck...

283
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,756
...but what is a beautiful girl like you
doing running around by herself?

284
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,674
- My date didn't show up.
- He must be out of his mind.

285
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,350
Tell me, how do you like England?

286
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,192
The weather or the women?

287
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,432
- The weather.
- I think it's beautiful.

288
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,388
- Hi. Mind if I hijack the lady?
- Yes, I mind.

289
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,472
Thank you.
I'm not dancing tonight.

290
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,596
Some other time, maybe.

291
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,151
You really didn't answer
my question.

292
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,959
About England?
I'm having the time of my life.

293
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,317
There's only two things that mean
anything to me: Flying and women.

294
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,719
- In that order?
- In any order, or both together.

295
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,553
So you're enjoying the war?

296
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,834
- I like my work.
- Work?

297
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,234
Lady, I belong to the most destructive
group of men the world's ever known.

298
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,958
That's my work.

299
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,311
Hey, Buzz, look what
Reconnaissance just slipped me.

300
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,830
Wait till Mother Chicken sees this.
We clobbered them!

301
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,550
One, two, three, four, five, 10 direct
hits on the submarine pens at Kiel.

302
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,235
Those Germans ain't never
coming up for air.

303
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,198
Come on, fellas, come on.
We got them.

304
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,113
Come on, get up.
Get a bottle!

305
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,240
- Okay, come on, Buzz!
- Come on, Woodman!

306
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,799
You're all mine.

307
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,470
- Steady, John! Give me a bottle.
- Throw me a bottle. That's it.

308
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,231
Will you please take me to the bus?
There's one leaving at 12.

309
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,389
I'll be glad to.

310
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,793
I'd like to see you again.

311
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,032
I'm free Saturday afternoon
if you'd like to come to Cambridge.

312
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,232
I can't think of anything
I'd like better.

313
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,712
Good night.

314
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,073
Hey, Daphne!

315
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,357
Daphne! I don't know where you live.

316
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,957
- Hey, why'd you miss interrogation?
- I've got to get the bus to Cambridge.

317
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,512
I've got a date. If I can find her.

318
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,389
With the English girl?
Well, what do you know?

319
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,634
I'm telling you, Bolland,
she was giving me the eye.

320
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,638
- You got the eyes crossed.
- Don't worry. She's not my type.

321
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,631
- Too intellectual.
- Mail call.

322
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,279
I got it.

323
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,390
For you, Bolland.

324
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,273
Know what I'm gonna have to do?

325
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,513
Write me a letter and have 25 copies
sent to all my girls in the States.

326
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,274
I could get knocked off over here,
and nobody'd ever know.

327
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,908
When were you home last?

328
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,873
Home? You tell me where it is, Bolland.
I'll tell you how long ago it was.

329
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,358
It's from Daphne. She can meet me
at the quad of the King's College.

330
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,196
You two ought to have a ball
in that library with all those books.

331
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,079
Maybe I won't see you until tomorrow.

332
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,800
Sonny's growing up.
Staying overnight, huh?

333
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,428
Maybe. If the library stays open.

334
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,997
So long, Buzz.

335
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,518
- Hello.
- Hello.

336
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,956
- Are you enjoying the madrigals?
- Is that what they are?

337
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,550
- Sixteenth-century pop tunes.
- You English are wonderful.

338
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,110
Half the world is blowing up, and you
go on singing music 400 years old.

339
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,231
You must think we're in a groove.

340
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,518
- Would you like to walk down to the river?
- You're the guide.

341
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,952
It's so wonderfully old.

342
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,153
Maybe Shakespeare and Ben Jonson
stood on this very bridge.

343
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,515
You're very American.

344
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,800
- Why?
- Well, romantic.

345
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,958
I like things that last.

346
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,317
Things last longer than people.

347
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,431
I wrote to Pitt's parents today.

348
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,558
Were you in love with him?

349
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,269
No. I didn't know him very well.

350
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,193
But he was a very nice man.

351
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,592
He was on Braddock's plane.
We saw it go down.

352
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,228
Your pilot, what's his name,
Rickson?

353
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,231
Buzz, yeah. Buzz Rickson.

354
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,358
Is he really that good?
They were making such a fuss over him.

355
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,829
- The best.
- Is he?

356
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,391
Yes. You see, well, I fly by the book...

357
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,830
...but Buzz flies like
he's a part of the plane.

358
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,436
Whenever we get into trouble, he knows
what to do without even thinking.

359
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,830
He's sort of your hero, isn't he?

360
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,434
I get sore at him once in a while.
We all do.

361
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,716
But we wouldn't trade him
for any other pilot.

362
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,032
I hope his luck holds out.
And yours.

363
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,000
Right now, my luck's doing fine.

364
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,909
It's started to rain again.
Shall we go somewhere until it stops?

365
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,874
- What about your lab?
- No, we can't. It's against the rules.

366
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,235
But we could wait in the library.

367
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,836
No, not the library.
It's just something that Buzz said.

368
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,395
Hey, Buzz, are you ready?

369
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,238
Get it over with, will you, captain?

370
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,231
Keep your pants on.
You're getting paid.

371
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,515
Not by the hour.

372
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,955
Ten bob if I miss.
A quid if you get hit, right?

373
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,511
- Don't even mention it.
- I never miss. Except once. I was drunk.

374
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,955
- What happened?
- We sent the quid to his mother...

375
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,429
...and gave the guy a decent burial.

376
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,276
That is true. He'll get it.
He's better than Davy Crockett.

377
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,751
- Now we'll do it with just the egg.
- Nothing do...

378
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,110
Come here, Junior.

379
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,630
Gee, thanks, Buzz. Come on,
I'll buy you boys a drink, eh?

380
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,797
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Junior?

381
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,393
This is Junior Sailen.
He's the pilot of our fortress.

382
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,437
Hey, no, Buzz, not her.

383
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,154
What, this little chappie?

384
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,232
It's one of the smaller fortresses.
We've got them in all sizes.

385
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,590
Hey, come on over
and meet Junior's new girl.

386
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,390
- New girl? I haven't got a new girl.
- You've been holding out on us, Junior.

387
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,710
- What's your name?
- Hazel.

388
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,878
That's a very nice name.
It fits you like a glove.

389
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,953
You're pulling my leg.
You Yanks are all alike.

390
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,348
Real modest too.

391
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,795
Hazel, did you ever think of going
on a stage?

392
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,878
Definitely the home type, Junior.
You picked yourself a winner.

393
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,591
- Excuse me, I got work to do.
- Don't run out on your boyfriend now.

394
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,672
- Come on, Junior, get on the ball.
- Come on, Junior!

395
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,877
- I'm not a boy...
- Come on!

396
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,878
Let her go!

397
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,476
Since when did you start giving orders,
Lynch?

398
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,756
I'm not giving orders.
We're guests here.

399
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,559
And it would be nice if we started
acting like guests.

400
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,950
Look, sonny, you don't know
east from west.

401
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,908
Why don't you get out of here
and see if you can find your way home?

402
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,519
- It's an air raid.
- Well, come on, then.

403
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,673
- And leave the Yanks with the whiskey?
- They don't want to get killed either.

404
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,917
That's the Jerries, boys.
They're coming back again.

405
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,119
- There's a shelter down the road.
- Come on, Alf. Down the cellar.

406
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,550
Come on, Alf!

407
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,276
You coming, Buzz?

408
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,068
The hell with it.

409
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,310
Come on, Brindt, free liquor.

410
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,398
Cheers.

411
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,709
You know where I had my first drink,
Max?

412
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,919
When I was 13 and on the road.

413
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,997
One night, I got terribly hungry. I went up
to a farmhouse to get something to eat.

414
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,069
This woman invited me in.

415
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,550
She wasn't bad-looking either...

416
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,473
...except she was old enough
to be my mother.

417
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,916
She kept me there 72 hours.

418
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,436
Man, did I learn a thing or two.

419
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,078
The boy who came to dinner.

420
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,316
Buzz, we can get killed in this trap!

421
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,230
That's how I got my schooling, Max.
The hard way.

422
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,551
Not like Bolland and Lynch.

423
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,231
All they know about life...

424
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,113
...is what comes out of books.

425
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,477
Listen, you, when you've made a bomb
big enough to kill Rickson...

426
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,871
...come back and blow up the world!

427
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,471
They're bombing quite a way off now.

428
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,439
All right?

429
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,589
I'll never get used to air raids.

430
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,479
You've gone through some bad ones
in London, haven't you?

431
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,631
My father was killed in one.

432
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,112
He left the house one morning,
and that's the last we ever saw of him.

433
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,438
You must hate the Germans.

434
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,592
I hate war and everything about it...

435
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,230
...unlike your friend, Capt. Rickson.

436
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,079
I had a feeling that night at the dance
that you were running away from Buzz.

437
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,629
Perhaps I was.

438
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,711
Most women find him attractive.

439
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,316
He is, in a dangerous sort of way.

440
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,233
Why do we always end up talking
about Buzz?

441
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,674
You started it.

442
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,593
That's right, I did.

443
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,389
I was in love with a man like him once.

444
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,997
At least, I thought it was love
till I found out what he was like.

445
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,988
Don't look at me like that. You must
have had a girl back in the States.

446
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,110
I wasn't exactly in love with her.

447
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,236
Our parents were friends.
We grew up together.

448
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,153
We don't write anymore. She's
probably going out with somebody else.

449
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,958
Like you.

450
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,518
Daphne...

451
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,116
I even like to say that name.

452
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,592
Today on the mission, I kept saying it
over and over. Daphne.

453
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,075
That's the only air raid
I've ever enjoyed.

454
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,431
Good night.

455
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,075
I don't want to go back.

456
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,913
You don't have to.

457
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,199
What about your landlady?

458
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,277
Quiet.

459
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,718
Not very grand, is it?

460
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,878
You'd never make a good thief.

461
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,473
I don't suppose you're very hungry
after that dinner...

462
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,872
...but if you'd like a cup of tea,
it's no trouble for me to make.

463
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,074
Don't you think it's time you told
me your first name?

464
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,756
Ed. Most people call me Bo.

465
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,471
Bo. I like that. Bo.

466
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,471
Daphne...

467
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,631
Yes, I know.

468
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,708
Come on in, Zebra 1.
All clear for landing.

469
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,316
Roger. Zebra 1, clear for landing.

470
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,436
You look like you swallowed
those leaflets.

471
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,151
Emmet's stuck in my throat. Leaflets!
I'm here to drop bombs, not paper.

472
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,629
What's the difference?
We chalked up another mission.

473
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,672
Not quite.

474
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,038
Not quite.

475
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,955
Are you out of your mind?

476
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,519
Have Capt. Rickson report
to Operations right after interrogation.

477
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,832
No, wait. Send for his copilot instead,
Lt. Bolland.

478
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,230
And ask the flight surgeon
to be present.

479
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,719
<i>Yes, sir:</i>

480
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,879
I suppose if the window had been open,
Rickson would've flown you into the room.

481
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,636
- Well, I think he was a little upset, sir.
- Upset?

482
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,917
Well, you see, Capt. Rickson
didn't like the idea...

483
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,755
...of having to drop propaganda leaflets
on his mission instead of bombs.

484
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,911
You mean his little stunt
was a reprisal...

485
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,799
...for having to carry out an order
of which he disapproved?

486
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,030
I wouldn't exactly say that, sir.

487
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,159
What's your opinion of Capt. Rickson's
qualifications as a pilot?

488
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,197
The crew feels safe with him, colonel.

489
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,352
He's a great pilot. He's pulled us
out of some tight spots.

490
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,991
- Are you speaking for the entire crew?
- I believe so, sir.

491
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,395
What's your opinion
of Lt. Lynch?

492
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,838
I think he's one of the steadiest men
in the group. I'd trust him anywhere.

493
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,639
Apparently Capt. Rickson
doesn't agree with you.

494
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,268
He feels Lynch is on the verge
of a crackup.

495
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,908
- He's asked us to have him grounded.
- Rickson said that?

496
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,559
Yes.

497
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,392
Well, I think he's mistaken, sir.

498
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,791
You see, he and Capt. Rickson
aren't on very good terms.

499
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,234
We gathered that.

500
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,915
Lieutenant, we feel you're about ready
to command your own plane.

501
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,548
Would you like to be transferred from
Rickson's crew...

502
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,756
...while we put you through
some training?

503
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,150
- Are you giving me a choice, sir?
- Yes.

504
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,597
- I'll stay with my own present crew.
- And Capt. Rickson?

505
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,553
Yes, sir.

506
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,518
Well, that's all, lieutenant.

507
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,758
Well, what's your opinion, doc?

508
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,469
I'd be inclined to grant Rickson's request.
I know both men quite well.

509
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,596
He and Lynch have never hit it off.

510
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,433
We transfer Lt. Lynch
to Capt. Woodman.

511
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,670
Now, what about Rickson?

512
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,831
We never know what stunt he'll pull next.

513
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,949
- Can we afford to have that sort of pilot?
- Can we afford not to have him?

514
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,678
What's your opinion, doc?

515
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,834
Rickson's an example of the fine line that
separates the hero from the psychopath.

516
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,991
Which side of the line
do you place Rickson?

517
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,516
Time will tell.
I suppose we're running a risk...

518
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,955
...but then that's the nature of war.

519
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,349
Did you ever try to score
with a girl in the air?

520
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,071
No. But I tried it underwater once.

521
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,798
And I nearly drowned.

522
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,155
Louie Baker and I sneaked a plane out
one night.

523
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:16,793
We had two girls. Took them up, put on
the automatic pilot and... Whammo!

524
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,155
Six ball in the corner.

525
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,793
Hi, Bo.

526
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,669
Would've liked to have seen Emmet's
face when we buzzed his window.

527
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,713
Bet I don't go on any more paper raids.
Eh, Bolland?

528
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,918
Emmet's out to nail me. I can fly circles
around him, and he knows it.

529
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,072
Why did you tell him that stuff
about Lynch?

530
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,993
So that's why they wanted to see you.

531
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,755
Scratch.

532
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,956
Yeah.

533
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,919
Marty's the last guy to crack up,
and you know it.

534
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,075
I don't know it. Lynch is an amateur.
One amateur can kill nine professionals.

535
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,676
- He's a first-rate guy.
- All right, he's a first-rate guy.

536
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,037
- The graveyards are full of them.
- You don't like him.

537
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,192
That was just an excuse
to get rid of him.

538
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,438
Why don't you and your girlfriend
go curl up in a library...

539
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,113
...and let me run the crew, huh?

540
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,556
- Leave Daphne out of this.
- I have so far. Maybe I should move in.

541
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,110
- What makes you think you can?
- Want me to try?

542
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,554
That's up to you.

543
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,156
- It won't be the same without you, Marty.
- You got a stamp on you?

544
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,032
Don't worry about me, Bolland.

545
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,636
I'll miss the rest of you guys,
but as for Rickson, good riddance.

546
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,110
- I'd sooner have Woodman.
- I don't know.

547
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,511
It's the difference
between talent and genius.

548
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,355
- Buzz is cut out for this sort of thing.
- So are the Germans, for that matter.

549
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,354
Give Rickson a bomber or a machine gun,
and he could be on either side.

550
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,714
Pretty bad cold.

551
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,998
I forgot to wear my second pair of socks
on the Frankfurt mission.

552
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,395
- That a new picture of the kids?
- Yeah. Mom took it down by the cottage.

553
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,358
- How old are they now?
- John's 5 and Margie's 7.

554
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,435
How's it feel to be a married man?

555
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,477
Well, right now, mighty lonely.

556
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,074
I mean, it's a big responsibility,
marriage and kids.

557
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,468
Is that bad?

558
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,870
I don't know. I'm just asking.

559
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,837
How's that girl of yours?

560
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,956
- Daphne.
- Yeah, Daphne.

561
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,236
I see her whenever I can.

562
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,356
Sam...

563
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,118
- I don't think he's telling us everything.
- Don't jump to any conclusions.

564
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,670
Seven more missions,
and I'm on my way home.

565
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,193
See you, Marty. Take it easy.
Good luck.

566
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,479
Thanks.

567
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,153
- Where are you going?
- We're going out to eat, aren't we?

568
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,639
Are we?

569
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,351
Darling, I know it's not very romantic,
but I'm starving.

570
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,671
What shall I wear?

571
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,320
I like you this way.

572
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,200
That guy who was in love with you...

573
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,157
Which one?

574
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,197
Was there more than one?

575
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,113
Well, there's only one now, darling.

576
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,356
The one you said that was like Buzz.

577
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,157
Rusty Miller.

578
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,831
He was killed earlier in the war.
He was a paratrooper in North Africa.

579
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,560
Do you like my hair this way?

580
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,152
I like your hair, period.

581
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,714
It's hard to explain my feelings
about Buzz and Rusty.

582
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,637
It's almost as if they like fighting
more than the things they're fighting for.

583
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,551
You sound like Marty Lynch.

584
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,790
You and Marty are lucky.

585
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,954
You don't like what you do, but you think
something good will come out of it.

586
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,192
No, I don't believe all the things
they tell us.

587
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,399
All that propaganda and stuff
that you read in the magazines.

588
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,394
Keep the world safe
for the <i>Reader's Digest:</i>

589
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,279
I know you don't.

590
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,398
But you are on the side of life.

591
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,156
Is that enough?

592
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,993
It's enough for me.

593
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:47,116
Darling Bo, if we don't eat now,
we will die of starvation.

594
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,076
Can you see the name?

595
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,954
The House of Usher.

596
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,309
Woodman.

597
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,439
It's a wonder he's still in the air.
Must have been hit by cannon fire.

598
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,160
She's full of holes,
and her landing gear's shot away.

599
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,878
Belly landing.

600
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,989
Lynch?

601
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,310
Up front.

602
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,790
Come and see me later.

603
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,593
He'll be buried in the American cemetery
at Cambridge tomorrow. You'll get leave.

604
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,829
What about his wife?

605
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,635
She'll get the usual telegram
when the machinery grinds a bit.

606
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,031
I think she'd appreciate hearing
from you, though.

607
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,634
Take two of these tonight.

608
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,155
- No, thanks, doc.
- Sorry, Bo, that's an order.

609
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,197
Sleep is the only antidote we know.

610
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,750
In time, you can even work up
an immunity to death.

611
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,036
Does the world ever make you
want to throw up?

612
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,955
I consider war a complete negation
of rational behaviour.

613
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,676
Marty had a lot to live for, doc.

614
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,991
In that case, he was probably
more prepared to die than most of us.

615
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,958
- Is anyone ever ready to die?
- No, I guess not.

616
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,076
No healthy person anyway.

617
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,392
I'm sorry. I guess I was using a clich
because I've nothing better to offer.

618
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,632
Bo, don't blame Rickson for this.

619
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,473
Rickson built up an image
of himself Lynch didn't buy.

620
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,158
He had to get Lynch out, or his hard shell
might have cracked wide open.

621
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,751
- Thanks, doc.
- Try and get some sleep.

622
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,750
We'll send the rest of his stuff
to his wife.

623
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,674
- Don't know what we'll do with the mutt.
- Come on, Sam.

624
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,876
We could teach him to bite
sergeants on sight.

625
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,271
Maybe throw in a couple of colonels
for good measure, huh?

626
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,556
Put down that dog.

627
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,156
You couldn't wait until he was buried
to get your hands on what you wanted.

628
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,709
Somebody's got to take care
of the mutt.

629
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,950
Not you. Put him down.

630
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,757
All right. He's down.

631
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,710
And don't touch any of Marty's things.

632
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,269
Bolland, you're behaving
like a sucking crybaby.

633
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,319
This is a man's racket we're in.
Men get killed flying airplanes in war.

634
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,675
If you hadn't dumped him,
he'd still be alive.

635
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,469
Watch yourself, Bolland.
You might be the next one I dump.

636
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,032
You think you're pretty tough, don't you?

637
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,679
Yes.

638
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,878
Yes, I do.

639
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,513
I'll help you pack his things.

640
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,438
How near are we to London, Haverstraw?

641
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,799
About 043 degrees west, due in about
12 minutes if the train stays on the track.

642
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,748
Late again. I'm gonna miss
the first act.

643
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,157
Bo, what are you and Daphne doing?
I don't mean the intimate details.

644
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,232
We haven't planned anything.
Maybe the Paris Club tomorrow night.

645
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,232
It's quite a joint. Full of free
French dames. And I mean free.

646
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,710
One of the four freedoms, parson.
After all...

647
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,632
...the French are our allies.

648
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,677
Yes. Yes, indeed.

649
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,994
They smell pretty good. Could I...?
Could I borrow one of those sandwiches?

650
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,310
Yes, of course.

651
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,910
When I get through
with this crummy war...

652
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,674
...I might just quit flying,
go into your business.

653
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,512
You mean, take holy orders?

654
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,752
I don't know about taking more orders,
but I'd like to sound off...

655
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,354
...at all those sergeants
down in the congregation.

656
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,956
I'd sure give them hellfire
and brimstone.

657
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,759
Well, I'm gonna go up
and talk to the pilot. Engine driver.

658
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,388
They have rules about passengers
riding on the engine.

659
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,835
I make my own rules, Max.

660
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,795
Nice talking to you, parson.

661
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,430
All right, men. Straighten up.
Straighten up.

662
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,396
Why waste a 48-hour pass
fooling around?

663
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,915
Set up a little game of stud poker
in London...

664
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,071
...then Junior and I'll have a stake
when we go home.

665
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,798
Only you just keep losing.

666
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,952
- Don't be a sucker, Junior.
- Don't give him your dough.

667
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,998
I got it already. You don't think
I'd let him have it, do you?

668
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,639
It's the same every leave.

669
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,916
We go flat broke
and can't afford any dames.

670
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,991
Dames, always dames.

671
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,869
- Junior, you can't put dames in a bank.
- That's not where I want to put them.

672
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,589
I think your brain is scrambled,
turning upside down in that ball turret.

673
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,833
- Well, the kid's making good sense to me.
- Scrambled? Me, scrambled?

674
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,232
Two kills and three probables.
And that's not counting the next one.

675
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,515
Lieutenant?

676
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,357
Got a hot rumour there's a big one
coming up on Leipzig.

677
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,193
- Think we're gonna get it?
- Haven't you read those posters?

678
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,555
Yeah. "Enemy ears are listening."

679
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,111
Forget it. Have fun in London.
And take good care of Junior.

680
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,710
Look, I guess Junior's sort of
adopted me, or me him.

681
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,871
I don't know which.

682
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,318
Anyway, that's why I tell him
I'm playing poker for a stake.

683
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,750
Me and Junior in business back home.
What a laugh.

684
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,354
What am I gonna do,
tell him the truth?

685
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,034
That we're both scared?

686
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,795
Playing poker helps me take
my mind off it, that's all.

687
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,957
We've all got that problem, haven't we?

688
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,592
Yeah, I guess you're right, lieutenant.

689
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,353
Anyway, there's only two more to go.

690
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,228
Hey, Buzz, cut it out will you?

691
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,310
- We don't want a Turkish bath!
- Hey, when did you join the union?

692
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,076
Hey, I knew it.
That hat looks good.

693
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,958
- Is this the only newsstand here?
- All the latest news.

694
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:39,399
- No, I'm supposed to meet someone here.
- There's three down here and one above.

695
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,991
- Darling, I have a surprise.
- What?

696
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,038
I borrowed my aunt's flat
for the weekend. We can be alone.

697
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,350
I love your aunt.

698
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,230
Hello, Yank.

699
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,313
You must be on the swing shift.

700
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,268
You're the live one, you are,
at this hour of the morning.

701
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,156
- How far's your place from here?
- Not more than 3 shillings by taxi.

702
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,359
- Cosy, comfortable, real homelike.
- I'll bet. Breakfast too?

703
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,670
Cup of strong tea
and a nice bit of toast.

704
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,389
That's for those who behaves themselves
and don't throw the furniture around.

705
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,199
- You look the sort.
- The sort of what?

706
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,272
- Gentleman's what I mean.
- Well, that's where you're wrong.

707
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,955
I'm the sort that throws
the furniture around.

708
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,510
I can see I'm wasting me time.

709
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,830
Five pounds. What's that for?

710
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,838
Buy yourself a dress.

711
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,073
And when you look in the mirror,
call yourself Daphne.

712
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,638
Daphne.

713
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,996
You Yanks!

714
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,120
- I'd like to set that clock back 48 hours.
- So would I, darling.

715
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,191
You don't have to remind me too.

716
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,998
Do me up, darling.

717
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,275
Did you used to come here
when you were a kid?

718
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,271
Every Friday night with auntie.

719
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,317
All very formal and proper.

720
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,711
- What would she say if she knew?
- Don't even mention it.

721
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,031
Hold still. This is a hard enough job.

722
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,237
You sound just like a husband.

723
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,591
I have an aunt that looks
something like her. Aunt Lila.

724
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,950
She has a big house
up on Narragansett.

725
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,839
- What did you do there?
- Loaf around.

726
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,831
We used to take girls out sailing.

727
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,434
We had a catboat. Dig for clams.

728
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,909
Would I like to have some
of those now!

729
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,036
- No fair. You know what that does to me.
- Well?

730
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,360
Do you ever wonder about us?

731
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,033
Your tour's nearly finished.

732
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,558
I want to get the war over
and done with.

733
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,392
That's as far as I let myself think.

734
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,189
What you're telling me
is, you're going back home soon.

735
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,118
Darling, we're together now...

736
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,068
...and it's all been wonderful.
Isn't that enough?

737
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,834
Yes, I suppose it is.

738
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,037
Then why are we getting so serious?

739
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,109
I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean to.

740
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:29,519
I'll finish dressing and we'll go. No one
ever gets serious at the Paris Club.

741
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,959
Tonight, I love everyone:

742
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,113
The Polish, the French, the Norwegians,
the Dutch, the Danish.

743
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,033
- How about Americans?
- Especially Americans.

744
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,193
Bless them for Lend-Lease
and for lending me Bo.

745
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,956
Even if it is a short-term lease.

746
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,873
Could I have another drink, please?

747
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,796
I'll get it. It'll be easier.

748
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,910
- My friend's bringing me one.
- Until he comes.

749
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,638
But I'm robbing you.

750
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,509
Tonight, everything belongs to everyone.

751
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,756
To France.

752
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,757
And to our American friends.

753
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,238
- Hello.
- Hello.

754
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,073
You know, I had an idea
I'd find you here.

755
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,874
- Where's Bolland?
- Getting some drinks.

756
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,270
I don't blame him for keeping you
to himself.

757
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,113
Has that been too hard on you,
captain?

758
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,114
- Well, I never try to steal a friend's girl.
- That's very ethical of you.

759
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,236
At least until I get the all clear.

760
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,834
I don't think I follow you.

761
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,750
- Bolland's last mission is coming up.
- Yours too, I take it.

762
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,832
- I'm staying here as long as the war lasts.
- A patriot.

763
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,150
Nuts! I like it here.

764
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,032
You don't have trouble getting girls,
captain. Why me?

765
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,839
Why not? You sure put roses
in Bolland's cheeks.

766
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,275
And now you think I'll put roses
in yours?

767
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,514
Could be.

768
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,832
- Hi, Buzz.
- Hi.

769
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,718
Thank you, darling.

770
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,873
- I thought you'd be painting the town.
- We took in a few churches.

771
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,749
- Where's the rest of the gang?
- I don't know.

772
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,115
- I like to do my hunting alone.
- Hunting?

773
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,033
- Hunting.
- Supposing the game won't play?

774
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,556
It will.

775
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,473
You must keep your girls
stashed someplace.

776
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,598
Maybe he's saving himself
for a great love.

777
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,671
That's what women like to think.

778
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,717
Have you ever been in love, captain?

779
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,074
I'm serious. Have you?

780
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,550
In wartime, you don't fall in love.
You make love. You know what I mean?

781
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,837
That's all right for the men.
What about the women?

782
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,318
- It's train time. We'd better be moving.
- What's the hurry?

783
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,597
- I'm going to take Daphne home.
- I can get home by myself.

784
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,830
I'm taking you home.

785
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,949
You two act like
you're married already.

786
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,153
I think I want to go home.

787
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,554
I'll get you a cab.

788
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,311
Taxi!

789
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,515
- See you at the train.
- Sure.

790
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,839
- Fifty-two Bedford Place.
- Right, sir.

791
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,037
What is it, darling?
Is something wrong?

792
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,430
I hate endings.

793
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,876
I'm gonna see you on my next leave,
won't I?

794
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:56,477
One day soon there won't be any more
leaves. You'll be on your way back home.

795
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,676
We both knew that from the start.

796
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,912
That doesn't make it any easier.

797
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,196
No, please.

798
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,831
You didn't act this way
before Buzz appeared.

799
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,116
He has nothing to do with it.

800
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,350
I'm not so sure.

801
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,829
You said there was a side of you
Buzz appealed to.

802
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,197
Not the side that I admire.

803
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,193
It was no accident,
his coming over tonight.

804
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,476
He figured this was the right time
to move in.

805
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,509
Were your intentions so different?
Except he was more frank about his.

806
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,353
- You think my feelings are the same?
- Be honest, Bo.

807
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,798
All you wanted was a war girl,
that's all.

808
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,474
I probably got what I deserved.

809
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,354
- Wait for me. I've got a train to catch.
- Right, guv.

810
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,312
Bo, I didn't mean all I said.

811
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,109
You are different from Buzz, different
from anyone else in the whole world.

812
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,431
I've no right to blame you.
I just made a mistake, that's all.

813
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,398
I shouldn't have fallen in love
with you.

814
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,830
Goodbye, Bo.

815
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,679
- King's Cross Station.
- Right, guv.

816
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,990
Bloody war.

817
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,873
Aren't you supposed to be on your way
back to the base?

818
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,678
Well, there's always another train.

819
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,396
Nice place you've got here.

820
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,391
What I can see of it.

821
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,711
Nice.

822
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,559
Very, very ni...

823
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,358
Nice.

824
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,239
- No, thank you.
- Do you mind if I do?

825
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,676
You do pretty much as you like anyway.

826
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,150
- Don't you?
- Pretty much.

827
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,196
Incidentally, I like you in that outfit.

828
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,836
Cheers.

829
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,719
I also like the way you looked at me
at the club tonight.

830
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,155
Well, you were wrong.

831
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,112
- Where's Buzz?
- Isn't he here?

832
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,556
No, not yet.
Maybe he's driving.

833
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,398
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just another American pilot.

834
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,510
Not quite, honey.

835
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,238
What makes you so special?

836
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,949
I'm good.
That's what makes me special.

837
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,111
And <i>The Body: : :</i>

838
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,479
...is my body.
- Supposing <i>The Body</i> gets hit?

839
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,316
What are we doing, playing games?

840
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,358
Bolland's out, and I'm making my move.

841
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,069
It's as simple as that, is it?
Look, captain...

842
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,277
- It is late, and I'd like to go to bed.
- So would I.

843
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,352
Please. I want you to go.

844
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,958
You're pretty funny.
You send out little messages.

845
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,793
- When I answer them, you start running.
- I found you attractive.

846
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,951
- Is that what you want?
- No.

847
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,553
But you're getting warm.

848
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,314
I once knew a man like you.
Take and give nothing back.

849
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,789
Get wise, Daphne. The world
belongs to the takers.

850
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,279
And there's another saying:

851
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,396
"The meek shall inherit the Earth."

852
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,391
Sounds like Lynch.

853
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,313
You hated Lynch, didn't you?

854
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,199
- He saw through you.
- I didn't come here to talk about Lynch.

855
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,989
No, you didn't. You came to prove
you could take me away from Bo.

856
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,197
I have nothing against Bolland.
He just isn't meant for war.

857
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,032
No one could say that about you.

858
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,714
You love to drop bombs,
smash cities, kill.

859
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,111
- That's war.
- That's why you love it. Why you stay.

860
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,272
That's right. I'm gonna stay
until the last bomb's dropped.

861
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,989
And when the war's over, what then?
You can't keep the war going forever.

862
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,233
And when it's finished, you'll have
no place to go, and I know you're scared.

863
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:52,750
You can't make love. You're twisted.
You can only make hate.

864
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,912
I'm in love with Bo.
Do you hear that?

865
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,479
I'm in love with Bo.

866
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,194
We got a mission coming up.

867
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,952
Sure.

868
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,914
Why did you stay in London?

869
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,834
Had a date I couldn't break.

870
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,560
I hope it was worth it.

871
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,154
You ought to know, Bolland.

872
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,871
- Lf you think I don't know you're lying...
- Fifty-two Bedford Place.

873
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,678
Want me to describe the room?

874
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,594
French windows, picture of a dame
over the mantelpiece, nice, soft...

875
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,153
You hit pretty good, Bolland.

876
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,790
Keep it up.
Someday you'll be in my class.

877
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,474
If anything's happened to Daphne...

878
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,710
...l'll kill you.

879
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,109
What is this? You guys been up
all night or something?

880
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,078
Get that light out of my eyes, Sully.

881
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,629
Briefing's at 0400.

882
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,036
Ten-hut!

883
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,310
As you were.

884
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,193
Carry on with the briefing, major.

885
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,233
Yes, gentlemen, this is it.

886
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,278
The big one. The big L.
Leipzig.

887
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,908
Six hundred and seventy-five miles
into Germany.

888
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,550
Deeper than any bomber force
has gone before.

889
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,430
Leipzig is the enemy's largest
synthetic-oil refinery.

890
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,478
I don't have to tell you how important
this target is.

891
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,634
Knock out their oil supply, and we
destroy the power of the Luftwaffe.

892
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,078
When the day comes for Allied soldiers
to invade the continent of Europe...

893
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,118
...we want them to see
only friendly planes overhead.

894
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,636
If you are successful in this mission,
you may hasten that day...

895
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,751
...and the end of the war.

896
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,072
Screen.

897
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,796
All right, lieutenant.

898
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,871
This is a detail of the target area.

899
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,112
Once you're over Leipzig,
you'll have no trouble recognising it.

900
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,589
You'll ignore this down here on the left.

901
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,672
They're fake. Dummy buildings
to throw you off.

902
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,990
Here's the refinery up here on the right.

903
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,469
North of the refinery,
you'll see a hospital.

904
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,713
It's a good marker to guide you.
But only a marker, not a target.

905
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,916
Lights, please.

906
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,392
Col. Emmet.

907
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,354
I'm not going to minimise
the danger of this raid.

908
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,353
This could be the toughest mission
the 8th Air Force has flown.

909
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,274
The enemy is getting desperate. They've
been unable to break up our formations.

910
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,795
Lately, they've been coming in
for head-on attacks.

911
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,839
You can expect them to be doing that
today, hitting us with all they've got.

912
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,348
British Spitfires and our P-47 s
will cover us as far as Amsterdam.

913
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,988
From there on...

914
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,076
...we're on our own.
About six hours over enemy territory.

915
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,677
Now, one word of comfort.

916
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,796
You won't be lonely.

917
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,838
You'll be part of the largest bombing
force ever assembled.

918
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,958
One thousand heavy bombers.

919
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:50,592
Due to the sheer length of this mission,
you'll be subject to more interceptions.

920
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,675
There are no less than 80 fields within
strike distance of the bomber streams.

921
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,276
So remember, conserve your ammo.

922
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:04,356
No long bursts. Just short, well-timed
and sighted shots.

923
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,671
Navigators and bombardiers will
remain for navigation briefing.

924
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,159
The rest of you may go.

925
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,078
And good luck.

926
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,436
- Colonel, can I ask something?
- Yeah.

927
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,956
I know it's against regulations, but
it's important to me personally.

928
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,396
- What is it?
- Permission to put in a call to London.

929
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,235
Full security's on. I couldn't give myself
permission to contact anyone off base.

930
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,675
I'm sorry, Bolland.

931
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,874
- Haverstraw, where are we?
- Over the Dutch coast, near Amsterdam.

932
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,391
Handown, did Blackie say anything
about checking the hydraulic fluid?

933
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,629
<i>Negative:</i>

934
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,439
- He was supposed to check it.
- He didn't say anything.

935
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,190
I forgot to ask him.
I meant to ask him.

936
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,113
The pressure was okay this morning.
I checked it on the preflight.

937
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,396
It was okay, huh?

938
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,799
<i>- Ball turret to waist gunner:</i>
<i>- What's up, Junior?</i>

939
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,394
- Junior, what's itching you down there?
<i>- Nothing, sir:</i>

940
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,597
- What do you mean, nothing?
<i>- It's betwee<i>n Farr and me, sir:</i>

941
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,955
- Farr, what's going on down there?
- Bandits!

942
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,718
About 20. Five o'clock high.

943
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,593
Holy crow, the sky's full of them!

944
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,599
<i>All right, get cracking: Get cracking:</i>
<i>Get on those guns:</i>

945
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,079
<i>All right, knock it off:</i>
<i>Watch him, he's moving around:</i>

946
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,038
<i>Bragliani, two o'clock: Two o'clock!</i>

947
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,430
- Coming in straight ahead.
- Nine o'clock, Farr. Get cracking!

948
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,034
What do you think I'm doing,
playing checkers?

949
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,868
- Hey, they got Perkins.
<i>- Get on it: They're coming your way:</i>

950
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,078
Captain, drop your right wing.
He's sitting on the right wing.

951
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,433
What's the matter? He was easy.
You didn't give us a chance.

952
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,190
Want to rest and let me take over
for a while?

953
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,310
Don't count me out yet, Bolland.

954
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,592
Somebody's lost his rabbit's foot.

955
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,719
I hope he doesn't need it.

956
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,038
Just north of Kassel, I'd say.
About 40 minutes to target.

957
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,997
A rough 40 minutes.

958
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,037
Feather number one. She's hit.

959
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,078
She's hit. Feather number one.

960
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,272
Haverstraw, how close to the IP?

961
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,599
Sixteen minutes. The lead squadron
should be over it now.

962
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,831
All right, Max. You ready to take over?

963
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,992
- We're 15 minutes away, sir.
<i>- All right: I heard you:</i>

964
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,155
<i>Twelve more from above:</i>
<i>Look at those flashes!</i>

965
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,796
The krauts must have cannons
or something. They're under the...

966
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,675
Ten of them at six o'clock.
Six more at six o'clock!

967
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,112
<i>Three <i>coming in at five o'clock:</i>

968
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:52,036
<i>Okay, Brag, you got him:</i>
<i>Here's four more at six o'clock:</i>

969
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,558
Three coming in at seven o'clock high.

970
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,868
They got Emmet!

971
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,395
You're group commander!

972
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,313
<i>Smok</i> e <i>in the bomb bay!</i>

973
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,271
I'm hit.

974
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,389
- Nothing to worry about.
- I can use my other hand.

975
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,551
Take it easy.
Let me bandage you first.

976
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,479
How's Bragliani?

977
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,790
He got it on the hand,
but he can still shoot.

978
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,315
We're on the IP.
Five minutes to target.

979
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,518
- You ready to take over, Max?
- Okay. Anytime you say.

980
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,675
All right, Max, she's all yours.

981
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,119
Two minutes.

982
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,838
Heavy flak ahead.

983
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,639
<i>Bomb doors open:</i>

984
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,872
<i>Bombs away!</i>

985
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,274
Okay, Buzz, I'm giving her back to you.
Let's go home.

986
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,599
You've got it.

987
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,112
Handown, I have a red light.
Check the bomb bay doors.

988
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,472
Bomb bay doors are jammed open.
One bomb is still hung up.

989
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,638
What?! Buzz, keep her steady.
We got trouble in the bomb bay.

990
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,712
- Try to crank it down by hand.
<i>- I'll try, sir:</i>

991
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,834
<i>It won't budge:</i>

992
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,039
- How about the bomb?
<i>- It's still with us, and it's live:</i>

993
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,873
All right, Max, see if you can
get that fuse out.

994
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:03,150
Third Bomb Division.
Yes, this is Col. Vogt.

995
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,352
Good.

996
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,473
That's fine.

997
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,872
All right.

998
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,635
Just got a flash from the lead ship.

999
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,519
Target was hit at 1230 hours exactly.

1000
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,558
- The fuse is set. I can't make it.
- We'll have to ride with it.

1001
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,920
- And land with it.
- Here they come again.

1002
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,875
- And land with it.
- Here they come again.

1003
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,519
Four of them at 11 o'clock.

1004
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,635
Mama mia, <i>there's no end to them!</i>

1005
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,395
Take Junior's place in the turret.
That's an order.

1006
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,834
Brindt, take Farr's place at the gun.

1007
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,679
You all right?

1008
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,077
They got Junior.

1009
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,152
His leg. I don't think
he's gonna make it.

1010
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,276
Take over.

1011
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,950
How is he?

1012
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,234
You want to take her?

1013
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,393
We're losing altitude.

1014
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,955
Buzz, we're losing altitude,
1800 and dropping.

1015
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,236
And number three is cutting out.

1016
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,869
Haverstraw, where are we?

1017
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,719
About 40 minutes to base
at the present speed.

1018
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,349
We're losing 50 feet a minute.
How does that figure?

1019
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,554
- Looks like we'll run a little short of air.
- He's right. We can't make it to base.

1020
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,119
We'll make it.

1021
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,317
Buzz, the brakes are out.
There's a bomb in the bomb bay.

1022
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,391
We can't ditch in the water.
The bomb would go off.

1023
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,152
I said, we'll make it.

1024
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,713
We're over the channel.

1025
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:32,112
The guys are wondering, if we're gonna
jump, oughtn't we call Air-Sea Rescue?

1026
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,829
I'm still giving the orders,
Haverstraw.

1027
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,118
We're under 1500 feet.

1028
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,232
If we get to shore, we won't have
enough air to clear the cliffs.

1029
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,392
I'm gonna bring this crate in.

1030
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:47,229
I'll show them.

1031
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,677
You'll show them?
That's all you ever think about.

1032
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,719
The men on this plane are not gonna
give up their lives to make you a hero.

1033
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,189
Afraid to die, Bolland?

1034
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,033
You're damned right I am.

1035
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,952
But you're scared to live.

1036
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,919
Make the call, Bolland.

1037
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,917
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Calling Air-Sea Rescue.

1038
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,355
Calling Air-Sea Rescue.
This is Zebra 1. Zebra 1.

1039
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,239
Come in, Air-Sea Rescue. Come in.

1040
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:28,520
<i>We hear you, Zebra 1: We hear you:</i>
<i>Give position: Give position:</i>

1041
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,513
Haverstraw, give our position.

1042
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,351
Mayday, mayday, this is Zebra 1.
Our position as follows...

1043
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:44,479
Prien's had it. Dump the heavy stuff
overboard. Everything that's loose.

1044
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,629
- Suppose the krauts hit us now?
- Don't even mention it.

1045
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,199
About Daphne. She beat me, Bolland.

1046
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:01,876
Beat me right to the ground.
Only woman that ever did.

1047
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,519
You think the meek
are gonna inherit the Earth?

1048
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,716
How would I know?

1049
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,348
Well, if they do...

1050
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,200
...count me out.

1051
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,914
There's your boat.

1052
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,793
We're under 600.
That's figuring it pretty close.

1053
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,359
I'll get the others out.

1054
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,955
We're over the launch.
Jump close together. Brag, you're last.

1055
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:35,272
Remember, we're close to the water.
Pull the cord as soon as you're clear.

1056
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,597
Go.

1057
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,957
Buzz, time to jump.
Put her on automatic.

1058
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,395
