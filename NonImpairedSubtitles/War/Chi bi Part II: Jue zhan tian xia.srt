1
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:19,085
I hereby decree that Prime Minister Cao Cao

2
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,283
lead the Imperial Army

3
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,081
to pacify the rebels Liu Bei and Sun Quan

4
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:26,005
Thank you, Your Majesty

5
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,599
These people are loyal to the Han Empire

6
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:48,560
They followed us to escape Cao Cao's regime

7
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:50,999
If we do not protect civilians

8
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,282
then what is the meaning of this war?

9
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:58,599
An alliance will strengthen us both

10
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:10,000
When a loser joins forces with a coward

11
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,238
what can they accomplish?

12
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,916
What the Southlands need is unity!

13
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,840
My decision to fight is final

14
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,157
Anyone who dares mention surrender

15
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:28,237
will end up like this table!

16
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:32,719
You need to fight this war

17
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,445
I am not afraid of him

18
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:38,804
I have been waiting for this day!

19
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,077
We shall fight, not waste time with words

20
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:54,595
Make camp there!

21
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,805
On the bank facing Red Cliff

22
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,598
Tomorrow we may be enemies

23
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:03,246
If that day ever comes

24
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:05,166
it will be each man for himself

25
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,846
Cao Cao has no experience in naval warfare

26
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,959
He must rely on Admirals Cai Mao and zhang Yun

27
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,839
If I can eliminate them

28
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,078
his navy will be powerless

29
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:55,724
Nice play!

30
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:08,202
These little monkeys are getting quicker!

31
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,444
The Prime Minister's order to practice Cuju (kickball)

32
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:13,565
Has toughened these kids up

33
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,357
Follow closely

34
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,520
Carry him inside quickly

35
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:12,965
Follow me

36
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:39,440
Just my stomach growling

37
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,243
Yes!

38
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:51,685
Goal!

39
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:54,315
What do you think? Not bad, right?

40
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,805
Block him!

41
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,801
Yeah!

42
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:38,600
Yeah!

43
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,964
That pot isn't wide enough

44
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,563
You would miss no matter how wide it was

45
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:27,676
Pitch pot is a game for aristocrats

46
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,521
not for soldiers in wartime

47
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:37,156
Your Honor, how'd you throw that bull's eye?

48
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,046
Concentration

49
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,441
When the enemy is over-confident

50
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:41,882
we must double our concentration

51
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,361
With concentration, you can kill a giant with a pebble

52
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:50,801
Your Highness, Zhou Yu's army is small

53
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,367
He'll have to resort to guerilla warfare

54
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:53,487
He'll have to resort to guerilla warfare
That last puny victory

55
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:54,556
That last puny victory

56
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,485
has made zhou Yu cocky

57
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:58,758
He's no guerilla warrior

58
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:01,640
He will confront us face to face

59
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:05,602
They are readying for battle

60
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:08,526
We need a strategy to counter them

61
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,155
Cao Cao wants to surround us

62
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,201
without breaking the basic rules of strategy

63
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,005
The first army to the field will be rested

64
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:19,767
The second army will arrive exhausted

65
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:21,082
Attack where the enemy is least prepared

66
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:22,516
Strike where they least expect it

67
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,360
We must concentrate all forces

68
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,085
on their strongest position

69
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:31,280
Naval victory depends on

70
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:36,447
Admirals Cai Mao and zhang Yun

71
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,487
Admirals Cai Mao and zhang Yun
We are loyal to Your Highness until death

72
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:39,320
We are loyal to Your Highness until death

73
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,675
Cao Cao underestimates us

74
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,525
He will never expect us to hit their navy

75
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,041
What is your name?

76
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,600
Private Sun Shucai

77
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:56,520
You are an outstanding player

78
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:58,884
and a good soldier

79
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:00,926
From this day forward

80
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,080
you are promoted to battalion commander

81
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:06,121
Thank you, Your Highness!

82
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,763
Everyone must practice hard at Cuju

83
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,285
only with tough bodies can we win this war

84
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:15,162
once the Southlands are subdued

85
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:20,238
your families will be exempt from taxes for three years

86
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,880
Thank you, Your Highness!

87
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,600
What are you doing?

88
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:00,476
I'm...

89
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:01,882
setting these birds free

90
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,883
That's very kind of you

91
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,366
You're leaving?

92
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,766
By your accent, I bet you're a Southerner

93
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,005
That's right

94
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,966
Southerners are warm-hearted people

95
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,006
Northerners are free-spirited

96
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm kind of dumb

97
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,836
People say my entire life...

98
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:32,476
You're not dumb, just too honest

99
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,201
You're good at Cuju

100
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,437
Thanks for heading the ball

101
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,163
What's your name?

102
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:44,437
My name is...

103
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:47,483
Look at the size of me

104
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,920
My mother calls me Piggy

105
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:53,165
Piggy?

106
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,519
So you can play Cuju right?

107
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,925
You kidding? I only know hacky-sack

108
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,160
Congratulations on your promotion

109
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:04,847
So does a commander get bigger meals?

110
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:06,635
You're a big officer now

111
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:08,280
You can eat as much as you want

112
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:11,765
Are you fighting just to fill your stomach?

113
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,083
Mother says my stomach is a bottomless pit

114
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,999
My family's too poor to feed me

115
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:19,517
We're Pit and Piggy!

116
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,519
What a pair!

117
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,601
The new environment has made our men ill

118
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,356
They are weak from a long war

119
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,199
and have lost all immunity

120
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:32,079
So typhoid quickly...

121
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,562
Can it be cured?

122
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:35,286
Yes

123
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,319
but not overnight

124
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:46,675
How many have died?

125
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,244
Over a hundred

126
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,039
In a few days, it will be out of control

127
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,566
We must bury them right away

128
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:54,766
No burials! We must cremate

129
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,083
Cremation is the only way to stop its spread

130
00:10:58,727 --> 00:10:59,762
Ready the funeral pyres

131
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:01,722
Hold on

132
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,245
"Epidemic outbreak"

133
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,078
The climate has weakened Cao Cao's army

134
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:19,436
Disease is rampant

135
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,438
Great

136
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:24,156
Your Honor, let's seize this chance and attack

137
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,359
The navy is still healthy

138
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:27,402
We must not act recklessly

139
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:29,757
Your Honor, this is the time to attack!

140
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:30,643
Yes!

141
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:33,005
This is a battle of honor

142
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,160
Even war must be fair

143
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:07,322
Your Highness

144
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,235
isn't this a bit inhumane?

145
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,597
Cast off the soldiers of the dead!

146
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,040
What's the matter?

147
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,245
Pull the boats here

148
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:07,765
Look, what is that?

149
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,441
Pull it here

150
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,959
They were enemy soldiers

151
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,243
Go report this to the general

152
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:18,237
Yes sir

153
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,281
Pile weapons and armor here

154
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,075
Put the corpses there

155
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,965
Get away from here

156
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:11,996
Don't touch them!

157
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,119
They died from typhoid!

158
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,284
Move! It's contagious!

159
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,763
Move! Don't touch anything!

160
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:19,916
Get out of here!

161
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:21,722
Everyone must leave!

162
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:24,326
Escort these people away

163
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:26,117
This is for your own good

164
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,157
This place is infected

165
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:28,835
Leave here immediately

166
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,562
Cao Cao is truly ruthless

167
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,478
Those soldiers have touched corpses

168
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,006
I've quarantined them

169
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,045
so they do not infect others

170
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:02,606
And the villagers?

171
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,598
I fear many have already been infected

172
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:08,000
Cao Cao has stooped to evil tricks

173
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,440
This is psychological warfare

174
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:12,439
He's attacking our morale

175
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,207
How to dispose of the bodies?

176
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:17,247
How to dispose of the bodies?
These are the bodies of our enemies

177
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,805
These are the bodies of our enemies

178
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,764
Feed them to the fishes

179
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,883
No, we must lay them to rest

180
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:24,117
No burials

181
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,646
We must cremate them

182
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,159
I lift my drink and sing a song

183
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:19,044
For who knows if life be short or long

184
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,045
Man's life is but the morning dew

185
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:25,764
Past days many, future ones few

186
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:29,120
The melancholy my heart begets

187
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,164
Comes from cares I cannot forget

188
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:33,645
Who can unravel these woes of mine?

189
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:37,916
I know but one man... the God of Wine!

190
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,323
Disciples dressed in blue

191
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,763
My heart worries for you

192
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,964
You are the cause

193
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,398
of this song without pause

194
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,360
Across the bank a deer bleats

195
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,118
in the wilds where it eats

196
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,040
Honored guests I salute

197
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,201
Strike the harp! Play the flute!

198
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,684
Bright is the moon's spark

199
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:10,521
Never ceasing, never dark

200
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,202
Thoughts of you from deep inside

201
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:17,964
Cannot settle, cannot subside

202
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,844
Stars around the moon are few

203
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,759
Southward the crows flew

204
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:24,645
Flying with no rest

205
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,599
Where shall they nest?

206
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:28,201
No mountain too steep

207
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,246
No ocean too deep

208
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,006
Sages rush when guests call

209
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:33,722
So at their feet...

210
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,241
the empire does fall!

211
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,800
Take your time. Careful, it's hot

212
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,001
More fall sick every day

213
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,122
You have enough medicine?

214
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:09,362
Cassia trees are scarce here

215
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,918
our men will keep searching

216
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,644
Can cassia cure typhoid?

217
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:18,599
It will ease current symptoms

218
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:21,437
But a true cure requires other ingredients

219
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:57,843
Hurry! Carry our men out!

220
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:58,763
Move it!

221
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,006
Stand up, let's go

222
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:02,846
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

223
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,796
General, what are you doing?

224
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,805
These patients cannot be moved

225
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:10,925
Hurry! Put our men on the horses

226
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,523
Please, these men must not leave

227
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:15,238
They are still ill

228
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:18,996
You're leaving?

229
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,080
Viceroy, this epidemic is beyond our control

230
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,927
I have barely twenty thousand men

231
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:35,047
I have barely twenty thousand men
If this continues, I might lose everything

232
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,436
If this continues, I might lose everything

233
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:41,363
I must retreat and reformulate my strategy

234
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,559
You withdraw at a moment like this?

235
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,363
You proposed this alliance

236
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,324
Now with our lives at stake you flee?

237
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,081
This is betrayal

238
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:52,799
You can't say that

239
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:54,806
We are men of our word

240
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,242
But look what has happened to our men

241
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,404
So our men count for nothing?

242
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:02,164
Selfishness

243
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:03,398
Who is selfish?

244
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,245
- Zhang Fei! - General!

245
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,121
My Lord, the battle is set

246
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:10,925
How can you...

247
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:12,002
Zhu-ge Liang

248
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,805
I have seen over a decade of defeat

249
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:20,518
I cannot endure another setback

250
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:25,597
Even soldiers must obey the law of survival

251
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,278
We must not lose our allies' trust

252
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,120
I know you feel strongly

253
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:33,280
But in chaotic times, you cannot live on justice alone

254
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:36,806
It's time I let others fight the tough battles

255
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:42,485
one day you will understand this

256
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,166
Liu Bei

257
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:52,164
It was an honor to fight alongside your men

258
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:55,120
We believed in the same goal

259
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,845
Achieving it will not be so easy after all

260
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:00,716
Take care

261
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:02,962
Take care

262
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,685
We shall meet again

263
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,366
Aren't you leaving?

264
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:32,278
A man must honor his promises

265
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,802
If I start something, I see it to the end

266
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:39,279
Anyone who talks like that is insane

267
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:42,916
Then we are all insane

268
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,084
Your Highness, tea is ready

269
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:11,600
Brother, scouts report

270
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:12,955
the typhoid was successful

271
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,566
The Southlands are in chaos

272
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:16,519
Good

273
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:17,802
one more thing

274
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:19,883
Liu Bei has left with all his men

275
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:21,164
Good

276
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,246
Their alliance is broken

277
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:27,003
Excellent

278
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:22,518
Swift as the wind

279
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:31,438
Gentle as a forest

280
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,284
Fierce as fire

281
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:55,125
Firm as a mountain

282
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:07,446
If you hate war

283
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:08,722
why can you quote "The Art of War"

284
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,364
To understand you

285
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,081
I must sneak glances at your books

286
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:16,843
Athousand books

287
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:18,765
cannot equal a cup of your tea

288
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:21,884
I'm happy so long as you enjoy it

289
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,237
I wish we could invite Cao Cao for tea

290
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,287
forget the war and just enjoy the scenery

291
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,279
Wouldn't that be great?

292
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:35,916
I doubt he appreciates the art of tea

293
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,198
You wield your sword

294
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:43,399
like you know a way to beat Cao Cao

295
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:45,526
Away as mysterious as darkness

296
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,838
And as powerful as thunder

297
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,839
It is time for us to act

298
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:09,880
Greetings, Your Highness

299
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:14,398
How goes the naval training, Admirals?

300
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:16,160
Very well, Your Highness

301
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:20,317
We're using iron beams to join the fleet

302
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:23,246
our men are Northerners and new to naval battle

303
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:26,803
Now our ships shall be stable as solid ground

304
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,527
Not even a storm will make our men seasick

305
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:31,517
Can they be separated?

306
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:33,279
Of course

307
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,359
Men, separate the ships

308
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,723
Unlocking the iron beams separates the ships

309
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:52,966
The fleet will move into pincer formation

310
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:54,362
ready for battle

311
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:56,483
You truly are naval experts

312
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,600
to invent this tactic

313
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,603
Thank you, Your Highness

314
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:01,407
Jiang Gan
At your service, Your Highness

315
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:03,045
At your service, Your Highness

316
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,565
You grew up with zhou Yu, right?

317
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:08,275
Yes, we were childhood friends

318
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,797
Cross the river. Urge him to surrender

319
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:12,446
Surrender?

320
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:15,485
Zhou Yu's loyalty to Sun Quan runs deep

321
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,367
I'm afraid he won't...

322
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:17,407
I'm afraid he won't...
The Southlands are falling apart

323
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:18,283
The Southlands are falling apart

324
00:26:18,447 --> 00:26:19,721
Liu Bei has fled

325
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,357
Now is the time to ask zhou Yu to surrender

326
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:23,717
Yes, Your Highness

327
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:48,358
Piggy?

328
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:49,883
Scared you didn't I?

329
00:26:58,647 --> 00:26:59,921
These guys keep tailing me

330
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:01,845
How can I have any fun like this?

331
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:06,764
You're battalion commander

332
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:08,200
They have to follow you

333
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,675
Listen up! Everyone go practice Cuju

334
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,201
Yes sir!

335
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:21,957
It worked!

336
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,762
Let's have some fun!

337
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:25,641
Great

338
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:29,404
What should we play?

339
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:30,404
Let's play...

340
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:32,921
Let's play "Ride High"

341
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:33,683
oK

342
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:34,799
Come on

343
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:38,963
You really are heavy

344
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,595
Your mother gave you the right nickname

345
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,357
This isn't high enough. Let's go up there

346
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:47,597
Watch your balance

347
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:49,803
Be careful

348
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:51,842
This high enough for you?

349
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:53,084
Yeah

350
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:54,517
Stay still

351
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,643
That itches

352
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:04,637
ltches?

353
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:06,962
Here, let me scratch it

354
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:09,437
Much better

355
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,363
Turn left

356
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:15,921
What's so interesting there? It's just the fleet

357
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:17,442
Don't move

358
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:23,997
My Lord

359
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:26,920
Cao Cao has several hundred thousand soldiers

360
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:29,678
We have only thirty thousand

361
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:32,038
We are totally outnumbered

362
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,962
How can we fight like this?

363
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,885
This will decide the fate of the Southlands

364
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:40,122
We must fight even if we cannot win

365
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:43,796
How many arrows do we have?

366
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:45,838
Not even fifty thousand

367
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:48,960
Liu Bei took forty thousand when he fled

368
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,316
Without those arrows, we cannot fight

369
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,644
The arrows are my responsibility

370
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:59,726
As well they should be. Your Lord took them

371
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:02,279
We need one hundred thousand arrows

372
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:04,520
You still think you can handle it?

373
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:08,724
Fine, if I cannot come up with one hundred thousand

374
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:11,598
you may take my head

375
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:14,523
We only have food for ten days

376
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:16,046
I give you ten days' time

377
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,881
I don't need ten, just three

378
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:21,836
We soldiers do not joke

379
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,078
You said you'd eliminate Admirals Cai Mao and zhang Yun

380
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,286
If not, then what?

381
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,282
You may have my head

382
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:49,282
By night, the Milky Way. By day, snaking clouds

383
00:29:58,007 --> 00:29:59,156
You were here all night

384
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:00,880
What are you up to?

385
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:02,915
See for yourself

386
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,563
Wind and water converge here

387
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:06,915
The feng shui is excellent

388
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:08,486
Glad you're relaxed

389
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,835
You are worrying me to death

390
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,996
The twenty ships with crew

391
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,162
you requested are ready

392
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:21,762
There's only one day left

393
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:23,123
Where are the arrows?

394
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:24,882
You haven't made even one

395
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:26,726
You should be in a nervous sweat

396
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:27,916
My sweat is of no concern

397
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:31,081
But see if the tortoise is sweating

398
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:34,237
It is

399
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,927
As I predicted, fog is coming

400
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:40,841
What fog?

401
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:42,600
The only fog here is around my head

402
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:45,041
What is this plan of yours?

403
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,003
Nature's secrets cannot be revealed

404
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:54,806
old cow plows the paddy's rows

405
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:59,445
Young calf munches on what grows

406
00:31:00,447 --> 00:31:01,277
You really are something

407
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,920
Back then you were just a kid who loved to sing

408
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:09,443
Who'd have guessed that kid would be a Viceroy

409
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:15,080
Planting rice is the old man's chore

410
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:18,684
We were ten when you clubbed that bandit from behind

411
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:21,202
He spun around and somehow the club was in my hands

412
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:25,516
He gave me the beating of my life

413
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:30,245
In the sedan chair the young boy snores

414
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,359
To this day I still don't understand

415
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,405
how that club got into my hand

416
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:37,837
You're too slow

417
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:47,442
You remember that time

418
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:50,167
I wrote on the tutor's exam book in your handwriting

419
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,525
"senile bastard"!

420
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:54,482
That's right!

421
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:57,919
He gave me twenty swats across my butt

422
00:31:58,247 --> 00:31:59,600
Back in those days

423
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,119
there was no prank we didn't pull

424
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,323
I can trick any man I meet

425
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:07,520
But with you, I always play the fool

426
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:11,203
Bring my sword!

427
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:18,801
Marvelous!

428
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,998
You are a fine sword dancer

429
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,604
Are you here as Cao Cao's emissary?

430
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:01,557
Me?

431
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,519
I can barely speak for myself

432
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,964
How could I speak for Cao Cao?

433
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:08,436
I'm not as clever as you

434
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:10,365
but I know what song you're singing

435
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:12,521
You do not give me enough credit

436
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:14,758
I'd never disrespect a talented Southerner

437
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,565
but to serve Cao Cao is wrong

438
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,556
You have your Lord and I have mine, but...

439
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:20,876
No matter

440
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,520
Afew days from now

441
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:25,400
someone will lay Cao Cao's head at my feet

442
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:26,721
You believe me?

443
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,162
Yes, I do

444
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:30,837
Your Honor, urgent news!

445
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:32,846
Can't you see I have a guest?

446
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,280
I know we've no arrows

447
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,358
If Zhu-ge Liang fails to get more

448
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:50,602
I'll have his head

449
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,235
Maybe our friends across the river can help

450
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:55,960
They have a more important mission

451
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,566
Admirals Cai Mao and zhang Yun report

452
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,758
Cao Cao's head cannot be taken just yet

453
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:00,878
I fear...

454
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:02,042
Do not underestimate them

455
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:04,005
Here is their message

456
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:09,437
Excellent!

457
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:13,163
Mr. Jiang

458
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:16,366
What are you doing here alone?

459
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:18,357
Mrs. Zhou?

460
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,443
Come sit inside

461
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:21,644
Xiao Qiao, bring more wine

462
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:23,846
Any more and you'll be drunk

463
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,044
Come on, we'll drink more upstairs

464
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,522
Drink more?

465
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:29,723
Why end a good time?

466
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:36,001
I hear Cao Cao invaded the Southlands all for your wife

467
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:39,004
Is that so?

468
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:41,961
Cao Cao has a reputation for stealing men's wives

469
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,275
You're drunk

470
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:45,998
More wine

471
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,680
More? Where?

472
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:32,046
"We surrendered to Cao Cao"

473
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:35,245
"not for profit but out of desperation"

474
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,364
"We now have the Northerners entrapped in camp"

475
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:43,080
"Soon we will deliver his decap..."

476
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,916
"...his decapitated head"

477
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:48,596
"Further reports to come"

478
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:50,522
"Admiral Cai Mao"

479
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:51,757
What are you looking at?

480
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:56,041
Just one of my tricks

481
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:59,918
You do love to play tricks on me

482
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,001
I'll trick you again...

483
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:07,200
and again...

484
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:14,323
Not this time you won't

485
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:19,436
Scarecrow, you're more of a man than that fellow

486
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:21,558
That fellow doesn't tell me a thing

487
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:24,483
You're a better drinking buddy

488
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,637
Cheers!

489
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,637
Scarecrow

490
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,598
Why are we heading for the enemy camp?

491
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,525
You're not surrendering are you?

492
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:05,279
The enemy! The enemy is approaching!

493
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:07,238
Separate ships

494
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:14,244
Send the left flank to intercept the enemy

495
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:24,766
Faster

496
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:35,758
Scarecrow, stop drumming

497
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,522
What if Cao Cao's men come for us?

498
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:39,279
They wouldn't dare

499
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,758
A heavy fog might hide an ambush

500
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:43,155
oh so you've decided to talk to me

501
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:53,201
Ready all archers

502
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,042
Shoot at first sight

503
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:00,882
Ready!

504
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:03,237
All ships line up!

505
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:33,918
This is a plot to turn us against each other

506
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:40,160
We're not fools

507
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:44,520
Would zhou Yu use such an obvious trick?

508
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:46,723
Sometimes the simplest trick

509
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:49,361
is the best way to lead someone to their death

510
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:56,961
Shoot

511
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:16,840
Shoot!

512
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:40,519
Your Highness, whether this is a trick or not

513
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:42,838
we should proceed with caution

514
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:45,078
What if their navy mutinies?

515
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:46,276
That would be a disaster

516
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:48,837
Shoot!

517
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:54,755
Besides the letter

518
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:57,237
I heard them mention

519
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,278
friends here would get them arrows

520
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,202
Don't worry

521
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,920
Scarecrow will protect you

522
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:45,166
Cease drumming!

523
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:54,165
Call Admirals Cai Mao and zhang Yun in for questioning

524
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:57,721
They are out training the fleet

525
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,965
If they are not here, then their handwriting is

526
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:03,997
Bring their letter of surrender

527
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,202
Ready, all ships about-face!

528
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:07,438
What?

529
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:25,595
Drum in unison

530
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:27,325
Give them a target to shoot

531
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:34,240
Aim for the drums

532
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:37,201
shoot

533
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:42,846
Drink up

534
00:42:47,727 --> 00:42:48,762
Watch your seat

535
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:55,797
Fire at will!

536
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:16,563
The handwriting is a perfect match

537
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:18,958
and full of the same mistakes

538
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:24,603
This must be the work of Cai Mao

539
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:26,485
Shoot!

540
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:48,886
We return home victorious!

541
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:50,917
Cheers

542
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:12,520
Nothing but scared mice

543
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:13,603
Return to your positions!

544
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,877
Return to your positions!

545
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,523
Thank you Prime Minister for your gift

546
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,879
Thank you! Thank you!

547
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:52,283
Marvelous!

548
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:53,197
Mr. Zhu-ge!

549
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:54,356
Look!

550
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:58,684
How did you know the fog was coming?

551
00:44:58,847 --> 00:45:00,838
A clear Milky Way and snaking clouds

552
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,366
signal fog is near

553
00:45:02,447 --> 00:45:04,961
If you know how earth, sky, yin and yang change

554
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:07,198
then the sun, moon and stars

555
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:09,517
the wind, forest, mountains and fire

556
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:11,678
become soldiers at your command

557
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,237
So you can read Mother Nature's moods, huh?

558
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,123
We lost one!

559
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:20,444
- What a shame -Hey, come back!

560
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:03,365
A small victory hardly deserves such a reception

561
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:04,357
Your Highness

562
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:05,926
A small victory?

563
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:08,005
How many men did the enemy send?

564
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:10,317
Fog covered the river. Impossible to see

565
00:46:10,447 --> 00:46:12,961
If you could not see, how did you repel them?

566
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:14,645
Firing at will forced retreat

567
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:16,001
Firing at will?

568
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,759
How many arrows is that?

569
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:19,916
About one hundred thousand

570
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:21,282
About one hundred thousand

571
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:24,438
And why didn't you pursue them?

572
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:26,125
Fog meant possible ambush, Your Highness

573
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:27,243
So...

574
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:28,677
Again with the fog

575
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:35,444
Seems like you are hiding something in that fog

576
00:46:36,847 --> 00:46:38,803
Look, a boat is floating this way

577
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:40,526
Pull it in

578
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:08,922
Your Highness

579
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:12,479
Can't you tell a soldier from a scarecrow?

580
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:15,042
One hundred thousand arrows?

581
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,081
You're mighty generous

582
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:19,157
Please forgive me, Your Highness

583
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:20,357
I deserve death, Your Highness

584
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:21,723
Today it's arrows

585
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:25,525
Tomorrow it's my head, am I right?

586
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,837
Zhou Yu is turning us against each other

587
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:38,202
No spy is stupid enough to...

588
00:47:38,287 --> 00:47:39,686
Silence!

589
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:44,843
I trust and honor talented men

590
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:49,479
But I abhor deceivers and traitors

591
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:51,160
Guards!

592
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:54,475
Your Highness, we have trained day and night

593
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,159
Take them away and behead them

594
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:57,999
We swear our loyalty to Your Highness

595
00:47:59,247 --> 00:48:01,078
Didn't I surrender to a benevolent ruler?

596
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:02,398
We have trained night and day

597
00:48:02,607 --> 00:48:03,926
Wait, Your Highness

598
00:48:04,127 --> 00:48:06,482
If you kill them, who will lead the navy?

599
00:48:07,207 --> 00:48:09,118
Halt!

600
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,076
Ninety-three thousand eight hundred

601
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:20,561
Ninety-four thousand

602
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:23,085
Ninety-four thousand two hundred

603
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,280
Ninety-four thousand six hundred

604
00:48:26,007 --> 00:48:28,202
We'll shoot Cao Cao with his own arrows

605
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:30,638
This battle will be interesting

606
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:37,121
Concentrate! No mistakes

607
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:38,322
Wait

608
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,276
Don't interrupt

609
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:42,838
Two hundred per person. There'll be no mistakes

610
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,597
Mr. Zhu-ge, what is this new invention?

611
00:48:45,887 --> 00:48:46,603
A rapid-fire crossbow

612
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,326
It shoots ten arrows without reloading

613
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:49,843
Here, watch

614
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:51,640
Great

615
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:53,606
Ninety-nine thousand four hundred

616
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:54,961
Ninety-nine thousand six hundred

617
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:04,837
lmpressive!

618
00:49:05,407 --> 00:49:07,045
You know a trifle about weapons design too

619
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:11,123
Knowing a trifle about everything gives life more color

620
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,920
Your Honor

621
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:14,757
Did he reach one hundred thousand?

622
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:19,439
The total is ninety-nine thousand six hundred

623
00:49:21,207 --> 00:49:22,606
Now what?

624
00:49:23,847 --> 00:49:25,360
Well...

625
00:49:28,247 --> 00:49:30,556
Your Honor, it's only four hundred

626
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:32,365
Short one is still short

627
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:34,160
The law is firm as a mountain

628
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:37,484
That's right. So what does the law say?

629
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:43,446
The law prescribes beheading

630
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:46,679
Bastards!

631
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:48,120
What took you so long?

632
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:49,362
Hurry and bring them over

633
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:51,001
Thank god!

634
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:52,406
The total is one hundred thousand two hundred

635
00:49:52,647 --> 00:49:54,444
Mr. Zhu-ge has completed his mission

636
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:57,840
Seems like my head is safe where it is

637
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,722
How about yours?

638
00:50:03,047 --> 00:50:04,685
You want my head?

639
00:50:06,527 --> 00:50:07,596
Mr. Zhu-ge

640
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:08,836
We're just joking

641
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,686
When I lost was he joking?

642
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:14,286
Of course not

643
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,041
Looks like you haven't lost after all

644
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:42,246
Cao Cao has executed Admirals Cai Mao and zhang Yun

645
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,756
I think we've been duped

646
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,320
Steal the enemy's weapons then destroy their moral

647
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:59,440
Your strategies worked together brilliantly

648
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:03,805
Cao Cao must be going crazy right about now

649
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:06,681
In two or three days, he will try something desperate

650
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:09,442
But this will not be good for Jiang Gan

651
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:13,959
I've lost an old friend

652
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:18,563
Honored guests

653
00:51:18,847 --> 00:51:20,803
zhou Yu is just showing off his cleverness

654
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:23,277
He undoubtedly thinks I have gone crazy

655
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:25,718
Tell me, do I look crazy?

656
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:27,236
Not at all

657
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,159
Come, let us root out the traitor

658
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:31,925
then we can sleep easy. Cheers!

659
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:35,277
Jiang Gan

660
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,444
Yes

661
00:51:36,687 --> 00:51:38,405
Today you were of great service

662
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:40,603
Please drink

663
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,756
Thank you, Your Highness

664
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,282
Sir!

665
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:08,236
Sir! Are you...

666
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:14,519
Your stupidity was trivial

667
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:17,403
But you brought your stupidity upon me

668
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:23,356
Hear this!

669
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:27,641
In two days, our army shall cross the river

670
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:28,962
and take Red Cliff!

671
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:29,963
Yes, Your Highness!

672
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:41,680
All hear this! In two days the army will cross the river

673
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:58,762
What's going on here?

674
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:03,405
There's a spy! Catch the spy!

675
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:11,243
Halt!

676
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:18,996
Don't let him escape!

677
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:21,683
Grab him!

678
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:43,924
Piggy, why do they want to hurt you?

679
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:44,758
It's a misunderstanding

680
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:46,037
A misunderstanding?

681
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:47,924
What's going on?

682
00:53:48,047 --> 00:53:49,321
He's a spy

683
00:53:49,447 --> 00:53:50,596
Nonsense, he is my friend

684
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:52,405
Friend? Are you stupid?

685
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:55,645
Come on, they're beating up the commander

686
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:57,037
Afight!

687
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
What is the fight all about?

688
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,566
Nothing, just some roughhousing

689
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,237
Pit

690
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:26,917
Pit

691
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:32,761
Piggy, are you all right?

692
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:39,717
I have to go

693
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:47,396
Piggy

694
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:48,918
Where are you going?

695
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:52,601
My mother is sick. I must go home

696
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,441
That's very kind of you to visit her

697
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,076
You should go home too

698
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:03,805
No, I'll return after the war

699
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,516
Fighting means no taxes

700
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:06,756
That means more food on the table

701
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:08,363
Hurry, go visit your mother

702
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,241
I will come back to see you

703
00:55:25,527 --> 00:55:26,721
Ride high

704
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,235
Don't let him escape!

705
00:55:40,607 --> 00:55:41,801
He's just going to see his mother

706
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:57,122
Hit him! Pummel him!

707
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:01,076
In eighteen years of battle

708
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:03,044
I have never lost

709
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:05,398
If I fail to capture this tiny cliff

710
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,563
I shudder to think what historians will say

711
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:09,637
Yes

712
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:18,836
Your Highness

713
00:56:30,607 --> 00:56:31,596
How are things?

714
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:33,761
Worse than expected

715
00:56:34,847 --> 00:56:38,362
The disease's spread has not slowed

716
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:40,801
At this rate

717
00:56:40,887 --> 00:56:43,082
it will take a month to control

718
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:49,279
I respectfully request you delay the assault

719
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:01,676
Stop!

720
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:02,597
Lie still

721
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:03,484
Your Highness

722
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:04,199
Sit up

723
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:07,397
You are ill and must recuperate

724
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:13,998
Man Tun, how can you be ill?

725
00:57:14,887 --> 00:57:16,445
You were always in perfect health

726
00:57:17,927 --> 00:57:19,360
What is on your mind?

727
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:21,277
Go ahead

728
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:24,204
I want to go home

729
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,758
I too have not been home for a long time

730
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:32,844
I want to see my youngest son

731
00:57:36,527 --> 00:57:38,563
He is only thirteen

732
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:43,842
Younger than you even

733
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,521
He is kind-hearted and bright

734
00:57:47,207 --> 00:57:51,723
He has been frail since birth and is often sick

735
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:54,246
Yet in front of me

736
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,522
he pretends everything is fine

737
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:03,239
Whatever the illness, he endures

738
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,246
He never complains to me

739
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:30,519
I swore at the start of this war

740
00:58:30,847 --> 00:58:34,317
to cleanse the world of warlords

741
00:58:40,247 --> 00:58:43,523
We must seize Red Cliff and storm the capital

742
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:50,926
Then bring the mud of this land back home

743
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:56,560
and tell our families we were victorious

744
00:58:58,527 --> 00:59:00,324
We were victorious!

745
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:06,237
So you all must be strong

746
00:59:09,247 --> 00:59:13,365
because I must bring you back home

747
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:19,405
Victory!

748
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:58,443
Victory!

749
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:16,840
Greetings everyone

750
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:18,402
Sorry for the wait

751
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:19,238
We're glad you're back safe

752
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:22,001
Did you have any problems?

753
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:23,287
No

754
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:23,367
No
I just fell into the mud jumping the stockade

755
01:01:23,367 --> 01:01:25,358
I just fell into the mud jumping the stockade

756
01:01:27,247 --> 01:01:28,805
Shang Xiang

757
01:01:30,047 --> 01:01:31,162
You're always causing trouble

758
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:32,919
Where have you been?

759
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,244
They are ready to attack

760
01:01:40,247 --> 01:01:40,997
Shang Xiang

761
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:43,243
You're back

762
01:01:43,727 --> 01:01:44,239
Xiao Qiao

763
01:01:49,487 --> 01:01:50,203
Shang Xiang?

764
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:03,880
Xiao Qiao

765
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:04,883
please help me pull this

766
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:06,038
Go ahead, pull it

767
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:36,566
This is a map of Cao Cao's camp

768
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:39,241
This tower here

769
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:41,159
is Cao Cao's headquarters

770
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:43,198
Their best troops guard it

771
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:44,761
The barracks are here

772
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:46,685
East and west are well-defended

773
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:48,166
The rear hill is weakest

774
01:02:48,487 --> 01:02:50,159
It's like a tiger that stares ahead

775
01:02:50,447 --> 01:02:51,482
but forgets its tail

776
01:02:51,927 --> 01:02:53,360
- The navy is here-Put this on

777
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:54,363
- You'll catch a chill -I'm not cold

778
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:55,562
Athird of their forces

779
01:02:55,687 --> 01:02:57,405
are onboard ready for assault

780
01:02:57,767 --> 01:02:59,564
Warships lead the smaller boats

781
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:01,439
Transport ships are in the middle

782
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:02,995
This is an interlocked naval formation

783
01:03:03,287 --> 01:03:04,356
I'm fine

784
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,675
Every ship is ready for attack or defense

785
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:27,482
I was wrong to scold you

786
01:03:35,927 --> 01:03:37,440
If you were zhou Yu

787
01:03:37,687 --> 01:03:39,166
how would you attack?

788
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,318
He only has enough men for one assault

789
01:03:42,607 --> 01:03:44,199
an all-out attack on our fleet

790
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:48,081
They will want to attack with fire

791
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,403
Fire? I doubt it

792
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:52,683
Without manpower, they need strength

793
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,801
Where can they get it? Fire of course

794
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:57,526
This is a standard rule of war

795
01:03:58,047 --> 01:03:59,366
Too bad it won't work

796
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,125
A northwest wind is blowing

797
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,281
If they attack our fleet with fire

798
01:04:07,127 --> 01:04:10,483
they will be fighting the wind and burn themselves

799
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:14,442
We are the ones who should use fire

800
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:18,517
Yes, load the ships with brimstone

801
01:04:18,927 --> 01:04:22,158
Tomorrow, we shall burn Red Cliff to the ground!

802
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,635
The map shows

803
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,203
Cao Cao's army has finished deployment

804
01:04:33,647 --> 01:04:37,356
Tonight may be the decisive battle

805
01:04:38,527 --> 01:04:39,926
This is a fight to the death

806
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:44,522
Win or lose, we must fight with everything we have

807
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,155
Shang Xiang

808
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,078
What are these lines between the ships?

809
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:03,122
It sounds funny

810
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:05,881
They've locked their boats together

811
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:07,886
to stabilize the fleet

812
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:10,043
so the Northerners won't get seasick

813
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:12,077
Enough talk

814
01:05:12,607 --> 01:05:14,040
What is your strategy?

815
01:05:21,927 --> 01:05:23,838
Cao Cao made camp in a bad location

816
01:05:24,727 --> 01:05:25,762
It is hook-shaped

817
01:05:26,087 --> 01:05:27,645
This makes return difficult

818
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:30,760
If their assault fails, they cannot fall back

819
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:33,522
We should use fire

820
01:05:34,247 --> 01:05:35,600
The terrain is in our favor

821
01:05:36,567 --> 01:05:39,081
If we can burn the fleet's vanguard

822
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,477
they will be trapped and vulnerable

823
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:43,998
Yes, a fire attack!

824
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:47,002
Just give me ten fire ships

825
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:50,727
Two will hit their left and right flanks

826
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:55,199
The remaining eight will ram the center

827
01:05:55,447 --> 01:05:56,675
We'll burn an opening here!

828
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:59,520
Next, you follow closely and rush in

829
01:05:59,847 --> 01:06:02,520
No matter how great their numbers

830
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:04,838
we will crush them

831
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:12,245
If only we still had Liu Bei's cavalry

832
01:06:12,527 --> 01:06:15,246
then we could attack their camp at the rear

833
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:17,762
Then victory would be assured

834
01:06:31,327 --> 01:06:33,158
This wind is to Cao Cao's advantage

835
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:37,684
A northwest wind is blowing

836
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:39,923
Sailing into the wind will burn our own fleet

837
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:41,366
Cao Cao knows the wind is on his side

838
01:06:42,287 --> 01:06:44,278
He will also think of using fire

839
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,846
Why are you so quiet?

840
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:14,361
What are you looking at?

841
01:07:15,647 --> 01:07:18,081
Look, those dark clouds in the east

842
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,965
are enshrouding the sun

843
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:23,515
Isn't that rather unusual?

844
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:26,157
Zhu-ge Liang, what does that mean?

845
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:29,285
The winds will change

846
01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:33,279
I know from farming

847
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:36,558
if during a warm winter clouds enshroud the sun

848
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:39,766
then along the Yangtze River

849
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:41,206
an unseasonal wind will blow

850
01:07:41,287 --> 01:07:42,322
What do you mean unseasonal?

851
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:44,326
Awarm southeast wind

852
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:47,161
It blows from southeast to northwest

853
01:07:49,087 --> 01:07:51,476
What if Cao Cao knows this too?

854
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:54,917
Only Admiral Cai Mao would know and he is dead

855
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,402
Zhu-ge Liang

856
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:03,565
Can you predict when it will change?

857
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:05,922
Tonight or tomorrow morning

858
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:08,756
History shows the timing of weather is key

859
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,446
He who can predict it will win

860
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:19,362
We must delay his attack

861
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:23,122
only then will we have a chance at victory

862
01:08:46,367 --> 01:08:47,595
Greetings, General

863
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:55,077
Terrific, just terrific

864
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,839
This fish oil is perfect!

865
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:25,402
Bigger

866
01:09:25,527 --> 01:09:26,357
Yes, General!

867
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,486
No good. Bigger!

868
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:40,477
Yes, General

869
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:52,038
No good. Bigger!

870
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:53,522
Just how big do you want it?

871
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:56,362
Go

872
01:10:12,527 --> 01:10:13,596
That's about right

873
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:17,680
Yes! This is it!

874
01:10:28,927 --> 01:10:31,646
See how strong this west wind is?

875
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,240
It will never shift

876
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:36,166
We'll never get near their navy

877
01:10:37,087 --> 01:10:39,282
Your Honor, I can fake a defection

878
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:41,245
Invent some excuse

879
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:43,438
to punish me with fifty lashes

880
01:10:43,527 --> 01:10:45,279
I'll fake a surrender in anger

881
01:10:45,447 --> 01:10:48,166
That way Cao Cao is sure to believe me

882
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:51,796
Then I can sail my fire ships in range

883
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:55,523
How can you fight after such a beating?

884
01:10:56,407 --> 01:10:59,717
I could never treat a general that way

885
01:10:59,807 --> 01:11:01,206
Do not lose heart

886
01:11:01,527 --> 01:11:02,927
The east wind will come

887
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:03,127
The east wind will come
Your Honor

888
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:04,526
Your Honor

889
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:06,086
Terrible news!

890
01:11:06,607 --> 01:11:08,837
Our Lady has disappeared!

891
01:11:31,807 --> 01:11:35,163
My dear husband, by the time you read this

892
01:11:36,527 --> 01:11:38,836
I will be on the way to Cao Cao's camp

893
01:11:41,087 --> 01:11:42,361
I will be cautious

894
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:45,237
and only act when the moment is right

895
01:11:47,487 --> 01:11:49,762
Yet I hope the east wind will come early

896
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:54,037
Where there is faith, there is hope

897
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:00,238
The clear waters of the Yangtze

898
01:12:00,847 --> 01:12:02,724
the emerald leaves of the mountains

899
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,439
the birds returning to nest

900
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:07,561
the fisherman singing his evening song

901
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:11,838
This is our home

902
01:12:12,447 --> 01:12:14,802
our beautiful native land

903
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,840
our people gladly give their lives for her sake

904
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,965
I cannot stand idly by

905
01:12:45,847 --> 01:12:48,998
I have been carrying our child Ping An for three months

906
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,443
I did not tell you

907
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,117
fearing it might distract you

908
01:12:55,367 --> 01:12:59,997
We cannot in caring for our child

909
01:13:00,687 --> 01:13:03,520
forget the children of the Southlands

910
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:07,604
I want to see them grow up together

911
01:13:07,727 --> 01:13:11,515
to have a future where they can play

912
01:13:11,607 --> 01:13:14,758
swim, pick flowers

913
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:17,602
and plant rice in peace

914
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:20,796
"Your child Ping An"

915
01:13:21,247 --> 01:13:22,566
"Pregnant"

916
01:13:24,927 --> 01:13:26,918
Do not fear

917
01:13:28,247 --> 01:13:31,080
I shall bring Ping An home

918
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:09,925
Some traditions still carry great meaning

919
01:14:10,687 --> 01:14:13,076
For example, rice flour and sugar

920
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:17,002
stick together like a family at reunion

921
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:27,838
over here! Bring the cart here!

922
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:30,602
There's sweet rice dumplings for everyone

923
01:14:31,887 --> 01:14:34,481
Today is winter solstice, a time for reunion

924
01:14:34,527 --> 01:14:36,563
Everyone have some rice dumplings

925
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:39,796
Two or three per person! Eat up!

926
01:14:42,447 --> 01:14:44,199
Officers and soldiers alike, come on

927
01:14:44,287 --> 01:14:46,562
Two or three per person! Eat up!

928
01:14:46,967 --> 01:14:48,685
Come on

929
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,199
Give me a bowl

930
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:08,002
zhang Fei, you're making them too big

931
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:09,879
Do you want us to choke?

932
01:15:10,567 --> 01:15:12,842
Fine with me. I couldn't be happier

933
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:18,802
zhao Yun

934
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:22,117
Has your wound healed from combat practice?

935
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:26,281
So long as I can fight, a wound means nothing

936
01:16:39,847 --> 01:16:42,805
Guan Yu, how many times have you read the classics?

937
01:16:44,127 --> 01:16:47,039
If a man of learning does not understand brotherhood

938
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:48,725
isn't his learning worthless?

939
01:17:10,447 --> 01:17:13,837
My Lord, what are we doing here?

940
01:17:14,447 --> 01:17:15,323
Waiting

941
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:18,036
Waiting for what?

942
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:19,996
Waiting for Zhu-ge Liang

943
01:17:20,847 --> 01:17:23,645
Waiting for his return, so we can go home

944
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:26,365
Do we still have a home?

945
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:30,165
Sons of the Southlands, listen

946
01:17:30,927 --> 01:17:32,519
Today is the winter solstice

947
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:35,602
a day for family reunion

948
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:40,603
Yet thieves encircle our home

949
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:42,756
How can we celebrate like this?

950
01:17:44,847 --> 01:17:47,486
I say let us drive them from this land

951
01:17:48,727 --> 01:17:51,287
Then we shall have our celebratory family meal

952
01:17:51,287 --> 01:17:51,367
Then we shall have our celebratory family meal
Here here!

953
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,835
Here here!

954
01:17:57,447 --> 01:17:58,800
My Lord

955
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,718
Though I sometimes disagree with you

956
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:03,680
I have never said a word against you

957
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:09,085
But this is a choice between right and wrong

958
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:10,486
I acted for the good of us all

959
01:18:11,247 --> 01:18:13,761
yet you lecture me for being unrighteous

960
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:17,079
You have followed me so long and for what?

961
01:18:17,127 --> 01:18:19,038
I just want to ensure we live on

962
01:18:42,087 --> 01:18:45,523
There are some things I value more than my life

963
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:51,078
zhou Yu, may your plans come to fruition

964
01:19:52,007 --> 01:19:53,884
We will fight the good fight

965
01:20:16,007 --> 01:20:17,156
zhou Yu's wife is here

966
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:18,045
She came alone

967
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:13,766
zhou Yu

968
01:22:13,927 --> 01:22:16,077
we must alter our plan of attack

969
01:22:17,327 --> 01:22:19,124
Consider your wife's safety

970
01:22:19,247 --> 01:22:20,885
I will send our best men

971
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:22,958
around back to rescue her

972
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:25,160
No changes

973
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:29,283
All our forces must be focused on frontal assault

974
01:22:29,447 --> 01:22:31,244
We cannot divide our strength

975
01:22:32,607 --> 01:22:35,679
Your Honor, we stand alone on the battlefield

976
01:22:35,887 --> 01:22:37,445
Without allied support

977
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:40,246
the chance for victory seems slight

978
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:43,283
I have never given up on my dream

979
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:45,483
Victory cannot rest on dreams alone

980
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:52,763
When will the east wind come?

981
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:55,484
If at that time you still trust your friends

982
01:22:56,007 --> 01:22:57,235
light a lantern for a signal

983
01:22:58,087 --> 01:22:59,440
If misfortune befalls Xiao Qiao

984
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:02,476
will you still fight a war of honor?

985
01:23:08,487 --> 01:23:10,239
I saw you once in the back of your family's estate

986
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:15,519
Though young, you were already a great beauty

987
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:17,201
You were studying the tea ceremony

988
01:23:17,287 --> 01:23:19,517
and liked catching butterflies

989
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:40,681
Did you launch this war for me?

990
01:23:41,007 --> 01:23:42,406
You believe that?

991
01:23:43,607 --> 01:23:46,679
My father was very fond of you

992
01:23:46,927 --> 01:23:49,919
At that time, Cao Cao believed in justice, ideals

993
01:23:49,967 --> 01:23:51,764
and loyalty to the Han throne

994
01:23:52,007 --> 01:23:53,645
He was a young hero

995
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:59,081
How else could he have become Prime Minister?

996
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:03,763
By killing many people

997
01:24:08,287 --> 01:24:11,040
I hear many Southland soldiers have fallen ill

998
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:12,836
Yes

999
01:24:13,847 --> 01:24:15,599
I hear Liu Bei has fled

1000
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:18,158
and the alliance is broken

1001
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,081
Yes

1002
01:24:20,927 --> 01:24:24,317
Then zhou Yu must be a lonely man

1003
01:24:32,007 --> 01:24:33,360
Did he send you?

1004
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:34,960
This was my idea

1005
01:24:38,327 --> 01:24:39,476
Why are you here?

1006
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:42,876
Please withdraw your troops

1007
01:24:43,967 --> 01:24:45,607
Victory is yours

1008
01:24:45,607 --> 01:24:45,687
Victory is yours
What need is there to fight on?

1009
01:24:45,687 --> 01:24:47,006
What need is there to fight on?

1010
01:24:47,607 --> 01:24:48,926
No

1011
01:24:49,727 --> 01:24:53,163
zhou Yu shall kneel before me in surrender

1012
01:24:57,607 --> 01:24:58,801
What is this?

1013
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:03,883
I am not here for my husband

1014
01:25:04,007 --> 01:25:05,918
but for the people of this kingdom

1015
01:25:06,207 --> 01:25:09,597
Please end this war

1016
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:13,281
And if I refuse?

1017
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:21,920
Stop playing

1018
01:25:28,527 --> 01:25:31,803
You must witness how I defeat zhou Yu

1019
01:26:13,287 --> 01:26:14,481
What's on your mind?

1020
01:26:18,487 --> 01:26:20,762
Just thinking of a silly friend

1021
01:26:36,087 --> 01:26:38,806
The times make the hero

1022
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:10,839
After this battle

1023
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:13,045
I will have time to savor your tea

1024
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:15,005
Just one cup?

1025
01:27:15,687 --> 01:27:17,837
Lt'll help you relax

1026
01:27:22,047 --> 01:27:23,241
Fine

1027
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:30,840
No one's ever given us respect

1028
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:32,767
So what?

1029
01:27:32,767 --> 01:27:32,807
So what?
Who cares so long as we respect ourselves?

1030
01:27:32,807 --> 01:27:34,718
Who cares so long as we respect ourselves?

1031
01:27:34,927 --> 01:27:35,916
Listen up!

1032
01:27:36,527 --> 01:27:41,078
Our boats will soon charge Cao Cao's fleet

1033
01:27:41,527 --> 01:27:44,963
No man jumps ship until their ships burn

1034
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:45,917
Yes sir!

1035
01:27:47,007 --> 01:27:48,122
Any problem with that?

1036
01:27:48,287 --> 01:27:49,720
No sir!

1037
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:50,796
That's what I thought

1038
01:27:51,447 --> 01:27:54,325
Have you all written to your families?

1039
01:27:54,407 --> 01:27:55,840
Yes

1040
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:30,316
Don't rush

1041
01:28:30,407 --> 01:28:32,716
Appreciate the tea's color and bouquet

1042
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:34,401
oh

1043
01:28:57,247 --> 01:28:58,680
Why is the Prime Minister waiting to attack?

1044
01:28:58,807 --> 01:29:00,081
The wind is behaving strangely

1045
01:29:00,127 --> 01:29:01,321
I know

1046
01:29:02,007 --> 01:29:03,804
He is drinking tea with that woman

1047
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:04,882
Tea?

1048
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,561
What makes brewing tea so difficult?

1049
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:14,124
Leaves, heat, water, and utensils

1050
01:29:14,687 --> 01:29:15,756
all demand study

1051
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:23,043
Yet the hardest is boiling water

1052
01:29:24,127 --> 01:29:25,162
Boiling water?

1053
01:29:27,087 --> 01:29:28,759
Look!

1054
01:29:30,247 --> 01:29:31,521
The wind has stopped

1055
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:44,915
At first boil, bubbles hiss and resemble tiny fish eyes

1056
01:29:45,687 --> 01:29:48,599
At second boil, the edge simmers like a fountain

1057
01:29:49,447 --> 01:29:51,756
This is when tea is finest

1058
01:29:52,247 --> 01:29:54,602
At third boil, the water seethes and spurts

1059
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:58,806
Any further and the water is past its prime

1060
01:30:00,367 --> 01:30:02,835
Your Honor, the wind seems about to shift

1061
01:30:03,087 --> 01:30:05,282
It's time to attack. What are we waiting for?

1062
01:30:05,687 --> 01:30:07,086
Our allies

1063
01:30:07,207 --> 01:30:08,356
What allies?

1064
01:30:13,487 --> 01:30:15,205
Liu Bei fled days ago

1065
01:30:15,247 --> 01:30:17,522
This is all part of zhou Yu's plan

1066
01:30:17,607 --> 01:30:20,167
Some plans are best kept quiet

1067
01:30:24,487 --> 01:30:26,000
Enough! It is full!

1068
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:27,800
Your Highness

1069
01:30:27,967 --> 01:30:31,164
Don't you see your true self reflected in this tea?

1070
01:30:31,767 --> 01:30:34,156
Your heart is overflowing with ambition

1071
01:30:34,247 --> 01:30:39,037
It's too full to let other people in

1072
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:42,560
You've carried this full heart to Red Cliff

1073
01:30:43,047 --> 01:30:46,437
Someone here shall pour that heart onto the floor

1074
01:31:05,207 --> 01:31:06,322
Your Highness

1075
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:08,358
You do not understand the art of tea

1076
01:31:16,447 --> 01:31:19,245
Your Honor, tell us what we must do

1077
01:31:19,367 --> 01:31:20,561
At two o'clock

1078
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:23,360
the ten fire ships will ram Cao Cao's fleet

1079
01:31:23,447 --> 01:31:24,926
burning through their vanguard

1080
01:31:27,567 --> 01:31:28,556
With the fleet broken

1081
01:31:28,647 --> 01:31:31,241
zhao Yun will hit the east gate

1082
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:32,960
to divert their attention

1083
01:31:35,927 --> 01:31:38,122
Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and zhang Fei

1084
01:31:38,687 --> 01:31:41,440
will overwhelm Cao Cao's camp from the west gate

1085
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:55,524
Doctor!

1086
01:31:57,087 --> 01:31:58,315
Your Highness

1087
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:00,199
Call Doctor Hua Tuo. My head aches

1088
01:32:00,327 --> 01:32:03,558
Your Highness, Hua Tuo has left

1089
01:32:04,287 --> 01:32:06,005
What did you say?

1090
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:07,315
Hua Tuo is gone

1091
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:12,679
Cast off!

1092
01:33:23,447 --> 01:33:24,277
What is this wind?

1093
01:33:24,367 --> 01:33:25,846
It's an easterly wind, Your Highness

1094
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:28,163
It shifted? Lmpossible!

1095
01:33:33,647 --> 01:33:35,285
Enemy ships approaching!

1096
01:33:36,327 --> 01:33:37,999
General, enemy ships approaching!

1097
01:33:38,167 --> 01:33:39,441
Hurry, separate the ships!

1098
01:33:39,527 --> 01:33:40,482
Separate ships!

1099
01:33:52,087 --> 01:33:52,727
What is that?

1100
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:52,847
What is that?
That is their lanterns, Your Highness

1101
01:33:52,847 --> 01:33:54,838
That is their lanterns, Your Highness

1102
01:33:58,167 --> 01:33:59,316
Forward

1103
01:34:05,967 --> 01:34:07,241
zhou Yu

1104
01:34:07,327 --> 01:34:09,158
I have done all I can

1105
01:34:09,487 --> 01:34:11,523
Tonight will decide the fate of the empire

1106
01:34:17,047 --> 01:34:18,605
There must be no mistakes

1107
01:34:18,767 --> 01:34:20,325
Zhu-ge Liang

1108
01:34:20,607 --> 01:34:22,325
you weren't lying after all!

1109
01:34:30,007 --> 01:34:30,757
Report!

1110
01:34:30,847 --> 01:34:32,121
Boats are approaching fast

1111
01:34:32,327 --> 01:34:32,998
Separate ships immediately

1112
01:34:33,087 --> 01:34:34,361
Separation has already begun

1113
01:34:47,447 --> 01:34:48,926
Light the fires!

1114
01:34:56,247 --> 01:34:58,283
Forward

1115
01:35:07,007 --> 01:35:08,440
Hurry over here!

1116
01:35:33,607 --> 01:35:34,756
All speed ahead!

1117
01:36:19,767 --> 01:36:21,723
Hurry, separate the ships

1118
01:36:23,247 --> 01:36:24,839
Faster

1119
01:37:21,607 --> 01:37:23,996
Retreat! Protect the main gate!

1120
01:37:24,887 --> 01:37:29,802
Faster, toward Cao Cao's flagship!

1121
01:39:13,767 --> 01:39:14,961
Strike as powerful as thunder

1122
01:39:50,007 --> 01:39:51,759
Charge!

1123
01:39:52,807 --> 01:39:53,717
Go ahead

1124
01:39:53,847 --> 01:39:54,962
Charge!

1125
01:40:15,767 --> 01:40:16,756
Follow me

1126
01:40:38,527 --> 01:40:39,846
Shoot!

1127
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:54,122
Launch catapults!

1128
01:41:09,727 --> 01:41:11,365
Hurry, the enemy is approaching

1129
01:41:11,847 --> 01:41:13,166
Look, over there

1130
01:41:34,247 --> 01:41:35,726
Your Highness! Terrible news!

1131
01:41:36,127 --> 01:41:37,480
They have broken through the stockade!

1132
01:41:37,767 --> 01:41:38,961
Why are you panicking?

1133
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:41,926
Do not forget you are a general

1134
01:41:42,407 --> 01:41:43,556
I...

1135
01:42:30,607 --> 01:42:32,165
Try to endure the pain

1136
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:49,515
Reinforce zhang Fei! Move!

1137
01:43:13,007 --> 01:43:14,156
Your Highness

1138
01:43:14,287 --> 01:43:16,084
the rear gate is under surprise attack

1139
01:43:17,007 --> 01:43:19,077
It is Liu Bei's allied forces

1140
01:43:19,567 --> 01:43:21,603
Liu Bei?

1141
01:43:22,527 --> 01:43:24,279
Free the horses!

1142
01:43:24,687 --> 01:43:29,807
Pull!

1143
01:43:40,847 --> 01:43:42,167
General Gan

1144
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:44,078
we must save energy for inside

1145
01:43:47,847 --> 01:43:49,121
You must break down this gate

1146
01:43:49,207 --> 01:43:50,606
so we can join our allies

1147
01:43:50,687 --> 01:43:51,676
otherwise all is lost

1148
01:43:51,727 --> 01:43:52,682
No problem

1149
01:43:52,767 --> 01:43:53,517
Good luck

1150
01:44:23,527 --> 01:44:24,926
Halt

1151
01:44:28,247 --> 01:44:29,475
Tear down the barricade!

1152
01:44:32,447 --> 01:44:34,005
Shoot!

1153
01:44:54,967 --> 01:44:56,480
Forward

1154
01:44:56,647 --> 01:44:59,241
Attack the main gate

1155
01:45:14,447 --> 01:45:15,596
Come on soldier

1156
01:45:17,087 --> 01:45:18,520
Hang in there

1157
01:45:28,487 --> 01:45:29,078
General Gan!

1158
01:45:29,567 --> 01:45:30,761
Individual bombs aren't strong enough

1159
01:45:33,207 --> 01:45:35,084
Run! The fire is coming!

1160
01:45:35,807 --> 01:45:36,762
Give me all your fire bombs

1161
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:39,236
There's only three left

1162
01:45:39,407 --> 01:45:41,159
No retreat! No surrender!

1163
01:45:57,647 --> 01:45:58,682
This is it!

1164
01:46:20,767 --> 01:46:22,200
All forces attack!

1165
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:28,562
Shoot!

1166
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:44,676
Your Highness

1167
01:48:44,967 --> 01:48:46,241
The navy is lost

1168
01:48:46,487 --> 01:48:49,081
East, south, and west... all three sides have been sunk

1169
01:48:57,847 --> 01:49:01,203
It seems like they went up in flames too

1170
01:49:01,847 --> 01:49:03,519
Yes, Your Highness

1171
01:49:03,847 --> 01:49:05,565
All is quiet below

1172
01:49:19,327 --> 01:49:20,760
The fire is too fierce!

1173
01:49:20,927 --> 01:49:22,599
Stay together at all costs!

1174
01:49:22,687 --> 01:49:24,006
Don't get separated!

1175
01:49:32,407 --> 01:49:33,522
Your Highness

1176
01:49:35,287 --> 01:49:37,482
perhaps retreat is best

1177
01:49:37,567 --> 01:49:38,841
Retreat?

1178
01:49:39,287 --> 01:49:41,278
With our best soldiers still remaining?

1179
01:49:41,407 --> 01:49:43,762
They would give their lives for me

1180
01:49:46,567 --> 01:49:48,797
Even if all would die, they must fight

1181
01:49:49,167 --> 01:49:50,680
This is military power

1182
01:49:57,087 --> 01:49:59,362
All together! Charge!

1183
01:50:09,807 --> 01:50:10,762
Fight me if you dare

1184
01:50:11,047 --> 01:50:12,116
Come back here!

1185
01:50:17,167 --> 01:50:18,680
Come on, you traitor!

1186
01:50:18,767 --> 01:50:19,836
General!

1187
01:51:19,247 --> 01:51:21,247
Don't give up, my brother

1188
01:51:21,247 --> 01:51:21,527
Don't give up, my brother
Guan Yu!

1189
01:51:21,527 --> 01:51:22,039
Guan Yu!

1190
01:51:22,087 --> 01:51:23,361
Where is Liu Bei?

1191
01:51:33,607 --> 01:51:34,756
All speed ahead!

1192
01:51:48,647 --> 01:51:49,716
Break formation!

1193
01:52:45,007 --> 01:52:46,281
Launch spears!

1194
01:52:56,967 --> 01:52:58,195
Forward!

1195
01:52:58,447 --> 01:53:01,837
Crush them or die trying

1196
01:53:12,567 --> 01:53:14,159
Hang in there

1197
01:54:35,847 --> 01:54:42,525
I oversaw the end of every warlord

1198
01:54:50,287 --> 01:54:55,805
I saw the end of one here and one there

1199
01:55:10,847 --> 01:55:13,725
The end of all but here

1200
01:55:30,367 --> 01:55:31,277
Just in time

1201
01:55:31,647 --> 01:55:33,444
I knew you wouldn't let me down

1202
01:55:34,047 --> 01:55:35,196
I said we would meet again

1203
01:55:35,687 --> 01:55:37,040
Gan Xing sacrificed himself

1204
01:55:38,927 --> 01:55:40,565
But not in vain

1205
01:55:43,487 --> 01:55:44,317
The fire is approaching

1206
01:55:44,567 --> 01:55:46,080
We must save Xiao Qiao now!

1207
01:55:47,367 --> 01:55:48,402
First find Cao Cao

1208
01:55:52,767 --> 01:55:55,076
We have lost

1209
01:55:55,487 --> 01:55:58,320
all because of that accursed woman

1210
01:55:59,407 --> 01:56:02,160
She ruined our chance to attack

1211
01:56:02,927 --> 01:56:03,518
I'll kill her

1212
01:56:03,847 --> 01:56:04,836
Kill her

1213
01:56:25,527 --> 01:56:26,676
Come no further

1214
01:57:00,367 --> 01:57:01,402
Don't let the enemy through

1215
01:57:01,687 --> 01:57:03,086
That way, quickly!

1216
01:57:09,807 --> 01:57:11,807
Protect the Prime Minister! Get them!

1217
01:57:11,807 --> 01:57:11,927
Protect the Prime Minister! Get them!
Pit?

1218
01:57:11,927 --> 01:57:12,882
Pit?

1219
01:57:26,247 --> 01:57:27,236
Pit

1220
01:57:33,087 --> 01:57:34,076
It's me, Piggy

1221
01:57:37,847 --> 01:57:39,200
It's me, Piggy

1222
01:57:40,047 --> 01:57:41,002
Piggy?

1223
01:58:12,767 --> 01:58:14,644
Piggy

1224
01:58:17,887 --> 01:58:20,003
You came to see me

1225
01:58:23,287 --> 01:58:25,447
I said I would

1226
01:58:25,447 --> 01:58:25,927
I said I would
Piggy

1227
01:58:25,927 --> 01:58:26,279
Piggy

1228
01:58:29,767 --> 01:58:33,885
Still want to play Ride High?

1229
02:00:45,247 --> 02:00:46,680
I'll kill that witch

1230
02:01:46,767 --> 02:01:48,325
Don't move

1231
02:01:57,767 --> 02:01:58,836
zhou Yu

1232
02:01:59,407 --> 02:02:00,203
Viceroy zhou

1233
02:02:00,447 --> 02:02:01,357
The traitor Cao Cao

1234
02:02:01,527 --> 02:02:02,403
Silence!

1235
02:02:03,167 --> 02:02:04,805
You shall call me Prime Minister

1236
02:02:07,367 --> 02:02:11,918
I never guessed I'd lose to a gust of wind

1237
02:02:11,967 --> 02:02:14,117
Because you don't understand the Will of Heaven

1238
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:18,524
I never dreamed I'd be defeated by a cup of tea

1239
02:02:21,327 --> 02:02:23,477
For you, war was just a tea ceremony

1240
02:02:23,927 --> 02:02:25,326
Such a pity

1241
02:02:26,167 --> 02:02:27,839
You never knew what you were fighting for

1242
02:02:27,927 --> 02:02:29,440
I come by order of the Emperor

1243
02:02:29,607 --> 02:02:33,077
to subdue rebels like you

1244
02:02:34,007 --> 02:02:35,360
We are not rebelling against the Emperor

1245
02:02:35,807 --> 02:02:37,126
but against you

1246
02:02:37,287 --> 02:02:39,482
You scum

1247
02:03:13,247 --> 02:03:14,680
Little boy

1248
02:03:15,047 --> 02:03:17,322
This has been quite an enjoyable hunt

1249
02:03:18,407 --> 02:03:20,125
What do you want to hunt?

1250
02:03:20,487 --> 02:03:22,239
Tigers

1251
02:03:22,327 --> 02:03:24,238
By the looks of you

1252
02:03:25,527 --> 02:03:28,246
you are a far cry from your father

1253
02:03:32,647 --> 02:03:34,478
Shoot!

1254
02:03:43,607 --> 02:03:45,484
I am prime Minister of the Emperor's court

1255
02:03:46,207 --> 02:03:48,960
Death is too good for rebels like you

1256
02:03:49,687 --> 02:03:51,678
If you declare allegiance to me

1257
02:03:51,807 --> 02:03:54,480
I can pardon you

1258
02:03:57,247 --> 02:03:59,886
Kneel down, all of you

1259
02:04:03,767 --> 02:04:05,325
Your time is over

1260
02:04:17,927 --> 02:04:19,440
Lay down your sword

1261
02:04:30,047 --> 02:04:31,765
Your Highness, kill them

1262
02:04:32,087 --> 02:04:33,679
Kill them all

1263
02:04:36,007 --> 02:04:37,360
Xiao Qiao!

1264
02:04:37,767 --> 02:04:39,803
Are you both safe?

1265
02:04:39,887 --> 02:04:42,276
We are both fine

1266
02:04:45,727 --> 02:04:47,558
We lost

1267
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:50,115
all because of you!

1268
02:04:50,527 --> 02:04:52,040
Kneel down before me

1269
02:05:01,927 --> 02:05:04,647
Kneel to me and I will spare Xiao Qiao

1270
02:05:04,647 --> 02:05:04,767
Kneel to me and I will spare Xiao Qiao
We won't let you harm her

1271
02:05:04,767 --> 02:05:06,086
We won't let you harm her

1272
02:05:06,287 --> 02:05:07,242
"We"?

1273
02:05:08,087 --> 02:05:09,964
You mean "them"?

1274
02:05:10,527 --> 02:05:11,880
That motley troop?

1275
02:05:12,727 --> 02:05:13,842
They are my friends

1276
02:05:16,247 --> 02:05:17,441
War knows no friends

1277
02:05:17,807 --> 02:05:21,482
Tomorrow, they shall be your enemies

1278
02:05:25,927 --> 02:05:27,280
General!

1279
02:05:27,607 --> 02:05:28,722
Push her off!

1280
02:05:28,927 --> 02:05:29,723
Die!

1281
02:05:47,447 --> 02:05:48,482
Your Honor!

1282
02:06:05,927 --> 02:06:07,326
Are you both all right?

1283
02:06:26,607 --> 02:06:27,926
Let's go

1284
02:06:30,007 --> 02:06:32,999
I promise I will take you home

1285
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:22,361
Go

1286
02:07:23,487 --> 02:07:26,445
Go back to where ever you came from

1287
02:07:52,567 --> 02:07:54,762
There is no victor here

1288
02:08:40,527 --> 02:08:42,245
Meng Meng

1289
02:08:43,247 --> 02:08:46,842
Go on now, go

1290
02:08:57,767 --> 02:08:59,200
Meng Meng

1291
02:09:08,927 --> 02:09:11,077
From division comes unity, and from unity, division

1292
02:09:11,687 --> 02:09:13,837
Liu Bei won't stand being second best

1293
02:09:13,967 --> 02:09:16,356
one day, we will face each other on the battlefield

1294
02:09:17,247 --> 02:09:20,523
No man can tell the future

1295
02:09:21,247 --> 02:09:22,999
The world is full of heroes

1296
02:09:23,167 --> 02:09:25,727
But you're the one I most fear offending

1297
02:09:27,247 --> 02:09:28,965
You would be an opponent I truly fear

1298
02:09:29,087 --> 02:09:30,236
Me?

1299
02:09:30,367 --> 02:09:32,881
I'd best return home and get some sleep

1300
02:09:33,687 --> 02:09:35,598
Are you a good farmer?

1301
02:09:35,687 --> 02:09:37,279
I planted lotus flowers once

1302
02:09:37,407 --> 02:09:39,363
but none lived long

1303
02:09:39,527 --> 02:09:41,802
Do not be humble. You have brought peace to the land

1304
02:09:44,647 --> 02:09:48,083
In this alliance, I found true friends

1305
02:09:48,687 --> 02:09:50,359
No matter what may happen

1306
02:09:50,447 --> 02:09:52,039
this experience is engraved in my heart

1307
02:09:52,167 --> 02:09:54,601
I too will not forget

1308
02:10:01,327 --> 02:10:02,203
Zhu-ge Liang

1309
02:10:02,287 --> 02:10:05,006
when Meng Meng has grown do not make her a war horse

1310
02:10:05,327 --> 02:10:06,396
Don't worry

1311
02:10:06,887 --> 02:10:08,400
These hands helped birth her

1312
02:10:09,287 --> 02:10:11,005
I shall always cherish her
