1
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:04,064
This film documents the Vietnam War

2
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:06,284
in the words of Americans
who served there.

3
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:09,281
it features home movies
and rare 
archival footage

4
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:13,620
collected during a worldwide search
and now presented in high definition

5
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:18,230
Many scenes are graphic in nature
and your discretion is advised.

6
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,607
What do we want Equiality?

7
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:27,287
I was in Word War II,
fella,

8
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:29,343
and I served for years.
I know it's about.

9
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:32,006
I have a son that's gonna
go into the army.

10
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:37,426
Over Ten Years

11
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:44,347
Over 2.5 million americans
served in vietnam.

12
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:52,212
It's not the war you know.
It's the war they fought.

13
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,689
Search & Destroy
1966 - 1967

14
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:36,371
===========

15
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,086
VC right across the river.

16
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,909
Roger, okay.

17
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:42,772
JANUARY 1966

18
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:45,004
The US victory over

19
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,472
the north Vietnamese
in the Ia Drang Valley,

20
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,861
measured by a kill ratio of 12 to 1,

21
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:53,320
convinces US commanders to
implement a new strategy,

22
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:55,121
Search ans Destroy.

23
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:00,785
The plan is brutaly simple.

24
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,023
Search out the enemy in South Vietnam,

25
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:05,507
and then destroy them
in numbers so high,

26
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:08,149
they will no longer be able
to continue fighting.

27
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:16,487
For the firt time in modern
US military history,

28
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,347
victory in war wil be measured
not by territory taken,

29
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,745
but by body count.

30
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:50,747
But as US and South Vietnamese forces

31
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:54,119
battle through the vast
countryside and winding rivers,

32
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:57,946
they quickly discover that the
enemy has a plan of their own.

33
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,814
The VC have meticulously planted

34
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,014
tens of thounsas of
mines and booby traps.

35
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:09,715
They have dug hundreds of miles of tunnels
to move soldiers and weapons,

36
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,287
and launch suprise attacks.

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,865
And perhaps worst of all,
they hide in plain sight,

38
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,778
indistinguishable from the 17 million civilians.

39
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,850
If they are to win the war,
US leaders realize

40
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:29,685
they need an enormous number
of boots on the ground

41
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:34,237
1966 becomes the year of escalation.

42
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,302
JANUARY 1966
180.000 US TROOPS ARE IN VIETNAM.

43
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:51,196
MAY 1966
280.000 TROPS.

44
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,571
Go faster! Run faster!

45
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,784
JULY 1966
300.000 TROOPS.

46
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,515
SEPTEMBER 1966
325.000 TROPS.

47
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,762
JANUARY 1976
389.000 US TROOPS ARE IN VIETNAM.

48
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,293
ONE THIRD ARE VOLUNTEERS.

49
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,489
When we graduated,

50
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:28,255
one of the commencement speakers
quote President Kennedy,

51
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:31,147
saying we should: "Ask not what
our country can do for us,

52
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,618
but ask what we can do for our country".

53
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:36,823
Well, the more I hear about Vietnam,

54
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:39,141
the more I think I'm finally
starting to understand

55
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,716
what those words mean.

56
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:45,310
In san Bernadino, California,

57
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:49,402
Barry Romo is feeling the
effects of the growing war.

58
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,136
And this sorts of led me to tinking about,

59
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,215
well, if I believe in the war then I have to

60
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:59,527
actully join the military and go and fight.

61
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:03,480
Really put my principles into action.

62
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:08,108
When I told my father
I was going to enlist,

63
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,359
he said: "I dont't want you to go".

64
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:12,361
And I said: "Well, you served".

65
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:15,712
He said:"But your brother
and I went to war to fight

66
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:19,509
people who were putting
other human beings in ovens.

67
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,967
All you're gonna do is go
fight some poor farmer

68
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:24,509
that doesn't want to
be bothered with you,

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,257
and I don't want you to die".

70
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,933
But he doesn't know
what he's talking abut.

71
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:36,653
We're in Vietnam to save those
farmers from the communist.

72
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:38,915
That's what this war is about.

73
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,618
Everybody knows that,
and everybody's behind it.

74
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:44,685
So I tell him,

75
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,138
"Sorry, Pops, regarless of what you think,

76
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,224
I'm enlisting in the army,

77
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,695
and I'm volunteering to go to Vietnam".

78
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,930
As Romo undergoes
his 12 months of training,

79
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,281
he has no idea what
Vietnam will really be like.

80
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:06,761
No more than 28 year old Chales Brown has,

81
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:10,135
even after serving 8 years in the peacetime army.

82
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:21,715
A few months ago, I didn't even
know any of these men existed.

83
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,140
Now we're headed into combat together,

84
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,948
and we're gonna have to depend
on each other to survive.

85
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,603
TAY NINH PROVINCE
May 1967.

86
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:47,753
Well, back when I was at fort benning,

87
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:50,603
training up young men
that was going to Vietnam,

88
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,399
one of my favorites slogans was:

89
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,889
"I'm gonna go to Vietnam.

90
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,355
I'm gonna kil some Viet Cong. Ha!".

91
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:04,279
Well, this take effect on you.

92
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,105
Remember now, I'd been drilled

93
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,089
for a good 8 years whit nothing
but talking about combat.

94
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,854
No that I wanted to experience,

95
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,473
but it had became a way of life,

96
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:20,741
there're certain things
you do and how you do it,

97
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:25,608
and actually combat is the only
way this is gonna be tested.

98
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,548
Brown is now second in
command to a platoon of 30 men

99
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:35,330
with the 173rd airbone brigade

100
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:39,644
sweeping through Tay Ninh Province,
a know Viet Cong stronghold.

101
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:46,534
A lot of my guys are from
places like New York and Chicago.

102
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:49,085
Boys that barely been
out of the city, let alone

103
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:51,010
been out in the middles
of a jungle like this.

104
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:54,426
No matter how much training they got,

105
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,959
Vietnam is a whole different world to them.

106
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:15,591
Summer daytime temperature overage
over 100 degrees Fahrenheit,

107
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:20,717
while a 100% humidity is like
bein in a stema bath 24/7.

108
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,887
Then men must cut their way

109
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,587
thoungh 8 foot tall razor
sharp elephan grass

110
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,026
and bamboo covered
in thick, thorny vines.

111
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,404
But this is only part of the problem.

112
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,003
THe countryside is also
infested with thounsand

113
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:41,358
of poisonius insectes and snakes,

114
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:44,048
including one of the deadliest in the world,

115
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,065
known as the "two step snake"

116
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,881
for the number of step a bite
victim can take before dropping dead.

117
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:01,405
Brown and his men must navigate
this treacheruous terrain

118
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:04,706
under the constant threat
of ambushes and booby traps,

119
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:08,557
looking for any signs of the elusive Viet Cong.

120
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:14,813
Couple of hooches up ahead.

121
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,798
I tell my radio man  to call
back to camp and tell:

122
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:21,313
"em we're gonna
search it fast" fore nighfall.

123
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:26,626
Couple of my guys start bitching,

124
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:28,308
waiting to know why the
hell we can't just skip it,

125
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:32,790
but I tell "This is a job," so they better
bucke down and get it done.

126
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:39,847
As Brown and his men enter
the area, they quickly realize

127
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,426
it's an abandoned
Viet Cong encampment.

128
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,803
The VC have a sophisticated
network of scouts

129
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:50,427
and sympathizers who alert
them the American's presence

130
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:53,954
allowing them to choose when
and where they want fight.

131
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,369
The best the americans can do now

132
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:01,992
is destroy any hidden enemy
weapons or supplies they can find.

133
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,592
I always tell these guys you got to go slow,

134
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,029
you got to take your time
going through these things,

135
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:10,722
but none of them listen to me.

136
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,871
All they want to do is get
done and get back to camp.

137
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,449
This one guy,

138
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:20,964
he thinks he's been out here so long,
he knows everything there is to know.

139
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:23,472
So what does he do?

140
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,470
Instead of him going
down into the rice slowly

141
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,190
to see if anything was in it,

142
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:32,982
he tilt the rice, immediately seeing

143
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,139
what we could call a
pressure realese booby trap.

144
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:50,560
The booby trap blast Brown and
two of his men with shrapnel.

145
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:55,570
Within minutes, a medevac chopper is on route

146
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,043
to take them to one of the 18
military hospitals in Vietnam.

147
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,043
The emergeny call indicated

148
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:06,167
that there are three injured, wounded G.I.'s.

149
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,600
We're on our way flying above

150
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,666
what has to be considered
insecure, hostile territory.

151
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:16,339
Nearly one million patients are airlifted
in medivac choppers during the vietnam war.

152
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:20,478
The average time from battlefield
to hospital is one hour.

153
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:36,044
Okay, we've go our three
wounded G.I.'s on board.

154
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,811
At least one of them is hit pretty bad.

155
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:42,478
We took a little fire on the
way out of this.. pickup area.

156
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,759
Romo: We had hear about
search and destroy missions

157
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,776
and ambushes and even practices them
in officer candidate school and other places.

158
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,500
But the reality of actually going out...

159
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:28,138
is a totally different thing.

160
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:34,809
It's not like the movies
where you go out in the field,

161
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:36,679
and that evening you're back in a base camp,

162
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,618
drinking beer or smoking dope.

163
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:46,242
We would go out
30, 35, 40 days at a time.

164
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:50,299
24/7.

165
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:00,241
In july of 1967,

166
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:05,158
19 years old second lieutenant
Barry Romo arrives in Vietnam.

167
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,928
He replaces a platoon leader
who was critically wounded

168
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:12,064
by a landmine during a search
and destroy operation.

169
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:16,077
Now Romo is in Quang Nam province,

170
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:19,255
300 miles north of where
Charles Brown was wounded,

171
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:23,025
leading his platoon of approximately 30 men

172
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:25,805
on a similiar mission, whit similar dangers.

173
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,500
Get Down! Take cover!

174
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:31,653
Get Down!

175
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:35,343
It's the not knowing that gets to you.

176
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,872
The feeling that you're never safe

177
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:41,655
anywhere, at any time.

178
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,438
All clear! Let's move it!

179
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:54,109
Suddenly mortars and gunfire
are flying in from everywhere.

180
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:00,317
No one knows what the hell's going on
or where the enemy's even at.

181
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,894
I start screaming at my men to get down

182
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:07,578
and form adefensive perimeter...

183
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,373
but everyone's yelling and shooting.

184
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:21,467
And then I realize one of my squads
got stuck between us and the enemy.

185
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,048
They're caught in the crossfire,

186
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:27,218
getting hit from both directions.

187
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,299
I gotta do something.

188
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,777
So I yell for cover,

189
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,269
and I run forward as fast
as I can to my squad.

190
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:45,875
They are all injured.

191
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:50,254
And every man was badly wounded.

192
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:54,375
And two of my men were dead.

193
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:02,903
And one of my men had
been thrown 100 feet,

194
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,205
maybe by a concussion,

195
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,818
and his insides were jellified,

196
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,843
and I saw that I had to
get them out there...

197
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:15,020
out of there or more
people are gonna die.

198
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,339
Medevac doesn't want to land be
cause we're taking too much fire.

199
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:21,856
But I scream into the radio and I tell them

200
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,879
"¡I 'm gonna stand up in the
middle of this damn field

201
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,331
and you better get in here
and get my men out!".

202
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:13,528
When it's finally over and
we get back to the platoon,

203
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:14,764
my company commander said,

204
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:17,002
"I'm going to put you in for a bronce star".

205
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:21,666
In my mind I could only picture a
bronce star for my dead men,

206
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,917
and it didn't seem worth it.

207
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,356
it didn't seem fair

208
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:33,947
that people should die
for me to get a medal.

209
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,585
During the first nine
months of 1967

210
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,303
6.990 americans are killed in Vietnam.

211
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:46,056
More than the total killed in
the previous five years combined.

212
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,491
As U.S. losses begin to mount,

213
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,988
president johnson reminds
the american people

214
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:59,552
that the war is not only about
stopping the spread of communism.

215
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:04,225
There is an even greater cause
worth fighting for in Vietnam.

216
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,646
Johnson: Every American
must know exactly

217
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,996
what it is that we are
trying to do in Vietnam.

218
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,035
Our greatest resource,
really, in this conflict,

219
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,588
is your understanding.

220
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,130
Hall: By the summer of 1967,

221
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,505
the united states is sending more
than $500 million in aid to SV.

222
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:43,566
More than 1.5 million children
are attending hundreds of new schools.

223
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,232
And for the first time

224
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,733
hundreds of thousands
of poverty stricken civilians

225
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,278
are receiving modern medical care.

226
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,782
Johnson: It is a goal that's worthy

227
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,591
of the deeds of our brave men.

228
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:07,531
The people of Asia do matter...

229
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,651
and I pledge to all those
that are counting on us,

230
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:18,245
you can depend upon us...

231
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:25,103
because all americans will do our part.

232
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:38,577
BOONVILLE, MISSOURI
Summer 1967.

233
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,912
PURCELL HOME MOVIES

234
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:57,161
Purcell: As long as ben
and I have been married,

235
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,353
our lives have been run by the army...

236
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:03,756
but I guess that's the price you
pay for falling in love with a military man.

237
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:09,292
Hall: Anne Purcell married Ben,

238
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,531
a carrer military officer, in 1951.

239
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:19,028
After 16 years of marriage,
five children, and mnay moves,

240
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:23,483
thery are living in Boonville, Missouri,
where he is stationed as a colonel.

241
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:30,841
Ben and I both know he'll be going
to Vietnam sooner or later,

242
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,549
so we figure if he
volunteeted to go to Vietnam,

243
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:41,698
the family had a choice as to where they
stayed, and we would stay in Boonville,

244
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:46,164
because it was already like home,
having lived there four years.

245
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,985
I dreaded seeing him go,
but I knew that was his duty,

246
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:56,597
and so I just accepted it that way.

247
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,844
Right Before we leave to see Ben off,

248
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:05,828
he surprises me with a pair of audio recorders.

249
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:08,860
He's going to take one to Vienam with him,

250
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,873
and I'll keep the other so we can record tapes

251
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:13,575
and mail them back and forth.

252
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:21,073
When we get to the airport, I give Ben last kiss,

253
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,342
and tell him he better try out
that recorder as soon as he gets there,

254
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:28,280
and let me know that everything's okay.

255
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:37,307
But the war colonel Purcell is
about to join is not going as planned.

256
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:39,496
Although U.S. forces conduct

257
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,985
hundreds of search and destroy operations,

258
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:46,075
including massive sweeps involving
up to 30.000 soldiers at a time,

259
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,994
the NV and VC are elusive,

260
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:53,976
refusing to engage in locked down,
drawn out combat.

261
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:00,768
Finally, near the end of October 1967,

262
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,536
U.S. forces locate 6.000 NV soldiers

263
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:09,239
massing near the american base
at Dak To in Kon Tum province.

264
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:18,010
More than 6.500 u.s and
south vietnamese soldiers,

265
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:20,833
along with attack helicopters, fighter bombers,

266
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:23,518
and the mightiest aircraft
in the u.s arsenal,

267
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:26,973
the B-25 bomber,
are deployed to the region.

268
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:47,657
On november 3, 1967,
shortly adter midmorning,

269
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,189
The first group of three B-25's

270
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:54,300
prepares to unleash nearly
six tons of high explosives,

271
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:57,112
before the ground troops move in...

272
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:02,276
the largest clash with the NVA
since the Ia Drang Valley begins.

273
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:18,464
All morning long, bombers
have been coming in overhead.

274
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:23,060
You can feel the ground shaking like Jell-o.

275
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,693
Sergeant Charles Brown
has recovered from his wounds

276
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:35,170
and is back with the 173rd Airbone Brigade

277
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:38,009
on his way to relieve American units

278
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,008
engaged in heavy combat outsie of Dak To.

279
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:47,835
We can hear the gunfire as we get closer.

280
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:52,244
The sound of M-16's and
AK-47's rip through the jungle.

281
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:54,552
The sound of trees splintering.

282
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,833
Men screaming.

283
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:02,864
A few paces ahead,
the recon team radios back.

284
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:06,256
They've walked right into an ambush.

285
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:10,788
And now they're stuck out there
only a few meters ahead of us,

286
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:12,476
screaming for help.

287
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:18,197
We got to do something
fast before they al get killed.

288
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:20,750
C.O jumps on the radio and tells:

289
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,389
'em to hit the ground and stay down.

290
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:25,376
Then he turns to me and instructs me
to take the rest of the platoon in

291
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:27,582
to see what was going on.

292
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:33,179
knowing that my men in there was down,

293
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,224
we went in firing from the waist up.

294
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,946
just spraying the whole area.

295
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:03,731
Brown, Charles, J., staff sergeant E-6,

296
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,493
awarded Bronze star medal

297
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:12,851
with first oak leaf cluster with V device.

298
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:26,491
"Reason: for heroism in
connection with military operation

299
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,256
against a hostile force...

300
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,537
near Dak To, Republic of vietnam".

301
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,754
OUTSIDE DAK TO
November 15, 1967.

302
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,521
After three weeks of fighting,

303
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:51,484
u.s and south vietnamese
forces have stopped the NVA

304
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:54,066
from destroying the
american base at Dak To.

305
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:59,611
But of the 6000 enemy
soldiers spotted in the area,

306
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:02,954
only an estimated 600 were killed.

307
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:09,005
The remaining 5400 are
making a strategic retreat

308
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:10,659
towards Laos an cambodia.

309
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:13,857
Diplomatoc policy prohibits
u.s ground troops

00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:15,576
from crossing the border.

311
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,281
Hoping to stop the NVA
before they escape...

312
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,347
the americans give chase.

313
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:03,966
On november 19, 1967,

314
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:09,448
u.s soldiers pin down 2000 NVA
on an 875 meter high hill,

315
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,824
know as Hill 875...

316
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,882
just six kilometers from Cambodia.

317
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,703
Do you have any idea what
kind of fire we have on this?

318
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:21,979
They are immediately
ordered to take the hill.

319
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:31,630
EN ROUTE TO HILL 875

320
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:35,161
Ain't no such thing as rest for the weary.

321
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,252
2000 NVA are on Hill 875

322
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,968
and command want us
to go hunt 'em all down.

323
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:51,054
During WWII an infantryman averaged
10 days of combat in one year.

324
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,521
In Vietnam an infantryman averaged
240 days of combat in one year.

325
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,551
Hours into the assault,

326
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,398
sargeant charles brown and his battalion

327
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,104
are helicoptered to hill 875 to join the fight.

328
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,183
They are dropped in a safe zone
just out of range of enemy fire.

329
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:20,825
The entire place already looks
like hell from all the fighting.

330
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:24,498
Trees are splintered and broken.

331
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,961
Smoke billows in the distance.

332
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:30,726
You can see this is a
completely destroyed area.

333
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:35,819
Trees gone, nothing to hide on, just a whole...

334
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:43,741
Unbelievable how it had been destroyed.

335
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:50,006
As brown and his men make their
way towards the american units,

336
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,918
they have no idea of horros that lay ahead.

337
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,586
The NVA have transformed Hill 875

338
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:02,365
into a heavily fortified stronghold,
brimming with prebuilt bunkers

339
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,882
and carefully carved put escape routes.

340
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:10,832
It's a cunning trap that the
americans are waking right into.

341
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:17,274
As we head into the twilight,

342
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:20,126
we can hear the mortar and artillery shells

343
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,759
exploding a few miles out in front of us.

344
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,518
Up ahead, men start whispering back

345
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:31,225
whenever they come across a dead body.

346
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,178
Pretty soons, seems like all you hear is:

347
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:42,611
"¡Body! ¡Body! ¡Body!".

348
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,424
OUTSIDE TAM KY
300 miles to the north.

349
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,279
Five hours ago, we were out
there in the middle of the bush.

350
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,543
Now I'm cracking open a warm
beer while ckick shakes her butt.

351
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,403
300 miles to the north,

352
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:20,888
second lieutenant Barry
Romo and his platoon

353
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:23,613
are on a 2 day breack
after being in the field

354
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:26,314
for 30 straight days
of search and destroy.

355
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,422
I guess this is one of the
crazy things about Vietnam.

356
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:34,530
One minute you're out there,

357
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,364
freaking out about tripe
wires and booby traps...

358
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:42,185
and the next thing you know,
they fly you into a rear area,

359
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:45,561
where they take away our weapons
and our hand grenades,

360
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:48,671
and they would plop us on a beach

361
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:52,406
like in apocalypse now
and have a big barbecue,

362
00:29:52,406 --> 00:29:56,018
and you would drink and they
would bring in tons of alcohol.

363
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,497
And then after two days,

364
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:04,984
they would pour you
back into the helicopters

365
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,395
and give you your weapons back

366
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,361
and fly you to an area for another operation,

367
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,657
for another 30 days.

368
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,824
It's so bizarre.

369
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:32,427
All anyone knows is that no one has
any idea what will happen next.

370
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,109
I had an officer in training that once said:

371
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:53,872
"The viet cong guerrillas are the
fish in the sea of the people,

372
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:57,952
and our jobs is to dry up that sea".

373
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:02,283
I thought he was crazy for saying that...

374
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,789
but now that I've been
out here for a few months,

375
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,188
I'm starting to see what he meant.

376
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,627
Second lieutenant Barry
romo is back in the field

377
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:16,781
seraching a south vietnamese village.

378
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:22,692
Civilians sympathetic to the viet cong
hide weapons and supllies,

379
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:25,460
while those who side with the americans

380
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,181
stay silent for fear of
brutal communist reprisals.

381
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:33,870
As result, the americans
cannot tell friend from foe...

382
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:37,444
leaving the villagers caught in the middle.

383
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,620
We're told the VC threaten
these people with their lives

384
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,366
unless they help them.

385
00:31:47,796 --> 00:31:49,941
So you got to figure
it's not really their fault.

386
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:56,160
But at the same time,
when you find a bunch of AK-47s

387
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,140
hidden in some villager's chicken pen,

388
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:01,905
you can't help but feel like they'r
the reason your buddies are dead.

389
00:32:04,503 --> 00:32:08,057
I mean, these are supposed to be
the people we're here to help.

390
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,838
Only it seems like don't give
a shit about helping us.

391
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,848
I've never once had a Vietnamese say:

392
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:20,848
"Don't go down this trail,
because there's a mine" ...

393
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:25,330
or, "Don't go over to this area

394
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,911
because the north Vietnamese
are gonna ambush you".

395
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:34,052
You morality wears down.

396
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:37,192
Your patience wears down.

397
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:40,679
After a while,

398
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:44,199
people started blaming the
Vietnamese for our casualties.

399
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:46,994
All of the Vietnamese,
and there's a genuine

400
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:50,592
dehumanization of the people
we were supposedly there to help.

401
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:01,084
This isn't like my dad's war.

402
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,541
We aren't fighting uniformed
nazis on our way to Berlin.

403
00:33:05,904 --> 00:33:07,270
Out here,

404
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:10,336
we've got to figure things
out every days as it's gappening.

405
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:13,246
So given a choice between your buddy living,

406
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,007
and one of those villagers living,

407
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,022
you know who you're gonna pick.

408
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:24,654
'Cause that's just the way it is,
and all any of us want to do

409
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,506
is get out of here
and get back home alive.

410
00:33:35,258 --> 00:33:38,481
HILL 875
Day three of Battle.

411
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:46,524
Every time one of these birds tries
to come in with supplies,

412
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,401
NVA shoots 'em up.

413
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,270
We already got two birds shot down.

414
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:05,380
Sargeant Charles Brown
and the 173rd airbone brigade

415
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:08,340
are pinned down on the side of hill 875.

416
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,197
Over the past 48 hours,

417
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,239
u.s and south vietnameses forces

418
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:15,821
have made several attempts to take the hill.

419
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:19,884
So far, all they have to show for their efforts

420
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,364
are mounting numbers of dead and wounded.

421
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,144
The north Veitnamese
are dug in, and dug in deep.

422
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,884
We were gonna have to burn them out.

423
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:44,788
Each platoon was ordered
to send a man forward

424
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,708
to our little rear camp to learn

425
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,202
or be familiar with the
operations of a flamethower.

426
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:58,201
And I ordered one of my replacements,

427
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:05,739
Billy Cupid, he was kind of
stocky black kid from Chicago,

428
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:10,331
and I told him:
"Get familiar whith the flamethower".

429
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,674
With flamethowers in hand,

430
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,467
u.s forces prepare for
their final push up hill 875.

431
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,641
I order my men to get into position.

432
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,530
All of a sudden,

433
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:59,267
mortars and rocket fire
start coming downs on us.

434
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:05,598
105's are screaming overhead,
and men are shouting and firing.

435
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:12,549
Smoke start clogging my lungs
and the sounds of small arms

436
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:17,254
and machine gun fire rips through the air.

437
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:22,265
As we charged the hill with
the flamethower on his back,

438
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:27,138
that pressure tank was hit
with a piece of shrapnel...

439
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,826
and the concussion of hit killed billy.

440
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:38,597
For a moment,

441
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:42,703
I am frozen with the
unbelievable sight of a man dying

442
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:44,942
right in front of me.

443
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,534
Soldier: Take the first two lines!

444
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,048
But then the incoming fire snap me out of it.

445
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:53,926
Soldier: Go! Go! Go!

446
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:57,349
It's constant and
coming from everywhere.

447
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:05,613
There seems little strategy
left other than move forward

448
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,269
and kil anything in front of you.

449
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:20,264
HILL 875
Day Five of Battle.

450
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:41,704
Only a couple choppers have
landed since we took the hill.

451
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:44,930
And all they've brought
is the bare necessities...

452
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:51,333
ammo, water, rations, and body bags.

453
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:56,369
Lots of 'em.

454
00:37:58,103 --> 00:38:00,645
On november 23, 1967,

455
00:38:01,255 --> 00:38:04,711
after five days of harrowing,
close-quarters combat,

456
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:08,938
u.s forces, including sergeant
charles brown an his company,

457
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:12,167
finally take hill 875.

458
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:20,856
115 americans have been killed,
and another 253 wounded.

459
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:25,272
Combined with the casulities from
the previous three weeks,

460
00:38:25,538 --> 00:38:27,458
Brown's 173rd brigade

461
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:31,961
has lost nearly one-fifth of
its total fighting strength.

462
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,288
Medics are making their
way to wounded troopers,

463
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:40,639
giving 'em sips of water or shots of morphine.

464
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,731
You got to admire them.

465
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:47,352
Lot of these boys ain't no
more than 18, 19 years old,

466
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,018
but they fought better and harder

467
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:53,015
than anything I could have ever hoped for.

468
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:57,030
They fought like the well disciplined,

469
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,686
professional soldiers they were trained to be.

470
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:03,487
Just like the soldiers I had trained them to be.

471
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:10,949
Despit their succes in
courageously taking the hill,

472
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:15,210
the American soldieres are
unable to achieve the primary goal,

473
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:19,339
killing all of the enemy
soldiers in Kon Tum Povince.

474
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,149
Of the 6000 north vietnamese originally spotted,

475
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:27,899
only some 1400 were killed.

476
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:31,763
The rest escaped into Laos and Cambodia

477
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:33,907
the night before the final assault.

478
00:39:36,437 --> 00:39:39,652
Six days after spilling so much blood to take it,

479
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:42,732
u.s forces leave hill 875.

480
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,619
In the strategy of search and destroy,

481
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:54,797
victory is mesured by
enemy bodies, not territory.

482
00:39:55,497 --> 00:39:59,336
Hill 875 is now considered worthless.

483
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:10,116
It didn't take us long to realize
there ain't no iwo jimas in Vietnam.

484
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:14,246
We don't get to plant
our flag and claim victory.

485
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:21,187
But we know we've done what
we was assigned to do.

486
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:24,262
We knew we were superior.

487
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:26,697
We knew we has killed all that was up there.

488
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:31,585
We didn't know at that time
that some of them had left.

489
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,419
That was one of the myths of vietnam.

490
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:40,015
Each time you take a
piece of ground, we left it,

491
00:40:40,837 --> 00:40:45,711
and they returned to
that same piece of ground.

492
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:52,398
But we left the hill as heroes.

493
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,827
We finally captured Hil 875.

494
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:01,400
That's the way we left it.

495
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:04,351
We were heroes.

496
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:09,432
Lost some buddies, lost some men, yes,

497
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:15,385
but we defeated the enemy on hill 875.

498
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,091
DECEMBER 1967

499
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:20,335
16.250 americans have
been killed in vietnam.

500
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,243
An estimated 186.000 enemy
troops have been killed.

501
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:34,338
Faced with only the cold
hard numbers of body count,

502
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,474
the american public has a difficult time
seeing measurable progress in vietnam.

503
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,906
In two years, public support
for the war has dropped

504
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,651
from 80% in 1965 t only 46%.

505
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:01,322
But with nearly half a
million soldiers overseas,

506
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:04,054
president Johnson and
his generals are convinced

507
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:06,432
that they have turned the corner.

508
00:42:07,794 --> 00:42:09,508
They launch a massive campaign

509
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:12,573
designed to reinvigorate
public support for the war

510
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:15,636
and demostrate that
victory is on the horizon,

511
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,794
so long as the american
public doesn't give up

512
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:21,496
so close to the finish line.

513
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:25,260
I could quote a number
of meaningful statistics

514
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,727
such as the roads that are being opened.

515
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,844
The numbered of weapons being captured...

516
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,709
and other statidtical information

517
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:41,013
that suggests we are making
progress and we are winning.

518
00:42:42,114 --> 00:42:44,799
Today, I can tell you that military progress

519
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:47,950
in the past 12 months has
exceeded our expectations.

520
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:55,919
And so I report to you

521
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:59,416
that we are going to continue
to press forward.

522
00:43:00,968 --> 00:43:04,680
We will provide all that our
brave men require

523
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,715
to do the job that must be done.

524
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:13,667
Let the world know that
the keepers of peace

525
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:17,572
will endure through every trial

526
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:21,731
and that with the full backing
of their countrymen...

527
00:43:23,124 --> 00:43:25,095
they are going to prevail.

528
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:30,222
