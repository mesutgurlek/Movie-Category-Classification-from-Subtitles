1
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:00,179
[Frank] Eight months is a long time
to be engaged, Major Houlihan.

2
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:04,244
- <i>[Hawkeye] Pickups without teeth.</i>
- It's hardly your affair, Major Burns.

3
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,812
An affair is an affair
is an affair.

4
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,655
- [B.J.] Who wrote that, Hawk?
- Gertrude Stein to Alice B. Toklas...

5
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:11,786
on a piece of brown paper bag.

6
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,797
- I understand they were very close.
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>

7
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:18,426
They wrote together, traveled together
and gave each other German haircuts.

8
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,436
That's two pieces
of shrapnel.

9
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,632
Personally, I think your Colonel
Penobscott's full of banana oil.

10
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:27,871
Not intending to pry, Major,
but has your wedding date been set?

11
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:30,743
- Not yet, Father.
- No ring. No wedding date.

12
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:34,148
I think it's, uh,
"Thanks for the buggy ride."

13
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,483
- Burns, why don't you get off
Major Houlihan's back?
- [B.J.] More sponges.

14
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,819
I'm sure Major Houlihan's
colonel is sincere.

15
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,654
- Oh, for God's sake!
- That's what I had in mind.

16
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:45,786
Frank, do I hear a little wave
of jealousy drifting through O.R.?

17
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:48,627
Jealous? How could I be jealous?
I'm a married man.

18
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,687
- <i>[Margaret] Hah!</i>
- I heard that "Hah."

19
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,015
Will someone please
change the subject?

20
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:56,525
- Why, did it wet itself?
- I read that a Japanese businessman...

21
00:01:56,593 --> 00:02:00,359
while playing golf in a rainstorm,
was struck by lightning in his zipper.

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,091
Shocking.

23
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,360
Medically speaking,
he had his zip zapped.

24
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:06,527
- Was he all right?
- <i>Oh, he's fine.</i>

25
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:10,061
Ever since his accident, he's been crazy
about "Stormy Weather."

26
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,768

L-I think we're getting him.
Uh, Colonel Penobscott?

29
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,614
- Yes, sir. It's Major Houlihan calling.
- You got him? Here!

30
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:26,986
- You got him. Right.
- Donald? Donald?

31
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:28,991
- Why don't you sit...
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

32
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:31,459
- I just wanted to talk to you, darling.
- You have...

33
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:34,554
I know I could have written.
Oh, it's so good to hear your voice.

34
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,565
Well, did you get
Mr. Hotsy Totsy on the phone?

35
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,726
- This is personal. Please leave.
- I'm here on business.

36
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:40,861
- Have you got those papers I asked for?
- Papers?

37
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,928
- I'll find them myself.
- My monthly report!

38
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:47,102
Donald, I've been talking to a friend,
and this friend suggests...

39
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,270
- and I agree...
- Time to get a few things straightened out.

40
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,576
That it's time to get
a few things straightened out.

41
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,582
- Time to set the date.
- It's time to set the date.

42
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,118
- No, I realize you're busy, dear.
- Sure he's busy.

43
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:58,677
- Fraternizing with bathhouse bimbos.
- What's a bathhouse bimbo?

44
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,689
Start not listening for a change.
Do you hear me?

45
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,691
- Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir! Right.
- Shut up!

46
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,818
Who is this friend?
No, I don't mind telling you that.

47
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,828
- No names!
- Major Frank Burns.

48
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,990
- Ooh! You're scrunching my report.
- That's right. Yes.

49
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,091
- That Frank Burns.
- You're scrunching... Could you just...

50
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:15,763
- You will? Oh, Donald, that's wonderful!
- Could I just...

51
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:19,104
- I can hardly wait to see you! Bye!
- It took me a whole...

52
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,507
- Frank, you did it! You've done it!
- Did what?

53
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:24,274
- Did what?
- He's coming here. He wants to talk to you.

54
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:27,145
- What do you mean?
- He's coming here. He's on his way... Donald.

55
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,879
- Here? Penobscott's coming here? To MASH?
- Yes! Yes!

56
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:32,854
He said he wants to
straighten things out once and for all.

57
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,322
- Ease up, please. Look what you did.
- [Whimpers]

Sir, can I have
two weeks' furlough?

59
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:41,520
- No.
- Oh, golly.

60
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:44,099
- Klinger!
- Pass off, Klinger.
You're always hogging the ball.

61
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,601
- That's no way to talk to a lady.
- It's a habit, guys.

62
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,900
In Toledo, if you pass
the ball to somebody, they sell it.

- Let go, you crumb!

Radar, you wanna reorganize
the entire filing system?

66

- Jump ball!
- Isn't it unusual for the ref
to change his call?

67
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:03,786
Not if he's a corporal.

68

Colonel, l-I believe
you're standing on my foot.

- Hi.

- Captain Pierce.
- Hello. How are you?

- Lieutenant. Father.

Now there's
your regulation hug.

Wow. They must really
like each other.

they close their eyes?

Would you excuse us, Colonel, sir?

Of course.
Of course.

Gee, I'm so embarrassed.
I threw him the ball.

93
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:29,066
It was very sportsmanlike.

- Okay.

Geez, I wonder what they're
saying to each other.

100

She's saying, "Donald, darling, I'm not
getting any younger, you know."

101
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:53,662
And he's saying, "Margaret, darling,
I couldn't love you more.
