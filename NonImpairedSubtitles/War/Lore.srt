1
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,660
One,

2
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:35,953
two,

3
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,621
three,

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,373
four,

5
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,333
five, six,

6
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,252
seven

7
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,629
Heaven.

8
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,132
Seven,

9
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,634
six, five,

10
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:52,970
four,

11
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,100
three, two, one.

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,351
Hell.

13
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,188
One,

14
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,689
two,

15
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,232
three,

16
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,942
four,

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,611
five, six,

18
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,613
seven.

19
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,490
Heaven.

20
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,576
Seven,

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,161
six, five,

22
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,496
four,

23
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,748
three, two...

24
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,616
We can only take what fits in the truck.

25
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,394
I'm not talking about the damn truck!

26
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,439
Hey, here she is.

27
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,859
My girl.

28
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,777
Come here.

29
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:36,657
You're wet.

30
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,039
You look completely different.

31
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,624
Not so different.

32
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,962
I wouldn't know you on the street.

33
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,965
I would know you, Vati.

34
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,096
That is comforting.

35
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,640
Lore.

36
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,559
Wake the twins,

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,853
we have to pack.

38
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,438
Vati,

39
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,607
are you coming?

40
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,443
Aren't you going to answer her?

41
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,203
Just six plates and cups,
but take the silverware.

42
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,788
All of it.

43
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,544
Lieschen, what are you doing?

44
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,129
Help your sister.

45
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,218
Did I ask you to pack the glasses?

46
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,763
You have to listen.

47
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,316
We called him Peter,

48
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,817
like you, Vati.

49
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,740
Here, take him, he's wet.

50
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,249
Pick it up, G-Canter!

51
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,583
Oaf!

52
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,668
You are!

53
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,079
Law for the Prevention of
Hereditary Diseased Offspring

54
00:04:14,163 --> 00:04:15,522
CONFIDENTIAL

55
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,273
Vati?

56
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,614
I'm just getting her some water.

57
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,784
Mrs Richter will look after her
until we come back.

58
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,953
Now go back to your mother.

59
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,996
Please go.

60
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,136
Come on, girl.
Out.

61
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,314
How are we better off here?

62
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,150
They'll find us.

63
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:54,993
Hurry!

64
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,663
Careful, damn it!

65
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,351
You're such a coward.

66
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,832
Are you coming back, Vati?

67
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,412
Heil Hitler.

68
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,295
Is your mother awake?

69
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,010
Yes.

70
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,646
Take this.

71
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,738
Gunter, hurry!

72
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,848
The fuhrer.

73
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,516
Don't touch it.

74
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,060
Come.

75
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,480
Come away from here.

76
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,907
It's coming, Mutti, isn't it?

77
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,700
What?

78
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,119
The final victory.

79
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,423
Put the others to bed.

80
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,925
I'll be back soon.

81
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,608
Mutti?

82
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,994
Stay away from me!

83
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,916
What has happened?

84
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:39,856
Put the blanket over it.

85
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,152
Please cover it, Mama.

86
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,612
Go away!

87
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,202
Why are you looking at me?

88
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,873
Stop it.

89
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,214
Do you hear?

90
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,433
He's gone.

91
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,855
It is the end.

92
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,695
He's dead, Lore.

93
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,238
Vati?

94
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,906
Vati.

95
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,079
Our Fuhrer, Lore

96
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,416
He's dead.

97
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,352
Mutti?

98
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,691
There is nothing to eat for Peter.

99
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,080
Hello.

100
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,165
Hello.

101
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,210
We wondered if we might buy some food?

102
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,490
- Is your mama still here?
- Yes, of course.

103
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,535
We thought they had taken her to prison.

104
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,373
I have to join your father.

105
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,420
If I'm not back in three days,

106
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,839
you must go to Omi.

107
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,178
Go to the train station
and buy tickets to Hamburg.

108
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,391
And from there to Husum.

109
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,436
And then over the mud.

110
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,897
You remember, Lore?

111
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,443
Hamburg is far.

112
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,114
If I don't go willingly,
they will come and take me.

113
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,033
Use the money first.

114
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,512
There is jewellery in my big suitcase.

115
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,126
Are you going to prison?

116
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,671
You mustn't worry.

117
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,257
I won't.

118
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,385
It is a camp.

119
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,678
Yes.

120
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,097
It is not a prison.

121
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,183
Prison is for criminals.

122
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:52,919
Take him.

123
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,172
Take him.

124
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,882
Take him!

125
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,971
Aren't you taking him?

126
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,932
They kill all the children.

127
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,548
You're not coming back, are you?

128
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,766
You must remember who you are.

129
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,635
You mustn't worry.

130
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,472
They will be here soon.

131
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,518
But we mustn't be afraid.

132
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,442
Before the victory there is always pain.

133
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,456
Hold his head up.

134
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,667
It mustn't go under.

135
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,503
If he goes under, would he drown?

136
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,670
He might.

137
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,382
A boy drowned in Hamburg, in Jenisch Park.

138
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,800
What did he look like?

139
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,470
You didn't see a thing, you ran away.

140
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,891
Where is that?

141
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,353
This is Omi's house.

142
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,149
There's blue windmills on the wall.

143
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,068
Lots of them.

144
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,903
Wait till you see.

145
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,782
And who is she?

146
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,454
Mutti's sister.

147
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,873
She died in the first war.

148
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,001
She had a bad cough and then she died.

149
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:22,795
Where's Mutti?

150
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,091
Close by, with Vati.

151
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,970
If they are close,

152
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,722
why don't they come and get us?

153
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,188
They are probably thinking about
where we will live,

154
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,065
and

155
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,152
what colours they will paint the house.

156
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,236
Things like this.

157
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,093
Why won't he open the door?

158
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,128
I caught him stealing.

159
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,839
I don't know how your parents
brought you up.

160
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,299
You think you can just help yourselves?

161
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,386
Is that what they taught you at Hitler Youth?

162
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,056
Get up!

163
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,811
This is not your house,
no one wants you here!

164
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,356
We'll keep the baby,
but the rest of you must go.

165
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,700
Let go, I want Mutti.

166
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,785
Get in there.

167
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:20,663
Let him out!

168
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:23,124
A German boy does not steal
and then cry like a baby.

169
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,668
- When is Mutti coming back?
- Never!

170
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,670
Go away!

171
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,993
Gunter is a dirty little thief.

172
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,967
Now we have to go.

173
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,011
All because of Gunter!

174
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,681
She said for us to wait!

175
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,519
Come out!

176
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,648
It's all your fault.

177
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,570
The Americans have special little prisons
for children like you.

178
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,490
Horrible places, where children are tortured.

179
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,610
Maybe she will come tomorrow.

180
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,929
I don't want to go to prison, Lore.

181
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,041
No, she's not coming.

182
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,293
She's at Omi's.

183
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,172
I spoke to her.

184
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,716
You were not there.

185
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,636
She's at Omi's.
Vati, too.

186
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,254
I can pay you!

187
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,091
I can pay you.

188
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,992
We want to go to the train station.

189
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,974
Did your mother make that dress?

190
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,311
This is from a store.

191
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,313
Where's your mother now?

192
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,317
Hamburg, with Omi.

193
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,320
And your father?

194
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,407
Dead?

195
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,908
He's fighting.

196
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,327
Then he's a fool.

197
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:28,582
We don't have any trains any more.
The Americans took them.

198
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,388
You're heading for Karlsruhe on this road.

199
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,586
Over to the French if you go too far.

200
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,757
- We want to go to Hamburg.
- Go across the field, you'll see the road.

201
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,676
Here.

202
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,011
For the baby.

203
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,416
Attention, attention!

204
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:15,045
We are under American control.

205
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:21,969
Shooting from behind,
sabotage and looting are prohibited.

206
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:27,266
These crimes will be punished by death.

207
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:34,607
All Germans and non-Germans
are instructed to go home.

208
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:41,029
You are only allowed outside between
8:00 and 10:00 a.m.

209
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,366
and 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.

210
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,625
Can you help me?

211
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,381
You have to push.

212
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,315
I want to have a go.

213
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,734
- No, let go.
- Stop it, what are you doing?

214
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,322
What are you doing?

215
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,573
It's already broken.

216
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,075
Doesn't matter, leave it.

217
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,535
Go sit over there.

218
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,692
Where is Gunter?

219
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,880
Excuse me.

220
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,473
There was a lot of blood on her legs.

221
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,141
And thousands of ants.

222
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,145
Maybe they live inside her body
and ride around in boats.

223
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,107
I don't think so.

224
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,693
Maybe her blood has become
really thick like jelly.

225
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,320
A boat might not work.

226
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,747
Excuse me, would you have any food for us?

227
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,084
I can give you something for it.

228
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,296
Don't put so much wood on it.

229
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,550
Maybe blow on it a little.

230
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,302
Not so hard, you'll just blow it out.

231
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,390
Liesel, pour the eggs into the bowl.
Leave the fire alone.

232
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,521
Will you stop it!

233
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,486
Don't blow, it's no use!
We'll eat the eggs raw.

234
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,239
Sit here.

235
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,272
This is my brother, Peter.

236
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,901
He's hungry-

237
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,498
Here.

238
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:42,891
Clean yourself.

239
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,859
I said please could you clean yourself.

240
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:03,966
I had to look at dead Jews for hours,
just to get stale bread.

241
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,552
But you got two loaves!

242
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:10,640
I have diabetes,
I'm the one who deserves two loaves.

243
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,851
And I got nothing!

244
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,607
If the Fuhrer knew that!

245
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,858
Let me see.

246
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:13,972
Try that.

247
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,229
That boy was at the school house.

248
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,572
Come quickly!

249
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,944
Who's afraid of the black man?

250
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,296
Who are you, child?

251
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,299
We just want something to eat.

252
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,094
We?
Where are they?

253
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,638
Mother, father?

254
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,641
I have water.

255
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:41,935
That is all.

256
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,748
This baby has bed bugs.

257
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,380
They are all dead.
I have nothing.

258
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,675
I have paraffin.
What can you give me?

259
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,183
But that's worth more than paraffin.

260
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:27,355
Anything else?
Then I'll get you food from the village.

261
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,907
This is my mother's.

262
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,935
It won't work.

263
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,401
You gave her too much.

264
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:18,531
You shouldn't have given her the ring.
What else have you got? Nothing.

265
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,037
It stinks.

266
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,955
Stink of shit.

267
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,249
Scratch all your skin off,

268
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,959
until you are only a heap of blood and bones.

269
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,420
I don't care any more.

270
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,035
I used to have a comrade

271
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,705
You won't find a better one

272
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,460
The drum called us to battle

273
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:41,966
He marched by my side
With the same pace and stride

274
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:52,852
A bullet came flying

275
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:57,524
Was it meant for you or me?

276
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:02,237
It tore him away

277
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,741
He was lying at my feet

278
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:11,871
As if he was a part of me

279
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:21,756
His hand is reaching out for mine

280
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,802
While I'm reloading my gun

281
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:30,806
I can't give you my hand

282
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:35,103
But in eternal life

283
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:39,232
Remain my good comrade!

284
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,823
That was lovely.

285
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,409
So beautiful.

286
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,123
We broke his heart,

287
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:58,209
he loved us so much.

288
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:01,796
And the lies.

289
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,716
Those Americans.

290
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,885
With their photographs.

291
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,305
Actors.
The Americans paid all of them.

292
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,516
Come here, my little one.

293
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:14,851
Come!

294
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,394
Come on.

295
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:17,812
Come!

296
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:27,572
Get outside.

297
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,365
Put on your clothes!

298
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:30,950
You can stay here.

299
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,202
With the baby, they give you food.

300
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,291
You have the boys, yes?
The twins?

301
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,168
Leave me the baby.

302
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,119
What did she mean?

303
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,372
What she said about the Fuhrer?

304
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,540
Nothing.
She didn't mean anything.

305
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,293
Is the Fuhrer sad?

306
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,548
Lieschen?
Please?

307
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:44,440
The moon has risen

308
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:50,445
The golden stars are sparkling

309
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:54,742
Bright and clear in the sky

310
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:58,287
The forest stands...

311
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,177
Keep walking.

312
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,068
Stay here.

313
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,033
Stay.

314
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,876
Mother?
Father?

315
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:12,046
We haven't done anything.

316
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:13,548
We don't know him.

317
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,632
Papers!

318
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:20,847
- Papers! Travel only with permission.
- He was at the school. He's following us.

319
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,057
I have papers.

320
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,571
We need a lift.
At least as far as Schweinfurt?

321
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,703
Thomas.
I'm their brother.

322
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,105
Your name?

323
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,441
Liesel.

324
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:19,947
Who is this?

325
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,828
Our brother.

326
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,830
We've just been to Ansbach,
looking for food,

327
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:29,832
and have been walking.

328
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,628
Lost

329
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,672
We lost them in Buchenwald.

330
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,467
We were moved to Buchenwald
from Auschwitz,

331
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,950
and we were there until liberation.

332
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:45,848
We have to go to Omi.

333
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,477
Yes, Omi, we have to go to Omi.

334
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,522
To Hamburg.

335
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,650
In Hamburg.

336
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,744
She's worse.

337
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,816
Thomas got us food.

338
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,696
Who said you could take the baby?

339
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,172
When my father comes, he will deal with you.

340
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:47,548
So when is he coming?

341
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,091
Shut up.

342
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,604
You only eat from that side.

343
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,785
Stop it.

344
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,101
I know what you are.

345
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,856
You're a Jew.

346
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,734
I saw it on your papers.

347
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,785
I don't want you touching them,
do you understand me?

348
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:25,437
One,

349
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,606
two,

350
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,277
three,

351
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,238
four,

352
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:37,032
five,

353
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,326
six...

354
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,008
Thomas says we're not allowed in Hamburg.

355
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:56,844
He said it's over the border.

356
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,931
Germany is all broken up.

357
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:06,353
There's a Russian zone,
a British zone, a French zone.

358
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,898
We're in the American one.

359
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,362
Hamburg is in Germany.

360
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,243
Thomas says there isn't a Germany.

361
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,747
He said the Russians hate us.

362
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:28,167
All the enemies hate us
and we can't be trusted any more.

363
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,878
And all the men will be punished.

364
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,843
Why don't you like him?

365
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,433
You don't know anything about him.

366
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,394
He gives us food.

367
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,233
He gets food because of Peter,

368
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,861
that's why he stays with us.

369
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,783
He's a parasite.

370
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,578
Mutti wouldn't like him.

371
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,624
But Mutti also said there were trains.

372
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,461
Well, I like him.

373
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,143
Why are there trees growing on the roof?

374
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,187
They're camouflage.

375
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,189
Why?

376
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,567
Because they built bombs.

377
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:23,782
Did you fight?

378
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:28,746
No, I was in prison.

379
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:32,499
What did you do?

380
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:33,959
I stole.

381
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,422
Did you have a gun?

382
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,800
No.

383
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,191
My Vati is fighting in Belarus.

384
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,308
What do you want?

385
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:54,279
I don't want to swim it, Lore.

386
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:58,325
- It's easy.
- Shut up, Gunter. You can't even swim.

387
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:01,286
I can swim with Peter.

388
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,498
You'll get to the other side and leave us.

389
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:09,544
We have to cross here.

390
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:11,922
There are no bridges for days.

391
01:08:12,631 --> 01:08:14,031
I'll go down there and have a look.

392
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:25,894
Go back!

393
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:47,624
Hello.

394
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,209
God!

395
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,752
You gave me a scare.

396
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,087
What are you doing down here?

397
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:54,214
I am walking.

398
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,634
I can see that.

399
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:01,888
My grandmother lives across there.

400
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:07,811
And your parents?

401
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,403
She has a house with windmills on the walls.

402
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,072
And a big garden with flowers.

403
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:23,702
- Do you know the house?
- No.

404
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:30,000
Strange heat today.

405
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:36,295
I need to cross the river.

406
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,098
Come here.

407
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,267
Let me have a look at you.

408
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:49,519
Closer, I don't bite.

409
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,378
I can sing something for you.

410
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,256
Yes.

411
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,301
Go on.

412
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,472
Little brother dance with me, take my hands

413
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:29,184
Go this way, then that way
Twirl around, it's easy

414
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:33,271
Clap, clap, clap, go the hands
Tap, tap, tap go the feet

415
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:38,485
Go this way, then that way
Twirl around, it's easy

416
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:03,510
There's water in it.

417
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,730
A broken watch and a little deer
for my trouble.

418
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,192
It's all I've got.

419
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:21,444
Do you know how much work
I have ahead of me?

420
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:26,574
And a bleating wife at home.
If I don't get this done, no dinner for me.

421
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:33,933
Child, you smell like death.

422
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:28,655
What have we done?

423
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:18,473
Don't touch me.

424
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:52,465
Lore did not mean to.
She didn't mean it.

425
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:40,430
If they ask you anything, I'm your brother,

426
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,347
and our parents are dead.

427
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,766
Just say that.

428
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,770
Wait here.

429
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,862
- Have you seen my brother?
- Piss off!

430
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,719
Did you tell them?

431
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:21,095
What?

432
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:24,015
Did you tell them what we did?

433
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,820
He said the trains are running again.
But they won't let us through.

434
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:40,198
We'll walk at night.
It's safer.

435
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:47,997
Come.

436
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:34,460
Lore.

437
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,052
What language was that boy speaking?

438
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:44,887
Polish.

439
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,640
We're in the Russian zone.

440
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,643
We need to get into the British one.

441
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,605
They're from a camp.

442
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:57,859
Come.

443
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:22,008
Quiet!

444
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,618
Someone's cooking.

445
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:17,623
I'm hungry.

446
01:21:17,707 --> 01:21:19,041
Quiet.

447
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:26,299
You don't move till I get back.

448
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,224
Will Thomas be back?

449
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:18,224
Gunter.
Come here, sit down on the blanket.

450
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,226
He's coming.

451
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:21,437
Thomas!

452
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,022
Thomas!

453
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:24,523
He's brought someone.

454
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,442
Thomas!
Here!

455
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:34,033
Stop!

456
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,201
Gunter!

457
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:52,760
Run!

458
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,139
Come on!

459
01:22:58,933 --> 01:23:00,226
Gunter!

460
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:28,796
They shot him.

461
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,966
You should have stayed down like I told you.

462
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:35,511
It's your fault they shot him.

463
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,055
You stole their food and now he's dead.

464
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:42,601
He fell down.

465
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,520
He ran the wrong way.

466
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:47,922
He should have stayed in the trees.

467
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:51,360
On the ground.
Like I told you!

468
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:54,864
Leave it on!

469
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:04,122
He should have kept quiet.

470
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,458
He thought it was you.

471
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:08,961
It wasn't me.

472
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,341
Gunter?

473
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:15,676
Eat!

474
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:17,303
I don't want to.

475
01:24:18,012 --> 01:24:19,555
Eat your bread!

476
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:22,099
- I don't want to.
- Eat it!

477
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,568
If you don't come now, I'll go without you.

478
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:28,707
You can't leave me.

479
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:35,381
There are no more borders now,
you can get there by yourselves.

480
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:38,634
You've got the baby,
they'll let you on the train.

481
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:43,430
If you stay,

482
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,308
I'll let you keep the baby.

483
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:48,185
You can keep Peter.

484
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,398
I'll tell everybody he died.

485
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:55,067
I don't want him.

486
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:58,070
You can pretend he's your brother.

487
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,324
I don't want him.

488
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:04,952
You won't get away with it.

489
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,037
They'll find you.

490
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:09,290
And you will be punished,

491
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,208
like all the others.

492
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:15,045
Like all the men who did bad things.

493
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:17,798
There are people everywhere
who did something.

494
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:19,884
No one cares.

495
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,817
I can't help you any more.

496
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:44,867
I told them Mutti and Vati would be there.

497
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,705
But they're not.

498
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,001
I don't care.

499
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,336
You lie!

500
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:58,255
You always lie.

501
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:01,342
You can't help it.

502
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:05,638
All you filthy Jews!

503
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,479
Sometimes I look at you

504
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:18,150
and I can see them.

505
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:21,361
One lie after the other.

506
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:23,239
They are everywhere.

507
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:28,077
I can't stop thinking of it.

508
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:39,964
I can't stop thinking of it.

509
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:37,187
Were they the same pictures as before?

510
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:38,772
No, different ones.

511
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,943
One was in Poland, I think.

512
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:45,279
The others were in Germany.

513
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,574
There was one of women in a pit.

514
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:53,746
Lots of women.

515
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,748
Naked.

516
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:57,750
A little boy.

517
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,959
They're exaggerating it.

518
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,128
They're always the same photos,

519
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:02,713
just a different angle each time.

520
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,466
And the people are thin
and lying on the ground.

521
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,843
But it said they killed them.

522
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:09,053
Shut up.

523
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:10,804
Stop talking about it.

524
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,310
It's not like the soldiers in these pictures
killed all these people.

525
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,955
You don't see any pictures of them
actually killing them, right?

526
01:29:54,765 --> 01:29:56,350
My wallet.

527
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,436
It has to be here.

528
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:56,762
Do you promise not to tell?

529
01:31:58,555 --> 01:31:59,556
What?

530
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:08,607
I only did it so he couldn't go.

531
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,457
It's not him.

532
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,302
Thomas Weil.

533
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,388
He said it didn't matter.

534
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,640
The man was a Jew.
He was dead already.

535
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,059
The Americans like Jews.

536
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:47,062
So he pretended to be a Jew.

537
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:51,483
So what is his name?

538
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:56,071
He didn't tell.

539
01:32:58,407 --> 01:33:02,119
They are the dead Jew's photos.

540
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,705
Is this Omi's house?

541
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:50,292
I think so.

542
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,294
Are you sure?

543
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:56,173
The lights are on.

544
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:14,566
Berta!
Be quiet!

545
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,360
Who's there?

546
01:34:17,778 --> 01:34:19,696
Hannelore, Omi.

547
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:22,491
My God, Hannelore!

548
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:24,493
Where is my Asta?

549
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:25,911
Where is Mutti?

550
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:27,621
Where have you come from, child?

551
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:32,459
From the Black Forest, Omi.

552
01:34:48,684 --> 01:34:51,478
Come on, sit.
Sit.

553
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:55,774
You have all grown so big.

554
01:34:55,941 --> 01:34:57,943
And here's little Peter.

555
01:35:00,404 --> 01:35:02,155
And this is Gunter.

556
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:06,952
No.

557
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:11,540
No, he is dead.

558
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,377
In Russia.

559
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,421
This is Jurgen.

560
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,136
You lied.

561
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:28,598
She said Mutti would be here.

562
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:31,643
I'm sure Lore didn't lie.

563
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,646
She's not here,
because she's being punished.

564
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,065
Isn't she, Omi?

565
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,235
She's in prison with Vati.

566
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:43,822
You must never feel ashamed of them.

567
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:45,907
It is all over now.

568
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:50,829
Your parents did nothing wrong.
You know that, don't you?

569
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:54,166
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

570
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,586
They did nothing wrong.

571
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,297
Yes.

572
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:02,299
Come.

573
01:36:07,387 --> 01:36:09,848
Give me your arm.

574
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,555
Hannelore Dressier!

575
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:41,767
Let me look at you.

576
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:44,479
The last time I saw you, you were a little girl!

577
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:47,273
Come, sit down.

578
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:52,696
So, what would you like for breakfast?

579
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:54,906
Show her the dance, Wiebke!

580
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:58,910
- I'm all right.
- Come on, Lore, you'll like it.

581
01:39:58,994 --> 01:39:59,995
Leave me be.

582
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,746
She never wants to do anything fun.

583
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:04,332
I don't believe that, Lore!

584
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,209
Look.

585
01:40:07,544 --> 01:40:11,463
Your hand goes here, you be the lady.

586
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:13,258
And now.

587
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:22,434
Look, here, Zulu!

588
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:25,437
Give me your hands and now...

589
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:42,245
Please.

590
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,290
I can't.

591
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:35,882
Thomas with Lisa - 1936

592
01:41:46,726 --> 01:41:48,978
Lisa - Breakfast - Spreewald

593
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:36,609
A good boy waits until he is served.

594
01:42:38,403 --> 01:42:41,614
Put it on your plate, you've touched it now.

595
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:45,743
Where did you learn such a thing?

596
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:51,207
What are you doing?

597
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:52,834
Put it down at once, Hannelore.

598
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:04,429
You may leave the table.
