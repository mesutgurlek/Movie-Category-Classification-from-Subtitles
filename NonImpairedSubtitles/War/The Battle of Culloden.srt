1
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:27,263
<i>Wednesday, April 16th 1746.</i>

2
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,804
<i>This is the advance battalion</i>

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,103
<i>of an English Government army
of 9,000 men.</i>

4
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,972
<i>Their objective: Culloden Moor,</i>

5
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,848
<i>four and a half miles southeast
of the Highland town of Inverness.</i>

6
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:48,049
<i>Their purpose: the destruction of the
Highland Jacobite army of rebellion,</i>

7
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,288
a <i>tired, ill-administered force
of less than 5,000 men</i>

8
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,400
<i>who wait just beyond
the top of this ridge.</i>

9
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,069
<i>Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Jacobite military secretary.</i>

10
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,568
<i>Suffering advanced debility
and loss of memory.</i>

11
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:06,141
<i>Former military engagement
56 years ago.</i>

12
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,409
<i>Sir John MacDonald,
Jacobite captain of cavalry.</i>

13
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,113
<i>Aged, frequently intoxicated,</i>

14
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,909
<i>"described as " a man
of the most limited capacities.“</i>

15
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,950
<i>John William O'Sullivan,
Jacobite quartermaster general.</i>

16
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,186
<i>"Described as " an Irishman
whose vanity is superseded</i>

17
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,593
<i>only by his lack of wisdom."</i>

18
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,899
<i>Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
Jacobite commander in chief.</i>

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,997
<i>Former military experience:
10 days at a siege at the age of 13.</i>

20
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,171
You must understand, without
putting too fine a point on it,

21
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,143
that the army here is
in a total shambles.

22
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,508
I've got half my company missing.

23
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,676
I just can't find them.
They've gone off somewhere to sleep.

24
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,646
<i>Your Royal Highness,</i>

25
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,419
<i>why exactly are Mr Sheridan,
Sir John MacDonald and Mr O'Sullivan</i>

26
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,721
<i>handling the administration
of your army?</i>

27
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,922
Because I chose them.

28
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:05,162
I consider those gentlemen to be
utterly trustworthy and competent.

29
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,232
The first thing my men will find
when they do awake

30
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:11,308
is the enemy on them,
cutting their throats.

31
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,035
<i>James MacDonald, taxman.</i>

32
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,669
<i>Senior officer
in a ruthless clan system,</i>

33
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,077
<i>who's brought with him
on to the moor</i>

34
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,582
<i>men whose land he controls.</i>

35
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,147
<i>Alistair McVurrich,
subtenant of a taxman.</i>

36
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,553
<i>Owns one eighth of an acre
of soggy ground and two cows.</i>

37
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,885
<i>Alan MacColl,
subtenant of a subtenant.</i>

38
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:42,930
<i>Owns half-share in a small
potato patch measuring 30 feet.</i>

39
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,798
<i>Angus MacDonald,
servant of a subtenant.</i>

40
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,928
<i>He owns nothing.</i>

41
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,642
<i>Lowest in the clan structure,
he is called a “cotter.“</i>

42
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,406
<i>This man is totally dependent on
the men above him in the clan system.</i>

43
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,879
<i>They, in their tum, on the taxman.</i>

44
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,015
<i>They, in their tum, on this one man,</i>

45
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,849
<i>the man who has brought them all
onto the moor.</i>

46
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,982
<i>Alexander MacDonald,
called, in Gaelic, MacDhomhnuill,</i>

47
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,321
<i>chief of the MacDonald's of Keppoch.</i>

48
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,294
<i>The owner of all his tenants' land,</i>

49
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,425
<i>the rem he has charged them
is to fight with him as clan warriors</i>

50
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,195
<i>whenever he decrees.</i>

51
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,533
<i>This is the system
of the Highland clan: human rent.</i>

52
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,245
I hold my land from MacCruachan,
as my father did,

53
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,575
by bringing him 20 fighting men
from amongst my tenants.

54
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,977
These I have brought.

55
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:41,255
<i>To this man, who is rent,
today's battle is a matter of honour.</i>

56
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,668
I fight today because it is an honour

57
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,746
to be with my chief, MacDhomhnuill,

58
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,180
and because my father
fought beside his father.

59
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:13,213
<i>To this man, who is rem,
the battle is a matter of revenge.</i>

60
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:27,932
I fight first for MacDhomhnuill,
then for Charlie.

61
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,073
Then because the Campbells,
who did steal my cows,

62
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,835
are with the enemy.

63
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,040
I have also raised
over 100 men from Rannoch.

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,377
Some were unwilling.
With these, I used force.

65
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,885
<i>Alistair McVurrich, told by
his taxman that if he did not fight</i>

66
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,254
<i>he would have his cattle taken
and his roof burnt.</i>

67
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,462
<i>This is the system of the clan,</i>

68
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,267
a <i>system that has brought
on to the moor over 4,000 men,</i>

69
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:03,204
<i>men from Argyll and Inverness,
from Moidart, Appin and the isles,</i>

70
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,310
<i>Catholics, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians,</i>

71
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,380
<i>the MacDonalds, the MacLeans,
the Chisholms, the Camerons,</i>

72
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,882
<i>the Farquharsons, the Frasers,
men of 14 major Highland clans.</i>

73
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,155
<i>Men like this.
Donald Cameron of Loch Eil,</i>

74
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,057
<i>chief of the powerful clan Cameron,</i>

75
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,165
<i>fearing for the survival of
the ancient and ruthless society</i>

76
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,994
<i>to which he belongs.</i>

77
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,103
<i>Because he is here on the moor,
most of the other chiefs are here.</i>

78
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,399
<i>Because he is here, Keppoch is here.</i>

79
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,868
Because I feel that
the Act of Union with England

80
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,445
is a betrayal.

81
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,979
Because Prince Charles is a Catholic
and I am a Catholic.

82
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,245
And the king in London
is a Protestant.

83
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,753
Because Charles is part Scot

84
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,053
and I am a Scot.

85
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,557
And the king in London is a German.

86
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,091
<i>Prince Charles Edward Stuart,</i>

87
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,228
<i>the centre of all these men's hopes,
himself half-Polish.</i>

88
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,904
<i>Age 25 and four months,</i>

89
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,271
<i>son of the exiled
James the Pretender,</i>

90
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,470
<i>he landed in Scotland
nine months ago,</i>

91
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,775
<i>raised the clan army
on a Highland surge of nationalism,</i>

92
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:23,011
<i>marched to Derby and came within an ace
of toppling the Hanoverian dynasty</i>

93
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,816
<i>and regaining the throne
for his father.</i>

94
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,659
<i>Though since forced
to retreat back into the Highlands</i>

95
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,319
<i>and despite
all evidence to the contrary,</i>

96
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,056
<i>Charles remains supremely confident</i>

97
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,102
<i>both of victory and
his welcome by the English people.</i>

98
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,969
King George ll is both
a usurper and a tyrant.

99
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,274
He's kept my father's crown

100
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,847
by enslaving all the people
of this island.

101
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,545
He's deemed unpopular

102
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,983
and I know that once victory is mine

103
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,022
the people of England
will welcome me.

104
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,055
<i>Lord George Murray, age 51.</i>

105
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,667
<i>Lieutenant General in the clan army.</i>

106
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,626
<i>As their commanding officer,</i>

107
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,398
<i>this man forged
the undisciplined Highlanders</i>

108
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,304
<i>into an army that not only
almost reached London</i>

109
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,469
<i>but that also twice reduced
superior English forces</i>

110
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,547
<i>into a panic-stricken rout,</i>

111
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,775
<i>first at Prestonpans,
then at Falkirk.</i>

112
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:31,384
<i>Blunt, imperious, this man has
bitterly quarreled with Charles</i>

113
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,151
<i>over the chaos
in the army administration</i>

114
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,453
<i>and over the choice
of this battlefield,</i>

115
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,457
<i>chosen by John William O'Sullivan.</i>

116
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,126
<i>Flat, treeless, devoid of shelter,</i>

117
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>ideal for the employment
by the British army</i>

118
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,128
<i>of its cannon and cavalry.</i>

119
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,036
<i>And from behind the shelter
of these walls,</i>

120
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,838
<i>which O'Sullivan
has refused to pull down,</i>

121
00:08:54,967 --> 00:09:00,440
<i>Lord George Murray also fears
both crossfire and outflanking.</i>

122
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,381
<i>Mr O'Sullivan,</i>

123
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,523
<i>in view of what Lord George
feels about the battlefield,</i>

124
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,386
<i>have you inspected
the ground yourself?</i>

125
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,993
- No, I have not.
- Why not?

126
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,129
Because I don't deem it necessary.

127
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,757
It is a large, plain moor

128
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:19,802
and, as such, it's a fair field
for the enemy horse and cannon

129
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,802
against which the
Highlanders will be defenceless.

130
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,372
I have informed His Royal Highness
that it is a good field

131
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,967
which I believe it to be.

132
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,713
I have told the Prince
I do not like it.

133
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,381
<i>Your Highness,
why are you fighting today,</i>

134
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,544
<i>when the ground here has been
criticized by some of your officers?</i>

135
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,655
Because God is on our side

136
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,523
and I am convinced that my duty
to my people lies in fighting today.

137
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:48,331
It's my opinion that the choice
of the field for us is suicidal.

138
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,677
<i>9,000 men, 16 battalions of infantry,</i>

139
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,148
<i>12 squadrons of cavalry,</i>

140
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,451
<i>8 companies of militia,</i>

141
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,994
<i>220,000 rounds of musket ammunition,</i>

142
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,989
<i>10 three-pounder battalion cannons,</i>

143
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,862
<i>800 three-pound cannonballs,</i>

144
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,899
<i>500 bags of cannon grapeshot.</i>

145
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,490
<i>This man's name is Fraser.</i>

146
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,321
<i>A deserter from the Government army,
he still wears its uniform</i>

147
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,295
<i>but now stands
in the ranks of the Prince's army,</i>

148
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,065
<i>amongst the men
of his own clan and name.</i>

149
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,731
<i>He knows that,
if he is captured as a deserter,</i>

150
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,403
<i>he will be immediately court-martialled
to a sentence of death by throttling.</i>

151
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:57,020
<i>These are the Wild Geese,
150 exiled Irishmen</i>

152
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,720
<i>sewing in the army
of His Most Christian Majesty,</i>

153
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:04,096
<i>Louis XV of France, the most
powerful ally of the Stuart cause.</i>

154
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,564
<i>Brigadier General Walter Stapleton,</i>

155
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,970
<i>commander, Irish pickets
of the French army.</i>

156
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:15,206
Yes, we're here because
Prince Charles is a Catholic.

157
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,012
It will be a fine thing
for all Catholics

158
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,380
when Charlie's on the throne
and German George is off it.

159
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,748
If we had a Catholic king
on the throne in this country,

160
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,854
then we could get back
to living in our own.

161
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,355
You must remember that
your Protestant king in London

162
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,191
is passing penal laws
against the Catholics in Ireland.

163
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,033
I'm from County Tipperary.
Now I've got to live in Boulogne.

164
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,662
You won't find a Catholic Irishman
with much cause to love George ll.

165
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,144
<i>William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland,
third son of King George ll.</i>

<i>Age 25 and one day.</i>

<i>Alexander Laing, private.

<i>Patrick McColman,

<i>two days ago 800 lashes for looting,</i>

172
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,263

173
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,439
<i>John Mallaby, private.</i>

174
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,735
<i>Pressed into service.</i>

175
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,673
<i>William Roach, private.</i>

176
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,150
<i>Two years of his pay would not
buy even the wig and hat</i>

177
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,948

to piety or to common morals

181
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,390
<i>would endanger
the owner to be cashiered.</i>

182
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,000
I will now pass...

183
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,961
in the middle of the second line.

184
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,832
Your Highness.

185
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,342
Give me a battery
in the centre of the front line.

186
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,514
<i>Alexander Laing
carries a .753 musket,</i>

187
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,260
<i>firing a ball of
one ounce and a third weight</i>

188
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,829
<i>an effective distance of 60 paces.</i>

189
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,632
<i>He carries sufficient ball, paper
and black powder for 24 cartridges.</i>

190
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,535
<i>He carries at his hip
a brass-hiked sword</i>

191
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,699
<i>and a bayonet
with 18 inches of ﬂuted steel.</i>

192
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,013
<i>Alistair McVurrich
carries in his right hand</i>

193
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,542
<i>an outdated dragoon pistol</i>

194
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,242
<i>for which he has
no further ammunition.</i>

195
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,919
<i>What's the gun you're sewing?</i>

196
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,181
It's a three-pounder.
Right now, it's downright useless.

197
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,690
<i>Why's that?</i>

198
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,420
We've only got 4 lb ammunition for it.

199
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,028
I tell you, it's chaos.

200
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,599
Half the ammunition's with the food.
That's still back in Inverness.

201
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,262
I haven't eaten for...
I don't know how long.

202
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:59,301
Ah, well now... that really
is not my responsibility.

203
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,071
<i>But, Mr O'Sullivan, you are
the quartermaster general</i>

204
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,842
<i>and, as such, surely you're responsible
for the distribution of food.</i>

205
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,350
In normal circumstances, yes

206
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:12,445
but now, as I am much pressed
by other affairs,

207
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,318
I have given that responsibility
to someone else.

208
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,527
<i>When was the last time you ate?</i>

209
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,598
Two days ago.

210
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,534
The day before yesterday.

211
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,871
This morning he killed a pig

212
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,707
but wasn't allowed time to eat it.

213
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,985
I can't remember.

214
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,316
<i>Andrew Henderson, Whig historian,
biographer of Cumberland,</i>

215
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,725
<i>eyewitness of the Battle of Culloden.</i>

216
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,591
The time is 12:15.

217
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,490
Now this wall,
behind which we're sheltering,

218
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,730
is at approximately right angles
to the rebel lines.

219
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:06,203
I've drawn a rough sketch map here.

220
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,643
The rebel lines are here.

221
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,313
We are here.

222
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,518
And the Duke of Cumberland's army
is here.

223
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,502
<i>9,000 men in 16 infantry battalions</i>

224
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,195
<i>three of which are themselves Scot,</i>

225
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,172
a <i>total of 1,300 regular soldiers

226

227

<i>of Stirling, Edinburgh,
Dumfries and Glasgow,</i>

228
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,648
<i>a further 8,000 men.</i>

229
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,320
<i>Charles Edward Stuart,</i>

<i>has more Scots-in-arms
against him than for him.</i>

232
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,569
<i>And, ranged against him
in the Highlands,</i>

233
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,180
<i>he has the Whig clans
siding with the Government,</i>

234
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,441
<i>the Munros, the Rosses,
the MacKenzies,</i>

235
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,017
<i>the McLeods of Skye, the Sutherlands,</i>

236
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,214
<i>and here on the moor,
the Campbells of the Argyll militia.</i>

237
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,064
<i>Here to fight Charles and his
rebellion, here to take clan revenge,</i>

238
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,294
<i>Angus Ian Campbell,</i>

239
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,338
<i>wife murdered by the MacDonalds.</i>

240
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:49,503
<i>Alistair MacDonald, brother
killed by Campbells in a cattle raid.</i>

241
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,481
<i>For him, loyalties to Charlie
mean little.</i>

242
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,481
<i>For him,
today's battle is a clan battle.</i>

243
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,423
The swords those bastards use
can cut a man in half.

244
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,359
Well, I reckon
we'll have them this time.

245
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:10,024
- Why do you say that?
- We've got a new bayonet drill, see.

246
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,328
You don't poke
at the man in front of you.

247
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,531
You poke at the man
coming at your chum on the right.

248
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,004
That means,
as he's lifting his sword arm,

249
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,075
you get him underneath, like.

250
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,775
<i>What do you think about the rebels?</i>

251
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:31,145
Well... I ain't taken me clothes off
for six weeks.

252
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,088
I reckon till we lay
them bastards out I won't, neither.

253
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,223
I'll tell you one thing.

254
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,654
I know a lot of the boys
make fun of our Billy Cumberland

255
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,888
but I reckon he's all right.

256
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,491
He's a tough bastard
but at least he feeds you

257
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,900
which is more than some of them do.

258
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:52,771
I've heard said the rebels want to cut
him as small as herbs for the pot.

259
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,812
Well... I don't reckon that.

260
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,477
They're a lot of friggin' savages.

261
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,983
<i>Donald Gram, a farmer,</i>

262
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,917
<i>forced a month ago
into the Highland army,</i>

263
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,058
<i>twice has deserted

264
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,490
<i>twice has been captured

265
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,792
<i>Euan MacDonald, farmer,</i>

266
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,568
<i>forced into the Highland army
the day before yesterday.</i>

267
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,130
<i>With him his son,
John Angus MacDonald,</i>

268
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,009
<i>the day before yesterday a ploughboy,</i>

269
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,338
<i>today a rebel in arms.</i>

270
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,241
<i>His age, 13.</i>

271
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,250
I can't just make out
what's happening in the rebel lines.

272
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,488
There's much confusion of movement.

273
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,690
Large numbers of men are moving about,
changing their position...

274
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,139
and there are large gaps
in the centre.

275
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,844
It seems to me as though
the entire line is completely askew.

276
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,212
<i>Why is this?</i>

277
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,077
We are all MacDonalds and, as such,

278
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:11,218
we are entitled to stand
on the right in the line of battle.

279
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,952
This is an ancient
MacDonald privilege

280
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,356
and yet Mr O'Sullivan

281
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,660
has thought fit to place
Lord George Murray's men

282
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,899
in that position.

283
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:30,298
The main reason is that
yesterday the Prince had an idea

284
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,307
for a surprise march by night
on the camp of Cumberland.

285
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,275
This we attempted. It failed.

286
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,178
But it meant that we were
all up marching the entire night.

287
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,617
Consequently, the men are exhausted

288
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,554
and are still stumbling
into their positions.

289
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,359
<i>What effect has this had
on your men?</i>

290
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,255
Look at them.

291
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,725
<i>When did you last sleep?</i>

292
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,734
As far as I am concerned,

293
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,105
we are now putting an end
to a bad affair.

294
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,937
The Scots are fair fighters
until a crisis is reached

295
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,078
and it's my opinion
we've now reached that crisis.

296
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,555
With all these things amiss
in our army,

297
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,951
it would have been better had the
Prince made some plan for retreat.

298
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,227
<i>Bu! Charles
has made no plans for retreat.</i>

299
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,389
<i>He says that only those who are
afraid can doubt his coming victory.</i>

300
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,330
<i>He puts from his mind
the discontent of the MacDonalds,</i>

301
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,630
<i>the fatigue and hunger of his men,</i>

302
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,001
<i>the total outnumbering of his army,</i>

303
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,870
<i>the thinning of ranks by desertion,</i>

304
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,999
<i>the ill choice of battlefield,</i>

305
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,546
<i>convinced as he is
of the invincibility of his men.</i>

306
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,978
God is on our side.

307
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,986
Our cause is just
and we will triumph this day.

308
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:57,352
The soldiers in the Elector's army
know me to be their lawful Prince.

309
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,954
And so I'm convinced
they'll break in panic,

310
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,067
for they will never dare fight me.

311
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,835
Battalion, fix your bayonets.
Fix.

312
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,225
<i>This man's name is Chisholm,
James Chisholm.</i>

313
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,867
<i>A private in the Government army,
he is also a Highland Scot.</i>

314
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:48,611
<i>This man's name too is Chisholm,
Roderick Og Chisholm.</i>

315
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,745
<i>Fifth son of the clan chief,</i>

316
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,907
<i>he stands before his men
in the Prince's army.</i>

317
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:58,478
<i>The Chisholm 500 yards away
is this man's brother.</i>

318
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,754
<i>Charles Edward Stuart's war
is a civil war.</i>

319
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,199
They've started.
The rebel cannon have opened fire.

320
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,107
The cannon have opened
from the rebels' centre

321
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,677
and they're over-elevated.

322
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,272
Fire!

323
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,610
Batteries...

324
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,184
from open sights...

325
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,749
at will... fire!

326
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,519
Pull!

327
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,188
Fire!

328
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,396
Fire!

329
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,564
That's the Duke of Cumberland's
cannons.

330
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,398
Cannonades all around me!

331
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,303
I'm going to have to shout
to make myself heard!

332
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,282
The smoke
is beginning to thicken.

333
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,015
It's going to be very difficult

334
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,889
to see what effect our cannon
is having on the rebel lines.

335
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,710
<i>A cast-iron ball of three pounds'
weight, fired from open sights.</i>

336
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,441
<i>This is roundshot.
This is what it does.</i>

337
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,710
Pull!

338
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,254
<i>Alistair McInnes, age 20.
Right leg severed below knee joint.</i>

339
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:57,236
<i>Malcolm Angus Chisholm, age 24.
Disembowelled.</i>

340
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,946
<i>Ian MacDonald, age 13. Shot.</i>

341
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,380
<i>1:12.</i>

342
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,981
<i>Dazed, indecisive, Charles
has moved to behind</i>

343
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,317
<i>the right ﬂank of the Jacobite lines</i>

344
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:17,757
<i>and is now unable to see
what is happening to his army.</i>

345
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,341
<i>Ordered by O'Sullivan
to stand in the ranks six-deep,</i>

346
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,033
<i>the men on the Highland right</i>

347
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,543
<i>make a clear and tight-packed target
for the English gunners.</i>

348
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,386
Pull!

349
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:51,085
The rebels' artillery
have stopped firing altogether

350
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,292
and, before they did, we counted...
How many?

351
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:59,333
We counted 15 to 20 shots
fired by our artillery

352
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,764
for every one fired by the rebels.

353
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,300
<i>1:17.</i>

354
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,636
<i>The second result of
O'Sullivan's administration.</i>

355
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:12,175
<i>The Prince's artillery, iii-fed
by a sporadic ammunition supply,</i>

356
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,816
<i>ill-served by untrained amateurs,</i>

357
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,485
<i>ceases fire.</i>

358
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,081
Pull!

359
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,560
<i>Have you had orders to attack, sir?</i>

360
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,253
- No, I've had none!
- Well, why not?

361
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,331
The Prince hasn't given any!

362
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,628
If he doesn't give them soon,
he'll lose the entire army!

363
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,464
We're being shelled to pieces!

364
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,122
Pull!

365
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,362
Reload!

366
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,728
Pull!

367
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,671
Reload!

368
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,960
- What's the Prince <i>doing?</i>
- I don't know!

369
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,297
Nobody knows what he's doing!

370
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,872
<i>1:22. Prince Charles Stuart,
paralyzed with indecision,</i>

371
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,069
<i>still has given no order,
either to advance or to retreat.</i>

372
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:54,244
<i>1:22. Clan Cameron,
200 men, shot to pieces.</i>

373
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,717
<i>Clan Stewart,
180 men, shot to pieces.</i>

374
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,190
This is fantastic!

375
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,349
If this keeps up much longer,

376
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,087
our gunners will have
finished the whole affair.

377
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:10,290
The cannonade... The cannonade
has given our men infinite spirits.

378
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:21,677
<i>Clan Chisholm casualties,
47 killed or maimed.</i>

379
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:28,347
This is incredible! Those men have
been standing there for 22 minutes!

380
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,351
They're just lining the ranks!

381
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,721
The rebels are being
literally blown apart!

382
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,026
Why are they standing there?
Why in God's name don't they run?

383
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,890
<i>1:30. Still no order to advance.</i>

384
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:49,130
<i>Clan army casualties,
700 dead or maimed.</i>

385
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,189
<i>Charles Stuart hopes
that by not advancing</i>

386
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,657
<i>he will tempt the Government army
out of its battle lines to attack him.</i>

387
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,053
<i>1:32 pm. Cumberland orders a move</i>

388
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,889
<i>but not the one
his cousin is expecting.</i>

389
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,461
I want Wolfe's battalion
to advance inside on the left!

390
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,333
Your Highness!

391
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,411
<i>At 1:32, Cumberland places a battalion</i>

392
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,073
<i>behind one of the walls
O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,</i>

393
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,043
<i>to fire into the side
of the clan army</i>

394
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,314
<i>when it charges
the Government front.</i>

395
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,688
<i>This is the crossfire
O'Sullivan said would never happen.</i>

396
00:29:54,626 --> 00:30:00,042
Oh, yes, yes... Units of the Argyll...
the Campbell-Argyll militia, yes?

397
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,611
And there are squadrons
of dragoons with them.

398
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,016
Yes, it's obvious that
His Royal Highness has decided

399
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:13,054
to have units of the Campbell-Argyll
militia and some squadrons of dragoons

400
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:17,285
to go down behind
the south side of this wall,

401
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,985
out of sight of the enemy,

402
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:22,826
to take them in the rear
and outflank the rebels.

403
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,525
<i>Thus, also at 1:32 pm,</i>

404
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,831
<i>begins the outﬂanking movement</i>

405
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,839
<i>that O'Sullivan
said would never happen.</i>

406
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,843
<i>29 minutes too late,
Charles Stuart orders an advance</i>

407
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,847
<i>along the entire from
of the Jacobite army.</i>

408
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,685
And you make the right side advance!

409
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,688
<i>Bu! The message
fails to reach the right wing.</i>

410
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,433
<i>Casualties, 850.</i>

411
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,939
<i>Have you still had
no orders to attack?</i>

412
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,043
No! I've had no orders!

413
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,078
I had a message from Mr O'Sullivan,

414
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,614
which, as ever,
I failed to comprehend!

415
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,684
- The line's broken up!
- What?

416
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,783
They're charging,
they're coming straight at us!

417
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,122
Sir, the right has broken forward!

418
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,057
The walls will hold them.

419
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,727
- They're going straight!
- Get down behing the wall there!

420
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,369
After 28 minutes of cannonfire!
What sort of men are these?

421
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,742
- Right! Change from ball to grape.
- Change from ball to grape!

422
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,744
<i>A cylindrical canvas bag
eight inches in length,</i>

423
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,754
<i>packed with musketballs
and pieces of jagged iron.</i>

424
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,857
<i>This is grapeshot.
This is what it does.</i>

425
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,323
Pull!

426
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,357
Pull!

427
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,140
It must be the grape! The centre
has collided with the right.

428
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,034
There's great confusion,
bodies flying!

429
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,063
They must be going to receive fire
from our centre battalions!

430
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,681
Charge! Charge!

431
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,290
Fire!

432
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,099
Bastards!

433
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,772
God, they're almost upon us!

434
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,214
They're firing from this side
and from this side.

435
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,012
They're been cut to pieces!

436
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,110
It must be chaos behind those walls!
Chaos!

437
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,529
Barrell's!

438
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,530
<i>Towards this one regiment,
Barrell's Fourth of Foot,</i>

439
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,865
<i>heads the entire right
of the clan army,</i>

440
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,102
<i>800 men in a solid clump,</i>

441
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:59,147
<i>running with a collision speed
of over 12 miles an hour.</i>

442
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,555
Alternate... firing!

443
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,961
Battalion, take care.

444
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,197
Fall in by rank. Take aim!

445
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,895
Rear rank, present!

446
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,195
Rear rank, fire!

447
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,869
Fire!

448
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,639
Front rank, take aim!

449
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:34,915
Front rank, fire!

450
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,250
Rear rank, present.

451
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,380
Fire!

452
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,029
Centre rank, present.

453
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,896
Front rank, present.

454
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,041
Remember, Barrell's,

455
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,553

emergency, fire with crippling effect</i>

<i>into the Highlanders
who broke through the from line.</i>

461

<i>sees, on the right wing, his men run
from this concentrated musketfire</i>

463
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,554
<i>and sees, on his left wing,</i>

<i>the MacDonalds, tired, hungry,</i>

<i>hold back from charging
the royal army right.</i>

467
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,795
<i>Instead, they stand and taunt,</i>

468

<i>trying to tempt the royal army lines
forward in disorder.</i>

469

Battalion Pulteney's, make ready!

470
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,323
They're stopping to pick up stones!
Shoot!

476

<i>About him, his men tum and run.</i>

477

<i>Time 1:59 pm.</i>

478

479

Christ, they're running.

480
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,995
They're leaving the field
except for two small units,

481
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,964
the French and the Irish.

482
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,740
Let them through. Stand your ground.

483
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,828
Guard, forward!

484
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,507
Oh, Jesus!

485
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,603
Front rank, present. Fire!

486
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,543
Re-form! Re-form!

487
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,518
Stand and aim! Fire!

488

490

<i>as the Scots about them run.</i>

491
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,495
Where are you going, you?

492
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,732
<i>Charles Stuart

<i>"your country and yourselves
and God forgive you.“".</i>

496
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,777
<i>But it is too late.</i>

497
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,446
<i>At one minute past two
in the afternoon,</i>

498

<i>his cause in ruins,</i>

is led from the battlefield</i>

500

<i>by the man most responsible

501
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:18,115
<i>As Charles leaves, a senior
clan officer screams after him,</i>

502
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,752
<i>"Run, you cowardly Italian.</i>"

503
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,727
- Mr Fossett.
- Your Highness?

504
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,766
- You will order a general ceasefire.
- Your Highness.

505
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,228
<i>Of the 9,000 men of the royal army</i>

506

<i>an estimated 50 are dead.</i>

508

<i>Bu! For every one corpse

509
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,345
<i>there are 24 in the clan army.</i>

510

<i>Piled in layers, dead or dying,</i>

511

512
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:28,486
<i>including the brother
of Private James Chisholm.</i>

513
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,029
<i>There was scarce a soldier or officer
of Barrell's Fourth of Foot</i>

514
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,500
<i>who did not kill one or two men each
with their bayonets or spontoons.</i>

515
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,107
<i>Not a bayonet but was bent
and stained with blood</i>

516
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,235
<i>to the muzzles of their muskets.</i>

517
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:49,345
<i>All witnesses agreed that, if
grapeshot were the king of battles,</i>

518
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,179
<i>the bayonet was now
the queen of weapons.</i>

519
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,191
<i>"It is mine and everybody': opinion,"
boasts a trooper,</i>

520
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,491
<i>"that no history can brag
of so singular</i> a <i>victory.</i>"

521
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,824
<i>How do you feel?</i>

522
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,067
Don't feel nothing, really.

523
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,210
I feel all right!
Well, now it's over.

524
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:05,018
Battalion, take care!

525
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,026
Halt!

526
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,529
<i>2:14pm. The battalions
of Cumberland</i>

527
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,764
<i>halt at the lines held by the rebels
one hour and eight minutes ago.</i>

528
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,708
Battalion, shoulder your firelocks!

529
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,818
Three cheers for His Royal Highness!

530
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,416
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!

531
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:37,420
<i>Thus has ended the last battle
to be fought in Britain</i>

532
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:41,358
<i>and the last armed attempt
to overthrow its king.</i>

533
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:46,496
<i>The Establishment has been saved,
peace restored,</i>

534
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:51,130
<i>Church, Crown,
trade and commerce safeguarded.</i>

535
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:01,547
<i>Thus the Duke of Cumberland
won his only victory</i>

536
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,078
<i>and Charles suffered his only defeat.</i>

537
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:09,222
<i>His advisers are shortly to urge
his instructions for reassembly.</i>

538
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:14,022
<i>"He is to reply, " Do as you wish.
Only, for God's sake, let us go.“</i>

539
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:18,260
<i>Charles Edward Stuart,
his cause now in ruins,</i>

540
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,264
<i>has given one order too many.</i>

541
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,469
<i>Charles pitted these men against
the modem musket and bayonet,</i>

542
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,976
<i>against cavalry and cannon.</i>

543
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,644
<i>Thus, in one hour, eight minutes,</i>

544
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,284
<i>he has reduced
the ﬂower of the Highland clans</i>

545
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,113
<i>to twitching, limbless corpses.</i>

546
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:03,066
<i>2:30 pm and His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Cumberland,</i>

547
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,307
<i>orders rum and brandy, cheese
and biscuits for his “brave boys.“</i>

548
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,585
<i>For the wounded and dying clansmen
on the moor,</i>

549
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,748
<i>there is to be different treatment.</i>

550
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:38,437
<i>All over the battlefield, whilst the
Duke of Cumberland eats his lunch,</i>

551
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,106
<i>any clansmen seen to be still alive</i>

552
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,549
<i>is either slit in the throat,
pistolled through the head</i>

553
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,782
<i>or bayonetted and trampled on
until, in the words of an eyewitness,</i>

554
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,189
<i>"the moor was covered with blood"</i>

555
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,387
<i>"and our British soldiers
looked less like Christian men"</i>

556
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,656
<i>"than so many butchers."</i>

557
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,766
What about some grub?

558
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:03,964
This rebel host has been
most deeply indebted to the public

559
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,234
for all the rapine,
murder and cruelty

560
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:11,608
and our men are heartily determined
to give them receipt in full.

561
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,413
Cut him!

562
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:19,217
Cut him, you bastard!
Take him to the shoulder!

563
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,270
I'm letting my regiments of horse
loose after the battle

564
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:39,067
in order they may have some sweets
with all their fatigue.

565
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,752
<i>Thus nearly 100 people
are to be butchered or maimed</i>

566
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,863
<i>on the road to Inverness.</i>

567
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:08,600
<i>Butchered whether or not
they took any part in the battle.</i>

568
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,968
They took my baby.

569
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,277
He's only two weeks old.

570
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:25,714
And one of them
whirled him around by his leg...

571
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,015
and threw him on to the ground.

572
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,325
<i>This is Jean Clark, aged 28.</i>

573
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,153
<i>Cut about the face and body
by sabres,</i>

574
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,960
<i>she was left lying for dead
on the road to Inverness.</i>

575
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,505
The soldiers came in and caught him,
and Daddy too

576
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,370
but I got away
through a hole in the wall.

577
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,809
- How old was your brother?
- Lachlan was nine.

578
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,316
I don't... I don't know
where he and Daddy are now.

579
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,147
Come on, you!

580
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,816
<i>4 pm. Inverness.</i>

585

<i>protecting his liberty

586
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,533
There was these two men,
shouting and screaming.

587
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:55,101
And then he came out
and there was blood on his hands.

588
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,742
<i>These troopers from the Duke
of Kingston's Light Horse Regiment</i>

by Cumberland</i>

590

<i>for their "zeal in the pursuit."</i>

591

<i>Each of them comes from Nottingham.</i>

592
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,817
<i>Each of them by trade is a butcher.</i>

593

<i>James Rae himself, who, like the other
troopers of Kingston's Light Horse,</i>

00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,891
<i>"God save our ever august King."</i>

605
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,336
<i>April 16th. 10:30 pm. Inverness.</i>

606
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,471
<i>For William Augustus,
Duke of Cumberland,</i>

607
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,666
<i>third son of King George ll,</i>

608
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,973
<i>an evening of immense
satisfaction and triumph.</i>

609
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:09,380
<i>At the age of 25,
he has saved his father's kingdom</i>

610
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,680
<i>and redeemed the reputation
of the British army.</i>

611
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:16,519
<i>At his table, older officers drink
his toast and declare him to be</i>

612
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,626
<i>one of the greatest English captains
since Marlborough.</i>

613
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:24,493
<i>His cousin Charles, until today the
heroic leader of an armed rebellion,</i>

614
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,327
<i>is now a fugitive in the heather.</i>

615
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,232
<i>If further proof were needed
of this young man's prowess,</i>

616
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,576
<i>it is here,</i>

617
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:41,304
<i>unheeded by him,
four and a half miles away.</i>

618
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:49,582
<i>This is Lachlan MacDonald
of Lochaber,</i>

619
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,194
<i>right leg severed
below the knee joint.</i>

620
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:59,130
<i>He's been lying on the moor
untended for 13 hours.</i>

621
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,161
<i>For most of the time,
it has been raining.</i>

622
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,746
<i>This is Mrs Anne Hossack
of Inverness.</i>

623
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:16,347
<i>Somewhere on the moor,
amidst 1,200 dead and dying,</i>

624
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,575
<i>is her husband.</i>

625
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,980
I don't know...

626
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:24,984
where he is.

627
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:40,196
<i>For Alexander Laing, private,
Barrell's Fourth Regiment of Foot,</i>

628
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,539
<i>this evening is also
one of immense satisfaction.</i>

629
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,271
<i>His regiment has acquitted itself
with honour on the field of battle.</i>

630
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,677
<i>He himself has despatched
three of the rebels</i>

631
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:55,084
<i>and, above all, he himself
has escaped death and maiming.</i>

632
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,515
Lucky bastard!

633
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:02,221
Battalion will take care
while the casualty lists are read.

634
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,695
It's all right for you, my lord!

635
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,963
<i>This is Mrs Anne Walker,</i>

636
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:14,173
<i>wife of Private Andrew Walker, who
was wounded in the ranks of Barrell's</i>

637
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,538
<i>and taken to the surgeons' lines.</i>

638
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,973
<i>This woman, also, has no idea
whether her husband is alive or dead.</i>

639
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,890
It is given out this morning
of Thursday 17th April

640
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,584
that the following officers
and other ranks

641
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,890
of Major General William Barrell's
Regiment of Foot

642
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,832
were either killed
or have since died from wounds

643
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,526
resulting from the glorious victory

644
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,969
inflicted yesterday
over the rebel army.

645
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,406
Killed: Captain Lord Robert Kerr.

646
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,240
Other ranks: Sergeant Pullman,

647
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:55,539
Privates Baker, Barstow, Dyke,
Finch, Lowell,

648
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,085
Lawson, Meecham, Napper, Osbourne,

649
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,845
Smart, Williamson.

650
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,358
Wounded and since died
in the surgeons' lines:

651
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,983
Corporal Lockhart,

652
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,427
Privates Davis, Pollock and Walker.

653
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,489
Battalion, take care.

654
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,129
Battalion will dismiss,
save for the duty picket.

655
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,565
Battalion, dismiss.

656
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:25,141
<i>You treated Private Walker
a short while ago, Doctor?</i>

657
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,408
Yes... Yes, I did.

658
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,380
<i>What did he die of?</i>

659
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,643
This one? He died of shock,
if I remember correctly.

660
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,082
Why was that?

661
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,918
He was an amputee.
I had to take his arm off.

662
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:44,527
Do you know what...
what is our young Billy's pleasure

663
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,496
because we fought
with such gallantry?

664
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:53,004
His Royal Highness thanks
all ye officers and men

665
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,767
for their gallant behaviour.

666
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,877
Get out of it! Leave off!

667
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,977
His Royal Highness releases
all ye military prisoners

668
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,144
who were this day
in custody of the provost.

669
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:09,149
- Have you heard about the wounded?
- Well, yeh, some talk about it.

670
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:13,126
They're gonna pay 12 guineas
out of the Duke's own purse

671
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,887
for all those wounded in the battle.

672
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,268
<i>For Lachlan MacDonald,</i>

673
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,768
<i>who's been now lying on the moor
two days with a severed right leg,</i>

674
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,241
<i>there'll be no 12 guineas.</i>

675
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,915
<i>Orders for Friday 18th April 1746.</i>

676
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,123
<i>"A captain and 40 foot
to march directly"</i>

677
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,486
<i>"and visit all the cottages"</i>

678
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,152
<i>"in the neighbourhood
of the field of battle."</i>

679
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,797
<i>"The officers and men
will take notice"</i>

680
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,662
<i>"that the public order of the rebels
on the day of battle"</i>

681
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,996
<i>"was to give us no quarter."</i>

682
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,202
Line up the bodies, men.

683
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,305
Come on, quick as you can.

684
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,177
There's another one over there.

685
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:21,785
<i>The public orders of the rebels
to give no mercy to the royal army</i>

686
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,966
<i>do not exist in any other form
than a crude forgery</i>

687
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:28,092
<i>alleged to have been found
on the field of battle.</i>

688
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,538
All right, lad.
We're only taking you to hospital.

689
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:35,108
<i>Bu! Whether he knows this
public order is a forgery or not,</i>

690
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:40,738
<i>Cumberland makes it his excuse
to authorize what now happens.</i>

691
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:47,480
Battalion, present your firelock...

692
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,426
at the man in front of you.

693
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,357
Fire!

694
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,894
<i>The officer in charge
of this execution squad</i>

695
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,059
<i>is himself a Scotsman.</i>

696
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,238
<i>Captain Scott, are many of the rebels
being killed in this fashion?</i>

697
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,874
As many as we can find.

698
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:10,173
I don't know how many men
have been killed in this fashion.

699
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,812
I fear to think.

700
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,678
But just this morning I heard
a Campbell officer saying that,

701
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:19,786
in just one area, he himself
saw 72 wounded rebels

702
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,718
shot or clubbed on the head.

703
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,516
Yes, I saw what was done.

704
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,887
<i>Did you agree with it?</i>

705
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,926
No, of course I didn't.

706
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:32,193
I will always thank God that I had
nothing to do with the black work.

707
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:36,563
You must try to remember that
this is a most difficult problem.

708
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,767
I have talked much with officers
from Lowland Scots regiments

709
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,544
and they undoubtedly feel
that these Highlanders

710
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,772
are threatening their culture,
their Protestant religion.

711
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:51,080
They're threatening to disrupt
their peace and their commerce.

712
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,322
There's a great feeling of insecurity
in the Lowlands.

713
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,858
These people still remember
the Highland host.

714
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,987
They still remember the years
of cattle thieves and murder,

715
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,766
men coming down at night
from the hills

716
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,632
and extorting blackmail
under pain of being robbed.

717
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,067
You see, the Highlander
talks a different language.

718
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,674
He wears different clothes...

719
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:22,075
and he undoubtedly has
some uncouth and barbaric practices.

720
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,013
For all these reasons,

721
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,179
I think you'll find most Lowlanders

722
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,823
hold the man
from this part of the country

723
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,823
in contempt and hatred.

724
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,520
Much more so
even than the English do.

725
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,125
<i>Why is your army treating the
prisoners and the wounded like this?</i>

726
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,599
<i>Of yourself, it's been said you're
keeping the prisoners in Inverness</i>

727
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,897
<i>without warmth, food and water.</i>

728
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,940
<i>And that you're even withholding
medical dressings from them.</i>

729
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,303
<i>Surely this is against
all bounds of humanity.</i>

730
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:52,777
Look, I think the point
somewhat eludes you.

731
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:55,716
These men are rebels and barbarians

732
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,378
and as such are to be rated as cattle
and treated as cattle.

733
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,849
Get that thing
back out the way, please.

734
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,460
<i>For three days and nights
since the battle,</i>

735
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:09,688
<i>these men, many of them
stripped of their clothes,</i>

736
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,459
<i>many of them dying
from gaping wounds,</i>

737
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,229
<i>have been lying in cold attics
and clamp cellars,</i>

738
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,239
<i>awaiting removal to the prison ships
anchored in the firth.</i>

739
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,338
<i>The British army authorities</i>

740
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,967
<i>have withheld from them
even medical dressings,</i>

741
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:27,310
<i>thus hoping to solve
the acute lack of prison space</i>

742
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:31,044
<i>by ensuring
the mortality rate remains high.</i>

743
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,611
<i>They get no food, no light,</i>

744
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,179
<i>no medical dressing.</i>

745
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,784
Get their headgear
while you're about it.

746
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,688
The belt here, too.

747
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,396
The smell in here is terrible.

748
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,298
This man next to me...

749
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,570
I think he's dead.

750
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,677
The way they are treating us,

751
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,315
you'd think we were just animals.

752
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,847
<i>Robert MacLean, salmon fisher.</i>

753
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,848
<i>To be tried without defence
at an English trial,</i>

754
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:15,896
<i>of which he is able to understand
not a word spoken.</i>

755
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,262

<i>Ranald MacDonald, farmer.</i>

759
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:32,002
<i>To wait in prison 14 months
for a trial.</i>

760
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:36,174
<i>Then sentenced at Brampton to be
pulled through its streets on a sled</i>

761
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,746

<i>Charles Edward Stuart, believing
the Scots to have betrayed him,</i>

<i>refuses to listen
to last-minute pleas</i>

764
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,623
<i>to stay and fight in the mountains.</i>

765
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:53,791
<i>Curtly and without a word of thanks
he dismisses the Highland army.</i>

766
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,403
<i>In his saddlebags
the last of the Jacobite funds,</i>

767
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,904
<i>which he has now decided
to keep for himself,</i>

768
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,100
<i>his need, he estimates,

<i>To die on the 11th day of gangrene.</i>

<i>John William O'Sullivan,

<i>To tell King James of the good part
he has played in the rising</i>

first a knighthood</i>

775

<i>Lord George Murray,</i>

<i>Prince Charles refuses to see him

<i>blaming his opposition
to his administration</i>

784

<i>for the downfall

785
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,672
Bad day for us all, this.

786
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:11,872
<i>Lord George Murray, estimated by some</i>

787
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,312
<i>as one of the most brilliant generals
of the 18th century,</i>

788
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,083
<i>who, if left to his own counsel,</i>

<i>Keep in step, now!</i>

791
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:34,664

<i>"the pacification of the Highlands."</i>

797

Patrol of Bligh's,

01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:59,190

to Lochaber,

799

with sufficient rations for two days.

800
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:07,028
All right, lads. Fall out
and pick up your firelocks.

801
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:08,929
Move it!

802
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,306
<i>Lord Sackville, what is the function
of these patrols.</i>

803
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:21,538
Their function is to march
deep into the glens

804
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:24,117
occupied by the rebels
and their families

805
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,153
and there, by vigorous police action,

806
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:31,952
ensure that never again will these
people disturb the peace of our land.

807
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,532
<i>May 30th. A military patrol

<i>strikes deep into a corrie
in Lochaber,</i>

809
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,632
<i>searching for
fugitive rebel families.</i>

810
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,139
<i>This is one of them,</i>

811
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:52,012
<i>sheltering from the rain 1,500 feet
up the side of a hill face.</i>

812
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:56,041
<i>Andrew McEachan, aged 25,</i>

813
01:02:56,672 --> 01:03:00,245
<i>who stood at Culloden,
and who now, because of the patrols,</i>

814
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,750
<i>has to hide in the hills
like an animal.</i>

815
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:09,228
<i>This is his wife, child
and a friend called Mrs MacInnis.</i>

816
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:13,925
<i>They have each been out in the open
for the past eight days.</i>

817
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,538
<i>This girl is suffering from
severe ﬂux</i>

818
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,732
<i>as a result of damp clothes.</i>

819
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,313
<i>The last meal this baby ate
was a small fish caught yesterday</i>

820
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,475
<i>and shared between the children.</i>

821
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,080
<i>This little girl, forced
to leave her home suddenly,</i>

822
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:40,983
<i>has only a thin dress,
a damp shawl and no shoes.</i>

823
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:45,265
<i>At approximately 12 noon, May 30th,</i>

824
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,459
<i>the family is sighted by the patrol.</i>

825
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,695
<i>This is what happens.</i>

826
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,135
Right, then!

827
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,550
NO! No!

828
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,673
I dunno.

829
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,510
All these officers keep telling us

830
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:42,589
these people up here
are a load of savages, but...

831
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:47,092
I dunno, they looked like ordinary
women and children up there to me.

832
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:49,888
I didn't like it, what We did.

833
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,927
I didn't like it at all.

834
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,497
Look, let me tell you something.

835
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,970
I had a mate at Falkirk.

836
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,070
He had his head split open.

837
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,901
Like that.

838
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,878
So don't try and make me
go all weeping, like,

839
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,610
over what happens
to these bastards. Eh?

840
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,875
Just don't try it!

841
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,323
<i>Well satisfied with the result
of his military occupation,</i>

842
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,654
<i>Cumberland is to leave
Scotland on July 18th.</i>

843
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:23,093
<i>He leaves behind him, to finish
the destruction of the rebel clans,</i>

844
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,598
<i>not only an immense concentration
of English and Lowland troops,</i>

845
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,532
<i>not only the zealous help
of all the Whig clans,</i>

846
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,732
<i>but even the help of the chief
of a rebel clan, Ludovick Grant,</i>

847
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:36,203
<i>son of the Gram clan chief,</i>

848
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,203
<i>who has hastily
reorganized his loyalties</i>

849
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:43,607
<i>and just delivered 82 of his own
rebel clansmen to Cumberland</i>

850
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,546
<i>for transportation to the Barbados,</i>

851
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:51,218
<i>as proof of his unswerving allegiance
to the Crown.</i>

852
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:55,794
<i>Cumberland himself is to receive
from London a tumultuous welcome.</i>

853
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:59,329
<i>From the Government,
a raise in salary of £25,000.</i>

854
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,957
<i>From George Frederick Handel</i>

855
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:04,401
a choral work,
See The Conquering Hero Comes.

856
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,234
<i>From the public,
his name for a ﬂower, Sweet William.</i>

857
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:13,510
<i>From the Scots,
his name for a weed, Stinking Billy.</i>

858
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,447
<i>Month after month,
the British army patrols</i>

859
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,614
<i>scour every hill range and glen
of northern Scotland</i>

860
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,487
<i>in an attempt, as Cumberland puts it,</i>

861
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:31,131
<i>"to wear down this generation
until there be peace in the land.“".</i>

862
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:35,501
<i>The patrols leave behind them
a trail of brutality and suffering</i>

863
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,570
<i>that is to earn for their commander
undying loathing</i>

864
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,800
<i>and the epithet
Cumberland the Butcher.</i>

865
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:45,709
<i>These three of his officers have
already burnt, smashed, raped,</i>

866
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:48,439
<i>looted and bayonetted their way
from Glenurquhart to Moidart,</i>

867
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,606
<i>committing,
in the name of pacification,</i>

868
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:54,050
<i>the worst atrocities

869

<i>Captain Caroline Frederick Scott,
Lowlander.</i>

870
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:00,959
I agree with
the senior staff officer,

871
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,563
who has proposed that £5 be paid

872
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,224
for the head of every rebel
brought to Fort Augustus.

<i>Major lain Lockhart, Lowlander.</i>

874
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:14,599
Those found in arms are ordered
to be immediately put to death

875
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:18,673
and the houses of those who abscond
are plundered and burned,

876
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:23,248
their cattle drove, their ploughs
and other tackle destroyed.

877
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:28,154
<i>Lord George Sackville, Englishman,

We have detachments
in all parts of the Highlands.

879
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:36,657
The people are deservedly
in a most deplorable way

880
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:41,024
and must perish,
either by famine or by the sword.

881
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,995
A just reward for traitors.

882
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:48,370
We hang or shoot everyone that
is known to conceal the Pretender,

883
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,535
burn their houses, take their cattle.

<i>The Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart,</i>

<i>now disguised

<i>much addicted to the little bottle

01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:17,087
<i>they proceeded to eliminate ail
the things that made this man unique</i>

905
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,194
<i>and that gave him
the strength they so feared.</i>

906
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:23,427
<i>They penalized the wearing
of his Highland dress,</i>

907
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,768
<i>penalized the weaving
of his Highland tartan,</i>

908
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,337
<i>penalized the worshipping
at his Church,</i>

909
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:33,378
<i>penalized the carrying
of his weapons,</i>

910
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,838
<i>penalized the playing of his music.</i>

911
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,182
<i>They removed
the authority of his chief</i>

912
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:44,121
<i>and, in one blow, smashed forever
the system of his clan.</i>

913
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,461
<i>They then encouraged his chief
to lose interest in him,</i>

914
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:52,793
<i>to evict him and to replace him
by the more profitable sheep.</i>

915
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:57,633
<i>Thus they reduced him
to a homeless, unwanted oddity</i>

916
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,766
<i>and finally forced him,
in his hundreds of thousands,</i>

917
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,035
<i>to leave the land of his birth</i>

918
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:06,078
<i>for the canning industries
of the North,</i>

919
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,183
<i>for the disease-ridden slums
of the South,</i>

920
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,743
<i>for the lumber camps of Canada</i>

921
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:14,215
<i>and the stockyards of Australia.</i>

922
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,314
<i>And wherever he went,</i>

923
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:19,618
<i>he took with him
his music, his poetry,</i>

924
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:23,062
<i>his language and his children.</i>

925
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,030
<i>"On an April morning.</i>

926
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,464
<i>"I no longer hear birdsongs</i>

927
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,034
<i>"or the lowing of cattle on the moor.</i>

928
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:36,699
<i>"I hear the noise of sheep
and the English language,</i>

929
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:40,314
<i>"dogs barking
and frightening the deer.“".</i>

930
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,313
<i>Thus, within a century from Culloden,</i>

931
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,214
<i>the English
and the Scottish Lowlanders</i>

932
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,346
<i>had made secure forever</i>

933
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:53,186
<i>their religion, their commerce,</i>

934
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:56,224
<i>their culture, their ruling dynasty</i>

935
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:01,532
<i>and, in so doing,
had destroyed a race of people.</i>

936
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,237
<i>They have created a desert</i>

937
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,006
<i>and have called it "peace."</i>
