1
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,827
They're watching me.

2
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,500
I don't know how long I was there.

3
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:06,634
I stayed alive by thinking
of the ones I loved.

4
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,211
Allegra.

5
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:15,247
-You're impossible.
-You're delicious. You taste like apricots.

6
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,586
Poppa.

7
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,494
My brother, Avram,
and my best friend, Jacko.

8
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:46,841
Salamo.

9
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:51,879
Jacko and I boxed together
ever since we were kids on the docks.

10
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,115
You got it.

11
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,255
You drop your guard.

12
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:59,054
He thinks you're tired,
so that brings him in.

13
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,531
Slip what's coming, then over with
a straight right. That's the punch.

14
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:06,931
What I cared about most
was fighting and winning.

15
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,238
Come on!

16
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,274
Champion!

17
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:32,353
Yes!

18
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,425
One, two....

19
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,762
Back to your corner!

20
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,529
Three, four...

21
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,862
...five, six...

22
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:44,733
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

23
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,619
Salamo!

24
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:06,621
Ladies and gentlemen...

25
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,332
...the winner...

26
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:14,528
...and the new middleweight champion
of the Balkans...

27
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,071
...Salonika's own Salamo Arouch!

28
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,798
Then the Nazis occupied Greece.

29
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:14,330
We couldn't eat in cafes like everyone else.

30
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,399
We couldn't ride in cars and buses.

31
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:21,769
We couldn't even walk on the streets
of our own city.

32
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:27,571
Our homes and jobs were taken away,
and we were forced to live in ghettos.

33
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,341
Anyone found outside the walls was shot.

34
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:43,523
lt's tomorrow morning!
We're leaving, 6:00 sharp.

35
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:47,731
The train station, 6:00!
One suitcase apiece is all you're allowed!

36
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:50,699
Tomorrow morning at 6:00,
the train station!

37
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,234
What is it?

38
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,467
Train station, 6:00 in the morning!

39
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,048
Every day, we were taken by the SS
to do forced labor.

40
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:14,020
We're being shipped out. Everyone goes.

41
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:16,685
-When?
-Tomorrow, 6:00 in the morning.

42
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:20,221
-You see, the rumors were right.
-Where are they sending us?

43
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,925
-Who knows.
-Won't be the Riviera, you can bet on that.

44
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,501
Baby, come to Grandpa.

45
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,907
Don't cry. As long as we're together,
it's not the end of the world.

46
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,239
Come on, we have to pack.

47
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,711
Poppa, l want to marry Sarah
tonight before we go.

48
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:37,770
There's no time.

49
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,475
-We love each other.
-No!

50
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,008
-Maybe they'll let us stay together.
-Come, Salamo. We have to pack.

51
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:47,990
-For once in your life, will you listen to me?
-Why shouldn't they get married?

52
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:51,117
-Where are you going?
-l'll be back.

53
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:52,219
We don't have much time!

54
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:17,377
I believe in a high and eternal justice
that is helping us.

55
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,630
Even when I was an unknown little soldier,
I believed it couldn't be possible...

56
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:32,861
...that my people were bound to go down.

57
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,051
And because I believed in the help
of a higher creature...

58
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:57,787
...that's why I started my struggle
as a small and quite unknown quantity...

59
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,921
...in this big German Reich.

60
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:09,762
Allegra and her family were hiding
in another part of the city.

61
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:15,702
The safest place for us to meet
was in the darkness of a movie theater.

62
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:20,217
It is impossible my people will go down.

63
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:31,753
And are now more entitled than before
to live in peace.

64
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,131
l missed you so much.

65
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:42,068
A thousand times, l wished my family
had stayed in the ghetto instead of hiding.

66
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,812
You still taste like apricots.

67
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,916
l can't bear not knowing where you'll be.

68
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,598
Jacko left. He has joined the partisans.

69
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:18,939
He didn't show up for relocation...

70
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:22,009
...and the SS shot his family.

71
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:30,013
Hitler has now finished his speech,
and all together the company is singing.

72
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,519
l better go.

73
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:40,863
l have to go.

74
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,902
May l see your documents, please?

75
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:49,596
Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God,
King of the Universe...

76
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,601
...who has sanctified us
by thy commandments.

77
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,938
Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
who sanctifieth thy people lsrael...

78
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,498
...by the sacred covenant of the wedding.

79
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:01,574
Do you have the rings?

80
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,233
Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God...

81
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,006
...King of the Universe,
who hast created joy and gladness...

82
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:32,538
...mirth and exultation...

83
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,507
...pleasure and delight.

84
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:42,277
They promised us a new life in Poland.

85
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,957
Momma brought her best silver,
Poppa took the family photo album.

86
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,217
Move to your assigned car.

87
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,392
Remain calm!

88
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:59,030
Do as you are told,
and everything will be all right!

89
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:02,597
Please move quickly!

90
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,766
Where are the children?

91
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,879
l'm over here!

92
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:18,785
Quickly!

93
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:20,550
Quickly!

94
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:39,298
For six days and nights we traveled.

95
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,240
People suffered, and many died.

96
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:47,115
We didn't know it then,
but we were just one family...

97
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:49,516
...among more than 12 million people...

98
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,786
...who were sent to 1,000
concentration camps across Europe.

99
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,656
Our destination was the death camp...

100
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,363
...Auschwitz-Birkenau.

101
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:09,957
Get off!

102
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,160
Put your luggage here inside.

103
00:15:12,636 --> 00:15:14,001
Shut up!

104
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,436
Don't talk!

105
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:16,966
Get off!

106
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,241
Salamo!

107
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,088
Poppa.

108
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:44,133
Put your luggage inside.

109
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,563
Salamo!

110
00:15:58,448 --> 00:15:59,608
Julie!

111
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,091
Poppa!

112
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:45,354
Poppa!

113
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:47,087
No!

114
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:49,691
-No! Poppa!
-Beppo!

115
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,467
-Poppa!
-Beppo!

116
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:55,661
Beppo, what is it?

117
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:58,306
My father's sick. They took him away!

118
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,277
Where's your sister?

119
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,505
Elena!

120
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,274
Where are you taking her?

121
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,471
No.

122
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:46,311
-Sarah!
-Avram.

123
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:39,634
How old are you?

124
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,234
-12.
-No, you are 16.

125
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:52,943
Momma, where are you?

126
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,714
Right. Left. Left.

127
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,890
-Your age?
-16.

128
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,763
16.

129
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:10,726
Right.

130
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,200
Left.

131
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,770
-What kind of work do you do?
-Stevedore.

132
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:21,671
Left.

133
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,207
Left.

134
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:29,744
Left.

135
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:34,022
Do you know this woman?

136
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,383
She's my mother.

137
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:45,492
Give your child to her.

138
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:48,299
You will work,
and your child and her grandmother...

139
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:52,068
...will be sent to a health camp
where they will be comfortable.

140
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:54,110
Can l stay with my child?

141
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:59,377
-Yes.
-Thank you.

142
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,442
Where are they taking them?

143
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:44,984
Things will be better now.

144
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:49,061
First, you will be going
into the bathhouse...

145
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:51,828
...where you will shower
and be disinfected.

146
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:54,392
Then, you will go into the camp...

147
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:57,031
...where your families will join you.

148
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,330
Remember your numbers
so you can pick up your clothing later.

149
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:02,102
Please tie your shoes together
and place them on the floor...

150
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,605
...under your number.

151
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:07,105
Let's take off your shoes.

152
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:11,608
Please hurry. We have a lot to do.

153
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:14,443
Soon you will enjoy a hot shower.

154
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:31,819
Place all your personal possessions
on the blanket.

155
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:34,026
Watches...

156
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:37,732
...rings, money...

157
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:39,696
...keys...

158
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:41,727
...everything.

159
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,831
Anyone found with anything
on his person...

160
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,411
...will be shot.

161
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:00,819
Now, take off all your clothing.

162
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:06,290
Please...

163
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,495
...take off your clothes.

164
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:19,935
No talking!

165
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:25,866
l said no talking!

166
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,865
-What is he saying?
-Quiet!

167
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:41,707
Line up! Row of five, over there! Move!

168
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:43,444
Move!

169
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,587
Row one!

170
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:12,946
Right hand!

171
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:25,018
l said right hand!

172
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:40,698
Listen. l'm only going to say this once.

173
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:44,374
For those that can hear me, tell the rest.

174
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:48,746
First come the SS, our lord and masters.

175
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:51,786
Then comes our block Altester, Kyr.

176
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,054
Then comes the assistants, Otto and me.

177
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,422
Then come the rats.

178
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:02,192
Then come the lice.

179
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:04,593
And then come you.

180
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:07,861
You have but one purpose...

181
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,464
...to work and obey orders.

182
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,204
-Sick man here!
-Shut up!

183
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:17,178
-This man needs help!
-l said shut up!

184
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:49,342
Kyr.

185
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:51,977
Come here.

186
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,493
lnto the barracks.
You'll be assigned places. Move!

187
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:54,769
You'll be assigned the bottom bunks!

188
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:56,334
Remember them!

189
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,841
Let's go!

190
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:21,733
Remember these places!

191
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:28,403
You have five minutes till roll call.

192
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:31,778
Hey, Greek.

193
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:35,912
You can put him in my place down here.

194
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:50,723
Watch your head.

195
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,169
Just breathe deeply.

196
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:10,747
Your side's a little swollen.

197
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,445
You may have a cracked rib.

198
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:19,561
My name is Janush.

199
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:22,764
l'm Polish,
but l speak a little of your tongue.

200
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,932
Kapo Kyr...

201
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,799
...uses people like punching bags.

202
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,567
He fight to entertain the SS.

203
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:37,412
He's Maj. Rauscher's prized one.

204
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:45,719
Roll call. We must go. All.

205
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:50,082
You exit quickly, Greeks.

206
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,253
l can't...

207
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,324
...take this.

208
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:52,971
Elena...

209
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,840
...remember that summer
we spent on Crete?

210
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,376
You had a boyfriend.

211
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:01,841
What was his name?

212
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:04,286
l know what you're up to.

213
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:07,684
l don't want to play.

214
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:17,890
l can't do this.

215
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:19,834
Yes, you can.

216
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,835
Damn it! Get up!

217
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:09,544
Momma and Julie.

218
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,615
Please God, they're all right.

219
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:16,989
They're strong, Poppa.

220
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,690
They'll be all right.

221
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:04,582
Come here.

222
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:06,185
You.

223
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:32,710
Why were they hanged?

224
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:35,907
The resistance.

225
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,882
They were my friends.

226
00:42:14,656 --> 00:42:16,317
You do what l say.

227
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:18,821
Remember and learn.

228
00:42:55,097 --> 00:42:56,291
Janush.

229
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,266
You know everything.

230
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,267
Where do they take the women?

231
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,073
Do you ever see them?

232
00:43:11,914 --> 00:43:15,111
Sometimes on work details.

233
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,947
And the children?

234
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:23,185
Tell us.

235
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,851
What about the children?

236
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:30,795
They're...

237
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:33,491
...gone.

238
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:34,660
Gone?

239
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:36,902
Gone where?

240
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:38,899
Where?

241
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:45,004
Go to sleep.

242
00:44:46,174 --> 00:44:47,835
You need your rest.

243
00:45:25,914 --> 00:45:27,609
Here comes the Gypsy.

244
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,147
Get him out.

245
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:05,518
Get him out!

246
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,848
What are you doing?

247
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:20,927
-l'm starving.
-l'm hungry, too.

248
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:25,327
Just a little more.

249
00:47:25,834 --> 00:47:27,324
You had yours.

250
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:34,204
-l know how you feel.
-How can you know how l feel?

251
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,778
l'm pregnant.

252
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,197
He wants you on the truck.

253
00:49:00,462 --> 00:49:04,228
1939, the Balkan Championship
was quite a long time ago.

254
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:07,233
The Sturmbannfuhrer wants to know
where you've fought since.

255
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,597
A few bouts in the Greek Army.

256
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,335
Nothing since the war.

257
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:19,339
But l'm still strong,
and l've never lost a fight.

258
00:49:35,397 --> 00:49:38,628
May l ask the Sturmbannfuhrer a question?

259
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,701
Go ahead.

260
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:50,175
The 1936 Olympics...

261
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,705
...you were there, weren't you?

262
00:49:53,581 --> 00:49:55,981
l was with the Greek Olympic team.

263
00:49:56,651 --> 00:49:58,243
l saw you fight.

264
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:02,187
You, sir...

265
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:04,456
...sehr gut.

266
00:50:14,836 --> 00:50:17,532
You told us you never lost a fight.

267
00:50:18,173 --> 00:50:20,573
So where is your gold medal?

268
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:30,282
The Sturmbannfuhrer
says you must understand...

269
00:50:30,352 --> 00:50:32,786
...the officers bet on these fights.

270
00:50:32,854 --> 00:50:37,723
There is much money at stake,
and the Sturmbannfuhrer wants to win.

271
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,654
Please tell the Sturmbannfuhrer
that l will win for him.

272
00:50:42,263 --> 00:50:44,254
He can bet his life on it.

273
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:52,689
l've been to Salonika, before the war.
lt's beautiful.

274
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,928
How many rounds?

275
00:52:55,263 --> 00:52:56,457
Rounds?

276
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,129
No rounds.

277
00:52:58,733 --> 00:53:01,634
You fight till one goes down
and can't get up.

278
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:19,170
Pass it over so l can have my share.

279
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,299
l fought for it. lt's mine.

280
01:00:21,642 --> 01:00:24,577
Connection in this place
could help you stay alive.

281
01:00:31,652 --> 01:00:34,120
Your father's strong, but what is he...

282
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:36,085
...55, 56?

283
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:41,886
Just a matter of time
before he starts to fail.

284
01:01:13,661 --> 01:01:14,821
Poppa...

285
01:01:15,796 --> 01:01:17,764
...l got a prize for wining.

286
01:01:17,831 --> 01:01:20,163
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

287
01:01:29,877 --> 01:01:31,105
Avram.

288
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,459
Give us a piece.

289
01:01:53,434 --> 01:01:54,628
Please.

290
01:01:55,736 --> 01:01:56,998
Please.

291
01:01:58,472 --> 01:01:59,700
Come on!

292
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:02,136
You know us.

293
01:02:02,476 --> 01:02:03,773
Please.

294
01:02:04,378 --> 01:02:05,572
Salamo.

295
01:02:33,507 --> 01:02:34,838
Thank you.

296
01:02:50,858 --> 01:02:52,348
One for Danny.

297
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,893
You're doing good, Salamo.

298
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:05,068
Congratulations, Greek.

299
01:03:06,006 --> 01:03:09,373
l see you won,
and l hope you continue to win...

300
01:03:10,277 --> 01:03:14,407
...because the moment you lose,
you are not longer useful.

301
01:03:15,282 --> 01:03:16,544
And then...

302
01:03:17,685 --> 01:03:19,744
...it's out the chimney.

303
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:00,092
Listen...

304
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:04,019
...your foot no good. l know. l see.

305
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:06,290
l could help you.

306
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:08,027
-One piece of bread.
-No.

307
01:04:19,413 --> 01:04:21,847
Last night l dreamed it was a girl...

308
01:04:22,983 --> 01:04:26,544
...and when l woke up this morning,
l thought l felt her.

309
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,986
Elena, you can't have a baby here.

310
01:04:29,523 --> 01:04:32,924
What about ''Rachel''?
l always loved ''Rachel.''

311
01:04:33,193 --> 01:04:36,128
The SS doctors do experiments
on pregnant prisoners.

312
01:04:36,196 --> 01:04:40,030
When they're finished, the baby is dead.
The mother, too.

313
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,958
At the end of the dream...

314
01:04:42,035 --> 01:04:46,062
...you and l were in the theater in Salonika,
watching her dance.

315
01:04:47,775 --> 01:04:50,573
ln Lublin l was a nurse.

316
01:04:51,378 --> 01:04:53,710
For twice pieces of bread...

317
01:04:54,414 --> 01:04:55,574
...l fix.

318
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:57,678
No baby.

319
01:04:57,918 --> 01:04:59,886
l don't want to hear it.

320
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,719
One ration?

321
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:03,317
Shut up.

322
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:05,958
One and a half.

323
01:05:06,593 --> 01:05:08,322
l do it good.

324
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,900
Greeks!

325
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:25,004
The following numbers step out
for a special work detail.

326
01:05:36,156 --> 01:05:37,646
That's me.

327
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:42,027
lf they think they're going
to send me up a smokestack...

328
01:05:42,095 --> 01:05:44,063
...they've got a fight on their hands.

329
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:46,827
Don't worry.
They don't kill the strong ones.

330
01:05:48,468 --> 01:05:51,437
Don't make trouble. Do as you're told.

331
01:06:25,305 --> 01:06:27,205
Your duties begin here.

332
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:32,004
Everything of value is shipped back
to the Third Reich.

333
01:06:50,264 --> 01:06:51,959
As soon as it's safe...

334
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:55,824
...you will take out the bodies,
and then you will wash the room.

335
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:57,434
That's all.

336
01:06:57,771 --> 01:06:59,102
Follow me.

337
01:07:08,215 --> 01:07:11,742
You will get plenty to eat, even vodka.

338
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:13,813
Now...

339
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:17,251
...you go to the front of the furnaces.

340
01:07:17,391 --> 01:07:20,189
There you will see what you will be doing.

341
01:07:48,555 --> 01:07:50,045
l won't do it.

342
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,643
What was he saying?

343
01:08:16,817 --> 01:08:19,718
The Greeks refused
to work in crematorium.

344
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,712
What?

345
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:25,254
-The Germans killed them.
-What?

346
01:08:27,527 --> 01:08:29,222
-Yeah.
-My God.

347
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:53,048
They refused to work.

348
01:08:55,455 --> 01:08:56,479
So?

349
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,489
All the men.

350
01:08:59,726 --> 01:09:01,023
Avram...

351
01:09:01,862 --> 01:09:04,057
...Shimon, Nikko.

352
01:10:43,663 --> 01:10:45,096
Why did he do that?

353
01:10:45,165 --> 01:10:48,293
Why?

354
01:12:17,257 --> 01:12:19,452
Six seconds left.

355
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:02,128
These are my people.

356
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:08,001
l wanna give this to somebody special.

357
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:16,715
Okay. Only one moment.

358
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,964
Come in.

359
01:14:20,013 --> 01:14:21,640
So you stole it?

360
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,212
Sit down.

361
01:15:05,058 --> 01:15:06,650
To the Russians.

362
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:49,812
-My clogs are gone.
-Look under the blanket.

363
01:17:49,889 --> 01:17:52,414
l'll die without them. They're gone.

364
01:17:54,594 --> 01:17:55,856
Her clogs.

365
01:17:56,596 --> 01:17:58,530
Have you seen her clogs?

366
01:17:58,598 --> 01:18:01,533
Her clogs. Who took her clogs?

367
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:03,532
Her clogs?

368
01:18:04,938 --> 01:18:06,098
Bread.

369
01:18:06,906 --> 01:18:09,397
Bread. Tell me who took her clogs!

370
01:18:11,778 --> 01:18:12,938
Show me your clogs.

371
01:18:15,582 --> 01:18:17,015
Show them to me!

372
01:18:18,585 --> 01:18:20,052
They're mine!

373
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:27,259
They're mine!

374
01:18:49,248 --> 01:18:50,510
Get out!

375
01:18:51,117 --> 01:18:53,278
Get out!

376
01:19:09,869 --> 01:19:11,427
l can't look at her.

377
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,744
lt was her or you.

378
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:32,518
You have a new work assignment:
the steel mill.

379
01:19:32,592 --> 01:19:34,116
My father, too?

380
01:19:35,662 --> 01:19:36,924
He stays.

381
01:19:37,263 --> 01:19:39,231
lt's a better assignment.

382
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:42,424
Better food, and you work inside.

383
01:19:43,736 --> 01:19:45,601
lt comes from Rauscher.

384
01:20:25,545 --> 01:20:26,705
Jacko.

385
01:21:13,693 --> 01:21:14,921
Poppa?

386
01:21:15,762 --> 01:21:18,925
Come. You should lie down.

387
01:21:19,365 --> 01:21:20,764
Come on.

388
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:59,094
lt was a month before we left.

389
01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:02,469
l was at the market.

390
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:06,837
This woman was staring at me.

391
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,977
l thought she was gonna turn me in.

392
01:22:17,623 --> 01:22:19,386
l was so frightened.

393
01:22:23,429 --> 01:22:25,454
He must have been watching...

394
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:29,799
...because just as she started
to come towards me...

395
01:22:32,138 --> 01:22:33,605
...he came up...

396
01:22:34,607 --> 01:22:36,370
...and kissed me...

397
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:40,175
...and said we were late
for lunch with his parents.

398
01:22:44,183 --> 01:22:45,844
And he took my arm...

399
01:22:46,519 --> 01:22:48,987
...and walked me out to the street.

400
01:22:58,164 --> 01:23:00,598
Then he took me to his apartment...

401
01:23:05,071 --> 01:23:06,868
...and he kissed me.

402
01:23:13,112 --> 01:23:14,443
l'm sorry.

403
01:23:18,985 --> 01:23:22,045
How could l have wanted you
to get rid of her?

404
01:23:42,275 --> 01:23:43,765
l'm so hungry.

405
01:23:50,216 --> 01:23:51,808
Here, take this.

406
01:23:52,218 --> 01:23:55,483
-No. You need it as much as l do.
-You need it more. Take it.

407
01:23:55,554 --> 01:23:57,784
Go on. l'll be out in a minute.

408
01:27:37,676 --> 01:27:41,043
l'm going to the gas. Tell my mother.

409
01:27:41,113 --> 01:27:43,411
Don't worry. We'll be all right.

410
01:27:54,693 --> 01:27:56,558
Put this in your mouth.

411
01:28:01,233 --> 01:28:03,167
Think about your wife.

412
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:19,448
l am alive.

413
01:29:10,502 --> 01:29:11,901
Did you see?

414
01:29:12,938 --> 01:29:14,906
l think you're all right.

415
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:34,782
My father's been selected.

416
01:29:42,301 --> 01:29:43,529
Come in.

417
01:29:47,506 --> 01:29:49,269
Can you do anything?

418
01:29:52,745 --> 01:29:55,179
Someone would have to take his place
on the list.

419
01:29:56,982 --> 01:29:58,574
Can you do that?

420
01:30:00,519 --> 01:30:02,009
lt's too late.

421
01:34:23,682 --> 01:34:25,775
Never baby. She lie.

422
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:03,717
lt wasn't true about having a lover.

423
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,057
l never had one.

424
01:36:11,156 --> 01:36:12,953
Salamo!

425
01:36:23,568 --> 01:36:26,366
We're finally moving against the bastards.

426
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:32,438
l don't understand.

427
01:36:34,746 --> 01:36:37,647
The underground. We have explosives.

428
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:41,750
We're going to hit a crematorium.

429
01:36:44,222 --> 01:36:46,520
Why are you telling me all this?

430
01:36:48,293 --> 01:36:50,625
'Cause when we move against them...

431
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:53,459
...l need your help.

432
01:37:03,008 --> 01:37:04,498
Come.

433
01:40:13,632 --> 01:40:15,031
lf l live...

434
01:40:17,535 --> 01:40:19,196
...l'll find you.

435
01:40:20,205 --> 01:40:21,695
l'll be there.

436
01:41:39,284 --> 01:41:40,478
Get up.

437
01:41:47,292 --> 01:41:49,089
Rauscher wants to see you.

438
01:41:49,794 --> 01:41:51,091
Now?

439
01:41:51,896 --> 01:41:53,124
Now.

440
01:41:59,704 --> 01:42:01,262
There's rumors...

441
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,834
...the Russians are outside of Warsaw.

442
01:42:06,411 --> 01:42:08,402
Auschwitz is breaking up.

443
01:42:09,647 --> 01:42:12,844
Prisoners able to work
are being moved to Germany.

444
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:19,213
The rest are up the chimney,
including the Gypsies. Hurry up.

445
01:43:17,648 --> 01:43:19,673
They know it's over.

446
01:43:40,971 --> 01:43:44,429
He told Rauscher
that they're both responsible.

447
01:43:46,143 --> 01:43:48,577
He can't go home and face his wife.

448
01:44:19,443 --> 01:44:20,535
Come here, Salamo.

449
01:44:49,406 --> 01:44:50,566
Jacko.

450
01:45:26,243 --> 01:45:28,040
He wants you to fight.

451
01:45:42,192 --> 01:45:43,955
He can barely stand.

452
01:45:44,795 --> 01:45:46,456
This isn't boxing.

453
01:46:45,055 --> 01:46:46,818
Everything is ready.

454
01:46:52,729 --> 01:46:55,527
The following men report for special duty.

455
01:46:55,699 --> 01:46:57,894
You'll get plenty to eat...

456
01:46:59,136 --> 01:47:00,501
...even vodka.

457
01:47:01,405 --> 01:47:04,306
Now, go to the front of the furnaces.

458
01:47:04,374 --> 01:47:07,241
There you will see what you'll be doing.

459
01:47:48,585 --> 01:47:49,847
Let's go!

460
01:49:47,704 --> 01:49:50,036
Jew!

461
01:49:55,579 --> 01:49:59,174
How did you carry the explosives
into the crematorium?

462
01:51:45,388 --> 01:51:46,946
Salamo!

463
01:52:53,924 --> 01:52:55,255
lt's over.

464
01:53:44,841 --> 01:53:46,832
All those I love are gone.

465
01:53:47,611 --> 01:53:52,548
Their faces and what happened here
are forever burned into my mind.

466
01:53:57,187 --> 01:53:59,621
How can we do this to our brothers?

467
01:54:48,638 --> 01:54:51,266
All I have left is my love for Allegra.

468
01:54:53,009 --> 01:54:54,670
I will find her...

469
01:54:56,046 --> 01:54:57,843
...and begin again.
