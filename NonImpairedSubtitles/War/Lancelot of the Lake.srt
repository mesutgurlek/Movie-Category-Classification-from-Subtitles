1
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,045
After marvelous adventures

2
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,908
in which Lancelot of the Lake

3
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,788
played a heroic part,

4
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,681
the Knights of the Round Table

5
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,550
set off in search of the Grail.

6
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,430
The Grail was a vessel

7
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,323
in which Joseph of Arimathea

8
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,192
had gathered the blood of Christ.

9
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,072
It was to bestow supernatural power.

10
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,965
It was believed hidden in Brittany.

11
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,834
Merlin, before his death,

12
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,704
pledged the knights to the quest.

13
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,607
Merlin had indicated

14
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,476
that the quest should be led

15
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,356
by Perceval (Parsifal),

16
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,249
not by Lancelot.

17
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,118
After leaving the castle,

18
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,998
the knights were dispersed.

19
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,891
Perceval was not seen again.

20
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,760
Two years have passed.

21
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,630
Decimated, the knights return

22
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,499
to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere.

23
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,244
They have not found the Grail.

24
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,518
He whose footfalls precede him
will die within a year.

25
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:54,892
- Even if they're his horse's steps?
- Even then.

26
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,864
You said that
of those who passed yesterday.

27
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,973
It is the same omen for them all.

28
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,405
I've lost my way.

29
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,641
This is Escalot.

30
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,081
I'll show you the way.

31
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,690
Is it you, Lancelot?

32
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,725
Gawain?

33
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,792
The first is last.

34
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,897
I was lost near Escalot.

35
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,940
Greetings, Lionel,
Lambegus, Bohort.

36
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,054
Uncle, Lancelot is here.

37
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,389
Sire, I do not bring you the Grail.

38
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,937
The Grail eludes us.

39
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:58,405
So much blood, so many dead.
At least you were spared.

40
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,239
The queen must be told
that her knight has returned.

41
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,869
Mass already?

42
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,272
Not yet.

43
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:54,254
You are alive, and you are here.
Nothing shall take you from me again.

44
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,297
All is lost for us in Brittany.

45
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,016
I can wait no longer. Say it.

46
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,618
I love you.

47
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,816
Say it once more.

48
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,595
I love you. You must believe me.

49
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,559
I believe you.

50
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,037
What is the matter?
Give me your hand.

51
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,039
The one you are hiding.

52
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:55,515
Your finger is bare.
You have taken off my ring.

53
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,593
Speak; end my fears.

54
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,993
I saw the Grail.

55
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:16,139
One night, I sought refuge
in a ruined chapel; a voice challenged me.

56
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,971
I can still hear that voice accusing me
of deceit and treachery.

57
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,305
You dreamed it.

58
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:28,511
I shall be your lover no longer, Guinevere.
I vowed it to God.

59
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,082
You did that?

60
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,888
I did.

61
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,661
You must be freed from another vow
before God can hear you.

62
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,424
I ask you to free me from that vow,
Guinevere.

63
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,362
I gave myself wholly to you,

64
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,760
and you took me.

65
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,043
I'll close this room.

66
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,781
Why, uncle?
Shall we never assemble again?

67
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,347
Who?

68
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:18,154
Here sat Ydier, Clamadeu, Urien,

69
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:23,494
here Galeschin and all the others
we shall see no more.

70
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,766
Here Perceval.

71
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,176
There Claudas, and there, there.

72
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,674
No, too many dead
and too many memories.

73
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,158
Enter, Mordred.
I wish to ask you too.

74
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,158
What shall we do now?

75
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,799
I warned against
such a foolish venture.

76
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,836
You stayed behind in safety, Mordred.

77
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,666
Therefore, I won't comment
on the disaster.

78
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,704
That's not what you were asked.

79
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,333
I'd rather keep silent.

80
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,909
In that case, you may withdraw.

81
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,384
I am troubled.

82
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,619
Have we provoked God?

83
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,560
Are the deaths a punishment,
a decree of His justice?

84
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,194
Is this silent, empty castle
a sign He has forsaken us?

85
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,406
- Let us re-form our ranks.
- Not yet.

86
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,371
I lack the heart, when we have lost
so many noble companions,

87
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,639
to replace them so quickly;
we must wait.

88
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,180
With arms folded? Wait for what?

89
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,384
We have received a terrible blow.

90
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,988
May God guide us.

91
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,292
What if He does not?

92
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,654
Remain at arms.

93
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,263
Practice. Perfect yourselves.

94
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:07,270
Remain united; forget your quarrels;
cultivate friendship.

95
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,648
What says Arthur?

96
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,820
That we breathe poisoned air

97
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,563
but that you will change poison
into balm.

98
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,292
Why me?

99
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,331
He always calls on you for help,
for a miracle.

100
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,868
His words have stayed with me all day.

101
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,234
Which words?

102
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,838
All. "Perfect yourselves."

103
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,780
You have devoted your life to that,
hence your mastery in combat.

104
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,119
I must perfect myself otherwise,
but as for Mordred,

105
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,657
he won't come to us,
so we must go to him.

106
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,694
He is everything that you and I despise.

107
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,391
When he splashed you fording a river,
you said he offended your horse.

108
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,533
How he cringed before you.
I dislike weaklings.

109
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,503
They should be hanged.

110
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,278
The queen's room is lit.

111
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,385
What of it?

112
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,047
I wonder how many eyes watch that window
while they feign sleep.

113
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,616
Idle talk.

114
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:39,091
I've surprised Agravain, Guivret, Lucan.
Even Mordred dares.

115
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,356
Pay no heed. Go to bed.

116
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,422
His name will be in the calendar;
Lancelot has become a saint.

117
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,522
We'll have to wait a long time
for you to become a saint, Gawain.

118
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:14,998
I attend services. God asks no more of me.
He willed me this way.

119
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,961
He wants you to love the life
He gave you.

120
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,698
I'd love it more with fewer baleful faces
about me.

121
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,890
We must do something.
Give us a purpose.

122
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,389
I gave you a purpose. Pray, Gawain.

123
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,861
Pray.

124
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:00,970
Consent.

125
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,414
Free me from my vow.

126
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,017
You have changed, but I am the same.

127
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:12,085
Consent. I beg you,
for the salvation of us all.

128
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,487
No; I'll save no one at that price.
God does not ask us to forswear love.

129
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,062
That which was must be no more.

130
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,030
Can we make it be no more?

131
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,297
We can forestall fate,
deflect the menace.

132
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,608
There is no menace.
You all imagine it.

133
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,136
Yield, Guinevere.
I yield; I humble myself.

134
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,618
To think yourself responsible
for everything is not humility.

135
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,994
Are you, then, the enemy?

136
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,893
I am the one created to help you

137
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,262
who will go with you through the void,
the darkness.

138
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,469
I am your strength.

139
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,309
You said, "Without Guinevere,
there would be no Lancelot."

140
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,672
I wish to be alone.

141
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,011
You are alone in your pride.

142
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,219
Pride in what is not yours is a falsehood.

143
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,623
I was to bring back the Grail.

144
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,489
It was not the Grail.
It was God you all wanted.

145
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,031
God is no trophy to bear home.

146
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,763
You were all implacable.
You killed, pillaged, burned.

147
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,241
Then you turned blindly on each other
like maniacs.

148
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,876
Now you blame our love
for this disaster.

149
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,420
And I am to destroy this love
which cost us so much to preserve?

150
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,719
I will not.

151
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,694
It is not what you want that matters.

152
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,264
I cannot.

153
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,534
Neither is it this happiness you seek
that matters.

154
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,863
Is it happiness that devours my soul?

155
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,508
Who am I not to throw myself at your feet?

156
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,782
I do not ask to love you.
Is it my fault I cannot live without you?

157
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,485
That I need you?

158
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,986
I do not live for Arthur.

159
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,820
Just say,
"For you, I prefer death to life."

160
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,957
Then I shall consent;
all becomes easy.

161
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,828
That is impossible.

162
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,527
Happy is he who knows
why he sacrifices himself.

163
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,603
But you know.

164
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:48,671
God cannot separate us.
If I surrender, it is to you alone.

165
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,109
You do not want that?

166
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,956
What must I say?

167
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,523
The "yes" that I see on your lips.

168
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,272
If you see it, it is there.
You can do with me as you wish.

169
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,945
- What are you looking at?
- The moon.

170
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,454
Carmaduc says the little cloud
drowns the moon.

171
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,685
I say it strangles it.

172
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,994
Meaning?

173
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,628
We'll stifle here
if we do not strike free.

174
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,302
The cloud is retreating.

175
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,847
Is it your watch?

176
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,687
Let me go the rounds with you.

177
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,227
I prefer to go alone.

178
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,022
Mordred, let's make peace.

179
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,891
Arthur sent you?

180
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,434
I came of my own accord.

181
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,267
You honor me.

182
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,965
I think things are best left
as they are.

183
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,769
What do you want?

184
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,243
Your friendship in exchange for mine.

185
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,108
We both serve the same king.

186
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,118
He takes your advice, not mine.

187
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:13,757
We are equal. Our table is round,
so there is no precedence.

188
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,025
A woman's scarf?

189
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,194
You recognize it?

190
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,599
Not if you conceal it from me.

191
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:34,904
Mordred, if I give you my right hand,
will you refuse it?

192
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,475
What insolence! He dared!

193
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,577
For much lesser affronts, you've drawn
your sword and struck at the heart.

194
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,452
So I went to him unarmed.

195
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,424
He could be struck.

196
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,426
No, self-control is a strength.

197
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,994
Easily taken as weakness.

198
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,563
He'll say you backed down,
as though guilty.

199
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,869
Guilty of what?

200
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,941
I don't know.
But they're all going over to his side.

201
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,604
Who?

202
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:44,909
My brother Agravain, Lucan, and others.
You are perplexing us.

203
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,250
Take this harness.

204
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,394
- It's your favorite.
- That's why I give it to you.

205
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:31,061
Lord, do not forsake us.
Do not forsake me.

206
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,195
I struggle against a death
worse than death.

207
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,366
Deliver me from a temptation
I can hardly resist.

208
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,487
Their swords are on the right;
they're from Gallesfort or Escalot.

209
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,893
From Escalot.

210
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,473
- What do they want?
- To see if we're still breathing.

211
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,365
Did I do right?

212
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,842
If you refused, it would be said
that we are weak and cowardly.

213
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:00,915
A tournament is not war,
and we know who will be the victor.

214
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,679
My faithful Lancelot.

215
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,382
We have a fortnight to prepare.

216
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:50,525
Has an angel descended
or a tongue of fire licked our heads?

217
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:56,435
It is only a simple tournament,
but look how happy they are.

218
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,723
And he twitches his ears.
Our luck is changing.

219
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,269
Not only Agravain and Mordred
gaze at that window.

220
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,497
I too.

221
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,172
Guinevere is our one woman, our sun.

222
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,578
Let us try our lances.

223
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,477
Against each other?

224
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,013
What of our promise to Arthur?

225
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,155
- There is no risk.
- What if you skewer me?

226
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,054
Or I skewer you?

227
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,978
Why ask me to come here?

228
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:24,661
I know all is ended between us
and that this must be.

229
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,123
It must.

230
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:31,001
I wanted to see you once more
and then part.

231
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,243
I left my scarf here.

232
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,110
I'm sure of it.

233
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,919
Someone has been here.

234
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,508
What have we done?

235
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,312
Guinevere, my heart.

236
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,087
Take this heart, this soul;
they belong to you.

237
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,281
It is your body I want.

238
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,384
Take this proscribed body.

239
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,096
Take it; revive it.

240
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,555
I am afraid.

241
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,794
I fear no one in the world.

242
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,688
I fear what awaits us.

243
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,957
Aren't you safe in my arms?

244
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,530
I won't always have them
to protect me.

245
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,860
Always.

246
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:54,304
Poor Lancelot, trying to stand his ground
in a shrinking world.

247
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,910
Where you are, Guinevere,
the world is vast, limitless.

248
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,745
Hold me. I am no ghost.

249
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,336
Don't undress me.

250
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,837
Wait till tomorrow.
Don't go to the tournament.

251
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,343
When they've gone, come to my room.

252
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,035
Even without entering the list,
he'll take all the honors.

253
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,703
He never claims
other people's victories.

254
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:00,539
He has mettle and courage,
but perhaps less than is supposed.

255
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,300
Wait here.

256
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:01,838
When his hand touches the latch,
do not hesitate. Strike!

257
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,783
Suspecting nothing, he won't be armed.

258
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,219
And if he is?

259
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,300
Surprise; he'll have no time.

260
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:35,437
His blood on the floor here
will unmask the adulterous traitor.

261
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:56,891
Fools will never understand his sort.
Luckily, he doesn't care.

262
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,592
He won't be carefree forever.

263
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,061
The hypocrite.

264
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,467
What do you mean, brother?
If Lancelot were here, you'd keep quiet.

265
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,241
You'd cringe like a dog. Beware.

266
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,467
Of you?

267
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,142
Of this blade that could run you through.

268
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,049
You're not going to fight.

269
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,746
Don't worry.
I'm not coming to the tournament.

270
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,354
I knew it.

271
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,060
Mordred, you read my thoughts.

272
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,523
Friendship works such wonders.

273
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,167
But I long to know your thoughts.

274
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,599
You will surely know them.

275
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,369
Good luck.

276
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:58,547
Lionel and I were defending you;
now I look ridiculous.

277
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,388
Teach them a lesson at the tournament.

278
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:07,154
They yelp about you
and besmirch your honor.

279
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,892
Your friends appear in the wrong

280
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,901
and those blustering cowards
in the right.

281
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,662
I'll silence them when the time comes.

282
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,333
The time has come.

283
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,475
Fetch a suit of white armor
and a plain shield.

284
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:11,246
Saddle the bay and prepare two lances.
I'm going.

285
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,747
- At night, alone?
- Get a move on, fool.

286
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,951
And hold your tongue.

287
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,966
Forgive me, my love. I must.
I shall not be long.

288
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:40,075
I shall return tomorrow,
and we shall be together all night.

289
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,146
Why isn't he with us?

290
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,791
Love, sire. Lancelot loves.

291
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,397
Whom?

292
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,560
The queen.

293
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,564
He is her knight.

294
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:41,965
He is more.

295
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,473
A monstrous lie.

296
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,106
It is the truth.

297
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:51,075
You're giving vent to jealousy.
He who accuses idly shall be punished.

298
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,713
I swear it.

299
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,713
That does not prove it.

300
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,216
I swear it is false.

301
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,854
What proof have you?

302
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,817
My word is enough.

303
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,424
Mordred, I order you to be silent.

304
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,688
Gawain, the conditions
of the tournament?

305
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,993
Choice of adversaries.
Sharpened points, weakened lances.

306
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,366
It was his horse.

307
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,764
More than one bay
has a white star on its brow.

308
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,409
Only one lance is a thunderbolt.

309
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,576
Only one knight charges
with his guard down.

310
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:44,411
Mordred, admit that everything refutes you:
Hold your peace.

311
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,959
At other times, too, he's opposed us
with visor lowered.

312
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,465
He can't do anything like anyone else.

313
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,862
He wanted to teach you a lesson.

314
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,006
Was it him?

315
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,672
My glancing blow
left the point in his waist.

316
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,544
He was the victor.

317
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,448
He's wounded?

318
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,229
Lionel thinks so, but he's not sure.

319
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,953
What are you sure of?

320
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,900
Did you see his face?
Did he speak?

321
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,055
You are keeping something from me.

322
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,325
Only gossip and lies.

323
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,608
Do you understand Lancelot?

324
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:27,948
He had to put a stop to things.
For Lancelot, to decide is to strike.

325
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:33,384
You are all wrong.
It wasn't him at the tournament.

326
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,549
Lancelot has left here forever.

327
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,057
He has fled far away.

328
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,491
Lionel, where are you going?

329
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,686
To challenge Mordred.
My sword will prove he lied.

330
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:15,627
Only Lancelot's sword can prove that.

331
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,561
Anyway, he won't fight.

332
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,492
You can't chop his head off
like a chicken's.

333
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,499
What's to stop me?

334
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,855
This is Lancelot's doing.

335
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,188
Carmaduc and Bohort
are going to look for him.

336
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:46,159
Why doesn't Arthur act?
"He who accuses idly shall be punished."

337
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:49,561
Some force is manipulating us.
Arthur cannot govern it.

338
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,197
Find him quickly.

339
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,240
- News of Lancelot?
- No, but the forest is a devil.

340
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:40,927
An omen?

341
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,136
God keep his soul.

342
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,657
So Lancelot is dead?

343
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,089
The queen must choose a new knight.

344
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,257
Without delay.

345
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,864
If I could corner him...

346
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,412
The king is checked.

347
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,411
By the queen and a castle?

348
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,288
And this knight?

349
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,124
Gone. Flown. Dead.

350
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,658
You cheat, Mordred.

351
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,028
Not as you think.

352
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,904
Explain the move
with a queen and a castle.

353
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,296
Can't you guess?

354
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,505
Stay where you are.

355
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,275
Keep out of reach of my sword.

356
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,636
Gawain, go away.

357
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,733
Don't stay here.

358
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,540
Are you giving orders?

359
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:10,381
On bended knee, I beg you listen.
You are being watched.

360
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,522
Here is your scarf,
which I found in Mordred's quarters.

361
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:19,023
He says you return because criminals return
to the scene of their crime.

362
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,122
What crime?

363
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:26,702
A crime that is punished horribly.

364
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,832
Gawain, once again, I tell you to go.

365
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,376
If you could do anything...

366
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,268
I'll dare all.

367
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:42,381
He who must save me will come here.
No one else can make me leave.

368
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,243
Except by force.

369
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:51,658
I wait for him here, alone with my pain,
as I always have done.

370
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,590
Here I can be with him.
I talk to him, and he hears me.

371
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,597
My crime is that for one instant,
I doubted him.

372
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:06,040
A wound, some mystery
is keeping him from me.

373
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,536
But he lives. I know it; I feel it.
He has not abandoned me.

374
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:17,979
Now go. Tell them that I love him
and that I am wholly his.

375
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,445
Tell Arthur.

376
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,616
What are you waiting for?

377
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,796
I would give my life to save yours,

378
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,337
but I fear it is too little
to tip the balance.

379
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,850
Uncle, do not go in.
Do not judge her.

380
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,556
If you still cherish her
above all else...

381
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,934
Do you doubt it?

382
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,238
Go quickly.

383
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,465
If there's a chance...

384
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,831
What are we doing?
His rage will be terrible.

385
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,902
We have no choice.

386
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,097
We seek a knight.
He may be wounded.

387
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,211
Nothing to say?

388
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:24,912
Nothing.

389
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,345
Not so tight.

390
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,537
Where were you?

391
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,883
Did you meet someone?

392
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,593
You should be dead.

393
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,462
But I am alive, and I am going.

394
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,028
In your condition?

395
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,503
What is it?

396
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,740
You are stupid,
and you'll never understand anything.

397
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:37,648
Someone keeps calling me;
I must go.

398
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:48,830
Go, then, and be killed.

399
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,730
I go to live.

400
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,680
Lancelot, help!

401
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:48,682
I have come to rescue you, Guinevere.

402
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,762
Don't touch me.
I forbid you to come nearer.

403
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,438
You are covered in blood.

404
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,217
We must go. They're waiting.

405
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,801
Nothing to be seen; not a sound.

406
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,066
That means they are there.

407
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,873
Do you know who you killed
to rescue the queen?

408
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,279
Two shadows.
It happened so quickly.

409
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,385
Agravain, Gawain's brother.

410
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:28,815
The other was Lucan.
He didn't deserve to live.

411
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,356
And Mordred?

412
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,588
We can wager that his sword
is still virgin.

413
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:38,133
- Is the drawbridge up?
- Yes, and these ruins are sound.

414
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,768
- Food, water, fodder?
- Enough for a ten-year siege.

415
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:46,102
Siege? Lionel, Bohort,
we are doing the attacking.

416
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,754
Where is Gawain?

417
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,318
Gawain killed by Lancelot?
God would not allow it.

418
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:58,838
My poor Gawain.

419
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,156
He is the victim of a murderer.

420
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:13,454
A traitor.

421
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,667
No, Gawain?

422
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:27,768
It was my fault.
Don't blame Lancelot.

423
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,338
I charged at him.

424
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,650
He parried and thrust
without recognizing me.

425
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:46,218
You must tell him it was my duty
to avenge Agravain.

426
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:51,933
For all else, my heart is with him.

427
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,865
We'll avenge you.

428
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:59,574
We'll avenge you and your brother.

429
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,808
Sire, I wanted...

430
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,674
What did you want?

431
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,980
You and I both wanted to save the queen.

432
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,253
Yes, I wanted to save her.

433
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,362
What we could not do,
Lancelot has done.

434
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,168
Uncle, listen to me this once.

435
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:32,005
All will die.
Listen to my counsel.

436
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,903
I am listening.

437
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,490
Gawain is dead.

438
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:02,397
Arthur offers...

439
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:06,065
He can offer nothing.
Lancelot had him under his horse's hooves.

440
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:09,769
Aiglin cried, "Kill him! End it!"
But Lancelot spared Arthur.

441
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:13,110
Arthur offers to take back the queen,

442
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,513
but Lancelot must leave.

443
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,212
Arthur judges her innocent of adultery;
there is no proof.

444
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,321
He swears respect and loyalty

445
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,792
to save further bloodshed.

446
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,925
Too late; we refuse.

447
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:20,674
This is our last night.
Let us accept; time is running out.

448
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,879
I won't capitulate.

449
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,347
We must atone for so much bloodshed.

450
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,014
We can't restore the dead to life.

451
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,053
It was my duty to defend you.

452
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,994
Your duty now
is to return me to Arthur.

453
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,565
I shall not give you up to him.

454
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:45,005
I delighted in deceiving him.
I despise him and loathe him.

455
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,532
I'll rid you of Arthur.

456
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,111
You didn't kill him yesterday.

457
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:52,670
If I only had, without a thought.

458
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,849
He would have killed you.

459
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,547
I'll send word I want to make peace.

460
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,948
He won't listen.
Right is on his side.

461
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,217
Right is not justice.

462
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,425
Forget justice.

463
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,954
Stay with me.

464
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,428
It is no longer possible.

465
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,671
I crave the impossible.

466
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:23,406
You have nothing more to ask of me;
I have nothing more to give you.

467
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,904
What I could do, I have done.

468
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:32,045
I loved you more
than anyone has ever loved.

469
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,890
You lie.
You will never cease to love me.

470
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,116
I shall suffer instead.

471
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,351
You choose suffering?

472
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,590
I have chosen nothing.

473
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,467
If I could see into your heart.

474
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,669
You see it.
It bleeds; it is torn.

475
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:54,099
How could I leave you?
Perhaps God demands it.

476
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,033
He demands nothing.

477
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:00,807
The woman made for me
was not made for me?

478
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,439
Truth is falsehood?

479
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:07,554
Leave this woman while there is still time,
of your own free will.

480
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,758
If I leave you, what remains for me?

481
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:16,196
Our faith in each other,
our promise to each other.

482
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,390
I cannot be but where you are.

483
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,959
Even if I am a burden?

484
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,171
Let me go.

485
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:29,003
For the first time,
you bid me farewell.

486
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,207
For the last time too.

487
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:40,550
No, you are in my hands.
I'll not let you escape me.

488
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,389
It is nearly time.

489
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:14,915
I must hold on to you.

490
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,687
I shall walk
looking neither right nor left.

491
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,085
What is the matter?

492
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:06,191
Carmaduc has come to tell us:
Mordred stayed behind at the castle.

493
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:10,701
He has mustered support
and intends to challenge Arthur's rule.

494
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,098
What say you?

495
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:18,078
You, Lionel, ask that? To horse!
For Arthur, against Mordred!
