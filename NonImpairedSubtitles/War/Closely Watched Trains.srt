1
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,621
My name is Milos Hrma.
They often laughed at my name.

2
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,054
But otherwise,
we were a happy family.

3
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,751
Our great-grandfather Lukas
as a tambour

4
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,261
fought on the Charles Bridge
of Prague

5
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,230
and when the students threw
cobblestones at the soldiers

6
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,063
they hit great-grandfather
with such aim

7
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,502
that he was getting a pension
ever since. One gulden per day.

8
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,876
He didn't do anything after that,
except buy a bottle of rum

9
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,801
and a pack of tobacco
every day.

10
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,707
Such luck, Milos, imagine
you've got a uniform.

11
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,581
Once again, somebody in
the family that made good.

12
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,588
My grandfather William was
a hypnotist

13
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,193
and the whole town believed
his hypnotism was prompted

14
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,659
by a desire to go through life
without any effort.

15
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:43,634
You must be careful not to have
the trains crash.

16
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,168
The whole town would envy us.

17
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,041
My father, an engine driver,
has been retired

18
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,738
since the age of forty eight
and people are mad with envy

19
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,109
since dad is healthy
and will draw his pension

20
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,081
for twenty,
maybe thirty years...

21
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,118
without doing a thing.

22
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,007
When you come to the platform
for the first time

23
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:30,878
everybody will realize
what a famous family we are.

24
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,543
Gee, you look nice, Milos.

25
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,896
Great-grandfather Lukas
bought a bottle of rum

26
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,605
and two packs of tobacco
every day.

27
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,335
Instead of staying home
he went to see the workers

28
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,206
and made fun
of the hard-working men.

29
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,246
So every year grandpa Lukas
would get beaten somewhere.

30
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,519
And in 1930 great-grandfather
boasted in front of stone cutters

31
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,087
whose quarry had just
been closed

32
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,225
and they beat him
so badly he died.

33
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,918
And when the Germans crossed
the frontiers in March

34
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,792
and proceeded towards Prague,

35
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,662
grandfather William decided
to face the Germans on his own

36
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,803
with hypnosis and stop
the advancing tanks

37
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,768
by the force of his thoughts.

38
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,567
With outstretched hands and eyes
glued to the Germans,

39
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,438
he tried to get them
to turn around and go back.

40
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:09,412
Actually the first tank stopped
and the entire army stopped,

41
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,072
but then the tank started
forward again

42
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,479
and grandfather wouldn't move -

43
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,620
so the tank went right over him,
cutting off his head

44
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,756
and nothing more stood in the way
of the Reich's army.

45
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,758
SHOEMAKER

46
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,401
And I went through
a preparation course

47
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,093
and I'm going to be
a train-dispatcher

48
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,138
and the entire town knows I want
to be a train-dispatcher

49
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,605
for the simple reason that
I don't want to do anything

50
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,472
just like my ancestors except
to stand on the platform

51
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,238
with a signal disc and avoid
any hard work,

52
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,406
while others have to drudge
and toil.

53
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:49,612
BASED ON THE NOVEL
BY BOHUMIL HRABAL

54
00:04:53,092 --> 00:05:00,191
CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS

55
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:04,284
My little loves, my babies.
My little dears...

56
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,120
My May children,
here this is for you.

57
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,853
My winged kiddies,
take a grain,

58
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,157
This is from the Countess,
does it taste nice?

59
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,200
Eat up my little ones.
You like it?

60
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:24,272
Here have some more, go ahead.
There... there...

61
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,604
Apprentice Hrma Milos
reporting to work.

62
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,438
Welcome Milos. At ease.

63
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:33,880
Your Dad was the best engine
driver in the district.

64
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,811
He once threw out the stoker
while the train was in motion.

65
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,356
There my little chicks.
Come here, pigeons fly.

66
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:44,656
Take a grain, here boys.

67
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,065
What a station, son,
that's a farm in itself.

68
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,108
Double gates that open and close.
Otherwise, we are closed.

69
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,877
We have arrivals and departures.
Otherwise we are closed.

70
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,843
So, why do you have it
half open?

71
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:03,170
Mr. Novak, I thought
you would settle it.

72
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,384
That clock has such
a beautiful sound.

73
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,505
Hiya Milos.

74
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,710
Hiya Masa.

75
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,910
You look sharp.

76
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,946
You look nice too, Masa.

77
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,125
Quite a girl.

78
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,334
What sort of girl is she?

79
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,664
A nice one.

80
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:03,785
Nice, nice, they all are,
but what else?

81
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,317
Countess, the station-master
at your service.

82
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,388
I need two freight cars to take
the cattle to the slaughterhouse,

83
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,786
we are getting short on fodder so
I'll have to sell a few heifers.

84
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,519
The moral in our district
is getting worse and worse.

85
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,297
In Kostelni Lhota the church has
to be consecrated all over again.

86
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,326
Fornication behind the altar.

87
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,803
What a woman,
look at those legs.

88
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,577
She's more like a dream
than a real woman.

89
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:06,014
If she bent over me, the
whole world would become dim.

90
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,587
One car, but with good rings.
I must sell some bulls too.

91
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,351
- You're not afraid of horses?
- Me, afraid of horses, Countess?

92
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,464
I used to serve under Count
Chotek and Prince Silva el Tores.

93
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,526
Bon. Next time when you come up
to the castle,

94
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,568
I'll send you this stallion
instead of the carriage.

95
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,953
Milos, I had the most
wonderful dream.

96
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,854
Woman, that's nature's jewel.

97
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,685
Now all the Countess ever sends
is two cases of beer

98
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,126
and a bottle of liquor...

99
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,167
I dreamt that I turned into
a carriage and the Countess

100
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:03,138
held me by the shaft-bar and
guided me to the store-room.

101
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,176
You should have all this
before the war,

102
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,472
when the lord master himself
went somewhere.

103
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,475
The station-master had
the carpet unfurled

104
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,244
from the carriage
to the platform,

105
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,321
all the pensioners came in
their uniforms.

106
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:22,119
Everybody saluted and in
the afternoon a whole carriage

107
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,991
full of liquor, beer,
wine and food

108
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,225
was sent down from the castle.

109
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,460
And what about your girlfriend,
tell us.

110
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,495
How's it going?

111
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,944
That clock has
a beautiful sound.

112
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,484
It's a bit tight here.

113
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,054
A railroad inspector
like you'll be,

114
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,526
is like a major in the army
during the Austrian monarchy.

115
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,996
Exactly. But don't forget
the shoulders.

116
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,134
One of my shoulders is shorter.

117
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:43,570
The golden ornaments, the star
and sequins with the gold braid

118
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,472
must be sewn on with
gold thread.

119
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,776
Come in.

120
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,243
Sir, what about the
Countess' cattle,

121
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,817
are we going to load it
on track five?

122
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:59,891
On five, but first of all
the cattle for the Countess,

123
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,420
secondly polish your shoes

124
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,253
and finally don't talk with
the conductor on the platform.

125
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,698
You must consider your position,
man, you'll be a train-dispatcher

126
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,897
Don't take after Hubicka,

127
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,702
he won't get
a promotion for ten years.

128
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:24,281
Why? Those women of his.
Better take your example from me.

129
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,157
Good morning, friends.

130
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,836
The situation of our armies
fighting for the welfare

131
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,742
of all the nations of Europe,
whether willing or unwilling,

132
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,315
is favorable.

133
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,284
We were forced to
withdraw here somewhat,

134
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:10,190
but here our armies tactically
withdrew from the Baltic area.

135
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,496
Here's a beautiful tactical
withdrawal from the Dniepr

136
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,566
to the Danube,

137
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:20,269
here we have tactically
withdrawn from the Americans

138
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,675
as far as Belgium. And here
this masterful stroke in Italy?

139
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,038
But why?

140
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,615
Precisely, why? Because the
enemies are crawling into a trap,

141
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,863
can't you see it?
Look carefully.

142
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,025
Here we'll disembark
to the back lines of the enemy.

143
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,496
Here for the Russians in the
Caucasus from Turkey

144
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,971
and to Petrograd from Sweden,

145
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,435
here we'll avoid the enemy
and disembark from Sicily

146
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:04,412
and here in the back lines
of the Americans in France.

147
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:12,817
And here they are trapped and
we'll chase them from two sides.

148
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,549
Why?

149
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,090
So that everyone can live
happily, that's why I came.

150
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,626
Here, sign this proclamation
stating that you understand

151
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,262
if one neglects his duties
at the station he'll be in for it

152
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:38,748
for at least ten years, also
for life or the death penalty.

153
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,548
That's all there is to it,
only a few Czech chauvinists

154
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:48,318
think that they can turn back
the course of history,

155
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,588
but the Fuhrer means well,
even with the good Czechs

156
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:57,463
and believes in providence which
will not abandon us...

157
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,063
Where is...
Where is the station stamp?

158
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:18,021
Special attention must be devoted
to carefully watching the trains.

159
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,418
Yes? There.

160
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,459
Maybe I should get dressed,
this way...

161
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,900
No, no, no, no, no, when
fighting for final victory

162
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,471
clothes are not important.

163
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,906
Let us leave fashion for
peace time.

164
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:39,907
Why?

165
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,146
Stop asking such silly questions.

166
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,977
Why shouldn't he ask,
he's young.

167
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,519
Why? To save humanity.

168
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,745
Why?

169
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,688
Because that's what
the Fuhrer wants.

170
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,363
But we must like each other,

171
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,264
because we are all
in the same boat.

172
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,539
Is that clear?

173
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,444
So long friends.

174
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:28,350
Cousin, train
dispatcher's cousin,

175
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,717
what beautiful little
ears you have.

176
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,495
All they need are nice earrings.

177
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,634
Really?

178
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,517
Why don't you
do something about it?

179
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,650
Do you know any other anecdotes?

180
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,665
Max, dinner.

181
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,497
One butcher used to carry udders
out of the slaughter house

182
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,706
and since they usually had
an inspection at the gate

183
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,003
he carried it in his pants.

184
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,181
In his fly? You're killing me.

185
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,676
Yes and he took
the streetcar.

186
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,048
A lady sitting next to him
looks at him and says

187
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,524
Mister, something is showing...

188
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:48,999
the man then takes a knife,
cuts off the udder and says,

189
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:53,069
never mind I've got three more.

190
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,334
And what did the lady do?

191
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,040
She fainted.

192
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,111
Mr. Station-master, this joke
sounds different now.

193
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,448
Everything is alright,
the butcher managed

194
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:13,854
to carry out the udder,
takes the tram, sits down,

195
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,653
the lady also points out
that something is showing...

196
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,295
and the butcher takes a knife...

197
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:18,952
cuts...

198
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,996
the lady turns pale...

199
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,904
Well, not so much the lady
as the butcher, who screams,

200
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,405
Christ, that was the real one.

201
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,149
Mr. Station-master this is really
a score for my cousin.

202
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,511
No, no, this really happened.

203
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,480
- Have a drink.
- Thanks.

204
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,485
A necklace would look real nice
on this beautiful neck.

205
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:54,393
Hurry, Max, your food will
get cold.

206
00:23:55,167 --> 00:24:01,003
Coming. Or a little cross.

207
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,240
Max...

208
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,006
I'm coming.

209
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,984
Max, if you don't come this
very minute,

210
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,787
I'm not going to warm your food.

211
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,573
I have to go down.

212
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:53,047
I have to work
on a report for the management.

213
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,885
This is for a sweater for Countess.

214
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,899
Who is that laughing out there?

215
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,027
The dispatcher's cousin.

216
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,967
Such terrible
morals these days.

217
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,972
The Countess told me in secret
that they will have to consecrate

218
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,706
the church in Kosteln Lhtota
all over again.

219
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,586
But that's what you get when
there is no power over people.

220
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,962
Mr. Dispatcher...

221
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,079
I don't know
how to tell you.

222
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,215
But did you always get along
so well with women

223
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,288
the way you do now
with the cousin?

224
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,085
Oh God no, I was no good
with women at all.

225
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,167
How long is it going to take?

226
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,831
Two hours.

227
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,980
Nothing is sacred to this guy.

228
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,056
Terrible downfall.

229
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,689
Was the soup too salty?

230
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:43,297
No. But today the church stands
on clay feet...

231
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:49,439
I could fry the rabbit,
what do you think?

232
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,575
I'd be better if God called
everyone to the Last Judgment

233
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:59,146
and put an end to everything.
Armageddon.

234
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,217
Armageddon.

235
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,081
Sodom and Gomorrah -
what morals.

236
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,541
Milos, we can relax now,
only a few freight trains

237
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,172
in both directions.
Just like streetcars.

238
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,008
Take over and serve me well.

239
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,887
My ears will be with you.

240
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,365
The curse of an erotic century.
Armageddon.

241
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,369
Condemn the authors of
pornography.

242
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:31,035
Away with the monstrosity
of young people's imagination.

243
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,373
I can hear you Milos,
you're doing well,

244
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,103
but you forgot the telegraph.

245
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,392
Remember next time.

246
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,915
Hi Milos.

247
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,418
Hello.

248
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,623
I'm on my way from work,
so I stopped to see you.

249
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,250
Yes.

250
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,473
Well, I'll be on my way.

251
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,147
Masa.

252
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,322
I have to go now.

253
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,775
They tore the sofa.

254
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:39,090
My official Austrian sofa.
In two parts.

255
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:44,430
That disgusting guy sees nothing
but nasty things. Bleh.

256
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,367
At least if he'd show
his low nature.

257
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,441
Whatever he does with those
bitches in the hall,

258
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,205
he can't do it on his
boss's sofa!

259
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,141
I'll show you
how wonderful she was.

260
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,057
Good morning boys.
Everything alright?

261
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,852
Station the way it should be?

262
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,722
Fun, fun, that's all very well,

263
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,596
but duty comes first,
do you understand?

264
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:06,514
Fun, fun, so what?
What about your girl?

265
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,783
She's nice.

266
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:16,049
Wait, that's not everything.

267
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,229
How is she in bed?

268
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,428
This carriage with the nurses
will have to stay.

269
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,971
The depot does not have
an engine.

270
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:08,635
Nurses. Merciful bitches
that's what they are.

271
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,749
Terrible the way the Germans
carry cattle.

272
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:17,252
Half of it is dead.

273
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:23,359
I saw one cow with a dead calf
hanging from its rear,

274
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,290
already rotting.

275
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,897
The Germans are pigs.

276
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,566
The cattle feels it.

277
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,731
Once we loaded a bull on
the train, he put up some fight.

278
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,738
I thought he was going to break
the sides off,

279
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,742
so I took a knife
and cut his eyes out.

280
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,408
The bull was quiet
as a lamb.

281
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:21,408
Last time they carried three
carloads of nearly dead sheep.

282
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,553
They were so hungry, they
chewed each other's fur.

283
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:25,984
The Germans are pigs.

284
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,305
Is this place Milovice?

285
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,237
No, no, this is Kostomlat.

286
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,468
Is it far to Milovice?

287
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,274
- Five kilometers.
- How do I get there?

288
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,748
- Straight on.
- Thanks. Let's go.

289
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:09,879
Milos,

290
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,690
let's go and see
my uncle. I'm off.

291
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,091
Sure, Masa, but I'm not off
until this evening.

292
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,933
That doesn't matter, we'll go in
the evening and stay the night.

293
00:38:55,066 --> 00:39:00,094
Get closer to each other and
give her a nice kiss, there.

294
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:04,000
That was a beautiful kiss,
and now smile,

295
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:08,041
Iook over here, that's right.
Smile, one second, there,

296
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:13,341
wave and that's all. Thank you.
Next please.

297
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,413
Next please.

298
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,123
Put your foot this way
a little bit.

299
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,227
That's nice,
straighten your back.

300
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,362
That's it. Yes, that's it.

301
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,695
Smile please. There.
Watch that tail, it is fragile.

302
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:40,536
That's fine, smile please. Yes.
Smile and stick out your chest.

303
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:45,407
That's it. Thank you. Fine.
Let's go then.

304
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,315
Next one please, there, watch it
over the steps,

305
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,415
don't break a leg.

306
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,823
Go in, I'll arrange it,
all the way to the end please,

307
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,867
watch your head, that's good.

308
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,631
Your hair a bit this way,
put the bag away

309
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,038
and your pretty teeth,
your teeth.

310
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,734
Yes, that's nice.

311
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,180
Now we can focus.

312
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:22,513
Quiet, please.
Don't move.

313
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,412
The one in green should smile
a bit, yes miss,

314
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,920
- would you be so kind...
- Uncle.

315
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,949
Milos, come along.

316
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,730
The one in purple a bit to
the right, that's it, yes.

317
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:37,024
That's all then. Thank you.

318
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,486
Now I know why mother didn't
want you to be a photographer.

319
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,450
Uncle is crude but kind.

320
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,140
What if he comes in?

321
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,273
Wait, they can hear
everything here.

322
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,808
So what?

323
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,055
Where is the girl?

324
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,553
What for?

325
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,190
For God's sake-you really
don't have a girl with you?

326
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,130
No.

327
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,099
And do you want one?

328
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,129
No.

329
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,010
You've got to be gone
in an hour.

330
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,049
Oh my god!

331
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:28,501
You'll get me really mad and
I'll spank you.

332
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:46,188
Eleven, twelve...

333
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,174
I told you I'd spank you.

334
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,998
For christsakes...

335
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:20,002
So you see doctor, I am not
a real man

336
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,770
and I don't even want to be one.

337
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:26,139
Everything is so difficult
in life, for me.

338
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,046
While for others it's
all child's play.

339
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:36,788
In other words, when I was
to act, I flopped.

340
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:42,529
You are healthy as can be,
maybe too healthy.

341
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,496
When a young person
is too healthy

342
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:50,037
he can suffer from
premature ejaculation.

343
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:57,869
That has happened to me too,
you're just overly sensitive.

344
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:06,047
You need to realize that
this is natural, normal

345
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:11,617
and that it has to be faced
as such.

346
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,727
Morning, Inspector, look how
she came home from work.

347
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:21,030
Look, show him your behind.
Write a protocol.

348
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:26,640
Look what this Hubicka
did to her

349
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,246
and on duty too.
Look what he did to her.

350
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,744
This, can you imagine,

351
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:35,578
I could hit that stupid girl
for letting him do it.

352
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:41,387
You must write a protocol.
I won't let it go. Look!

353
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,858
This color is produced by
the Pelikan Company

354
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,094
and won't wash off for a week.

355
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,830
Mother, this will go to
to the district court.

356
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:05,304
Don't think about it too much,
think of something else, Milos.

357
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:11,110
Football for instance,
think of football and then

358
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:18,552
choose an older, experienced
woman to initiate love making.

359
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:23,327
And I took her under the neck,
pressed a bit

360
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:30,039
and no sound out of her after
that. I didn't want to kill her,

361
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:34,700
I don't usually steal geese.
And then the neighbor came.

362
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,641
Come here. Look here, Sir,

363
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,117
how the girl looked when
she came home from work.

364
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,886
She is a telegraphist
at the station,

365
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,584
where Milos Hrma cut his veins.
And this is how she came home.

366
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:56,221
Her behind full of rubber stamp
imprints, look at it,

367
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,796
nice isn't it?

368
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,494
I've never seen
anything like it.

369
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:11,744
Is that some sort of new game,
Miss?

370
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,679
- Was it a new social game?
- Yes.

371
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:18,186
He deserves to be locked up.

372
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:23,858
Say, that's no issue for court.

373
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:29,363
You can go and complain
to the railroad management.

374
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:34,533
That's a case for the
disciplinary commission.

375
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,433
Good God, look at that -

376
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:41,703
if that isn't a clear cut
criminal case...

377
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,270
Look at him.

378
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,781
How do you do, I'm Milos Hrma
from the station.

379
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,518
Out!

380
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:15,170
Hookie player Milos Hrma from
Kostomlaty station... reporting.

381
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,779
Yes, yes young man...

382
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,940
Sorry
for having shouted

383
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:26,384
but you should know how
to report. What is it?

384
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,650
Premature ejaculation
is what doctor Brabec said.

385
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:40,435
Nice schweinerei.
But dear Hrma, look here,

386
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:44,373
young people hardly cut of
the Hitlerjugend are fighting

387
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,374
for a new Europe,
for a better future

388
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,743
and what is your family doing
for Europe?

389
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:58,845
Your father has been lying on
a sofa for a number of years

390
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,717
although he could have gone on
serving the Reich,

391
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:07,287
your grandfather hypnotized
our tanks, liberating Prague.

392
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,900
The youth of Germany is shedding
blood on the battlegrounds

393
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,230
and hookie player Milos Hrma
sheds it

394
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,737
in the bathtub of a bordello.

395
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:23,572
But I'll show you. Do you realize
that I can charge you

396
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,271
for self mutilation in order
to avoid service

397
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,314
in the defense of the Reich?

398
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,823
It could also be qualified
as sabotage. There.

399
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,286
What should I put in the report
on your case?

400
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,731
With your permission...

401
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,104
But I'm not here to procure
females for such things,

402
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,268
I have other duties.

403
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,879
But I...

404
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,810
Out!

405
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,622
Welcome Milos, welcome.

406
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,463
You've really made our
little station famous. Nice.

407
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:21,262
This is bad business
for your boss.

408
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:29,444
Milos, let me see, what's
happened to you?

409
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:37,016
Let me see.

410
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:47,328
And Doctor Brabec said that
an older woman should teach me

411
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:51,524
at first, so I was wondering
whether you wouldn't know of one?

412
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:56,501
No, I don't Milos, you'll have
to find one yourself.

413
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,139
That's hilarious.
What about your wife?

414
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,470
Oh no, she's all mine.

415
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,079
I didn't mean that.

416
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,218
I was just wondering whether
she'd know of someone.

417
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,251
I know and then it ends
by stamping.

418
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:34,408
And doctor Brabec also said
to find one of ill repute

419
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:38,838
to teach me, you wouldn't know
of one, would you?

420
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,744
Teach what?

421
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:56,254
At certain moments
they are all alike.

422
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,529
But it just has to happen
gradually,

423
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:03,999
you can't ask straight out
that way,

424
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,367
even one of ill repute may
scare away like that.

425
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,107
Don't you have a sister?

426
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,109
Milos...

427
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,243
I know...

428
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:41,304
That's something you two
will never understand...

429
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:47,107
Reverend, consider this
a confession, I wanted...

430
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:57,148
Come to the vicarage, the church
can solve everything.

431
01:04:57,493 --> 01:05:00,656
Everything will be fine,
if you believe in it.

432
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:05,664
The church has mastered
psychoanalysis for 600 years.

433
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,429
Only they will beat the burden.

434
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:14,775
Never mind, I'll consider it
a Christian duty.

435
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:29,116
What are you doing? Painting?
Painting?

436
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,021
Painting, yes, painting.

437
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,922
What are you painting now?

438
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,394
I am painting the sea
from a postcard.

439
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:40,194
I am copying it, but somehow
my rheumatic hand hurts

440
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:47,938
and I can't get the waves in
properly, the sway of the sea.

441
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,638
I'll tell you what sir.

442
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,814
Place the postcard close
to this cover, see?

443
01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:04,885
And then take the brush
and do this over the waves.

444
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:09,896
Over the waves like this
until you get the swing in hand.

445
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,194
Then make them bigger and bigger,
the way you need them

446
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:18,003
and put them right on the cover.

447
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,832
That's perfect.

448
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,503
So what?

449
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:27,912
Last night, partisans threw a
closely watched train in the air

450
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:31,815
so smart-that the train and
the bridge were destroyed.

451
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,954
The main track is blocked and
trains going to the front

452
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:37,115
will pass by here.

453
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:42,855
Tomorrow an ammunition train
will pass by here.

454
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:48,000
You'll get everything in time.
The password is Viktoria Freie.

455
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:52,271
That idea with the sway
of the sea is wonderful.

456
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:07,518
Run, run. The SS train stopped.

457
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:12,388
The partisans took out the rails
and threw them into the forest.

458
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:16,792
Run, run.

459
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,624
Now they are assembling
the track,

460
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,701
they'll be here any minute now.

461
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,464
They sprayed everything at
the station with their bullets.

462
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,540
I must report it, we must cover
ourselves.

463
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,937
This is no laughing matter.

464
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:27,479
Milos, you took over for me.
I'll be grateful until death.

465
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:44,597
Come here.

466
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:49,971
Look Milos.

467
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,482
Tomorrow a freight train will
pass through our station.

468
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,186
So what?

469
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,352
We'll blow up the train.

470
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,350
Sure, but how?

471
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:09,294
Don't worry, we'll get
everything in time.

472
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,993
Do you get it, twenty eight
carloads of ammunition in boxes

473
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:19,040
blowing up behind our station
right into space.

474
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:27,047
Now we'll follow our closely
watched train again.

475
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,049
The best thing would be
to stand on the platform

476
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:37,921
and throw it at the middle car.
But then somebody can see us.

477
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,288
Look.

478
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,781
You'll slow down the train.

479
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,250
Once it comes close
to the signal,

480
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,828
let it come to a stop and
give it the go-ahead signal.

481
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,266
What time is dinner
at the Countess?

482
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:19,731
At eight thirty, sir.

483
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,110
At least I had the chance to
try a horse from the other side.

484
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:18,353
I'm not angry with you, I know
everything. I understand.

485
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:27,793
When will you come
to see us? Tomorrow?

486
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,828
Maybe the day after tomorrow!

487
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,336
The day after tomorrow.

488
01:13:55,097 --> 01:14:00,057
Don't be afraid, madam,
that's me Milos.

489
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,100
What do you want?

490
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,880
Well you see...

491
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,484
Sit down.

492
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,124
Well you see madam, I came
to see you.

493
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:39,003
The day after tomorrow I want
to go see my girl -

494
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,401
the conductor, you know?

495
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:47,307
And she's sure to want -

496
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:51,776
you know what?

497
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,013
No, I don't.

498
01:14:55,657 --> 01:15:00,720
Sure you do, don't pretend
you don't when I know you do.

499
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:06,363
You see I am a man, but whenever
I'm trying to prove

500
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:11,871
that I'm a man
I no longer am.

501
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:17,340
Doctor Brabec said that I suffer
from premature ejaculation.

502
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,011
So I came to you.

503
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,189
But Milos.

504
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:35,822
Well, now for instance
I am a man.

505
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,807
Are you angry with me, madame?

506
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,151
No.

507
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,688
And you won't tell the
station-master? Please? No?

508
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,055
No.

509
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,929
And you aren't angry at me?

510
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:39,054
Look, the Viennese professor
doctor Otto Gruner

511
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:43,459
said that potatoes contain
many harmful substances

512
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:47,762
dangerous to health.

513
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,605
That's interesting.

514
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,710
My name is Viktoria Freie.

515
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:24,000
In the morning, 28 ammunition
carloads will pass the station.

516
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:46,854
Be careful.

517
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,523
Can I take a nap
somewhere?

518
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,586
You wouldn't leave me alone,
would you?

519
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,925
No, I wouldn't,
but I'm on duty.

520
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,892
But I'll go and ask.

521
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,518
Sit down.

522
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,169
I'm Viktoria Freie.

523
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:40,402
A German? What do you do?

524
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:44,602
Circus artist. Before the war
we had a whole program

525
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,749
of air acrobatics. And you?

526
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:51,984
I'm Milos Hrma, I've tried to
commit suicide because

527
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:55,248
apparently I'm suffering from
premature ejaculation,

528
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,517
but that's really not so,
even though all the time

529
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:02,629
I just can't do a thing,
but I'm a real man.

530
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,570
What are you thinking of now?

531
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:22,105
Of football. Doctor Brabec
told me to think of football.

532
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:27,346
Our club is playing an
important league game right now.

533
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:39,866
Shut the light, will you please.

534
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:52,069
So you've never
had a girl before?

535
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,035
Really and truly not?

536
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,356
It came through Podebrady so it
should be here in half an hour.

537
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:30,371
Look, this is how you set it.

538
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:38,803
Are you afraid?

539
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:42,945
No, I've never been so calm
as I am today.

540
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:46,913
I cut myself off from the past
entirely. Just like that.

541
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:53,989
Here you can rest at least.
The sofa's cut in two places,

542
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,828
animals behave better
than that.

543
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:11,037
There my little chicks...

544
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:22,556
It should be here
in seven minutes.

545
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:33,457
- Who's driving the trolley?
- Probably the trackman.

546
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:09,500
The disciplinary commission
is opening its investigation

547
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:12,868
against train dispatcher
Ladislav Hubicka.

548
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,141
Where is the station master?

549
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:18,273
Here.

550
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,587
Station-master reporting.

551
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,082
Good. Enough.

552
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:36,625
I've got a new uniform
in the closet.

553
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:42,067
So you want to become
an inspector?

554
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,363
Yes.

555
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,236
Wouldn't you prefer
breeding geese?

556
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:48,769
No.

557
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:57,040
I should go and change, I've
got a new uniform in the closet.

558
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,747
- You'll take the minutes.
- Yes.

559
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:17,995
Attention. The situation of our
armies fighting for the welfare

560
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:22,974
of all the nations of Europe
is extremely favorable.

561
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:31,017
Holy Zdenka,
is that your behind?

562
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:42,188
Yes.

563
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,504
And who stamped you?

564
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,874
Dispatcher Hubicka.

565
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,343
How did it happen?

566
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:08,813
We were both on night duty.
I read until midnight.

567
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:12,552
There were no trains
so we were bored.

568
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:18,632
Then Mr. Hubicka said we
ought to play games for tokens...

569
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,664
So we played...

570
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,938
Everything flies that
has wings.

571
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:27,465
Raven flies.

572
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,339
Child flies.

573
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,309
Time flies...

574
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:36,275
Train flies...

575
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:38,581
Soldier flies...

576
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,249
Second flies...

577
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,091
Death flies.

578
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,055
Everything flies.

579
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,466
Masa, dear, wait a minute.
I'll be right back.

580
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,350
And I kept losing,

581
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:23,661
first my shoes,
then stockings...

582
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:28,499
then blouse, slip

583
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:31,935
and finally my panties.

584
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:37,538
And who took them off?

585
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:39,612
Mr. Hubicka.

586
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:52,550
And now Zdena listen carefully.

587
01:28:53,494 --> 01:29:00,332
Before the dispatcher put you
on the table, did he use force?

588
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:03,834
Did he threaten you?

589
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:08,906
Not really. I lay down myself.

590
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:13,209
I wanted to wait and see
what would happen.

591
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:20,253
Wait and see what would happen.

592
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,833
He really didn't threaten you?

593
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:40,672
Did use any force? No?

594
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:43,774
No.

595
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:51,512
Well, then, this is no crime
restricting personal freedom,

596
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:56,388
but abuse and disgrace of
the German national language.

597
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,384
The most noble blood
of Europe goes to the front

598
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:33,721
to fight for peace.
Risking their lives, their blood.

599
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:37,055
And your gratitude to the Reich?

600
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,432
One stamping imprints on the
behind of the telegraphist

601
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,300
and the other one cuts his veins
because of some girl.

602
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:29,080
Do you know what Czechs are?
Laughing animals.

603
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:44,728
Max.

604
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:56,501
The inspector's garden
is all shot to hell.
