who are insubordinate and rebellious.

The German soldier no longer has any ideals.

He's not fighting for the culture of the West,

not for one form of government that he wants,

to inform you that

agreed to recommend you

hearing from them very soon, sir.

- An offensive?
- Yes, I should think so, sir.

- Starting when?
- Soon.

216
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:29,481
- What about your platoon?
- Two killed, one missing.

217
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:31,314
Two killed, how?

218
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:37,731
Bullets. Mortar fire. Artillery.
Heavy salvos. Bad luck.

The missing man,
did you look for him, Steiner?

221
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,231
- No, sir.
- Why not?

222
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:53,481
I felt that it would be irresponsible of me
to risk the safety of the entire platoon

223

for the sake of one man.

You felt what?

225
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:10,981
A non-commissioned officer does not permit
a missing man in such a case, in any case!

226
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,689
I'll try to do better next time, sir.

227
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:15,273
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- If you wish.

229
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:28,231
I have a feeling you somewhat
overestimate your importance.

230
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:33,564
At the moment,
I am free of any such illusions, sir.

231
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:40,856
Well, may I suggest to you that you do not
underestimate your present company.

232
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,564
Everything you are and may become
is dependent upon this present company.

233
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:50,314
No, I will not forget that, sir.

234
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:56,148
But I may add that a man is generally
what he feels himself to be.

235
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:05,814
Of course.

236

Stransky will survive this war
one way or another.

Let me ask you a question, Triebig.
Do you like soldiering?

It's an old theory of mine.

Men can get along without women easily,

women are no more than a nuisance.

I think we should make a fresh start together.

667

But the main point is

668
01:02:45,524 --> 01:02:50,148
the regiment feels or believes

669
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,064
that I deserve the Iron Cross now.

670
01:02:54,982 --> 01:02:58,356
And they've asked me to produce
two witnesses to the fact

671
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:02,523
that I led the counterattack and threw
the Russians out of their positions.

I have named Lieutenant Triebig and you.

Especially you.

674
01:03:12,065 --> 01:03:15,856
Lieutenant Triebig
has already submitted his signature.

675
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:31,648
Am I to believe this is a private conversation?

01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,398

679
01:03:51,982 --> 01:03:53,939
Thank you, Sergeant.

680
01:03:57,815 --> 01:04:04,564
But still remember that in civilian
as well as in military life

681
01:04:04,732 --> 01:04:06,898
the distinction is made between people.

682
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:13,731
Is that what you meant when you said,
"All you are and may become

683
01:04:15,024 --> 01:04:18,023
"is dependent upon this present company?"

684
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:22,731
Well, the difference

685
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:27,648
is a matter of ethical

686
01:04:30,232 --> 01:04:34,814
and intellectual superiority which is caused,

687
01:04:34,899 --> 01:04:39,523
whether you like it or not,
by blood and by class difference.

688
01:04:40,315 --> 01:04:45,023
If I remember correctly Kant was
the son of a saddle maker

689
01:04:45,107 --> 01:04:48,689
and Schubert's father
was a poor schoolmaster.

690
01:04:50,399 --> 01:04:55,606
Perhaps talent, sensitivity and character
are no longer privileges

691
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:59,481
of the so-called upper class.

692
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:02,731
But Kant and Schubert were exceptions.

693
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,064
We're talking about general concepts,

694
01:05:07,857 --> 01:05:12,689
- not individuals.
- But I am one and so are you.

695

Didn't your führersay that
all class distinctions were to be abolished?

696

I'm an officer of the Wehrmacht.
I've never been a Party member.

I'm a Prussian aristocrat

into the same category!

Were you present when Captain Stransky
led the counterattack?

I accompanied Captain Stransky to the field

and saw him calling several men around him.

Then how do you know that Captain Stransky
led the counterattack?

You've signed a statement
to that effect, Triebig.

I wasn't there. I learned of it from

Can you give me the name of

We had been under fire, sir.

I want you to know, Triebig,
that I have had your statement checked.

Captain Kiesel will inform you
of the results of our investigation.

Our investigation so far has disclosed

787
01:13:38,857 --> 01:13:45,273
that the men in the second company who
took part in the action declared unanimously

that the action was led by Lieutenant Meyer.

None of them saw Captain Stransky
or Lieutenant Triebig.

To my mind there is nothing
more contemptible

properly belong to a man
