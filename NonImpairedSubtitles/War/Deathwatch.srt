Come on, come on Chevasse

102
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,225
CorporaI

103
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,721
Oh, God. It hurts

104
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,992
Put your hand here

105
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,294
Yes, sir

106
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,392
How is he?

107
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,567
I think he's cut his spine

108
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,473
The chances are that it'II turn gangrenous
and er, I'm aImost out of morphine

109
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,679

Okay, Iisten

118
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,074
We've captured a forward, German trench

119
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,272
It's a rare achievement, gentIemen

120
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,610
It may be vitaI to the war effort

121
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,247
We wiII hoId this trench untiI
we are reinforced. We must...

122
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,355
...that is our duty

123
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,322
Get some scoff on, get a brew going...

124
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,961
See if we can't make the best of it, eh?

125
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,462
Make the best of it?

126
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,865
He makes it sound Iike a bIoody hoIiday

127
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,725
I went to BIackpooI once

128
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,131
Yeah?

129
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,135
Nice?

130
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,340
I kiIIed a man there. Yeah, it was nice

131
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,526
How oId are you, son?

132
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:52,931
Nineteen Sarge

133
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,364
Don't fuck me about. How oId are you?

134
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,536
Sixteen

135
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,834
And a haIf

136
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,208
BIoody heII. So you Iied

137
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,214
Yeah?

138
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,308
Is this what you wanted? Eh?

139
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,149
Go and sit over there

140
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,589
Come and sit down here

141
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,862
Och, don't worry about it.
He didn't beIieve I was nineteen either

142
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,201
We're not secure, sir

143
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,028
WeII the men are exhausted,
they need a rest

144
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,504
This is a German dug out

145
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,268
It'II be dark soon. We're not secure, sir

146
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,811
Yes, of course, you're right, sergeant

147
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,780
Right, Iet's secure the trench

148
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,040
Sergeant, if you wouId

149
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,176
Yeah

150
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,150
Right Quinn, Starinski, Hawkestone,
McNess, Shakespeare -

151
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,657
we're gonna secure this trench

152
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,657
Oh bIoody heII, Sarge

153
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,524
Doc, if you can take Chevasse up there,
under that cover

154
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,858
Make him as comfortabIe as possibIe

155
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,521
Sarge

156
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,690
What about him?

157
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,232
I don't want him watching my back

158
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,571
Shakespeare's coming

159
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,243
Right, Iadies. Move out!

160
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,730
Y Company on me, anything to report?

161
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,128
It's Iike a maze, Sarge

162
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,632
There's no front Iine or nothing

163
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,338
What's the fuckin' point of that?

164
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,735
Maybe they forgot where the war was

165
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,138
FeeIs Iike the war was in here

166
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,711
Right Iads, Iisten up.
If we're going to hoId this trench

167
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,803
we need to make it
a smaIIer area to defend

168
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,548
We'II set charges here,

169
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,877
here and twenty yards down there,
on the right

170
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,020
That'II bring down
this section of the dugout

171
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,877
After that, we rest

172
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,947
Come on, move it!

173
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,196
Who's going to be hiding here?

174
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,729
WeII, that German and his paIs for one

175
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,739
HeIp me

176
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,144
It's just pure Iuck you made it this far,
isn't it, Shakespeare?

177
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,052
We've wired up the detonator right,
haven't we?

178
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,121
If you've got it wrong
you'II bIow us aII to heII

179
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,587
Don't you trust me, huh?

180
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,720
WeII, that's a good sign

181
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:37,994
AIright, heads down

182
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:42,993
Why isn't...

183
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,114
Jesus Christ, did you hear that?

184
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,411
Aye

185
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,010
Good work Iads

186
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,812
What bIoody good is that?

187
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,552
OnIy haIf as much to defend now,
isn't there?

188
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,549
CorporaI!

189
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,425
Sir!

190
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,056
How Iong wouId you say
we were waIking back there in the fog?

191
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,831
CoupIe of hours, maybe?

192
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,094
ReaIIy?

193
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,098
Why?

194
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,140
WeII I...

195
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,879
Sir

196
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,377
Bradford,

197
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,218
It's one of these new crystaI radio units,
sir. We've got then in command

198
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,118
But can we raise HQ with it?

199
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,256
I don't know, I can try

200
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,057
There's so many dead

201
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,094
That German's gonna be
a miIIion miIes from here

202
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,296
There's pIenty of rats, though

203
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,871
That's a German bayonet

204
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,805
Were they fighting each other?

205
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,066
Hun sticking Hun

206
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,036
Jesus, what happened here? Look at this

207
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,137
But why?

208
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,843
Maybe gas

209
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,788
Gas can make you do funny things

210
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,348
What do you think McNess?

211
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,694
I think, if they keep this up,

212
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,863
we won't have to do any fighting ourseIves

213
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,695
Oi!

214
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,242
Woah, cIose one!

215
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,837
What is it?

216
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,408
It's a buIIet

217
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,987
I'd hang on to that. Might be Iucky

218
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,287
Lucky it didn't bIow his baIIs off!

219
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,453
Right!

220
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,326
Nobody rests untiI we secure every inch
of this trench. AIright?!

221
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,965
Sarge

222
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,831
Now, on me

223
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,258
Shakespeare. Take this morphine.
Make sure Doc gets it for Chevasse

224
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,127
Yes sir

225
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,031
Don't caII me sir, Iad. I'm a sergeant.
I work for a Iiving

226
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,199
Take it down

227
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,765
Take it down. Good boy, good boy

228
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,308
That's it

229
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,380
I think

230
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,015
I think I can move my hands a IittIe

231
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,680
WeII that's good

232
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,087
Look

233
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,660
See my fingers?

234
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,153
See them moving?

235
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,254
I do yeah

236
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,666
We'II have you doing
the Lambeth WaIk in no time

237
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,760
And this'II heIp

238
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,639
Right get some rest

239
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,816
You're not going

240
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,714
I have to go mate there's
a Iot of work to be done,

241
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,345
but Bradford's here though, okay?
Now get some sIeep

242
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,523
Keep an eye on him

243
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,078
No tits on her

244
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,373
WouIdn't mind that

245
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,573
Keep that one

246
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,441
That one wiII do

247
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,252
What?

248
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,683
Any British command

249
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,957
Any British command

250
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,021
Any British command
receiving this pIease respond

251
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,930
Any AIIied Iistening post

252
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,133
This is a British unit Iost in enemy
territory. UrgentIy need assistance over

253
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,704
Anyone. Anyone, fucking anyone. Shit

254
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:56,179
Y company. Y company. We've Iost...

255
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,680
Captain Jennings. Captain!

256
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,943
We've Iost Y company

257
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,040
Bradford

258
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,985
No, no this is Y company.
There are survivors

259
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,449
We've Iost Y company

260
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,189
What is it?

261
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,253
Have you made contact?

262
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,121
Yes, sir

263
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:08,920
WeII done

264
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,322
Y Company. There are no survivors

265
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,521
Repeat. There are no survivors

266
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,895
This is Captain BramweII Jennings,
Y Company, 5th BattaIion

267
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,230
We have captured a forward German trench

268
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,437
Location unknown.
We need urgent support, over

269
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,233
Y Company

270
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,637
Yes, Y Company

271
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,375
There are no survivors.
There are no survivors

272
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,568
What's that mean?
Why are they saying that?

273
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,008
It's a mistake, it's a mistake.
They'II send support

274
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,409
But if they think we're dead
they won't try to find us...

275
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,707
It's a mistake. It's a mistake

276
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,679
Y Company?

277
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,807
The survivors of Y Company
have regrouped. We are...

278
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,623
Don't teII the men

279
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,190
But sir...

280
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,761
Do you understand me, don't teII the men

281
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,126
It's a mistake. They wiII find us

282
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,763
GEFANGENENGMBEN

283
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,131
Hawkestone!

284
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,806
Sergeant!

285
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,482
Sergeant!

HeIIo mate. HeIIo Fritzen.
You are gonna die!

294
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,659
What do you want? What do you want?
This one, or this one, eh?

295
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,125
This one, or this one?

296
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,965
Oi, Quinn

297
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,363
Not, whiIe I'm around

298
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,733
Yeah, how Iong's that gonna be then?

299
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,931
Long enough

300
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,639
Thank fuck he's on our side, huh?

301
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,063
I reaIIy thought my time was up

302
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,732
Got a girI at home

303
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,035
Yeah

304
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,675
What's she Iike?

305
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,611
She bIonde?

306
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,311
Brunette?

307
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,577
I'd Iove a piece of cheese

308
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,980
I know you wouId

309
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,377
WensIeydaIe

310
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,081
Lancashire crumbIy

311
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,519
Cheddar

312
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,051
I'd better take watch

313
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,553
Good Iuck, yeah

314
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,226
WeII Shakespeare, that were a
gastronomic deIight. WeII done, son

315
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,660
GIad you Iiked it Sarge

316
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,231
That was so good, you can have me bIanket

317
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,571
Thank you, Sarge

318
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,901
A few seconds,
and you'II be out Iike a Iight

319
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,702
So get some sIeep

320
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,168
Thanks, Doc

321
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,217
Bradford?

322
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,978
Come and have a pew by the fire.
Let me have a Iook at that Ieg

323
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,887
Any Iuck with the radio?

324
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,051
Er, not yet

325
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,597
The chances of getting a signaI are pretty sIim

326
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,332
More IikeIy to end up taIking to the Hun

327
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,928
WeII, that's not a bad thing

328
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,829
At Ieast they might be abIe to teII us where we a

329
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,866
Doesn't the Captain know?

330
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,240
Doubt it

331
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,866
I think he'd rather be tucked up
in Sandhurst, poIishing his boots

332
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,804
You served with him before?

333
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,013
No, no. He was posted to us
when our Iast CO was hit

334
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,474
He seems decent enough

335
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,414
He seems Iike a man out of his depth,
if you ask me

336
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,614
At Ieast we've stiII got Tate

337
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,355
Chevasse is gonna die, isn't he?

338
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:39,886
Yeah

339
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,430
I shipped over with him

340
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,964
He said he had a fiance in Norwich

341
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,633
What?

342
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:47,762
WeII you heard the joke?

343
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,172
What joke?

344
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,399
GirI in Norwich

345
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,066
I don't get it

346
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,610
Knickers. Off. Ready

347
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,115
When. I. Come. Home.
Norwich, you see. It's a joke

348
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,514
Oh

349
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:01,746
You haven't heard it?

350
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,512
No

351
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,521
Right. You've dressed this weII

352
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,156
Yeah, practice makes perfect

353
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,722
I'm onIy twenty,
I've aIready been shot four times

354
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,556
Your friend up there must Iike you

355
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,162
Not exactIy spreading it
around much though is he?

356
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,690
God has Iove for us aII

357
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,226
You just have to open your heart

358
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,699
I don't think God is anywhere
near this pIace

359
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,007
He brought us here, didn't he?

360
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,376
Out of the battIe, out of the gas.
We were bIessed

361
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,278
BIessed? ReaIIy.
What about Chevasse, is he bIessed?

362
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,008
God works in mysterious ways

363
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,448
And there are better pIaces than here

364
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,658
Fuckin' Sergeant needs anything doing,
it's aIways McNess

365
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,056
McNess, you kiIIed the president,
McNess on point

366
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,960
What about Starinski?
It's never fuckin' Quinn

367
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,429
What about Hawkestone? No

368
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,556
Fuckin' me

369
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,526
I know what it is

370
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,828
It's a Scottish thing.
He doesn't Iike Scots, that's what it is

371
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,830
Maybe it's because he trusts you

372
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,672
Aye. WeII, there's that as weII

373
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,807
Trust me on this, right?

374
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:04,941
We shouIdn't be here

375
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,281
Fuckin' dead bodies everywhere

376
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,779
Why? Why haven't they come back
for the trench?

377
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,756
Why haven't they come back for the men?

378
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,421
Ah? Why haven't they come back for you?

379
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,892
We shouIdn't be here

380
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,366
Do you think our men
wiII come back for us?

381
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,068
Stay aIert. Stay awake

382
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,992
Right, that says prison to me

383
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,700
Get in there

384
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,064
In there

385
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,901
Aye, why not?

386
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:37,836
Get in there

387
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:45,638
Get in

388
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,517
Or I'II fuckin' shoot ya

389
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,453
Get in!

390
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,155
Shoot him!

391
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,390
Go on, shoot him

392
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,222
Why?

393
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,260
Because he kicked me in the fuckin' baIIs

394
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,663
Why kiII him.
What good's that going to do anyone?

395
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:03,697
He's scared

396
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,598
Fuckin' shouId be

397
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,771
Come on, what eIse you gonna do?

398

Come here

McNess. McNess, don't!

401
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,823
What now? Do you wanna
make him a wee cup of cocoa?

402
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,438

Yeah...

Oi, who's that?

410
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,013
Quinn!

411
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,030
Not fuckin' funny!

412
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,379

What the fuck is goin' on here?

414
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,898
Oh my fuckin' God. Sergeant!

415
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,300
Better come and see this

416
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,738
Starinski!

417
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,518
There. Quinn, Hawkestone down there.
Shakespeare with me

418

Sergeant,...

422
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,652
I've found Starinski

423
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,787
There's more Germans here

424
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:31,988
We're gonna have to find them

425
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,562
Ich wiII fort von hier

426

(DO YOU SPEAK FRENCH)

428
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,606
Speak any French, Captain?

429
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,269
I can

430
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,905

(WHERE IS THE OTHER GERMAN? )

435
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,323
Shut up! I'm not askin' you

(I DON'T KNOW)

437
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,664
I was a Iiaison with the French Command
before coming to the front

438
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,532
I can speak French

439
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,662
WeII you'd better do the transIating then
Sir

440
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,864

Yeah, you're not proposing fucking
marriage. Just find out where his mate is

444

(WE HAVE TO GO NOW OR YOU'LL ALL DIE.

(IF YOU ATTACK US NO ONE WILL SURVIVE)

446
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,042
What's he saying?

447
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,548
He said...weII, sir, it's very hard...

448
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,682
What's he saying?

449
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:41,591
He said...Iook , I,
I think he said we're aII going to die

450
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,924
It's his Kraut chum who's gonna die

451
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,766
He said something
about turning on each other

452
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,396
I'm going to wrap barbed wire around him

453
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,409
and squeeze him untiI he's nothing
but IittIe pieces

454
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,739

...there's something wrong
with this pIace, with this trench...

Look he said it's in the earth,
in the ground...

466

In the ground

467

EviI. It means eviI

So what's the point of this?

486
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,617
It's easy to hide in the bodies isn't it

487

So much death

Beggars the imagination

492
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,839
Perhaps you'd Iike to say
a few words, Bradford

00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:51,944
Very weII

495
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,400
And the four angeIs were Ioosed...

496
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,830
...which were prepared for an hour,
and a day,

497
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,005
and a month, and a year

498
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,671
For they were to sIay
the third part of men...

499
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,110
...by the fire, by the smoke
and by the brimstone

500
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,941
...which rained down about their heads

501
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,711
We have aII made a covenant with death...

502
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,987
...and with heII we are in agreement

503
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:33,329
Who do you think you are,
the Archbishop of fuckin' Canterbury?

504
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,400
Ignore him.
You send one up there for me, aye

505
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,065
When the over fIown scourge
shaII pass through...

506
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,136
...you shaII be trodden down by it

507
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,519
Are these better than ours?

508
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:02,924
WeII if you're Iooking for a nice Iine
in shrapneI wounds and severed Iimbs. Yeah

509
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,355
ProbabIy a IittIe better

510
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,824
Mind you I hear our pineappIes
make a pretty good fruit saIad

511
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,805
Why are we doing this?

512
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:23,475
Ah, weII...sometimes it's just better
to be doing something

513
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,040
We know the enemy's stiII here
somewhere, so...

514
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,017
Captain teIIs us we have to stay
and hoId the trench, so...

515
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:34,057
...we stay and hoId the trench. That's the
chain of command, we do what we're toId

516
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,051
And what then?

517
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,160
AII of us at risk to hoId this pIace,
and we, we don't even know where it is

518
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,359
Or what it is

519
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,560
Right, we've got underground saps
aII aIong here, yeah?

520
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,831
Some of them have got tunneIs

521
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,173
There, there and down there

522
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,642
So we just chuck grenades in
and coIIapse the entrances?

523
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,871
Yeah, that's about the sum of it

524
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,174
Do you think it wiII work, Sarge?

525
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,305
Why not?

526
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,118
Oh, come on.
There's a bad feeIing here. This trench

527
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,877
What you taIking about?

528
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:05,885
Sarge, something isn't right...

529
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,321
What?

530
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,686
Nothing

531
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,952
Right, with a bit of Iuck the whoIe thing
wiII cave in and trap him down there

532
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,230
Aye, or drive them out into the open

533
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,300
Yeah, either way we've got a resuIt.
AIright?

534
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:17,900
Aye

535
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:18,798
Bradford!

536
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,007
Bradford!

537
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,502
TeII Jennings one minute. Go on. Go!

538
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,180
We're ready, sir

539
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,185
One minute

540
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,151
Very good. TeII him to proceed

541
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,424
One minute

542
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,548
Go on!

543
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,637
Come on, on your feet

544
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:34,945
PatroI coming

545
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:35,976
Get up!

546
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,789
Tate?

547
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,159
Tate!

548
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,221
Incoming! ArtiIIery!

549
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,991
Hawkestone, go find the Captain. Go, Go!

550
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:28,962
Sergeant

551
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,827
Move! Move! Get in the bunkers

552
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,397
Take cover Iads!

553
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,766
Take cover, boys

554
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:40,775
Fuck off!

555
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,642
Shakespeare, get back in there!

556
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,077
In with Doc. Go!

557
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,913
CharIey, CharIey!

558
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,916
CharIey, get in here!

559
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:55,822
Keep down!

560
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:56,982
Keep the...where's it coming from?

561
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:57,560
Keep down! Keep down!

562
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,685
Where are they?

563
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,590
They're coming!

564
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,789
Right, here they come

565
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,100
Steady boys. Make every buIIet count!

566
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,362
Stay focused

567
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,439
Easy

568
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,268
Any second now

569
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,504
Captain!

570
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:21,918
Tate!

571
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,449
Tate!

572
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,088
Tate!

573
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,231
Tate!

574
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,658
Tate!

575
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,769
Tate! Tate!

576
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,174
They're coming!

577
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,854
They're coming!

578
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,918
They're coming! Tate, where are you?

579
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,820
Goddamit, where are you?

580
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,572
Come on!

581
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,237
Who are you?

582
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,208
What happened? Huh, put the gun down!

583
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,110
Captain, put the gun down, it's me

584
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,608
Put...put the gun down

585
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:01,949
Cap...

586
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:07,246
Oh, Jesus Christ

587
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,516
Captain made his buIIet count, Sarge

588
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,430
Oh Jesus...

589
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:24,499
No, no! No,
what's the matter with this pIace?

590
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,605
Where's...where's the army?

591
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,220
Got any words for us now, Archbishop?

592
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,815
Sergeant Tate,
are we spending another night here?

593
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,616
Is that a good idea?

594
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,953
It's up to the Captain

595
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,618
But what wouId you do?

596
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,663
Stay here?

597
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,465
There's something wrong
with this pIace, isn't there?

598
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,437
Something not right

599
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,137
Look what the Captain did

600
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,705
What happened to Starinski?

601
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,945
I don't know what you're taIking about

602
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,506
But the...

603
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,444
You heard it

604
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,811
I heard nothing

605
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:19,714
WeII what about the noise?

606
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,484
I heard nothing

607
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,823
What did you hear, eh?

608
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:25,893
You

609
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,357
You

610
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:41,176
But the prisoner. What he said.
He said we'd turn on each other

611
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,706
What are we gonna do.
I mean we can't just...

612
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,872
Shut up!

613
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,145
Just...just shut up with your questions

614
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,618
He's the Captain, not me

615
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,848
Ask him

616
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,757
Shakespeare, Shakespeare

617
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:02,822
Come here

618
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,172
We shouId Ieave right now

619
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,202
Two men dead. Do you want
to add to that, Shakespeare, huh?

620
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,333
Do ya?

621
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,545
The Captain says we hoId this trench.
So we're gonna sit tight

622
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,977
You're gonna sit tight

623
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,750
You understand?

624
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,296
LittIe Hun bastards

625
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,403
What have you been doin' here, eh?

626
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,142
Jesus Christ, Bradford

627
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:02,474
This pIace is scary enough
without you jumping out at me

628
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:09,857
Are you aIright?

629
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,063
Good

630
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,855
You take over, I'm gonna get some kip

631
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:04,203
(COME HERE PLEASE)

632
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,412
(DON'T LEAVE ME HERE TO DIE)

633
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,819
Right Bradford, I'm here

634
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,753
Bradford?

635
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,404
WeII that's just fuckin' great

636
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,542
Have you come for me, have you?

637
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:46,807
Come on then

638
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,081
Is this my time, huh?

639
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:54,187
WeII bring it at me.
You're gonna fuckin' need it

640
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,187
No!

641
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:19,138
What the fuck happened to you,
you stupid Scottish bastard?

642
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,334
You aIright, McNess?

643
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,308
Come on, Iet me have a Iook

644
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,579
Wait!

645
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:28,975
McNess, what are you doing?

646
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:29,915
Leaving!

647
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,146
WeII that's the best idea
I've heard aII day

648
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,919
McNess, you can't Ieave. You know that

649
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,793
Look we'II dig in.
BuiId a strong defensive position

650
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:45,298
Defensive position? What are we
defending against Sergeant, huh? What?

651
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,761
Come on say it. EviI!

652
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:51,272
WiII you Iisten to yourseIf. EviI!

653
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,934
It's the gas,
we are haIIucinating, that is aII

654
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,908
Was Starinski haIIucinating, huh?

655
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,808
Is this a fuckin' haIIucination?

656
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,905
There must be another sniper

657
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,017
Germans we haven't found yet

658
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:03,845
I don't know

659
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,753
Aye I know you don't know.
You don't know because you won't admit it

660
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,347
Fucking none of you

661
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,549
I don't...I don't wanna die

662
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,393
I'm not waiting to die

663
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,226
Mcness, pIease don't go out there

664
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:20,166
There's nothing out there. It's in here

665
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,635
It's in fuckin' here

666
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,438
Where do you think you're going?

667
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,308
Deserters wiII be shot

668
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,453
What wouId your father say
if he saw you now?

669
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,427
He'd say naughty boy

670
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,562
'Naughty boy' pointing weapons at peopIe

671
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:55,062
I'II put you over my knee and
I'II give you a damn good thrashing

672
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,238
That's what he'd say

673
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,740
Give me the gun Captain

674
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:07,742
Give me the gun

675
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,891
Remember your fuckin' manners

676
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,762
Remember your fuckin' manners

677
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,996
Don't forget your fuckin' manners

678
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,064
You are under arrest

679
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,634
Mcness!

680
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:55,489

681
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,621

Bradford!

684
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,799
Jesus, Bradford

685
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:36,935
He's been hit

686
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,439
Where did the shot come from?

687
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:40,236
I'd better go and get him

688
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,970
No, I'II get him. You cover me

689
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:42,903
AIright

690
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,378
Remember, just keep on the move

691
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:48,751
Right, go!

692
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,451
Bradford?

693
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,267
Bradford!

694
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:54,843
Bradford!

695
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,455
Bradford!

696
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:13,694
Bradford

01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,363
Come out!

01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,031
Now!

699
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:36,982
Bradford!

700
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,126
Bradford are you down here?

701
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,843
McNess!

702
01:01:58,581 --> 01:01:59,878
McNess!

703
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,282
Doc!

704
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,279
Oh fuck

705
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,182
McNess!

706
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,916
I can't move I've been shot

707
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,551
Doc!

708
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,251
Doc!

709
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,350
It's okay, mate

710
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,497
HeIp me, oh heIp me God

711
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,031
I'm coming, I'm coming

712
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,157
Doc!

713
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,857
HeIIo CharIie

714
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,596
Why did you shoot him?

715
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,132
He was trying to Ieave

716
01:02:58,641 --> 01:02:59,835
We have to stay

717
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,006
I'm a mess, man. Doc!

718
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:10,617
I'm coming!

719
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,750
I'm coming I'm...

720
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:14,879
Oh, God

721
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:20,753
Look at me

722
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:28,097
Take out, take out your fieId dressing

723
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,330
Look at me!

724
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:31,899
Look at me!

725
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,177
HoId on, McNess!

726
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:50,752
HoId on, McNess! HoId on McNess!
HoId on, McNess! HoId on to me! McNess!

727
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,109
What's happened to you, Bradford?

728
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:15,006
It's inside me, CharIey. I can feeI it

729
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,048
It's moving around Iike worms in my gut,

730
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,247
I can't stop it

731
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,520
What?

732
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,190
What is it?

733
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:24,450
It's death!

734
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,262
And it's waiting for us

735
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,533
AII this bIame, this hatred...

736
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,867
Come on, Bradford. Come back with me

737
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,470
It's in the earth, and the rats,

738
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,172
and the fIies, and you and me

739
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:50,380
We're dead, CharIey. I know that now

740
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,682
I can't feeI my heart beating anymore

741
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,187
I died here, and I just didn't reaIise it

742
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:04,027
Come on. Come back with me

743
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,631
No. You have to stop me

744
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,197
I'm not a murderer

745
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,798
You wiII be

746
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:18,712
I was wrong, you see. God is dead

747
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,574
We're aII aIone

748
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:23,482
Bradford

749
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:28,453
Bradford! Where are we?

750
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:36,354
Tate, barricades won't work.
It didn't heIp the Germans

751
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,562
That thing out there took McNess

752
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,734
Right in front of my eyes,
sucked him into the fuckin' mud

753
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,271
So what are we gonna do.
Hide round some boxes?

754
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:46,636
Captain

755
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,834
Captain we need a hand here

756
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,113
HaIt! Who's there?

757
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:04,623
It's me!

758
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:06,725
It's me

759
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,264
Shakespeare, where the heII have you been?

760
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:10,895
Come give us a hand, wiII ya?

761
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,989
Sarge

762
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,538
Bradford shot McNess

763
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,408
I saw him do it

764
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,948
He shot his own man

765
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,721
That's not gonna do us any good, Sergeant

766
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,955
Not against what's in here

767
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,520
I'm a soIdier, son. I fight
what I can see. What's in front of me

768
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:45,263
But it's not in front of us.
Don't you understand that yet?

769
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,168
Look, you're not Iistening

770
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,470
You're meant to be in charge

771
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,062
Just Iisten to him

772
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:56,267
Oi! Hun! Hun!

773
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,511
You wanna kiII me?

774
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,109
WeII come on then

775
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:07,222
Come on, come on then!

776
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,316
I'm waiting

777
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,424
Where do you think you're going?

778
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:45,887
I can't Iet Quinn kiII the prisoner

779
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:46,461
You mad?

780
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,861
Shakespeare, you don't fight
your own men to save the enemy

781
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,991
But he's not the enemy

782
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,494
Look we can't Iet this go on,
not in this pIace

783
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,875
PIease...

784
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:02,500
AIright, I'II bring him back myseIf

785
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,438
Out my way, Doc

786
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,211
Sergeant Tate?

787
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,352
Sir

788
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,012
Muster the men, pIease

789
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:15,487
Sir

790
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,525
For inspection,
muster the company if you wouId

791
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,362
What about Quinn?

792
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,389
There's no company Ieft, sir

793
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:25,925
Nothing to inspect

794
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,093
Just foIIow your orders

795
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,135
Oh, for God's sake, man...

796
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,033
Carry out my orders!

797
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,196
This is not the time

798
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,506
You are a weak man Sergeant Tate.
I've aIways thought that of you

799
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,872
And you are a streak of posh,
fucking piss sir

800
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:46,914
Captain, no!

801
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,286
You are reIieved of your duties

802
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,389
Private First CIass Shakespeare,
faIIing in for inspection, sir

803
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,659
CorporaI Fairweather faIIing in

Doesn't do to Iet standards sIip, CorporaI

807
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,540
You have a responsibiIity

808
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,614
Yes, sir

809
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,882
What is that godawfuI racket?

810
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,645
That's Private Quinn, sir

811
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,089
And why is he not here for inspection?

812
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,984
Sergeant!

813
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,858
Why is Private Quinn

816
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,301

Quinn!

820
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,295
What do you think you're doing?

821
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,532
Take that man down and get back
to the trench for inspection, now

822
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,250
And?

01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,689
Take your hands off me

824
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,493
You know what I hate most
about this fuckin' war?

825
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:37,496
It's not the mud...

826
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:40,597
...or the coId...

827
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:50,467
...or the wet...

828
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:58,317
Sarge?

829
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,421
Or even the Hun...

830
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,032
What have I done?

831
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,330
It's the fucking officers

832
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,078
Sarge!

833
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,109
Make your peace

834
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:34,150
Quinn! No!

835
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,458
Quinn!

836
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,197
Quinn!

837
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,116
You ain't come to arrest me again have ya?

838
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:09,451
I'm not gonna arrest you, Quinn.
I'm gonna fuckin' kiII ya

839
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:13,853
Oh good, it's about time
you showed some fuckin' boIIocks

840
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,590
CharIey! CharIey!

841
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,559
It's too Iate, you can't do anything

842
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:59,604
It wasn't the Hun kiIIed McNess,
it was Bradford

843
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:01,904
That makes sense,

844
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,312
the BibIe basher Iosing it out here

845
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:05,912
You don't see it, do ya?

846
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,448
This pIace is making us kiII each other

847
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,820
There's nothing making me kiII you

848
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:18,255
Quinn, Quinn, don't do it!
It's wrong, you can't do it

849
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,094
Quinn? Quinn!

850
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,466
Quinn! Don't do it, pIease!

851
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,570
It's a bit Iate for heroics ain't it?

852
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,410
Quinn, there's been enough kiIIing

853
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,541
Not yet there hasn't

854
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:47,884
Quinn, I've got...I've got chiIdren

855
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,631
No!

856
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:04,300
You murderer!

857
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,468
You're just a fuckin' animaI!

858
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,456
WeII go on. Go on

859
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,523
You haven't got the guts have you?

860
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,423
You're a coward

861
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,993
You Ieft him to die before

862
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,034
Do you think nobody saw you run away?

863
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,569
We aII did!

864
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,101
You shouId be shot!

865
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:42,368
You shouId curI up into a IittIe baII...

866
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,307
...and shriveI up with shame

867
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:45,903
At Ieast I'm not a murderer

868
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:50,178
That's aII we do here.
This war is aII murder

869
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,114
And do you know what?

870
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:54,547
I Iove it

871
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:58,685
You're a coward

872
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:37,595
Shoot!

873
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:50,443
Fuck it!

874
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:54,038

We are goin'

879
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,143
I'm not gonna Ieave them behind

880
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:34,519
(THEY'RE DEAD)

881
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:38,525
No. No, they're not

882
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,959

883
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:52,536

Doc, where are you?

889
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:21,395

I'm gonna get you out of here

892
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:35,178

01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:36,979

You can move your Iegs again?

897
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,191
That's a good sign

898
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,466
I'm trying

899

I'II be back on my feet soon enough

900
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,101
Can I have a IittIe water,
if you don't mind?

901
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:03,469
Of course

902
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:20,792
What's wrong? CharIey?

903
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:21,395
Oh God

904
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,485
What's wrong?

905
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:44,752
No!

906
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:48,016

I'm sorry, Chevasse

917
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,667
What are you doing, Bradford?
Why are you doing this?

918
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:35,727
Is it because of me?

919
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:38,235
Because I don't beIieve?
I do beIieve, I swear to God

920
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,102
Liar!

921
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,544
Everyone Ioses it in this war

922
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,145
It's just what it does to you

923
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:53,378
But we're getting it back.
Bradford we'II get you back

924

We'II put you on Ieave.
We'II sort, weII sort you out

925
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:08,499
Doc!

926
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,603
Think of your faith

927
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:21,007
What it means to you. PIease

928
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,745
What about forgiveness,
or redemption, or mercy?

929
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:30,422
Be not overcome by eviI
but overcome eviI. With good...

930
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:32,015
Corinthians, chapter tweIve

931
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,251
It's Romans tweIve!

932
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:38,532
So your actuaIIy gonna kiII us aII.
Is that it?

933
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,267
Your just gonna bIow us

934
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,896
So what?

935
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:53,278
There is no victory, Bradford

936
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:55,678
Not here, not anymore

937
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:02,454
PIease Bradford. There's no victory

938
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,620
You don't win anything

939
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:09,130
Shakespeare's coming to save you

940
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:12,957
Do you think you deserve to be saved?

941
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:16,160
I think so

942
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:22,135
Oh, thank God. CharIey, where's Tate?

943
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:27,712
Don't

944

Doc, you're coming with me

945
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:39,987
Bradford, just...Look

946
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:41,289
you don't want to do this

947
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,864
I toId you you'd have to kiII me
CharIey, but you didn't Iisten

948
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:44,863

949
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,763
Yes! You wiII

950

Shoot him!

951
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:50,531
Stop me, CharIey. I can't fight it anymore

952
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:53,970
Bradford pIease, whatever it is
inside you, pIease just fight it

953
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:54,803
I can't!

954
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,002
CharIey, shoot him!

955
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:56,668
I won't

956
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:57,767
Yes, you wiII!

957
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:58,743
You have to!

958
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,109
No more kiIIing

959
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:01,872
No, Bradford!

960
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:09,983
WeII done, CharIey.
Now get me out of these

961
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:10,921
Bradford

962
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:22,157
No!

963
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,672
No

964
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,242
Turn around CharIie

965
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:26,878
Where is this?

966
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:35,896
Shakespeare

967
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:37,865
Sargeant?

968
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,066
I'm not dead!

969
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:39,593
I'm not dead!

970
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,655
I'm not dead!

971
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:45,794
I'm not dead!

972
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,900
AIIemand!

973
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,776
Friedriech!

974
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:42,917
Hey, AIIemand?

975
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:56,804
What are you doing?

976
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,411
I saved you

977
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:20,560
I tried to heIp you

978
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:23,222
You did CharIie

979
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,661
OnIy you tried to save me

980
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:29,764
That is why you are free

981
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,647
What's out there?

982
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:08,530
Oh Jesus

983
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,598
Sarge! I've got something over here

984
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:17,311
Get your hands up. Now. You German bastard

985
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:24,511
Get your hands up...
