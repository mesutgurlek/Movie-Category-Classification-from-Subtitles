1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,967
Red Sorghum

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,977
Adaptation of Moyan's novels:
<<Red Sorghum>> and <<Kaoliang Spirit>>.

3
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,987
I want to tell you the story
about my grandparents.

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,994
People from my town still talk about them.

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,999
but not everyone believes the story anymore.

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,025
This is my grandma.

7
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,019
That year, on the 9th day of the 7th moon, my grandma was married off.

8
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:09,024
To Big Head Li, a wine brewery owner at 18 Mile Slope.

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,040
Big Head Li didn't find a wife till he was fifty.

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:19,034
Because everyone knew
that he was a leper.

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,043
No crying or vomiting in the sedan chair, it's bad luck!

12
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,050
Don't take off your veil either, it brings trouble!

13
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:41,056
Get in!

14
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,085
According to local custom...

15
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,079
The sedan bearers must tease the bride.

16
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,086
All the chair bearers and musicians are Big Head Li's employees.

17
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:16,091
There was only one man hired for the wedding.

18
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,105
He was a well known sedan bearer from the area.

19
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,099
He later became my grandpa.

20
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,157
Don't peek, little lady.

21
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,160
If you're bored, talk with us!

22
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,163
It's a long trip.

23
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:22,157
Talk if you're bored, sing if you're tired.

24
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,169
Come on, sing!

25
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:28,163
There is no use in peeking!

26
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,178
Little lady...it's not easy to carry you.

27
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:37,172
Yes, not easy.

28
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,177
Poor girl, what a pity.

29
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,181
Who'd marry their own flesh to a leper for money!

30
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,193
She will have a painful future.

31
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,196
Your parents sold you for money!

32
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,199
Big Head Li oozes yellow pus all over.

33
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,201
He will never recover.

34
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,204
Yes, he will never recover.

35
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,198
You can not live with Big Head Lee.

36
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,211
Or you will rot, too.

37
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,213
Yes, you will rot, too.

38
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,216
It's not too late.

39
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,209
We can carry you back.

40
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,223
Just give us the word.

41
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:22,217
Come on, at least sing for us, while we sweat for you.

42
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:32,267
Not a word, huh? Let's shake her up!
Can't make her sing, at least, it'll make her piss.

43
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:38,233
Music!

44
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:03,433
The guests aren't gone.
The party isn't over.

45
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:09,433
But can't find the groom

46
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:24,633
Eager is the groom.

47
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:31,833
Rushes into the room to unveil
his bride.

48
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:44,033
Ah-ya-ya, my little darling.

49
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:58,433
A nose as flat as a pancake.

50
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:05,333
Gosh, big spots all over her face.

51
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:19,433
Chicken-skin neck, ugly face.

52
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:27,333
Hair covered with fleas.

53
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:41,133
Ah-ya-ya, my little darling.

54
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,333
Still silent? Let's continue.

55
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:54,533
Save me from the ugly bride.

56
00:06:55,333 --> 00:07:01,333
Turn around and run.

57
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,533
She's now crashing into my thigh.

58
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:23,533
I'd rather sleep in the pig pen.

59
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:33,633
Ah-ya-ya, my little darling.

60
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,426
Go!

61
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:16,451
On the way to 18 Mile Slope, you pass Green Killer's Crossing.

62
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,458
The area is covered with wild sorghum.

63
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,464
No one knew where it came from.  No one harvested it.

64
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,468
They all say that
these are wild sorghum.

65
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:38,473
And that the place is haunted.

66
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,515
Stop!

67
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,508
Don't move!

68
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,513
Put down the sedan.

69
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,524
Money!

70
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,537
I'm Magic Shot Bandit.

71
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:36,531
Hand over your money or I'll shoot!

72
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,547
Take off your belts!

73
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,553
Put your belts and money here!

74
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,571
Go behind the sedan!

75
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,577
Don't look back.

76
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:30,585
Squat!

77
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,617
I'll shoot if you turn around!

78
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,669
Get out! Walk...

79
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:48,663
Go into the sorghum field.

80
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,692
Hurry up!

81
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:46,721
What are you looking at!? Walk!

82
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,735
Beat him up!

83
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,740
Beat him up! Beat him up!

84
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,749
What! Dead already?

85
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,765
He's not Magic Shot Bandit.

86
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,767
The gun's fake too.

87
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,761
You have guts!

88
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,775


89
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,844
At 18 Mile Slope, the place is deserted.

90
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,848
And the brewery owner is a leper.

91
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,853
No one comes unless to buy wine.

92
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,001
After 3 days, the bride visits her family.

93
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:32,006
That day, grandma's father came to fetch her.

94
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:43,017
You must return to the Li family.

95
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,032
Big Head Li is generous.

96
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,035
He gave us the big black mule.

97
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,028
So you didn't want him.

98
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,032
But why take out the scissors?

99
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:03,037
You must go back to your husband.

100
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:11,045
Daughter, why are you going so fast?

101
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:09,283
Where were you?

102
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:15,289
Did you go to the toilet?

103
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:32,306
Girl, go and just go bravely.

104
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:38,312
Hey sister, go forward boldly.  Go forward! Don't look back.

105
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:45,319
9999 roads all lead us to heaven.

106
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:52,326
9 thousand 9 hundred and ninety nine.

107
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:04,338
Hey sister, go forward boldly.

108
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:10,344
Don't turn around.

109
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,359
... go build yourself a red silk tower.

110
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,352
Toss that red silk bouquet and I'll catch it.

111
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,356
What a big red bouquet.

112
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:27,361
It hits me on my head.

113
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:31,365
Let's drink sorghum wine together.

114
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:40,374


115
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,380
Hey you singer! Get out of there.

116
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,384
What kind of perverted tune...

117
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,389
are you singing anyway.

118
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:03,397
Hey sister, go forward boldly.

119
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:08,402
Go forward. Don't look back.

120
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:31,425
Eat something!  Why don't you eat?

121
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,430
Don't you know how lucky you are?

122
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:41,435
Look at Big Head Li's wealth!  And the mule he gave us!

123
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,439
Eat! Then go back to him.

124
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:50,444
When he dies, everything will be yours.

125
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,448
What else do you want from life?

126
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,462
You belong to him now.

127
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:02,456
Eat! Then you've got to go!

128
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,465
Fine, I'm going!

129
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:18,472
I don't want a father like you.

130
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:23,477
You traded me for a mule! Go live with your mule.

131
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:30,484
I'm going, and I'm never coming back!

132
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,489
Disowning your father!  You little bitch! Not so easy!

133
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:40,494
Your ma and I had a hard time raising you...

134
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,499
while grandma was quarreling with her father.

135
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,503
Big head-Li was murdered at 18 Mile Slope.

136
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,507
No one knew who killed him.

137
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:58,512
I always thought grandpa did it.

138
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:03,517
But I never had a chance to ask him before he died.

139
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:10,524
We'd better leave, and find work elsewhere.

140
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,538
This leper house is jinxed anyway.

141
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,541
That woman brought nothing but trouble.

142
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:21,535
It's very strange.

143
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,540
Big Head Lie just disappeared...
the front door was locked.

144
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,554
His pipe was still on the bed.

145
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:34,548
I heard they found his shoes at Green Killer's Crossing.

146
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,563
He was probably murdered there!

147
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,556
No one knew what happened at Green Killer's Crossing.

148
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:47,561
The county sent two investigators...they didn't find anything!

149
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:53,567
Who could have done it?

150
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:58,572
Big Head Li never did anyone any good.  His enemies did it.

151
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:03,577
No money was stolen...

152
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,581
they only wanted him dead.

153
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:12,586
That woman...she didn't waste any time!

154
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:18,592
On the wedding day, she and the sedan bearer were eyeing each other.

155
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,600
What's it to us?  Tomorrow we'll pack and leave.

156
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,612
See no evil, hear no evil.

157
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,614


158
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,616
Come in.

159
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,618
I haven't got my pants on.

160
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,621
Eggy's dad, are you still drinking?

161
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,623
Scolding your husband again?

162
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,616
Go to sleep!

163
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,620
I just saw that woman sitting alone in the courtyard.

164
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,633
It's an eerie sight.

165
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,636
Send her to us! We'll have some fun!

166
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,630
Behave yourself!

167
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,665
She's afraid of the house...afraid to catch leprosy.

168
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:59,693
Boss!?

169
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:38,732
Sorghum wine can cure all sickness.

170
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,772
Don't go!

171
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:12,766
I want to talk to you.  We can't close down the brewery.

172
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,771
Brother Laohan.

173
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,785
Brother Laohan, you were here the longest.

174
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,779
You manage things around here.

175
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,784
I am just a woman, I need your help.

176
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:38,792
If you really want to go, I won't force you to stay.

177
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,806
You'll get this month's wages, too.

178
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,800
Whenever you want to come back,
you'll have a job waiting.

179
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,806
Please stay.

180
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:57,811
If we do well, you'll get a share of the profit!

181
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,817
Is that acceptable?

182
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,830
All right! We'll all stay.

183
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,831
We'll stay boss.

184
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,832
Listen to him.

185
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,833
Let's stay here.

186
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:13,827
Don't call me "boss," I'm from a poor family also.

187
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,840
We're all equals here.

188
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,834
I am the ninth child, born on the 9th day of the 9th moon.

189
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:27,841
So, call me Jiu'er (Ninth Child), like everyone else.

190
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:35,860
Jiu'er.

191
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:40,854
Boss...shall we clean the yard today?  No one dared to go to the backyard.

192
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,859
They're afraid of leprosy.

193
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,864
You're the boss...tell us what to do.

194
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,877
Tell us, Jiu'er

195
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,870
We'll obey your order, Jiu'er.

196
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,875
Alright, let's clean everything in the next 3 days.

197
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,889
Sweep the house for me.

198
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,883
Anything the old boss touched, we'll burn or bury it.

199
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,889
Brother Luohan, buy some lime.
Let's repaint the yard.

200
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,894
Pour wine over the house and Eighteen Mile Slope three times.

201
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,899
Didn't you say that sorghum wine cures all sickness?

202
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:30,904
May it cure bad luck too!

203
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,931
These keys were boiled three times.

204
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,925
What's mine is yours too.  Keep them.

205
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,970
It was in the sorghum fields.

206
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:50,984
I can walk by myself.

207
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,000
I've told you already, remember?

208
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,002


209
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,996
Tell us what happened afterwards!

210
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:09,002
Then I laid her down on the sorghum...

211
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,006
And she made me v-e-r-y happy!

212
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:18,011
Stop teasing him.

213
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,015
Get out!

214
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,019
That's right, listen to the man.  No need to walk with me.

215
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,033
We're not far from home.

216
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,035
No, I'll sleep there.

217
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,028
From now on, I'm sleeping there

218
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,041
-This will be my room.
-That's the boss's room.

219
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:42,035
Boss? Who's the boss?
You mean Big Head Li?

220
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,041
Who is fucking big head-Lee?

221
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,055
Let me tell you.  I'm not afraid of him, alive or dead!

222
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,048
That woman is mine.

223
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,062
Mine.

224
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,065
She's my wife, because she likes me.

225
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,059
She told me in the sorghum field.  She likes me, she said.

226
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:23,076
That's true, isn't it?  You said you liked me.

227
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:39,092
She's pretending; she wants me to go in.

228
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:54,107
All you can go back.

229
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:02,115
Go back.

230
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:25,138
This man is drunk, get him out!

231
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,175
Push him down.

232
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,178
Hold him.

233
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,171
You bitch! You only want me when your pants are down!

234
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,185
How can you disavow our relationship?

235
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:06,179
I want to sleep in that room.

236
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:15,188
Shut up!

237
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:22,195
Oh, it feels good.

238
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,207
Boss, don't be angry.

239
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:39,212
Get him out of here.

240
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,217
I haven't finished. I...

241
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:54,227
I can't go.

242
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:25,258
Throw him into the pot.

243
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,270
Eggy's mom, bring his belongings.

244
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:50,283
Leave the cover off! I can't breathe.

245
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:56,289
Let me out.

246
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:04,297
Bandits! Magic Shot Bandit!

247
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:33,326
Did Big Head-Li sleep with you?

248
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,340
Yes.

249
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:41,334
Fuck.

250
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:49,342


251
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,351
My grandpa stayed in the pot for 3 days.

252
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,358
Magic Shot kidnapped my grandma.  He sent a message.

253
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,372
If ransom isn't paid...

254
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:13,366
he'll dump the body at Green Killer's Crossing.

255
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,381
Jiu'er is back.

256
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:22,375
Who?

257
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,392
Luohan, you are back.

258
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:33,386
Jiu-er.

259
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:28,441
Bring me some wine!

260
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:40,453
Is everyone dead around here?

261
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,488
Anything to go with the wine?

262
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,490
Only a cow's head.

263
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,492
I want beef.

264
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:13,486
Just a cow's head.

265
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:18,491
Damn the wretched head.

266
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,515
I want beef.

267
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,517
Eat what we have or get out.

268
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,520
You dare talk to me like that?!

269
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,523
I won't leave till I get beef.

270
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:44,517
Sit tight.

271
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:50,523
Someone like you wants beef?  The beef is for Magic Shot Bandit.

272
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,562
A piece of silver.

273
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,555
I only have three coppers.

274
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,567
A piece of silver!

275
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,560
Damn! Three pieces of copper!

276
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,574
Trying to rip me off?

277
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,575
It's fine if you don't want my money.

278
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,577
Just you wait!

279
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,580
Wait for what?

280
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,573
What's up?

281
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:45,578
Boss, this guy tried to rip me off.

282
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:50,583
Cut off his tongue to go with my wine.

283
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,603
I just got a bit drunk.

284
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,616
I was only joking.

285
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,610
Save your tongue to kiss women.

286
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:23,616
But go kowtow to the boss.

287
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,629
What are you waiting for?

288
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:30,623
I'm going, I'm going.

289
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,639
Kneel down!

290
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:40,633
Check out the place before you make a scene.

291
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,647
Come, have more wine.

292
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,640
Magic Shot, let me go, please.

293
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,653
I was naive, sorry for disturbing you.

294
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,656
I was drunk.  I was just joking.

295
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,649
I won't do it again.

296
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,662
Don't move, or I'll kill him.

297
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,666
Don't move

298
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,668
Brother, we've never met, why this?

299
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,670
You ruined my woman!

300
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,673
Your woman?

301
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,675
The one from the brewery?

302
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,676
Yes, did you?

303
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,679
No, I didn't.  I only got 3000 pieces of silver.

304
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,681
You're lying!

305
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:22,675
No, I didn't.
I don't touch women who've slept with lepers.

306
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:30,683
Believe me, brother,

307
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:35,688
or you can have my head.

308
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:41,694
Hold it!

309
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:55,708
Boss, he's not with any gangs.
Why don't we just boil him?

310
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:03,716
I don't want to dirty my shop.

311
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:11,724
Come on, move to the door.
Are you afraid to die?

312
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:26,739
Magic Shot, you're a coward!
I let you go.

313
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,745
Now you dare kill me!

314
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,771
Thank God for Brother Luohan.

315
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,776
He raised the ransom money.

316
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:08,781
At least you got back alive.

317
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:14,787
Boss, are you alright?

318
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:22,795
Today is the 9th day of the 9th moon.
We'll make the new wine of the season.

319
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:28,801
Come and take a look.
It'll take your mind off things.

320
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:42,815
It's a good idea.
I've never been to the brewery

321
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:54,827
Brother Luohan, don't call me boss anymore.
Only you keep calling me that.

322
00:47:55,873 --> 00:48:00,833
Yes, boss.

323
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:06,839
The boss is here!  Behave yourselves.

324
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,852
No one is a stranger here.

325
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:13,846
No. Eggy's father, cover yourself.

326
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,877
How is the water?

327
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,879
Not quite ready.

328
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,881
The wine is made here.
Cold water is poured from the top.

329
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,884
Wine comes out from the bottom.

330
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,877
The wine flows down when
the steam meets the cold water

331
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,891
Let me try!

332
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:52,885
Go ahead.

333
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,890
It's heavy

334
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:09,902
Jiu'er, sit down

335
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,907
This time, I'll find out how sorghum is made into wine!

336
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,920
More cold water

337
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:21,914
Coming!

338
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,920
Hotter!

339
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,934
Cold water!

340
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:35,928
Coming!

341
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,934
Fire! Quick!

342
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,972
The new wine is ready.

343
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:33,986
To the wine God!

344
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:56,008
The best wine is made by us on the
9th day of the 9th moon.

345
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:02,014
Good wine made by our own hands!

346
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,028
Drink our wine...

347
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:10,022
you'll never catch cold!

348
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,037
Drink our wine...

349
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:19,031
nourish your yin and yang!

350
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,044
Drink our wine...

351
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:26,038
bold enough to walk Green Killer's Crossing alone!

352
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,052
Drink our wine...

353
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:34,046
Stand up tall in front of a king!

354
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:39,051
One, Four, Seven, Three, Six, Nine,

355
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:49,061
On the ninth day of the ninth moon. Good wine!

356
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:10,082
Boss, try the new wine!

357
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,095
Drink a bowl of this wine

358
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:17,089
We must all drink it.

359
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:22,094
Jiu'er, drink up!

360
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,119
Come on, drink it

361
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:51,123
Drink it all

362
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,136
You're a good drinker.

363
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,138
I can't drink

364
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:59,131
With practice...

365
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:04,136
I'm not like you

366
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:10,142
That's the way to drink.  Good!

367
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,158
So good

368
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,161
Good

369
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,154
You're back, brother.

370
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:27,159
I like that drinking style.

371
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:32,164
Have some new wine.

372
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,230
What are you doing?

373
00:55:27,264 --> 00:55:32,224
Wait and see.

374
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:37,469
My grandpa pissed in the
wine jugs, it was meant as a joke.

375
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:44,476
But oddly enough, those jugs turned out to be
the best they ever brewed.

376
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:59,491
Boss...good news!

377
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:05,497
Boss...good news!

378
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:15,507
It's Brother Luohan.

379
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:25,517
Boss...good news.

380
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:29,521
The wine is ready.  I've been here for
more than ten years...

381
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:34,526
but never had wine so good.

382
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:39,531
Give it a name.

383
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:44,536
So people will remember it.

384
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:54,546
This place is called Eighteen Mile Slope,
we can call it "Eighteen Mile Red."

385
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:03,555
Jiu-er, I've left "Eighteen Mile
Red" at your door.

386
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:15,567
Brother Luohan left that very night.

387
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:22,574
Nine years went by quickly.
"Eighteen Mile Red" had become famous in the area.

388
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,588
My father was nine years old.

389
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:30,582
Everyone called my father a bastard
from the sorghum field.

390
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:35,587
Last time when I went home,
the 99 year old Granny next door said...

391
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:41,593
as an acre of sorghum only yields 9 pleats of grains,
9 out of 10 bastards will turn out bad.

392
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:18,630
Mum!

393
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:31,643
Mum!

394
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,711
Brother Luohan!

395
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:33,705
Brother Luohan!

396
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:31,763
It was Brother Luohan.

397
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,786
In July that year, the Japanese came.

398
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,780
The road they built had reached Green Killer's Crossing.

399
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,993
You're good at this.

400
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:14,986
Thank you.

401
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,999
The captain thinks well of your skills.

402
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,992
It's just to make a living.

403
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:25,997
The captain said one isn't enough.
He wants you to do one more.

404
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,010
No problem.

405
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:33,004
Over there!

406
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:42,013
Skin him!

407
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,029
Sir, this must be a joke.

408
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:52,023
Who's joking? Skin him!

409
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,037
Go!

410
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,039
Don't just stare!

411
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,041
Please, sir.

412
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:04,035
I can't do it.

413
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:11,042
The captain said if you won't do it,
we'll split your chest open.

414
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:19,050
Listen!

415
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,054
After flattening the sorghum field.

416
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:28,059
You're now going to watch a person
being skinned alive!

417
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:35,066
This man hanging here, look at him carefully.

418
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:46,077
Whoever fights the Japanese
will end up like him!

419
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:44,135
Finish me off quickly.

420
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,140
I'll forever be grateful.

421
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,154
Why're you taking so long?

422
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:57,148
Sir, I'll wash him with cold water first.
If I pour cold water on him first...

423
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:00,162
You're the expert.

424
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:05,156
Boss, you can't get away this time

425
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:10,161
I can't save you.

426
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:17,168
Hurry up!

427
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:41,192
You dog!

428
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,205
Slave of the Japanese!

429
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,208
Don't fall out

430
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:53,204
Bastard!

431
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:59,210
Bastard!

432
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:15,226
Damn you Japanese and your ancestors!

433
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:27,238
Spare me.  Let me go.  I can't.

434
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:37,248
I want him skinned alive!

435
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,253
Hurry up!

436
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:45,267
Take the knife

437
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:50,261
Do it well!  I want his skin!

438
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:55,266
Did you hear me?...I will skin you!

439
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:03,274
If you don’t hurry up, the captain says
to skin you alive.

440
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:11,282
Didn't you hear?  Hurry up!

441
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,298
Brother Luohan!

442
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,292
Spare me...

443
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:30,301
Brother, bear with me.

444
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:36,307
Bear with me.

445
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:58,329
Skin him! Quick!

446
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:04,335
Do it

447
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:20,351
According to people from my home town,
Brother Luohan joined the communists.

448
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:26,357
He helped organize the guerrillas
to fight the Japanese.

449
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:32,363
I've checked the county
registrar, it's says...

450
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:37,368
The Japanese captured over 400,000 people
to build a highway.

451
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:44,375
They destroyed rice fields and
murdered thousands.

452
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:49,380
Luohan Liu was skinned alive
in public at Green Killer's Crossing.

453
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:56,387
He showed no fear, and cursed the Japanese
till his last breath.

454
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:27,478
Beans, kneel down!

455
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:37,488
The wine was brewed by Brother Luohan.

456
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:45,496
Bow, then drink it!

457
01:16:05,469 --> 01:16:08,569
If you are real men, drink this wine.

458
01:16:09,723 --> 01:16:14,823
...and bomb the Japanese truck tomorrow morning
to avenge Brother Luohan's death.

459
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:53,624
9th day of the 9th moon we brew

460
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,639
Good wine brewed by our own hands.
Good wine!

461
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,632
Drink our wine.

462
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:06,637
You'll never catch cold.

463
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,651
Drink our wine.

464
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:14,645
Nourish your yin and yang!

465
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,660
when the fighting starts

466
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:23,654
Bold enough to walk Green Killer's Crossing

467
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,667
If you've drunk our wine

468
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:30,661
Stand up tall in front of a king!

469
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:36,667
One, Four, Seven, Three, Six, Nine,
on the 9th day of the 9th moon.

470
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:46,677
Good wine!

471
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,757
Beans, come here.

472
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:00,751
Why?

473
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,765
Piss into the wine.

474
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:08,759
Play the trumpet.

475
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,774
I only know the tune for weddings.

476
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,776
Which song should I trumpet?

477
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:19,770
Just play anything,
the Japanese are afraid of noise.

478
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:24,775
Just play it as loud as you can.

479
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,815
Has the truck arrived?

480
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:09,820
Don't just sleep,
make sure the explosions go off.

481
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:20,831
I put twice as much gunpowder in it.
It has to go off.

482
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,869
My dad told me...

483
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:52,863
since that day, his eyes started to hurt.

484
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:57,868
Everything he saw was red.

485
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,884
One year when I went home

486
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:07,878
The bridge of Green Killer Crossing
was still there, but all the sorghum was gone.

487
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:12,943
Ma!

488
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,960
Is the fighting over?

489
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,963
Not yet.

490
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,965
Where's your father?

491
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:28,959
They are sleeping, and getting hungry.

492
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:56,987
Ma!

493
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:30,020
Ma!

494
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,036


495
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:39,029
Ma!

496
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:44,034
Fire the cannon, quick!

497
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:49,039
Big Zhang! Little Zhang!
It didn't go off!

498
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:58,048
Brother, let's go!

499
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:19,129
Father!

500
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:27,137
Father!

501
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:54,085
Hey sister, go forward boldly.

502
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:59,085
Don't look back. Go build yourself a red silk tower

503
01:26:59,085 --> 01:27:09,085
Toss that red silk bouquet.  I'll catch it.

504
01:27:09,085 --> 01:27:19,085
Let us drink that red, red sorghum wine.

505
01:27:19,085 --> 01:27:29,085
That red, red sorghum wine.

506
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,227
Father, look!

507
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:25,255
Mother, go to heaven.

508
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:30,260
On a wide road, in a big boat.

509
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:35,265
Mother, go to heaven.

510
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:40,270
On a handsome horse, with lots of silver.

511
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:45,275
Mother, go to heaven.

512
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,280
Rest and leave your earthly worries behind.

513
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:57,287
Mother, go to heaven.

514
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:02,292
On a wide road, in a big boat.

515
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:07,297
Mother, go to heaven.

516
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:12,302
On a handsome horse, with lots of silver.

517
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:17,307
Mother, go to heaven.

518
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:22,312
Rest and leave your earthly worries behind.
