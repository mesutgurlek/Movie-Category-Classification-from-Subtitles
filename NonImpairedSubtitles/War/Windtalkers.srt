1
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,810
Charlie!

2
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,620
I wasn't so sure you'd be on the bus.

3
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:29,962
Didn't want your white brothers
thinking you were the best we had.

4
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,040
SOLOMON ISLANDS
1943

5
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,961
Watch out!

6
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,128
My hand!

7
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,627
Goddamn!

8
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,263
We're running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.

9
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,505
Move!

10
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,954
Come on!

11
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,058
Come on, you can do it! Come on!

12
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,518
We got nothin', Enders!
We're out of ammo!

13
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:03,087
Joe... Nobody else needs to die.
We can go! We can get outta here!

14
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,805
We got orders!

15
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:14,468
They told us to hold the position!
And that's what we're gonna do!

16
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,547
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!

17
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:34,219
Come on!

18
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:37,097
Get down!

19
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:43,528
Tommy.

20
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,605
Goddamn you!

21
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,245
Oh, no! No!

22
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:10,592
- Bill!
- I'm out.

23
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:17,165
Come on! Come on!

24
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,520
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.

25
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,055
No... No!

26
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:41,823
No!

27
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,502
Raise your right hand.

28
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,207
- I... State your full name...
- l, Ben Yahzee...

29
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:03,609
CAMP PENDLETON, CALIFORNIA

30
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,513
...do solemnly swear to support and
defend the constitution of the US...

31
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,923
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

32
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:13,757
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

33
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:17,356
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me
the code word for "tank"?

34
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:28,165
Come on. You boys
wanna be codetalkers.

35
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,075
Show me some brains. Think!

36
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,642
What do we call a tank?

37
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,412
Chay-da-gahi.

38
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:44,891
Tortoise. Good.

39
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,356
Artillery. Code word?

40
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,295
In code. Private Whitehorse.

41
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:58,066
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?

42
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:01,603
Very good.

43
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,645
Japanese Zero. Code word?

44
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:08,107
KANEOHE BAY US NAVAL HOSPITAL
1943

45
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:41,782
We can go! We can get outta here!

46
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,977
They told us to hold the position!

47
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,792
Nice day, huh?

48
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,199
Joe?

49
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:15,608
Joe.

50
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,581
Didn't hear a word, did you?

51
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:27,322
That's what happens to a man
when he's talking to a beautiful woman.

52
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:30,627
It happens when you're
not watching my lips, Joe.

53
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:37,929
Watch this.

54
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:00,920
You're a mess, Joe.
You're not fooling anybody.

55
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:03,396
No, Rita. He's a mess.

56
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:07,426
I'm getting better every day.

57
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:11,735
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium's all screwy.

58
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:14,867
You can't go back to war
if you can't stand up.

59
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,902
Let's go, marines. This war
ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.

60
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:22,376
Joe...

61
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,537
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?

62
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:50,103
Somebody's gotta keep
the WAVES company.

63
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,810
Are you gonna help me or not?

64
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,755
Marked improvement.

65
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,793
And his left ear is the worse of the two?

66
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,955
It's... amazing.

67
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,697
TBYhasn't got the range of the TBX.

68
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:32,361
So you may need a relay to get
your transmission to command post.

69
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,774
But what it really comes down to
is speed and accuracy under pressure.

70
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,907
Transcribe now.

71
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:42,779
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.

72
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:53,387
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!

73
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,657
We're losing men.

74
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,994
I need this message decrypted.

75
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:09,033
"Request fire support. We have target
at one-one-niner, Baker one-five."

76
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,136
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will."

77
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,578
Beginner's luck.

78
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,641
You're up, mac.

79
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,382
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.

80
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,728
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.

81
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,961
Better than you did as a civilian.

82
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,339
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.

83
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:20,846
Assault and battery...
on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?

84
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,543
A priest?

85
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:29,386
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan
High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.

86
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,755
Public-school boy myself.

87
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:36,519
Some minor problems in boot.

88
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:40,225
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.

89
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,832
And you made a hell of a stand
on the Solomons.

90
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,998
Tough bit of business there, huh?

91
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,369
Pretty tough, sir.

92
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:51,744
But you're prepared
to jump right back into it?

93
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:53,676
Yes, sir. Very much so.

94
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,110
Very much so.

95
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:59,811
Well...

96
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:06,390
The Japs have pretty much busted
every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.

97
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:09,521
You men on the Solomons
were lost to a broken code.

98
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:14,231
Tell me something. You ever
run into any Indians on the Solomons?

99
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:17,362
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.

100
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:22,108
The Corps has developed a new code
based on their language.

101
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:24,111
It's had quite an impact.

102
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,275
So much so the navy have decided
to go to great lengths to protect it.

103
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,574
That's why you're here.

104
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,777
You're to pair with one of them,
keep his ass safe.

105
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:38,087
Your job is to keep him alive
so he can do his job.

106
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,496
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,

107
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:44,532
not baby-sitting some Indian.

108
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,466
Enders, we didn't pick
your name out of a hat.

109
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,194
We need good marines.

110
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,902
That's why you're standing here.

111
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:55,807
Take a look.

112
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,038
It's a Navajo. Or it was.

113
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:02,048
Tortured to death by Japanese
intelligence trying to bust our code.

114
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:05,608
Fortunately, he couldn't help them
even if he wanted to.

115
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:09,315
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.

116
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,019
Code's based on their language,
but it is still a code.

117
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:18,097
Tojo would like nothing more
than to catch a live one.

118
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:23,301
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal,
cannot leave this room.

119
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:30,540
Under no circumstances can you allow
your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.

120
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:34,505
Your mission is to protect the code...

121
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,208
at all costs.

122
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,445
You understand me?

123
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,890
Yes, sir, I do.

124
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,656
Good.

125
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:50,357
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.

126
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,880
Keep those hands vertical.

127
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,943
Way to go, marine.

128
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,860
Fortino, take over.

129
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:59,956
Hey... That was you, right,
sitting in front of the major's office?

130
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,298
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.

131
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:07,038
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.

132
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:11,272
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.

133
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:14,410
So you're with JASCO too, huh?

134
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:20,828
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

135
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:21,192
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?

136
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,492
No fuckin' idea, mac.

137
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,623
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

138
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:33,670
I've never seen so many white men.

139
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,144
They've never seen so many Navajo.

140
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,677
Looks to me like you got to see
a little action there.

141
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,418
Me too.

142
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:51,823
Jap sons of bitches
shot me right in the ass.

143
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:55,090
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.

144
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:04,069
So, your duty with JASCO have anything
to do with these Navajo radiomen?

145
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:08,634
I'm not at liberty to say.

146
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:13,344
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.

147
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:19,880
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell
me are the same orders I can't tell you.

148
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,649
Hell of a thing, huh?

149
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:24,384
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.

150
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,925
Yeah.

151
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:32,258
They look pretty normal, I guess.

152
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,699
Expecting them to wear war paint?

153
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:41,941
Maybe we ought to go introduce
ourselves. They look a little lost to me.

154
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:45,704
Henderson.

155
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:48,472
I wouldn't get too friendly.

156
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:56,280
How!

157
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:58,524
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.

158
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:00,355
Whitehorse.

159
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:02,362
This is Yahzee. Ben.

160
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:07,490
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

161
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:10,833
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?

162
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:51,937
Mind if I join you?

163
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.

164
00:22:57,284 --> 00:22:59,115
How you doin'?

165
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,981
You're blocking my view.

166
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:07,183
Oh, sorry.

167
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,963
What do they call this crap anyway?

168
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,092
Marines call it chow.

169
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,633
Well, there's a propaganda effort.

170
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,051
Sorry. You can have mine.

171
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,684
Shit.

172
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:44,020
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?

173
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:46,362
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.

174
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:49,759
Hold this.

175
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,217
Shit.

176
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:14,361
How's your white man?

177
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,788
Hungry.

178
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,905
I'm in for a couple more.

179
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:36,640
You writing to your son?

180
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,708
Tell him I say hello.

181
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:42,245
Pair of cowboys for Big E.

182
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,159
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.

183
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:50,288
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.

184
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:53,627
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.

185
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,098
All right.

186
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,699
OK... Oh, another mess
for the Sunshine State.

187
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:03,334
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.

188
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,140
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.

189
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,477
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.

190
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,450
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.

191
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:14,176
Call.

192
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:16,314
We all got thumbs up our asses.

193
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,589
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy
in Intel that says we ship out in a week.

194
00:25:21,662 --> 00:25:23,687
I been hearing "next week" for a month.

195
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:27,666
I didn't know you knew
anybody in Intelligence, Harri.

196
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,667
Next year'd be all right with me.

197
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:35,266
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.

198
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,144
Full boat, baby.

199
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:40,510
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.

200
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,482
Oh, Jesus!

201
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,542
Ouch. Ouch.

202
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:50,048
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.

203
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:53,457
God knows what a girl will do
without reassurance.

204
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:56,151
Son of a bitch.

205
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,667
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats
opening up. You wanna come join us?

206
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:04,296
Are you serious?

207
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:08,934
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?

208
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:12,570
Card on the head,
only fool can't see it is you.

209
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:16,343
You want to come on over, or what?

210
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,612
Cut me in.

211
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,761
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

212
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:34,527
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...

213
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:36,395
Hey, don't let him scare you.

214
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:41,597
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's
like any other. Waste of time and money.

215
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,773
Well, ante up... Chief.

216
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,501
How'd you know I was a chief?

217
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:51,844
You must've seen me showering
with my war bonnet.

218
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:08,558
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.

219
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:10,623
Beautiful.

220
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,850
All right, then.

221
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:40,328
Orders finally came through.

222
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,525
We ship out tomorrow morning.

223
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,634
Destination: the island of Saipan,

224
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:59,046
which is one of the stepping stones
we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.

225
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,783
It's of strategic importance
that we capture this island.

226
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,617
We can get ourselves
an advanced naval base

227
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:09,022
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's

228
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:11,959
and get our bombers
within range of Tokyo.

229
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:18,261
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil,
and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.

230
00:28:18,335 --> 00:28:20,826
They're gonna fight for every square inch,

231
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:24,567
because it's their home,
but we're gonna take it away from 'em!

232
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:27,574
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!

233
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,381
We're gonna be in front
of the whole damn division.

234
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:39,083
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.

235
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:42,417
We're gonna be
sniffin' out enemy positions,

236
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:44,392
coordinating the naval gunfire -

237
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:49,398
exactly what we've been training to do
for the last four months. All right?

238
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,574
Now, we got some new radiomen
from headquarters.

239
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:03,535
There's a Private Whitehorse...

240
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:09,375
and Yahzee...

241
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:14,981
and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson,

242
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:18,222
who, if I'm understanding
these orders correctly,

243
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:21,628
will be covering our Navajos' asses.

244
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:46,517
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!

245
00:29:55,065 --> 00:30:00,367
...but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin'
into our share of the shit nonetheless.

246
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,966
Any questions?

247
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:26,988
Sounds like you're dying.

248
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:29,828
These might help get rid of the taste.

249
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:34,303
Charlie and l, we both lost it
on the boat ride from San Diego.

250
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:37,196
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.

251
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,901
Life Savers really helped.

252
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:42,368
You want a Life Saver?

253
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:47,008
What are you doin' here?

254
00:30:47,717 --> 00:30:49,708
Just trying to help.

255
00:30:57,494 --> 00:30:59,485
Not what I meant.

256
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:03,157
You mean what am I doing
in this uniform?

257
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,202
It's my war too, Sergeant.

258
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:09,898
I'm fighting for my country,
for my land, for my people.

259
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:13,666
Not your people I'm worried about.

260
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:18,111
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.

261
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:22,208
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes
to do what used to take an hour.

262
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:25,414
Now, somebody wearing
a lot more stripes than you

263
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,923
thinks that's worth something.

264
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:31,791
Remind me to time you when
you got bullets flying over your head.

265
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:41,065
What the hell's wrong with you?

266
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,844
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

267
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:55,544
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!

268
00:31:58,688 --> 00:32:03,887
From the halls of Montezuma

269
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,862
To the shores of Tripoli

270
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:12,631
We will fight our country's battles

271
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:16,399
On the land and on the sea

272
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:21,006
First to fight for right and freedom

273
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:24,740
And to keep our honor clean

274
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:29,075
We are proud to claim the title

275
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:32,952
Of United States Marines

276
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:50,662
Hi.

277
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,700
How's that ear?

278
00:32:55,412 --> 00:32:59,280
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if
it starts aching, take a couple of those.

279
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:01,476
And call me in the morning.

280
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:07,746
You're not gonna be here
in the morning, are you?

281
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:12,821
Shipping out without even
buying me a drink.

282
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,889
Ought to be ashamed of yourself,
hustling a... hustling marines.

283
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,838
What's your poison?

284
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:26,899
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I'll get a shot of something.

285
00:33:26,977 --> 00:33:28,535
Rum.

286
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:31,237
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.

287
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:33,308
Make that two.

288
00:33:33,383 --> 00:33:35,374
May as well join me, huh?

289
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:38,181
- Why not?
- OK.

290
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:43,415
Thank you.

291
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:47,422
Well... to war.

292
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:05,537
THE JAPANESE ISLAND OF SAIPAN
JUNE 16, 1944

293
00:34:16,729 --> 00:34:18,492
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

294
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:33,239
Get those men spread out!

295
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,606
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!

296
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,362
Come on, keep up!

297
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,509
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on!

298
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,092
- How am I doin'?
- You're good.

299
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,777
Let's go!

300
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,512
Stay on my ass.

301
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,763
I told you to stay on my ass!

302
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:20,111
- Stay low!
- Get out of there!

303
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,301
Go!

304
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:34,005
Get him outta there!

305
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,071
Get me outta here!

306
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,685
- Hold still, damn it!
- Get him outta there!

307
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,697
You sons of bitches!

308
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,670
Fortino! Cover me!

309
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:03,732
Whitehorse, get down!

310
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:35,540
Get down!

311
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,995
Pappas!

312
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:56,904
Corpsman!

313
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:59,600
Helmet goes on your head! Corpsman!

314
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:02,200
Take care of him.

315
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:06,938
Put a hand on this.

316
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,053
Tank! Tank! Tank!

317
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,995
You ready? Go! Go!

318
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:36,200
Harrigan, light it up!

319
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,624
Let's go, boys! Keep up the fight!

320
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:06,867
Are you hit? Are you hit?

321
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:09,578
You're OK. You're good, you're good.

322
00:42:10,382 --> 00:42:13,317
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.

323
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,486
- Harri?
- You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy.

324
00:42:16,555 --> 00:42:18,887
- Stay low!
- Nellie? Pappas?

325
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:20,948
Yeah, we're good.

326
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:24,921
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate.

327
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:26,259
What?

328
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:29,128
I can't breathe when I get excited.

329
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:32,261
Goddamn! Must be hell on your gal!

330
00:42:50,756 --> 00:42:55,784
Enders, get the navy on the horn
and tell 'em to dig out those guns.

331
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:59,862
Target reference... dog one...

332
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:02,526
right 700.

333
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:05,034
Elevation zero-five-zero.

334
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:14,810
Relay the damn coordinates!

335
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,818
Arizona! Arizona!

336
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,267
USS CALIFORNIA

337
00:43:51,383 --> 00:43:55,717
It sounds like they're underwater.
Is it English?

338
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:09,966
Target reference, dog one,

339
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:13,869
south 700, elevation zero-five-zero.

340
00:44:36,995 --> 00:44:38,724
Right 200!

341
00:44:39,164 --> 00:44:42,065
Up 50. Fire for effect.

342
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:14,796
Let's go!

343
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,390
Move!

344
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,401
Harrigan!

345
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:03,437
Torch the box!

346
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:56,130
Kill him!

347
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,653
Goddamn it!

348
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:26,597
Shit.

349
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:30,966
Nellie. Take the satchel charge.

350
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:33,800
You hear me? Move!

351
00:47:40,281 --> 00:47:42,044
You're gonna cover me, right?

352
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:44,210
I'll go with you. We flank left.

353
00:47:44,919 --> 00:47:47,217
I'll cover you. Smoke and cover.

354
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:49,279
I can do this.

355
00:47:51,926 --> 00:47:53,917
I can do this.

356
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:05,696
Smoke 'em up!

357
00:48:11,112 --> 00:48:13,137
Cover up.

358
00:49:04,432 --> 00:49:05,956
Shit!

359
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,868
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!

360
00:49:24,018 --> 00:49:25,918
Heads up around 0500.

361
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:29,548
You're going to have replacements
and ammo coming up. Over.

362
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:32,986
Roger. Make sure
they have the new password.

363
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:35,427
Challenge: "Wind." Answer: "Talkers."

364
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:38,898
That's what one of our Navajo brothers
calls us. What do you think? Over.

365
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:45,736
"Windtalkers," I like it. OK, Kemo Sabe,
keep your butts down tonight. Over.

366
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,237
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?

367
00:49:50,678 --> 00:49:54,136
You are a whiny son of a bitch
right now, aren't you?

368
00:49:56,317 --> 00:50:00,515
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does
that make it on the East Coast?

369
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:03,154
How the fucking hell should I know?

370
00:50:03,925 --> 00:50:05,916
Just seven...

371
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:09,186
It's 8am, Sunday morning.

372
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:12,698
I hope my side of the bed
didn't get taken up Saturday night.

373
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:16,895
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer,
you keep worrying about her.

374
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:19,132
Might get my ass
sent back to Rhody, though.

375
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:23,576
There's plenty of dollies outside
of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty.

376
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,876
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.
- Ain't that the truth.

377
00:50:26,948 --> 00:50:32,079
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.

378
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:34,951
This one time, before the war,

379
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:41,986
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little
thing named Molly comes out the water.

380
00:50:42,597 --> 00:50:45,964
She walks straight up to me
and asks me if I'm hungry...

381
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:49,001
cos she's havin' a weenie roast.

382
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,970
Shit! Damn.

383
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:53,536
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.

384
00:50:58,546 --> 00:51:01,913
Now I'm on Saipan with this
giant Zippo strapped to my back

385
00:51:01,983 --> 00:51:04,247
and I'm roastin' human beings.

386
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:14,184
Why I volunteered... beyond me.

387
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:18,789
Damn, I'm proud to be here.

388
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:21,300
My whole family's been in the Corps.

389
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,229
My old man, he's a lifer.

390
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,235
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.

391
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:29,733
Around the house too.

392
00:51:34,248 --> 00:51:36,512
Maybe now he'll back off.

393
00:51:43,891 --> 00:51:45,882
Pappas, I...

394
00:51:47,428 --> 00:51:49,555
I want you to do me a favor.

395
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:54,096
If anything should happen to me,

396
00:51:54,168 --> 00:51:56,966
you make sure that my wife gets this.

397
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,100
I mean, she picked them out and all.

398
00:52:02,477 --> 00:52:04,536
Don't talk like that, Nell.

399
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:08,441
You don't even joke about shit like that.

400
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,383
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.

401
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:09,472
Hey.

402
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,838
Don't thank me till you've tried it.

403
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:14,573
You missed mail call.

404
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,016
What the hell are they doin'?

405
00:53:27,825 --> 00:53:30,623
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.

406
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:39,566
Sounds like some kind of prayer.

407
00:53:46,944 --> 00:53:49,174
Maybe they know our orders.

408
00:54:03,928 --> 00:54:05,862
Think you could do it, Joe?

409
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,023
Give it a rest, Henderson.

410
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,860
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...

411
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,463
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.

412
00:54:21,045 --> 00:54:23,570
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...

413
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:27,075
You will make your family proud.

414
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:19,129
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?

415
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:21,501
Getting on my uniform.

416
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:25,269
You know the difference
between you and a Jap, Yahzee?

417
00:55:28,012 --> 00:55:30,003
It's that uniform.

418
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,572
That's it.

419
00:55:34,118 --> 00:55:35,983
See, I know you people.

420
00:55:36,387 --> 00:55:40,016
I know what kind
of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.

421
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:43,087
You ought to be careful out here all alone.

422
00:55:43,828 --> 00:55:45,819
No baby-sitter.

423
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,321
I might just take you for a Jap.

424
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:51,765
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?

425
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:55,033
Or keep demonstrating
what an ignorant fool you are?

426
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,376
How's that for an ignorant fool?

427
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:22,223
Go ahead, try again.

428
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,972
You gonna do somethin'?

429
00:56:57,635 --> 00:56:59,159
Chick! Come on!

430
00:56:59,236 --> 00:57:01,227
Get off me!

431
00:57:20,758 --> 00:57:23,352
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.

432
00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:25,759
Ben? Shit.

433
00:57:28,232 --> 00:57:32,999
I thought he was a Jap. You know,
killed some marine for that uniform.

434
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:36,639
Sure you did, Chick.

435
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:39,840
Damn Injun looks just like
a Jap, don't he?

436
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,901
Look, I'm no damn Injun.

437
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:47,483
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,
born for the Towering House clan.

438
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:53,248
But you do look like a Nip.

439
00:57:53,324 --> 00:57:58,284
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.

440
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,157
Fuckin' shitbird.

441
00:58:05,302 --> 00:58:07,998
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter
all the time, I thought.

442
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:09,972
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.

443
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:16,804
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.

444
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:23,711
Navajo believe, until a body's given
a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.

445
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:28,648
Chindis - that's what
we call evil spirits. Demons.

446
00:58:31,362 --> 00:58:34,388
I haven't thought much about it
since I was a kid.

447
00:58:34,465 --> 00:58:36,899
Till I saw those dead bodies.

448
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:39,527
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?

449
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:42,115
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.

450
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:42,479
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.

451
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:45,575
Because your buddy
smeared ash on your forehead?

452
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:49,952
That's right. Cos my buddy
smeared ash on my forehead.

453
00:58:57,631 --> 00:58:59,792
You ever see ghosts?

454
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:08,439
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.

455
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:42,014
Sounds beautiful.

456
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:44,717
You, uh, you self-taught?

457
00:59:45,495 --> 00:59:47,690
My dad was always playing.

458
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:51,795
You know what they say:
if you can't beat 'em...

459
00:59:51,868 --> 00:59:57,135
No shit. My dad, he...
he gave me this thing.

460
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,969
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.

461
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:04,946
Used to bring 'em in for feeding
with this little tune I played.

462
01:00:05,982 --> 01:00:09,145
I know I ain't gonna get you
to quit playin' that thing, so...

463
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:11,585
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...

464
01:00:11,921 --> 01:00:14,219
I don't think it's gonna work.

465
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:18,890
Well, we ain't got much else
to do out here. What the hell?

466
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,759
OK.

467
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:25,265
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.

468
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:07,006
2nd Recon Company will move out
at 0600 and scout along road 04.

469
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:10,706
You can expect light resistance
northwest of the palm grove. Over.

470
01:01:11,648 --> 01:01:15,880
Roger. What do you mean, light?
No resistance is light! Over.

471
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:20,050
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to
question why, ours is but to do or die."

472
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:21,784
Semper Fi. Over.

473
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:36,429
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?

474
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:41,969
Or, given that you're not much of a
writer, should I not expect an answer?

475
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:44,980
The newspapers say
our boys are doing great.

476
01:01:45,048 --> 01:01:49,542
But I don't think the reporters
have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.

477
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:53,715
I found a stray dog
the other day on Waikiki.

478
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,520
I gave him a bath and took him in.

479
01:01:56,593 --> 01:02:00,120
He reminded me of you - but cuter.

480
01:02:01,965 --> 01:02:04,661
At least he keeps me warm at night.

481
01:02:05,802 --> 01:02:10,466
I try not to think about you. About
what might be happening over there.

482
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:13,471
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,

483
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:16,910
I can't keep myself
from wondering where you are.

484
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,971
How you're doing.

485
01:02:29,425 --> 01:02:31,450
What the hell you doin'?

486
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:34,529
Writing a letter to my son.

487
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:37,191
Forget your orders? No letters out.

488
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:41,031
Command don't want postmarks
going to the reservation.

489
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:47,642
Hey! You hear me?

490
01:02:53,249 --> 01:02:56,616
I thought that he might read 'em
when I get home.

491
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:04,418
What's his name?

492
01:03:04,494 --> 01:03:06,428
Your son.

493
01:03:06,796 --> 01:03:09,993
It's George. George Washington.

494
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:13,597
George Washington Yahzee.

495
01:03:15,705 --> 01:03:17,900
It's got a bit of a ring to it.

496
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,343
My wife wasn't so sure.

497
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:24,279
She's a little more traditional.

498
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:29,541
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.

499
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:34,283
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.

500
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:39,954
Can I try one of those?

501
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,631
- You smoke?
- Not really.

502
01:04:22,472 --> 01:04:24,940
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!

503
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:28,033
Let's go! Let's go!

504
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:30,613
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

505
01:04:39,055 --> 01:04:41,546
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!

506
01:04:43,026 --> 01:04:44,653
Yahzee!

507
01:04:46,129 --> 01:04:47,721
I'm hit!

508
01:04:47,797 --> 01:04:50,061
Take it off! It burns!

509
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,995
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit.

510
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,392
- Spread out!
- Move!

511
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:30,279
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.

512
01:05:30,413 --> 01:05:32,313
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.

513
01:05:33,449 --> 01:05:36,907
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.

514
01:05:36,986 --> 01:05:38,851
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!

515
01:05:38,921 --> 01:05:43,324
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.

516
01:05:46,229 --> 01:05:49,062
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.

517
01:05:49,131 --> 01:05:50,758
Do somethin'.

518
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,324
Shit... Follow me!

519
01:05:53,402 --> 01:05:56,132
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!

520
01:06:18,194 --> 01:06:19,718
God.

521
01:06:42,418 --> 01:06:44,113
Son of a bitch!

522
01:07:05,908 --> 01:07:07,967
I got you, mac!

523
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:14,746
Corpsman!

524
01:07:15,418 --> 01:07:18,216
Corpsman!

525
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:25,685
Corpsman!

526
01:07:27,229 --> 01:07:29,220
Nellie!

527
01:07:33,002 --> 01:07:34,993
Corpsman!

528
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,597
You were right, Joe.

529
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,133
I do look like a Nip.

530
01:08:09,205 --> 01:08:11,298
What the hell are you talking about?

531
01:08:11,374 --> 01:08:15,811
Putting on that Jap uniform. Trying to get
one of their radios, call off our guns.

532
01:08:15,878 --> 01:08:18,642
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.

533
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:21,842
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.

534
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:24,477
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!
