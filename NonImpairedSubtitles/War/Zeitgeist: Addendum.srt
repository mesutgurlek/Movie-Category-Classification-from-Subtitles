<i>It is no measure of health to be well adjusted 
to a profoundly sick society. - J. Krishnamurti</i>

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Society today,

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
is composed of a series of institutions.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
From political institutions,

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
legal institutions,

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
religious institutions.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
To institutions of social class,

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
familiar values,

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and occupational specialization.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It is obvious, the profound influence
these traditionalized structures have

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
in shaping our understandings and perspectives.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yet, of all the social institutions, we are born into,

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
directed by, and conditioned upon..

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There seems to be no system as taken for granted,

49
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,001
and misunderstood,

50
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,002
as the monetary system.

51
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,203
Taking on nearly religious proportions,

52
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,604
the established monetary institution exists

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
as one of the most unquestioned forms of faith there is.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How money is created,

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the policies by which it is governed,

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and how it truly affects society,

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
are unregistered interests of
the great majority of the population.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In a world where 1% of the population
owns 40% of the planets wealth.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
In a world where 34.000 children die every single day

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
from poverty and preventable diseases,

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and, where 50% of the world's population
lives on less than 2 dollars a day...

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
One thing is clear.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Something is very wrong.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And, whether we are aware of it or not,

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
the lifeblood of all of our established institutions,

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and thus society itself,

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
is money.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Therefore, understanding this
institution of monetary policy

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
is critical to understanding why
our lives are the way they are.

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Unfortunately, economics is often
viewed with confusion and boredom

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Endless streams of financial jargon,
coupled with intimidating mathematics,

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
quickly deters people from attempts at understanding it.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
However, the fact is:

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The complexity associated with the
financial system is a mere mask.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Designed to conceal one of the
most socially paralyzing structures,

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
humanity has ever endured.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
None are more hopelessly enslaved than
those who falsely believe they are free.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe-  1749-1832

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A number of years ago, the central bank
of the United States, the Federal Reserve,

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
produced a document entitled
"Modern Money Mechanics".

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This publication detailed the
institutionalized practice of money creation

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
as utilized by the federal reserve and the
web of global commercial banks it supports.

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
On the opening page the document states its objective.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The purpose of this booklet is to describe
the basic process of money creation

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
in a fractional reserve banking system.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It then precedes to describe this fractional reserve process

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
through various banking terminology.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A translation of which goes something like this.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The united states government decides it needs some money.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it calls up the federal reserve
and requests say 10 billion dollars.

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The FED replies saying: "sure, we'll buy ten
billion in government bonds from you".

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So the government takes some pieces of paper,

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
paints some official looking designs on them,

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and calls them treasury bonds.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then it puts a value on these bonds
to the sum of 10 billion dollars

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and sends them over to the FED.

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In turn the people of the FED drop a bunch
of impressive pieces of papers themselves.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Only this time, calling them federal reserve notes.

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Also designating a value of ten billion dollars to the set

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The FED than takes these notes and
trades them for the bonds.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Once this exchange is complete,

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the government than takes the
ten billion in federal reserve notes,

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and deposits it into an bank account.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And, upon this deposit the paper notes
officially become legal tender money.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Adding ten billion to the US money supply.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And there it is!
Ten billion in new money has been created.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course, this example is a generalization.

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
For, in reality, this transaction would occur electronically.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
With no paper used at all.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
In fact, only three percent of US
money supply exists in physical currency.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The other 97 percent essentially exists in computers alone.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now, government bonds are
by design instruments of debt.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And when the FED purchases these bonds

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
with money it essentially created out of thin air,

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the government is actually promising to pay back

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that money to the FED.

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In other words, the money was created out of debt.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This mind numbing paradox,
of how money or value

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
can be created out of debt,

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
or a liability, will become more clear

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
as we further this exercise.

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So, the exchange has been made.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And now, ten billion dollars sits
in a commercial bank account.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Here is where it gets really interesting.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
For, as based on the fractional reserve practice,

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that ten billion dollar deposit

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
instantly becomes part of the banks reserves.

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just as all deposits do.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And, regarding reserve requirements

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
as stated in " Modern Money Mechanics":

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
"A bank must maintain legally required reserves

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
equal to a prescribed percentage of its deposits".

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It then quantifies this by stating:

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
"Under current regulations,

135
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,001
the reserve requirement against most
transaction accounts is ten percent”.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This means that with a ten billion dollar deposit,

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
ten percent, or one billion,

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
is held as the required reserve.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
While the other nine billion is
considered an excessive reserve,

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and can be used as the basis

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
for new loans.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Now, it is logical to assume, that this nine billion

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is literally coming out of the
existing ten billion dollar deposit.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
However, this is actually not the case.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What really happens, is that the nine billion

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
is simply created out of thin air

147
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
on top of the existing 10 billion dollar deposit.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This is how the money supply is expanded.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
As stated in "Modern Money Mechanics":

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
"Of course they" the banks,

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
"do not really pay out loans for the money, they receive as deposits.

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If they did this, no additional money would be created.

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What they do when they make loans

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
is to accept promissory notes

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
- loan contracts

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
in exchange for credits - money

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to the borrowers transaction accounts.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In other words, the nine billion
can be created out of nothing.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Simply because there is a demand for such a loan,

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and that there is a 10 billion dollar
deposit to satisfy the reserve requirements.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now let's assume that somebody
walks into this bank and

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
borrows the newly available nine billion dollars.

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They will then most likely
take that money and deposit it

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
into their own bank account.

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The process then repeats.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
For that deposit becomes part of the banks reserves.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Ten percent is isolated and in
turn 90 percent of the nine billion,

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
or 8.1 billion is now availlable as
newly created money for more loans.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And, of course, that 8.1 can be loaned out
and redeposited creating an additional 7.2 billion

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
to 6.5 billion... to 5.9 billion... etc...

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This deposit money creation loan
cycle can technically go on to infinity.

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The average mathematical result is that about 90 billion
dollars can be created on top of the original 10 billion.

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In other words:

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
For every deposit that ever occurs in the banking system,
about nine times that amount can be created out of thin air.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Money-Jitters. Ask the obliging Bank of America for a jar of

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
soothing instant money.

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
M-O-N-E-Y in the form of a convenient personal loan.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So, now that we understand how money is
created by this fractional reserve banking system.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A logical yet illusive question might come to mind:

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What is actually giving this newly created money value?

181
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The answer: the money that already exists.

182
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The new money essentially steals
value from the existing money supply.

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For the total pool of money is being increased
irrespective to demand for goods and services.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And, as supply and demand defines equilibrium,

185
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
prices rise, diminishing the purchasing
power of each individual dollar.

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is generally referred to as inflation.

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And inflation is essentially a hidden tax on the public.

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What is the advice that you generally get?
That is, inflate the currency.

189
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They don't say: debase the currency.
They don't say: devalue the currency.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
They don't say: Cheat the people who are safe,
they say lower the interest rates.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The real deception is when
we distort the value of money.

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
When we create money out of thin air,
we have no savings. Yet there is so called "capital".

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So, my question boils down to this: How in the
world can we expect to solve the problems of inflation.

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That is: increase in the supply of money, with more inflation.

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Of course it can't.

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The fractional reserve system of
monetary expansion is inherently inflationary.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
For the act of expanding the money
supply, without there being a

198
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
proportional expansion of goods and services in the economy,

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
will always debase a currency.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
In fact, the quick glance of the
historical values of the US dollar,

201
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
versus the money supply,

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
reflects this point of definitively.

203
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
For inverse relationship is obvious.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
One dollar in 1913 required $21.60 in 2007 to match value.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That is a 96 percent devaluation since
the Federal Reserve came into existence.

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Now, if this reality of inherent and perpetual
inflation seems absurd and economically self defeating.

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Hold that thought. For absurdity is an understatement
in regard to how our financial system really operates.

208
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
For in our financial system money is debt,

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and debt is money.

210
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Here is a chart of the US money supply from 1950 to 2006.

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Here is a chart to the US national debt for the same period.

212
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
How interesting it is, that the
trends, are virtually the same.

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
For the more money there is the more debt there is.

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The more debt there is the more money there is.

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
To put it a different way.
Every single dollar in your wallet

216
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
is owed to somebody by somebody.

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
For remember: the only way the money
can come in to existence is from loans.

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Therefore, if everyone in the country were
able to pay off all debts including the government,

219
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
there would not be one dollar in circulation.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,800
"If there were no debts in our money
system, there wouldn't be any money."

221
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:44,801
Marriner Eccies - Governor of the Federal Reserve
September 30th, 1941

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In fact, the last time in American history
the national debt was completely paid off

223
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
was in 1835 after president Andrew Jackson shut
down the central bank that preceded the Federal Reserve.

224
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In fact, Jackson's entire political
platform essentially revolved

225
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
around his commitment to shut down the central bank.

226
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Stating that one point:

227
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
"The bold efforts the present bank
has made to control the government...

228
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
are but premonitions of the fate
that awaits the American people

229
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
should they be deluded into
a perpetuation of this institution

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
or, the establishment of another like it."

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Unfortunately this message was short lived.

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And the international bankers succeeded
to install another central bank in 1913,

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the Federal Reserve. And as long as this institution exists

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
perpetual debt is guaranteed.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Now, so far we have discussed the reality
that money is created out of debt through loans.

236
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
These loans are based on a banks reserves,

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and reserves are derived from deposits.
And through this fractional reserve system,

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
any one deposit can create 9 times its original value.

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
In turn, debasing the existing
money supply raising prices in society.

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And, since all this money is created out of debt,

241
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and circulated randomly through commerce,

242
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
people become detached from their original debt.

243
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And a disequilibrium exists where
people are forced to compete for labor

244
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
in order to pull enough money out of the money supply

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to cover their costs of living.

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
As dysfunctional and backwards
as all of this might seem,

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
there is still one thing we
have omitted from this equation.

248
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And it is this element of the structure

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
which reveals the truly fraudulent
nature of the system itself.

250
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The application of interest.

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
When the government borrows money from the FED,

252
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
or when a person borrows money from a bank,

253
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
it almost always has to be payed
back with a crude interest.

254
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
In other words,

255
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
almost every single dollar that exists

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
must be eventually returned to a
bank with interest payed as well.

257
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But,

258
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
if all money is borrowed from the Central Bank,

259
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and is expanded by commercial banks through loans,

260
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
only what would be refered to as the "principal"

261
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
is been created in the money supply.

262
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So then, where is the money to cover
all of the interest that is charged?

263
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Nowhere.

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It doesn't exist.

265
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The ramifications of this are staggering.

266
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
For the amount of money owed back to the banks

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
will always exceed the amount of
money that is available in circulation.

268
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This is why inflation is a constant in the economy.

269
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
For new money is always needed to help
cover the perpetual deficit build in to the system.

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Caused by the need to pay the interest.

271
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What this also means, is that
mathematically the defaults and bankruptcy

272
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
are literally built into the system.

273
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And there will always be poor pockets of
society that get the short end of the stick.

274
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
An analogy would be a game of musical chairs:

275
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
For the once music stops, somebody is left out to dry.

276
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And that is the point.

277
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It invariably transfers true wealth
for the individual to the banks.

278
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
For, if you are unable to pay for your
mortgage, they will take your property.

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is particularly enraging when you realize,
that not only is such a default inevitable

280
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
due to the fractional reserve
practice. But, also because of the fact

281
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
that the money that the bank loaned to you

282
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
didn't even legally exist in the first place.

283
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
In 1969 there was a Minnesota court
case involving a man named Jerome Daly

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
who was challenging the foreclosure of his home
by the bank, which provided the loan to purchase it.

285
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
His argument was that the mortgage
contract required both parties,

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
being he and the bank, each put up a
legitimate form of property for the exchange.

287
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
In legal language this is called

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
cosideration [a contract's basis.
a contract is founded on an exchange
of one form of consideration for another.]

289
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Mr. Daly explained that the money
was, in fact, not the property of the bank.

290
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
For it was created out of nothing as
soon as the loan agreement was signed.

291
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Remember what "Modern Money Mechanics"
stated about loans?

292
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What they do, when they make loans, is to
accept promissory notes in exchange for credits.

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Reserves are unchanged by the loan transactions.

294
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But, deposit credits constitute new additions
to the total deposits of the banking system.

295
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
In other words, the money doesn't
come out of their existing assets.

296
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The bank is simply inventing it,
putting up nothing of it's own,

297
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
except for a theoratical liability on paper.

298
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
As the court case progressed, the bank's
president Mr. Morgan took the stand.

299
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And in the judge's personal memorandum,
he recalled that the Plaintiff - banks president -

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
admitted that, in combination with the
Federal Reserve Bank, did create the money

301
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and credits upon its books by bookkeeping entry.

302
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The money and credit first came into existence
when they created it. Mr. Morgan admitted that

303
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
no United States Law or Statute existed
which gave him the right to do this.

304
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
A lawful consideration must exist
and be tendered to support the Note.

305
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The Jury found that there was
no lawful consideration, and I agree.

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He also poetically added, "Only God can
create something of value out of nothing".

307
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And, upon this revelation the court rejected the
bank's claim for foreclosure, and Daly kept his home.

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The implications of this court decision are immense.

309
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
For every time you borrow money from a bank,
whether it is a mortgage loan or a credit card charge,

310
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
the money given to you is not only counterfeit,
it is a illegitimate form of consideration.

311
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And hence, voids the contract to repay. For the
bank never had the money as property to begin with.

312
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Unfortunately such legal realizations
are suppressed and ignored.

313
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And the game of perpetual wealth
transfer and perpetual debt continues.

314
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And this brings us to the ultimate question:

315
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Why?

316
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
During the American Civil War President
Lincoln bypassed the high interest loans

317
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
offered by the European banks, and decided
to do what the founding fathers advocated.

318
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Which was to create an independent
and inherently debt-free currency.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It was called "The Greenback".

320
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Shortly after this measure was taken, an internal document

321
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
circulated between private British
and American banking interests, stated:

322
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
"Slavery is but the owning of labor and
carries with it the care of the laborers,

323
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
while the European plan..is that capital
shall control labor by controlling wages."

324
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This can be done by controlling the money.

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It will not do to allow the Greenback...
as we cannot control that.

326
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The fractional reserve policy,

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
perpetrated by the Federal Reserve

328
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
which has spread in practice to the
great majority of banks in the world,

329
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
is in fact a system of modern slavery.

330
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Think about it, money is created out of debt.

331
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What the people do when they are in debt?

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
They submit to employment to pay it off.

333
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But if money only can only be created out of loans,

334
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
how can society ever be debt free?

335
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It cant, and that's the point.

336
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And it is the fear of losing assets,
coupled with the struggle to keep up,

337
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
with the perpetual debt and
inflation inherent in the system

338
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
compounded by the inescapable scarcity,
within in the money supply itself,

339
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
created by the interest that can never be re-payed.

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
that keeps the wage-slave in line

341
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Running on a hamster wheel, with millions of others.

342
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
In effect, powering an empire

343
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
that truly benefits only the
elite at the top of the pyramid.

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
For, at the end of the day,

345
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
who are you really working for?

346
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The Banks !

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Money is created in the bank,
and invariably ends up in a bank.

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They are the true masters, along with the
corporations and governments they support.

349
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Physical slavery requires
people to be housed and fed.

350
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Economic slavery requires people
to feed and house themselves.

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It is one of the most ingenious scams
for social manipulation ever created.

352
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And at its core,

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
it is an invisible war against the population.

354
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Debt is the weapon used to conquer and enslave societies,

355
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and interest is its prime ammunition.

356
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And, as the majority walks
around oblivious to this reality,

357
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the banks in collusion with
governments and corporations

358
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
continued to perfect and expand
their tactics of economic warfare

359
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Spawning new bases,

360
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
such as the World Bank

361
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and International Monetary Fund [IMF],

362
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
while also inventing a new type of soldier.

363
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The birth of the economic hitman.

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,300
There are two ways to conquer and enslave
a nation. One is by sword. The other is by debt.

365
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:14,301
There are two ways to conquer and enslave
a nation. One is by sword. The other is by debt.
John Adams - 1735-1826

366
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We economic hitmen really have been the ones
responsible for creating this first truly global empire.

367
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And we work many different ways.

368
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But, perhaps the most common is that we will
identify a country that has resources, like oil.

369
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And then, arrange a huge loan to that country
from the World Bank or one of it's sister organizations.

370
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,100
But the money never actually goes to that country.

371
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:45,801
Instead it goes to our big corporations to
build infrastructure projects in that country.

372
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Power plants, Industrial parks, Ports...

373
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Things that benefit a few rich people in that country.

374
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In addition our Corporations.

375
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But really dont have the majority to
people that all. How ever, those people

376
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
the whole country is left holding the huge debt.

377
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's such a big debt they can't repay,
and that's the part of the plan...

378
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
They can't repay it !

379
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And so, in some point, we economic hitman,
go back to them and say "Listen"

380
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
"You lost a lot of Money. Can't pay your Debt. So..."

381
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
"Sell your oil "

382
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
"Real cheap to our oil companies"

383
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
"Allow us to build a Military Base in your Country..."

384
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
"Send troops and support one of our's,
to some place in the world like..."

385
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
"Iraq or vote with us on the next U.N."

386
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Vote, to have their electric
utility company privatized

387
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and their water and sewing system
privatized and sold to US corporations or other

388
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
multinational corporations.

389
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So there is a whole mushrooming thing, and it's
so typical, the way the IMF and the World Bank work.

390
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
They put a country in debt, and it's
such a big debt they can't repay it!

391
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And then they offer to refinance that
debt, and pay them more interest

392
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And you demand...

393
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
this "quid pro quo" what you call
a conditionality or good governance

394
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
which means basically, that they
got to sell off their resources,

395
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
including many of their social
services, their utility companies..

396
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
their school systems sometimes,

397
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
their penal systems,

398
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
their insurance systems... to foreign corporations.

399
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So it's a double - triple - quadruple whammie!

400
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The preceptive for a Economic Hitman
really began back in the early 50's

401
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
when democratically elected "Mossadegh"

402
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
who was elected in Iran...

403
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He was considered to be "The hope for Democracy"

404
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
in the middle east or around the world. He
was in Time-Magazine's man of the year. But...

405
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
one of the things that he brought on
and end the implement was the idea that

406
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
foreign oil companies needed to pay the Iranian people
a lot more for the oil, that they were taking out of Iran

407
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and the Iranian people should benefit
from their own oil. - Strange policy -

408
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
we didn't like that of course, but we were afraid to do
what we normally were doing, which was to send in the military

409
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
instead we sent in one CIA agent, Kermit
Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt´s relative.

410
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,500
And Kermit went in with a few million
dollars, and was very very effective

411
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:09,001
and efficient and in a short amount of time,
he managed to get Mossadeg overthrown,

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,200
and brought in the Shah of Iran to replace
them, who always was favorable to oil,

413
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,301
and it was extremely effective.

414
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:16,802
Revolt in Iran

415
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
<i>Mobs over through Tehran.</i>

416
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
<i>Army officers shout that Mossadeg has surrendered
and his regime as virtual dictator of Iran has ended.</i>

417
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
<i>Pictures of the Shah are paraded through
the streets as sentiment reverses.</i>

418
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
<i>The Shah is welcomed home.</i>

419
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So back here in the United States, in Washington, people
looked around and said "wow, that was easy and cheap".

420
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So this established the whole new way,
of manipulating countries, of creating empire

421
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the only problem with Roosevelt was
that he was a card carrying CIA agent

422
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and if he'd been caught, the ratifications could have been pretty
serious, so very quickly at that point, the decision was made,

423
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
to use private consultants to channel the money through
the world bank or the IMF or one of the other such agencies

424
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
to bring in people like me, who work for private companies

425
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
so that if we got caught, it would
be no govermental ramifications.

426
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
when Arbenz became president of Guatemala, the country
was very much under the thumbs of United Fruit company

427
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The big international cooperations and Arbenz ran on this
ticket that said: "We want to give the land back to the people".

428
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And once he took power he was implementing
policies that would do exactly that

429
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
give the land rights back to the people.

430
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
"United Fruit" didn't like that very much,

431
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and so they hired a public relations firm

432
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
watch the huge campaign in the United States

433
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
to convince the United States, the people...the citizens
of the United States, the press of the United States

434
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and the congress of the United States,
that Arbenz was a soviet puppet.

435
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And that if we allowed him to stay in power the
Soviets would have a foot hole in this hemisphere.

436
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And at that point in time there was a huge fear on
everybody's mind, of the Red terror, the Communist terror.

437
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And so, to make a long story short,
out of this public relations campaign

438
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
came a commitment on the part of the
CIA and the military to take this man out.

439
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And in fact, we did! We sent in planes,
we sent in soldiers, we sent in jackals,

440
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we sent everything in to take him out.
And did take him out

441
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and as soon as he was removed from office,

442
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the new guy, that took over after him basically
reinstated everything to the big international corporations.

443
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Including United Fruit.

444
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Ecuador, for many many years had
been ruled by Pro-US-Dictators

445
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
they often relatively brutal. Then it was
decided to have a truely democratic ellection.

446
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Jaime Roldos ran for offence and his
main goal , he said, as president would be...

447
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
... to make sure that Ecuador's
resources were used to help the people.

448
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And he won! Overwhelming.

449
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
By more votes than anybody had
ever won anything in Ecuador.

450
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And he began to implement these policies.

451
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
To make sure that the profits
from Oil whant to help the people.

452
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Well... We didn't like that in the United States.

453
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I was send down as one of several
Economic Hitman to change Roldos.

454
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
To corrupt him. To bring him around...
to let him know... you know.

455
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
"OK, You can get very rich, if you
and your family play our game."

456
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
"But if you continue to try to keep these
policys you promised... ah... You gonna go!"

457
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
He wouldn't listen...

458
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He was assassinated.

459
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,201
As soon as the plane crashed,
the whole area was cordoned off.

460
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:47,002
The only people allowed in were
US military from a nearby base,

461
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:48,903
and some of the Ecuadorian military.

462
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:51,504
When an investigation was launched,

463
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:56,905
two of the key witnesses died in car accidents
before they had a chance to testify.

464
00:31:57,106 --> 00:32:02,106
A lot of very very strange things that went on
around the assassination of Jaime Roldos.

465
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:08,707
I like most people who’ve really looked at this case
have absolutely no doubt that it was an assassination.

466
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:13,708
And of course in my position as an economic hitman
I was obviously expecting something to happen to Jaime,

467
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:15,909
whether it be a coup or assassination I wasn’t sure,

468
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,510
but that he would be taken down
because he was was not being corrupted,

469
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:22,611
he would not allow himself to be corrupted
the way we wanted to corrupt him.

470
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,812
Omar Torrijos, president of Panama was,
you know, one of my favorite people.

471
00:32:31,913 --> 00:32:36,813
I really, really liked him. He was very charismatic.
He was a guy who really wanted to help his country.

472
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:42,189
And when I tried to bribe him or corrupt
him he said ‘Look John…’He called my Juanito.

473
00:32:42,215 --> 00:32:45,315
Look Juanito, I don’t need the money.

474
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:50,016
What I really need is for my country to be treated fairly.

475
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:55,717
I need for the United States to repay the debts that
you owe my people for all the destruction you’ve done here.

476
00:32:55,918 --> 00:33:00,918
I need to be in a position where I can help other
Latin American countries win their independence,

477
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:07,719
and be free of this terrible presence from
the north. You people are exploiting us so badly.

478
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,620
I need to have the Panama canal back
in the hands of the Panamanian people.

479
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:18,221
That’s what I want. And so,
leave me alone, don’t try to bribe me.

480
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:24,122
It was 1981 and in May,
Jaime Roldos was assassinated.

481
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,623
And Omar was very aware of this.

482
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:30,724
Torrijos got his family together
and said ‘I’m probably next,

483
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:36,125
but it’s Okay because I’ve
done what I came here to do.

484
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:39,726
I’ve renegotiated the canal.
The canal will now be in our hands.

485
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,427
He’d just finished negotiating the
treaty with Jimmy Carter.

486
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:48,628
In June of that same year, just a couple of months later,

487
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:52,129
he also went down in an airplane crash.

488
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,430
Which there is no question, was
executed by CIA sponsored jackals.

489
00:33:56,531 --> 00:34:01,331
A tremendous amount of evidence
that one of Torijjos’ security guards

490
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:05,232
handed him at the last moment as he
was getting on the plane a tape recorder.

491
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,533
A small tape recorder that contained a bomb.

492
00:34:15,134 --> 00:34:20,934
It is interesting to me how this system has continued
pretty much the same way for years and years and years,

493
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:23,635
except the economic hit men have
gotten better and better and better.

494
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:28,536
Then we come up with very recently
what happened in Venezuela.

495
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:32,137
In 1998, Hugo Chavez gets elected president,

496
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:38,638
following a long line of presidents group been very
corrupt and basically destroyed the economy of the country.

497
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:43,539
And Chavez was elected amidst all that.
Chavez stood up to the United States,

498
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:51,340
and he’d done it primarily by demanding that
Venezuelan oil be used to help the Venezuelan people.

499
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,641
Well… we didn’t like that in the United States.

500
00:34:55,442 --> 00:35:00,442
So in 2002, a coup was staged which
was no question in my mind,

501
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:03,443
in most other peoples minds,
that the CIA was behind that coup.

502
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:14,044
The way that that coup was fomented was very
reflective of what Kermit Roosevelt had done in Iran.

503
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:20,845
Of paying people to go out into the streets, to riot,
to protest, to say that Chavez was very unpopular.

504
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,146
You know, if you can get a few
thousand people to do that,

505
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:30,847
Television can make it look like it’s the
whole country and things start to mushroom.

506
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:39,648
Except in the case of Chavez, he was smart enough and
the people were so strongly behind him that they overcame it.

507
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:44,349
Which was a phenomenal moment
in the history of Latin America.

508
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,950
Iraq actually is a perfect example of
the way the whole system works.

509
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,851
We economic hitmen are the first line of defense.

510
00:35:56,952 --> 00:36:03,052
We go in, we try to corrupt governments and get them to try
to accept these huge loans which we then use as leverage,

511
00:36:03,153 --> 00:36:04,653
to basically own them.

512
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:09,254
If we fail, as I failed in Panama with Omar Torrijos,

513
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:13,555
and Ecuador with Jaime Roldos,
men who refused to be corrupted,

514
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:16,356
then the second line of defense is we send in the jackals.

515
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:19,557
And the jackals either overthrow
governments or they assassinate.

516
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,958
And once that happens then a
new government comes in and boy

517
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:27,059
it’s gonna toe the line because the new
president knows what will happen if he doesn’t.

518
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,060
In the case of Iraq, both of those things failed.

519
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:34,161
The economic hitmen were not able
to get through to Saddam Hussein.

520
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:35,362
We tried very hard.

521
00:36:35,363 --> 00:36:40,163
We tried to get him to accept a deal very similar to
what the House of Saud had accepted in Saudi Arabia,

522
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,764
but he wouldn’t accept it.

523
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:45,265
And so the jackals went in to take him out.
They couldn’t do it.

524
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,766
His security was very good.

525
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:50,067
After all, he at one time had worked for the CIA.

526
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:54,168
He’d been hired to assassinate the
former president of Iraq, and failed,

527
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,669
but he knew the system.

528
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,570
So in ‘91 we send in the troops and
we take out the Iraqi military.

529
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:06,071
So we assume at that point that Saddam Hussein is gonna come around.

530
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:07,972
We could have taken him out, of course,

531
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:08,973
at that time, but we didn’t want to.

532
00:37:08,974 --> 00:37:12,174
He’s the kind of strong man we like.

533
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:13,675
He controls his people.

534
00:37:13,676 --> 00:37:15,476
We thought he could control the Kurds,

535
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:18,177
keep the Iranians in their border,
and keep pumping oil for us.

536
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:21,378
And that once we took out his military,
now he’s gonna come around.

537
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:25,779
So the economic hitmen go back in
in the 90’s without success.

538
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,880
If they’d had success he’d
still be running the country.

539
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,681
We’d be selling him all the fighter jets he wants,

540
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:35,382
and everything else he wants,
but they couldn’t, they didn’t have success.

541
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:39,383
The jackals couldn’t take him out again,
so we sent the military in once again and

542
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:41,884
this time we did the complete job and took him out.

543
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:47,485
And in the process created for ourselves
some very very lucrative construction deals…

544
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:50,486
had to reconstruct a country that
we’d essentially just destroyed.

545
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:52,487
Which is a pretty good deal if you
own a construction companies, big ones.

546
00:37:55,388 --> 00:38:00,788
So Iraq shows the three stages.
The economic hitmen failed there.

547
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:06,889
The jackals failed there. And as a
final measure the military goes in.

548
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,090
And in that way we’ve really created an empire,

549
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:14,091
but we’ve done it very very subtly.
It’s clandestine.

550
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,992
All empires of the past were built on the military,
and everybody knew they were building them.

551
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:21,493
The British knew they were building them, the French, the Germans,

552
00:38:21,494 --> 00:38:25,294
the Romans, the Greeks… and they were proud of it.

553
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:29,895
They always had some excuse like spreading
civilization, spreading some religion,

554
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:33,296
something like that, but they knew
they were doing it. We don’t.

555
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:41,497
The majority of the people in the United States have no idea
that we’re living off the benefits of the clandestine empire.

556
00:38:41,598 --> 00:38:45,398
That today there is more slavery
in the world than ever before.

557
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,399
Then you have to ask yourself, well… if it’s an empire,

558
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
then who is the emperor?

559
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:56,001
Obviously our presidents of the
United States are not emperors.

560
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,602
An emperor is someone who is not elected,

561
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:58,703
doesn’t serve a limited term,

562
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,804
and doesn’t report to anyone, essentially.

563
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:05,305
So you can’t classify our presidents that way.

564
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:09,006
But we do have what I consider to
be the equivalent of the emperor,

565
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:11,007
and it’s what I call the Corporatocracy.

566
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:17,408
The Corporatocracy is this group of
individuals who run our biggest corporations.

567
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,709
And they really act as the emperor of this empire.

568
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:26,310
They control our media, either through
direct ownership or advertising.

569
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:31,411
They control most of our politicians
because the finance their campaigns,

570
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:35,612
either through the corporations or through personal
contributions that come out of the the corporations.

571
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:40,313
They’re not elected, then don’t serve a
limited term, they don’t report to anybody,

572
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:44,714
and at the very top of the Corporatocracy
you really can’t tell whether

573
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:48,915
the person is working for a private corporation or the
government because their always moving back and forth.

574
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:55,616
So you’ve got a guy who is one moment is the
president of a big construction company like Haliburton,

575
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:58,417
and the next moment he’s
Vice President of the United States.

576
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:00,318
Or the President who was in the oil business.

577
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:03,419
And this is true whether you get
Democrats or Republicans in the office.

578
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,020
You have this moving back and forth,
through the revolving door.

579
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:12,721
And in a way, our government
is invisible a lot of the time,

580
00:40:12,822 --> 00:40:16,772
and policies are carried out by our
corporations on one level or another.

581
00:40:16,823 --> 00:40:24,023
And then again, the policies of the government
are basically forged by the Corporatocracy,

582
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,624
and then presented to the government
and they become government policy.

583
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,525
So, there is an incredibly cozy relationship.

584
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:32,326
This isn’t a conspiracy theory type of thing.

585
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,627
These people don’t have to get
together an plot to do things.

586
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:39,228
They all basically work under one primary assumption,

587
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:49,429
and that is that they must maximize profits
regardless of the social and environmental costs.

588
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
This process of manipulation by the corporatocracy

589
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
through the use of debt, bribery
and political overthrow is called:

590
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Globalization

591
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Just as the Federal Reserve keeps
the american public in a postion

592
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
of indentured servetude, though
perpetual debt, inflation and interest

593
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
the Worldbank and IMF serve
this role on a global scale.

594
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The basic scam is simple:

595
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Put a country in debt you
divide is own in disgression

596
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
- or through corrupting
the leader of that country -

597
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
than impose "conditionalities" or
"structual adjustment policies"

598
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
often consisting of the following:

599
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Currency devaluation

600
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
When the value of a currency drops,
so does everything valued in it.

601
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
This makes indigenes resources
available to predator countries

602
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
at a fraction of their worth.

603
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Large funding cuts for social programs,

604
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
these usually include education and healthcare,

605
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
compromising the well-being and integrity
of the society leaving the public vulnerable

606
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
to exploitation.

607
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Privatization of state-owned enterprises.

608
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This means that socially important
systems can be purchased and regulated

609
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
by foreign corporations for profit.

610
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
For example in 1999 the Worldbank
insisted that the bolivian government sell

611
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,000
the public watersystem of it's third-largest
city to a subsidy of the US-corporation "Bechtel".

612
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
As soon as this occured waterbills for
the allready impoverished local residents

613
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
skyrocketed.

614
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It wasn't until after full-blown revolt by the
people that the Bechtel-contract was nullified.

615
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Then there is trade liberalization

616
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
or the opening up of the economy through
removing any restrictions on foreign trade.

617
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
This allows for a number of
abusive economic manifestations,

618
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
such as transnational corporations
bringing in their own mass-produced products

619
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
undercutting the indigenes production
and ruining local economies.

620
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
An example is Jamaica,

621
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
which after accepting loans and
conditionalities from the Worldbank

622
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
lost it's largest cash crop markets
due to competition with western imports.

623
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Today countless farmers are out of
work for they're unable to compete

624
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
with the large corporations.

625
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Another variation is the creation of numerous,
seemingly unnoticed, unregulated, inhuman

626
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
sweetshop-factorys, which take advantage
of the imposed economic hardship.

627
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Additionally, due to production-deregulation,
environmental destruction is perpetual

628
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
as a country's resources are often
exploited by the indifferent corporations

629
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
while outputting large amounts of deliberate pollution.

630
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,700
The largest environmental lawsuit
in the history of the world,

631
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:46,901
today is being brought on behalf of 30,000
Ecuadorian and Amazonian people against

632
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Texaco, which is now owned by Chevron so it's
against Chevron, but for activities conducted by Texaco.

633
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
They're estimated to be more than 18 times what
the Exxon Valdez dumped into the Coast of Alaska.

634
00:44:01,101 --> 00:44:05,201
In the case of Ecuador it wasn’t an accident.
The oil companies did it intentionally;

635
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:11,002
they knew they were doing it to save
money rather than arranging for proper disposal.

636
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Furthermore, a cursory glance at the performance record of the
World Bank reveals that the institution, which publicly claims to

637
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
help poor countries develop and alleviate poverty, has
done nothing but increase poverty and the wealth-gap.

638
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
while Corporate profits soar.

639
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,900
In 1960 the income-gap between the fifth of
the world's people and the richest countries,

640
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:37,001
versus the fifth in the poorest countries was thirty to one.

641
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
By 1998, it was seventy-four to one.

642
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,000
While global GNP rose 40% between 1970 and 1985,
those in poverty actually increased, by 17%.

643
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,000
While from 1985 to 2000, those living on
less than one dollar a day increased by 18%

644
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,700
Even the Joint Economic Committee
of the U.S. Congress admitted

645
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:09,201
that there is a mere 40% success
rate of all World Bank projects.

646
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,600
In the late 1960's, the World Bank
intervened in Ecuador with large loans.

647
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:19,001
During the next 30 years,
poverty grew from 50% to 70%.

648
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:28,700
Under or unemployment grew from 15% to 70%.
Public debt increased from 240 million to 16 billion,

649
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,000
while the share of resources allocated
to the poor went from 20% to 6%

650
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
In fact, by the year 2000, 50% of Ecuador's national
budget had to be allocated for paying its debts.

651
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It is important to understand: the World Bank is,
in fact, a U.S. bank, supporting U.S. interests.

652
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,000
For the United States holds veto-power over
decisions, as it is the largest provider of capital.

653
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And where did it get this money? You guessed it: it made it
out of thin air through the fractional reserve banking system.

654
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Of the world's top 100 economies, as based on annual GDP,
51 are corporations. And 47 of that 51 are U.S.-based.

655
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,700
Walmart, General Motors, and Exxon,
are more economically powerful than

656
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:31,101
Saudi Arabia, Poland, Norway, South Africa,
Finland, Indonesia, and many others.

657
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,800
And, as protective trade-barriers are
broken down, currencies tossed together and

658
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:42,001
manipulated in floating markets,
and State economies overturned

659
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
in favor of competition in global capitalism,
the empire expands.

660
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You get up on your little 21 inch screen and
howl about America and democracy.

661
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:04,001
There is no America,
there is no democracy.

662
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:15,700
There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T,
and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbine, and Exxon.

663
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:19,001
Those are the nations of the world today.

664
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,800
What do you think the Russians talk about
in their counsels of state- Karl Marx?

665
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:28,001
They get out their linear programming
charts, statistical decision

666
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
theories, min and max solutions, and compute the price-cost
probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do.

667
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,200
We no longer live in a world of
Nations and Ideologies, Mr. Beale.

668
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:48,001
The world is a college of corporations,
inexorably determined by the immutable

669
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
bylaws of business.
The world is a business Mr. Beale.

670
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,201
Taken cumulatively, the integration of the world
as a whole, particularly in terms of economic

671
00:48:02,202 --> 00:48:05,402
globalization and the mythic qualities of "free
market" capitalism, represents a veritable

672
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:08,603
"empire" in its own right... Few have been able to
escape the "structural adjustments" and

673
00:48:08,604 --> 00:48:11,804
"conditionalities" of the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, or the arbitrations

674
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:15,005
of the World Trade Organization, those
international financial institutions that,

675
00:48:15,006 --> 00:48:18,206
however inadequate, still determine what
economic globalization means...

676
00:48:18,507 --> 00:48:21,707
Such is the power of globalization that within
our lifetime we are likely to see the integration,

677
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:24,908
even if unevenly, of all national economies in
the world into a single global, free market system.

678
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:27,709
Jim Garrison
President, State of the World Forum

679
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,800
The World is being taken over by
a hand-full of business powers

680
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:34,001
who dominate the natural resources we need to live,

681
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
while controlling the money we
need to obtain these resources.

682
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The end result will be world monopoly based not
on human life but financial and corporate power.

683
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,650
And, as the inequality grows, naturally,
more and more people are becoming desperate.

684
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:57,101
So the establishment was forced to
come up with a new way to deal

685
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
with anyone who challenges the system.
So they gave birth to the 'Terrorist'.

686
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:11,000
The term 'terrorist' is an empty distinction designed for any
person or group that chooses to challenge the establishment.

687
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,900
This isn't to be confused with the fictional 'Al Qaida',

688
00:49:15,001 --> 00:49:21,001
which as actually the name of a computer
database of the U.S.-supported Mudjahedeen

689
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
in the 1980's.

690
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,501
"The truth is, there is no islamic army or
terrorist group called Al Qaide. And any

691
00:49:24,502 --> 00:49:27,002
informed intelligence officer knows this. But
there is a propaganda campaign to make the

692
00:49:27,003 --> 00:49:29,503
public believe in the presence of an identified
entity... The country behind this propaganda is the US."

693
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:32,004
Pierre-Henry Bunel
Former French Military Intelligence

694
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:42,000
In 2007, the Department of Defense received 161.8
billion dollars for the so-called global war on terrorism.

695
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,800
According to the national counter-terrorism center,

696
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:52,001
in 2004 roughly 2000 people were killed
internationally due to supposed terrorist acts.

697
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,400
Of that number, 70 were American.
Using this number as a general average,

698
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,901
which is extremely generous,
it is interesting to note that twice as many

699
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
people die from peanut allergies
a year than from terrorist acts.

700
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Concurrently, the leading cause of death in America is
coronary heart disease, killing roughly 450,000 each year.

701
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And in 2007, the government's allocation of funds for
research on this issue was about three billion dollars.

702
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,000
this means, that the US government, in 2007,
spent 54 times the amount for preventing terrorism,

703
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:46,000
than it spent for preventing for the disease, which kills
6600 times more people annually, than terrorism does

704
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
yet, as the name terrorism and Al Qaida

705
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
are arbitrarilly stamped on every news report

706
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
relating to any action - taken against US interests

707
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
the myth grows wider!

708
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
in mid 2008 the "US Attorney General"

709
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
actually proposed, that the US congress

710
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
officially declare war against the fantasy

711
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
not to mention as of July 2008,
there are now over 1 million people

712
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
currently on the US terrorist watch list

713
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
These so called "Counter-Terrorism Measures"

714
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
of course had nothing to do with social protection

715
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
- and everything to do with
preserving the establishment

716
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
amongst the growing Anti-American sentiment

717
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
both domestically and internationally

718
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
which is legitimately founded on the
greed based corporate empire expansion

719
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
that is exploiting the world

720
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
The true terrorists of our world,
do not meet at the darks at midnight

721
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
or scream "Allah Akbar" before some violent action

722
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
the true terrorists of our world,
wear 5000 dollar suits,

723
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and work in the highest positions of finance,
government and business

724
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So, what do we do ?

725
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
How do we stop a system of greed and corruption,
that has so much power and momentum

726
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
How do we stop this aberrant group behavior,
which feels no compassion

727
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
for say, the millions slaughtered
in Irak and Afghanistan

728
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So the corporatacity can control energy
resources and opium production for Wall St. profit

729
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Before 1980, Afghanistan produced
0% of the world's opium

730
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
After the US/CIA backed Mujahideen won the Soviet/Afghan war.
by 1986 they were producing 40% of the world's heroin supply.

731
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
By 1988, they were producing
80% of the total market supply.

732
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But then, something unexpected happened.

733
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
The Taliban rose to power, and by 2000 they
had destroyed most of the opium fields.

734
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Production dropped from 3.000+ tons
to only 185 tons, a 94% reduction.

735
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
On Sept. 9th 2001, the full Afghanistan
invasion plans were on President Bush's Desk

736
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Two days later they had their excuse

737
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Today, opium productions in US controlled Afghanistan,

738
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
which now provides more than 90% of the world's heroin,
breakes new production records nearly every year.

739
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
How do we stop a system of greed and corruption

740
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,000
that condemns poor populations to "Sweatshop-Slavery"
for the benefit of Madison Avenue?

741
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Or that engineers false-flag
terrorattacks for the sake of manipulation?

742
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Or that generates "Build-in-Modes" of
social operation, wich are inherently exploited.

743
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Or that systematicly reduces several
libertys, and violates human rights.

744
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
In order to protect it self,
from it's own shortcomings.

745
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
How do we deal with the numerous covert institutions?

746
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Such as the Council on Foreign Relations? The The
Trilateral Commission and the Biderberg Group?

747
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
and other undemocraticaly elected groups

748
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:06,000
which behind closed doors collude to control the political,
financial, social and enviromental elements of our lives.

749
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
in order to find the answer, we must
first find, the true undermind cause

750
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:22,000
For the fact is, the selfish, corrupt, power and profit
based groups are not the true source of the problem

751
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
They are symptoms!

752
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Greed and Competition are not the
result of immutable human temperament

753
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
...greed and gear of scarcity are
in fact being created and amplified

754
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
the direct consequence is that we have to
fight with each other in order to survive

755
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Bernard Liertaer-founder of the EU currency System

756
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
my name is Jacque Fresco, I'am an
industrial designer and a social engineer

757
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'am very much interested in society and developing
a system that might be standable for all people

758
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,100
first of all, the world corruption is a
monitory invention, that aberrant behavior,

759
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:11,001
behavior that's destructive for the well
being of people, or you dealing with human behavior

760
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and human behavior appears
to be environmentally determinant

761
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
meaning, if you were raised by the seminole
indians as a baby, never saw anything else

762
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:32,000
you hold that system. And this goes for nations, for
individuals, for familys they try to indoctrinate their children

763
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
to their preticular faith in their country and
make them feel like their are part of the land

764
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and they built a society,
which they call established

765
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
they established a workable point of
view and intend to perpetuate that

766
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
whereas, all societies are
really emergent, not established

767
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and so they fight new ideas,
that would interfere with the establishment

768
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Goverments try to perpetuate that which keeps them in power,
people are not elected to political office to change things

769
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
They are put there, to keep things the way they are.

770
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
so you see, the bases of corruption is in our society

771
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Let me make it clear. All nations then are basically
corrupt because they tend to uphold existing institutions.

772
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,600
I don't mean to uphold, or downgrade all nations,

773
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:40,001
but communism, socialism, facism, the free
enterprise-system and all other sub-cultures are the same

774
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
they are all basicly corrupt

775
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the most fundamental
characteristic of our social institutions

776
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,000
is an necessity for Self-Preservation, but they're
dealing with the cooperation from religion or goverment

777
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
the foremost interest is to preserve the institution itself

778
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
For instance the last thing an oil company would ever want
is the utilization of a energy that was outside of its control.

779
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:09,301
For it makes that company less relevant to society.

780
00:57:09,502 --> 00:57:15,902
Likewise the cold war and the collapse of the
Soviet Union was in reality a way to preserve

781
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:20,703
and perpetuate the established economic
and global hegemony of the United States.

782
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:27,004
Similarly religions condition people to
feel guilty for natural inclinations,

783
00:57:27,105 --> 00:57:31,405
each claiming to offer the only
path to forgiveness and salvation.

784
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:38,105
At the heart of this institutional
self-preservation lies monetary system.

785
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:42,506
For it is money that provides the means for power and survival.

786
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:47,207
Therefore, just as a poor person might
be forced to steal in order to survive,

787
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:53,108
it is a natural inclination to do whatever is
needed to continue an institutions profitability.

788
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:58,309
This makes it inherently difficult for
profit-based institutions to change,

789
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,310
for it puts in jeopardy not only the
survival of large groups of people,

790
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:07,711
but also the coveted materialistic lifestyle
associated with affluence and power.

791
00:58:08,012 --> 00:58:13,112
Therefore, the paralyzing necessity
to preserve an institution regardless

792
00:58:13,113 --> 00:58:18,113
of it’s social relevance is largely
rooted in the need for money, or profit.

793
00:58:23,614 --> 00:58:26,714
What’s in it for me?, is why people think.

794
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:31,115
And so if a man makes money selling a certain product,

795
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:37,616
that’s where he’s going to fight the existence of
another product that may threaten his institution.

796
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:41,817
Therefore, people cannot be fair.

797
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:45,018
And people do not trust each other.

798
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,019
A guy will come over to you and say ‘I’ve got
just the house you’re looking for’… he’s a salesman.

799
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,120
When a doctor says ‘I think
your kidney has to come out’,

800
00:58:53,221 --> 00:58:58,421
I don’t know if he’s trying to pay off a
yacht or that my kidney has to come out.

801
00:58:58,722 --> 00:59:02,122
It’s hard in a monetary system to trust people.

802
00:59:02,923 --> 00:59:07,423
If you came into my store and I said
‘This lamp that I’ve got is pretty good,

803
00:59:07,524 --> 00:59:09,724
but the lamp next door is much better’,

804
00:59:10,025 --> 00:59:11,625
I wouldn’t be in business very long.

805
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:15,526
It wouldn’t work. If I were ethical, it wouldn’t work.

806
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,527
So when you say industry cares for people…

807
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:20,328
that’s not true.

808
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:22,729
They can’t afford to be ethical.

809
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:28,330
So your system is not designed
to serve the well-being of people.

810
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:35,431
If you still don’t understand that there would be
no outsourcing of jobs if they cared about people.

811
00:59:35,632 --> 00:59:37,132
Industry does not care.

812
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:40,633
They only hire people because
it hasn’t been automated yet.

813
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:48,134
So don’t talk about decency and ethics,
we cannot afford it and remain in business.”

814
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:53,435
It is important to point out that
regardless of the social system;

815
00:59:53,636 --> 01:00:02,336
whether fascist, socialist, capitalist, or communist; the
underlying mechanism is still money, labor, and competition.

816
01:00:03,137 --> 01:00:07,037
Communist China is no less
capitalistic than the United States.

817
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:12,338
The only difference is the degree by
which the state intervenes in enterprise.

818
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
The Reality is that "Monetary-ism",
so to speak, is the true mechanism,

819
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
that guides the interests of all the countries on the planet.

820
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
The most agressive and hence
dominant variation of this monetary-ism

821
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
is the free enterprise system.

822
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
The fundamental Perspective as put
forth by early free market economists,

823
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
like Adam Smith,

824
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
is that self interest and competition leads to social prosperity,

825
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
as the act of competition creates incentive,
which motivates people to persevere

826
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
However, what isn't talked about,
is how a competition based economy

827
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
invariably leads to strategic corruption,
power an wealth consolidation,

828
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
social stratification, technological
paralisis, labor abuse

829
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and ultimately a covert form
of government dictatorship

830
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
by the rich elite

831
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
The word "Corruption" is often
defined as - moral perversion -

832
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
If a Company dumps toxic waste
into the ocean, to save money

833
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Both people recognize this as "Corrupt-behavior"

834
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:23,801
On a more subtle level, when Walmart moves into a small town

835
01:01:23,902 --> 01:01:28,902
and forces small businesses to shut down for
they are unable to compete, a grey area emerges.

836
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:36,603
For what exactly is Walmart doing wrong? Why should they
care about the Mom and Pop organizations they destroy?

837
01:01:37,004 --> 01:01:39,504
Yet even more subtly,

838
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
When a person get's fired from their job,
because a new machine has been created,

839
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
witch can do the work for less money.

840
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
People tend to just accept that as...

841
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
"The way it is!"

842
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Not seen the inherent
-Corrupt inhumanity- of such an action.

843
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Because the fact is:

844
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Wether it is dumping toxic waste. Having a
monopoly enterprise or downsizing the workforce,

845
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
the motiv is the same!

846
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Profit!

847
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
They are all different degrees of
the same self-preserving machinism,

848
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
which always put's the well-being
of people second to monetary gain.

849
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Therefor, corruption is not
some "Byproduct" of Monetaryism.

850
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It is the very Foundation!

851
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:28,601
And while most people acknowledge
this tendency on one level or another,

852
01:02:28,802 --> 01:02:38,302
majority remains naive as to the broad ramifications of
having such a selfish mechanism as the guiding mentality in society.

853
01:02:38,603 --> 01:02:42,703
<i>"Internal documents show that
after this company positively absolutely </i>

854
01:02:42,704 --> 01:02:46,504
<i>knew they had a medication
that was infected with the AIDS virus,</i>

855
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:50,505
<i>they took the product off the market in the US,
and then they dumped it in France,</i>

856
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:54,606
<i>Europe, Asia and Latin America.
The US government allowed it to happen.</i>

857
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:59,707
<i>The FDA allowed this to happen, and now the
government is completely looking the other way.</i>

858
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:04,608
<i>Thousands of innocent hemophiliacs
have died from the AIDS virus.</i>

859
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:08,009
<i>This company knew absolutely
that it was infected with AIDS, </i>

860
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:12,810
<i>they dumped it because they wanted
to turn this disaster into a profit."</i>

861
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:18,411
So you see, you have built-in corruption.

862
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:24,412
We’re all chiseling off each other, and you
can’t expect decency in that sort of thing.

863
01:03:28,613 --> 01:03:31,513
…a feeling that they don’t know who to elect.

864
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:37,914
They think in terms of a democracy, which
is not possible in a monetary based economy.

865
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,515
If you have more money to advertise your position,

866
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:45,516
the position you desire in government,

867
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:46,617
that isn’t a democracy.

868
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:51,018
It serves those in positions of differential advantage.

869
01:03:51,219 --> 01:03:56,819
So it’s always a dictatorship of the
elitist, the financially wealthy.

870
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,120
“We can either have democracy in this country or we
can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few,

871
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:04,621
but we can’t have both.”
Louis Brandeis, Supreme Court Justice

872
01:04:04,722 --> 01:04:09,422
It is an interesting observation to note
how seemingly unknown personalities

873
01:04:09,523 --> 01:04:12,823
magically appear on the scene as presidential candidates.

874
01:04:12,924 --> 01:04:17,624
Then before you know it, somehow you are
left to choose from a small group of

875
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:23,425
extremely wealthy people who suspiciously
have the same broad social view.

876
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:26,026
Obviously it’s a joke.

877
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:28,727
The people placed on the ballot are done so

878
01:04:28,828 --> 01:04:35,128
because they have been pre-decided to be acceptable by
the established financial powers who actually run the show.

879
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:40,329
Yet many who understand this illusion of democracy,

880
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:46,330
often think ‘If only we could just get
our honest, ethical politicians in power,

881
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:54,531
’then we would be okay. Well, while this idea of course
seems reasonable in our established oriented world view,

882
01:04:54,632 --> 01:04:58,232
it is unfortunately another fallacy.

883
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:02,433
For when it really comes down
to what is actually important,

884
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:06,834
the institution of politics and thus politicians themselves,

885
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:14,035
have absolutely no true relevance as to
what makes our world and society function.

886
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:17,936
It’s not politicians that can solve problems.

887
01:05:18,037 --> 01:05:20,837
They have no technical capabilities.

888
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:22,738
They don’t know how to solve problems.

889
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:27,039
Even if they were sincere,
they don’t know how to solve problems.

890
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:31,540
It’s the technicians that
produce the desalinization plants.

891
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:34,441
It’s the technicians that give you electricity.

892
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:37,442
That give you motor vehicles.
That heat your house,

893
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:43,343
and cool it in the summer time. It’s
technology that solves problems, not politics.

894
01:05:43,444 --> 01:05:47,444
Politics cannot solve problems
’cause they are not trained to do so.

895
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:55,345
Very few people today stop and consider
what it is that actually improves their lives.

896
01:05:55,546 --> 01:05:57,046
Is it money?

897
01:05:57,347 --> 01:06:02,647
Obviously not. One cannot eat money,
or stuff money into their car to get it to run.

898
01:06:02,848 --> 01:06:04,648
It is politics?

899
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:10,549
All politicians can do is create laws,
establish budgets, and declare war.

900
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,750
Is it religion?

901
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:19,051
Of course not, religion creates nothing except
intangible emotional solace for those who require it.

902
01:06:19,452 --> 01:06:23,252
The true gift that we as human beings have,

903
01:06:23,353 --> 01:06:30,353
which has been solely responsible for everything
that has improved our lives, is technology.

904
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:34,654
What is technology? Technology is a pencil,

905
01:06:34,955 --> 01:06:38,755
which allows one to solidify
ideas on paper for communication.

906
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Technology is an automobile, which
allows one to travel faster than feet would allow.

907
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:50,000
Technology is a pair of eye glasses,
which enables sight for those who need it.

908
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:56,100
Applied technology itself is merely
and extension of human attributes,

909
01:06:56,501 --> 01:07:01,001
which reduces human effort,
freeing humans from a particular chore or problem.

910
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:09,000
Imagine what your life would be like today without
a telephone, or an oven, or a computer, or an airplane.

911
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:17,000
Everything in your home, which you take for granted;
from a doorbell, to a table, to a dishwasher is technology

912
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,500
generated from the creative
scientific ingenuity of human technicians.

913
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:30,001
Not money, politics, or religion.
These are false institutions.

914
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:36,000
“…and writing your congressman is fantastic. They tell you,
‘Write your congressman if you want something done.

915
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:44,000
The men in Washington should be at the forefront of technology.
The forefront of human study. The forefront of crime.

916
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:49,000
All the factors that shape human behavior.
You don’t have to write your congressman.

917
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,000
What kind of people are they
that are appointed to do that job?

918
01:07:53,500 --> 01:08:02,000
The future will have great difficulty… and the question
that’s raised by politicians is: How much will a project cost?

919
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,800
The question is not: How much will it cost?, but:

920
01:08:06,001 --> 01:08:12,001
Do we have the resources? And we have
the resources today to house everyone,

921
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:17,500
build hospitals all over the world,
build schools all over the world,

922
01:08:17,701 --> 01:08:22,001
the finest equipment in labs for
teaching and doing medical research.

923
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:30,000
So you see, we have all that, but we’re in a
monetary system, and in a monetary system there’s profit.”

924
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:37,000
And what is the fundamental mechanism that
drives the profit system besides self-interest?

925
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:42,000
What is it exactly that maintains
that competitive edge at it’s core?

926
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:49,000
Is it high efficiency and sustainability?
No. That isn’t part of their design.

927
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,000
Nothing produced in our profit based society
is even remotely sustainable or efficient.

928
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,000
If it was, there wouldn’t be a multi-million dollar
a year service industry for automobiles.

929
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05,000
Nor would the average lifespan for electronics
be less than three months before they’re obsolete.

930
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,800
Is it abundance? Absolutely not.

931
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:14,001
Abundance, as based on the laws of
supply and demand, is actually a negative thing.

932
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,800
If a diamond company finds ten times the
usual amount of diamonds during their mining,

933
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:22,001
it means the supply of diamonds has increased,

934
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,000
which means the cost and profit per diamond drops.

935
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:31,600
The fact is; efficiency, sustainability,
and abundance are the enemies of profit.

936
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:39,001
To put it into a word, it is the
mechanism of scarcity that increases profits.

937
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,000
What is scarcity?
It’s based on keeping products valuable.

938
01:09:45,401 --> 01:09:53,001
Slowing up production on oil raises the price.
Maintaining scarcity of diamonds keeps the price high.

939
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:59,000
They burn diamonds at the Kimberly Diamond Mine.
They’re made of carbon. That keeps the price up.

940
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,700
So then, what does it mean for society when scarcity,

941
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:10,001
either produced naturally or through
manipulation is a beneficial condition for industry?

942
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:17,500
It means that sustainability and abundance
will never ever occur in profit system.

943
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:22,001
For it simply goes against the
very nature of the structure.

944
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:28,000
Therefore, it is impossible to have
a world without war, or poverty.

945
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:35,000
It is impossible to continually advance
technology to its most efficient and productive states.

946
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:44,000
And most dramatically, it is impossible to expect
human beings to behave in truly ethical or decent ways.

947
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:56,600
People use the word instinct because
they can’t account for the behavior.

948
01:10:57,001 --> 01:11:02,001
They sit back and they evaluate
with their lack of knowledge,

949
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:11,000
and they say things like ‘Humans are built a certain way.
Greed is a natural thing.’ as though they’d worked for years on it.

950
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,000
And it’s no more natural than wearing clothing.

951
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:19,500
What we want to do is to
eliminate the causes of the problems.

952
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:27,001
Eliminate the processes that produce
greed, and bigotry, and prejudice,

953
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:36,000
and people taking advantage of one another,
and elitism. Eliminating the need for prisons and welfare.

954
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:42,000
We have always had these problems because
we have always lived within scarcity, and barter,

955
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,000
and monetary systems that produce scarcity.

956
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:54,000
If you eradicate the conditions that generate
what you call socially offensive behavior, it does not exist.

957
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,000
A guy says ‘Well listen,
are they in-born?’ No it’s not!

958
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:04,000
There is no human nature, there’s human behavior,
and that’s always been changed throughout history.

959
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:12,000
You’re not born with bigotry, and greed, and corruption,
and hatred. You pick that up within the society.

960
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:20,600
war, poverty, corruption, hunger, misery,
human suffering will not change in a monetary system.

961
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:24,001
That is, there’ll be very little significant change.

962
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:33,000
It’s going to take the redesigning of our culture, our values,
and it has to be related to the carrying capacity of the earth,

963
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:39,000
not some human opinion or some politicians
notions of the way the world ought to be.

964
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Or some religion’s notion of
the conduct of human affairs.

965
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,000
And that’s what The Venus Project is about.

966
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
The society, that we're about to talk about,

967
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
is a society that is free of all the old superstitions,

968
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
incarceration, prisons, police cruelty and law.

969
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
all laws will disappear

970
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and the professions will disappear,
that are no longer valid,

971
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
such as stockbrokers,
bankers, advertising.

972
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Gone! Forever!

973
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Because it's no longer relevant

974
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
When we understand that it is technology

975
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
devised by human ingenuity

976
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
which frees humanity and increases our quality of life

977
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
we then realize, that the most
important focus we can have

978
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
is on the intelligent management
of the earth's resources

979
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
For, it is from these natural
resources, we gain the materials

980
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
to continue our path of prosperity

981
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Understanding this we than see,

982
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
that money fundamentally exists
as a barrier to these resources

983
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
for, virtually everything has a financial cost.

984
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And why do we need money
to obtain these resources?

985
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Because of real or assumed scarcity

986
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
We don't usually pay for air and tap water,

987
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
because it is in such high abundance,

988
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
selling it would be pointless

989
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So then, logically speaking

990
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
If resources and technologies, applicable
to creating everything in our societies

991
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
such as houses, cities and transportation

992
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
were in high enough abundance,

993
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
there would be no reason to sell anything.

994
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Likewise, if automation and machinery
was so technologically advanced,

995
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
as to relieve human beings of labor

996
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
there would be no reason to have a job

997
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And with these social aspects taking care of,

998
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
there would be no reason to have money at all.

999
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So the ultimate question remains:

1000
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Do we on earth have enough resources

1001
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and technological understanding

1002
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
to create a society of such abundance,

1003
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
that everything we have now
could be available without a price tag

1004
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
and without the need for
submission through employment

1005
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Yes, we do!

1006
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,100
We have the resources and
technology to enable this at a minimum,

1007
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:10,001
along with the ability to raise
the standard of living so high

1008
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,000
that people in the future will
look back at our civilisation now

1009
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,000
and gawk how primitive and
immature our society was.

1010
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
What the Venus Project proposes

1011
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
is an entirely different system

1012
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
that's updated to present day knowledge

1013
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
We've never given scientists the problem of

1014
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
how do you design a society that would
eliminate boring and monotonous jobs

1015
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
that would eliminate accidents in transportation

1016
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
that would enable people to
have a high standard of living

1017
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
that would eliminate poisons in our food

1018
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
give us other sources of energy,
that are clean and efficient

1019
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
we can do that out there

1020
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
A resource based economy

1021
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
The major difference between a resource
based economy and a monetary system

1022
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
is that a resource based economy
is really concerned with people

1023
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
and their well-being

1024
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
where the monetary system has become so distorted

1025
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
that the concerns of the people are really secondary,

1026
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
it they're there at all

1027
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
The products that are turned out are for:

1028
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
How much money you can get.

1029
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
If there is a problem in society and you can't
earn money from that solving that problem,

1030
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
than it won't be done

1031
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
The resource based economy is really
not close to anything that's been tried.

1032
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And with all our technology
today we can create abundance.

1033
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It could be used to improve everyone's livestyle

1034
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Abundance all over the world
if we use our technology wisely

1035
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
and maintain the environment

1036
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's a very different system

1037
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
and it's very hard to talk about

1038
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
cause the public is not that well enough informed

1039
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
as to the state of technology

1040
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Energy

1041
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
At present we don't have to burn fossil fuels

1042
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
We don't have to use anything that
would contaminate the environment

1043
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
There are many sources of energy available

1044
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Alternative energy solutions
pushed by the establishment, such as

1045
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
hydrogen, biomass and even
nuclear are highly insufficient, dangerous

1046
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
and exist only to perpetuate the
profit-structure the industry has created

1047
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
When we look beyond the
propaganda and self-serving solutions

1048
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
put forth by the energy companies

1049
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
we find a seemingly endless stream

1050
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
of clean abundant and renewable
energy for generating power.

1051
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Solar and wind energy are well known to the public

1052
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
But the true potential of
these mediums remains unexpressed

1053
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Solar energy derived from the sun has such abundance

1054
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
that one hour of light at high noon contains more energy

1055
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
than what the entire world consumes in a year

1056
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
If we could capture 1/100 of this
energy the world would never have to use

1057
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
oil, gas or anything else

1058
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The question it is not availability

1059
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
but the technology to harnesst it

1060
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and there are many advanced mediums today

1061
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
which could accomplish just that.

1062
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
If they were not hindered by the
need to compete for market share

1063
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
with the established energy power structures

1064
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Then there's wind energy.

1065
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Wind energy has long been denounced as weak

1066
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And due to being location driven, impractical.

1067
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
This is simply not true.

1068
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
The US department of energy admitted in 2007

1069
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
that if wind was fully harvested
in just three of Americas 50 states

1070
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
it could power the entire nation

1071
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:44,000
And there are the rather unknown
mediums of tidal and wave power

1072
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Tidal power is derived
from tidal shifts in the ocean

1073
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Installing turbines which capture
this movement generates energy

1074
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
In the United Kingdom 42 sites
are currently noted as available

1075
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Forecasting that 34% of all the UK's
energy could come from tidal power alone

1076
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Wave power, which extracts energy
from the surface motions of the oceans

1077
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:14,000
is estimated to have a global potential
of up to 80.000 terawatt-hours a year.

1078
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:21,000
This means 50% of the entire planets energy
usage could be produced from this medium alone.

1079
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Now, it is important to point out that

1080
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
tidal, wave, solar and wind power

1081
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
requires virtually no preliminary energy to harness,

1082
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
unlike coal, oil, gas, biomass,
hydrogen and all the others

1083
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,000
In combination these four mediums alone,
if efficiently harnessed through technology,

1084
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
could power the world forever

1085
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,000
that being said, there happens to be another form
of clean renewable energy, which trumps them all.

1086
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Geothermal power

1087
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Geothermal energy utilizes,
what is called "heat mining"

1088
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Which, through a simple process using water,
is able to generate massive amounts of clean energy.

1089
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
In 2006 an MIT report on geothermal energy found that

1090
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
13.000 zetajule of power are
currently available in the earth

1091
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
with the possibility of 2.000 ZJ being
easily tapable with improved technology.

1092
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
The total energy consumption of
all the countries on the planet is about

1093
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
half of a zetajule a Year

1094
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
This means about 4000 years of
planetary power could be harnessed

1095
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
in this medium alone

1096
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
and when we understand that
the earth's heat generation

1097
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
is constantly renewed, this energy is really limitless

1098
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It could be used forever!

1099
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
These energy sources are only a few
of the clean renewable mediums available

1100
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And as time goes on we will find more.

1101
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:54,000
The grand realization is that we have total
energy abundance without the need for pollution

1102
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,000
traditional conservation or, in fact, a price tag!

1103
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And what about transportation?

1104
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
The prevailing means of transportation in
our societies is by automobile and aircraft.

1105
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Both of which predominantly need fossil fuels to run.

1106
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
In the case of the automobile,
the battery technology needed

1107
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
to power an electric car that can
go over a hundred miles and hour

1108
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
for over two hundred miles on one charge, exists

1109
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
and has existed for many years.

1110
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
However, due to battery patents,
controlled by the oil industry,

1111
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
which limits their ability to maintain market share,

1112
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
coupled with political
pressure from the energy industry,

1113
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
the accessibility and affordability
of these technologies is limited.

1114
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,000
There is absolutely no reason, other
than pure, corrupt profit intersts,

1115
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
that every single vechicle in
the world cannot be electric,

1116
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
and utterly clean, with zero need for gasoline.

1117
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
As far as airplanes, it is time we realized

1118
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
that this means of travel is inefficient,

1119
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
cumbersome, slow and
causes far too much pollution.

1120
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,999
This is a mag-lev train.

1121
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It uses magnets for propulsion.

1122
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It is fully suspended by a magnetic field

1123
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
and requires less then two
percent of the energy used

1124
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
for plane travel. The train has no wheels,

1125
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
so nothing can wear out.  The current maximum speed

1126
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
of versions of this technology,

1127
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
as used in Japan, is 361 miles per hour.

1128
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,000
However this version of
the technology is very dated.

1129
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
An organisation called ET3 which
has connection with the Venus project,

1130
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,000
has established a two-based mag-lev
that can travel up to 4000 miles per hour

1131
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
in a motionless frictionless tube
which can go over land or under water.

1132
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Imagine going from L.A to New
York for an extended lunchbreak

1133
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
or from Washington D.C. to
Beijing, China, in two hours.

1134
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
This is the future of continental
and intercontinental travel.

1135
01:22:54,500 --> 01:23:01,000
Fast, clean, with only a fraction of the
energy usage we use today for the same means.

1136
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,000
In fact, between mag-lev technology,
advanced battery storage and geothermal energy

1137
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
there will be no reason to
ever burning fossil fuel again.

1138
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
And we can do this now, if we were not
held back by the paralyzing profit structure.

1139
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Now America is inclined towards fascism.

1140
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It has a propensity by its dominant philosophy
and religion to uphold to fascist point of view.

1141
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:38,000
American industry is essencially a fascist institution.

1142
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
If you dont understand that, the minute you
punch that time clock you woke into a dictatorship.

1143
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:51,000
We are given notions about the respectibility
of work. And I realy look at it as being paid slavery.

1144
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,000
You’re brought up to believe that you shall
earn your living by the sweat of your brow.

1145
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:05,000
That holds people back. Freeing people from drudgery,
repetitive jobs which make them ignorant, you rob them.

1146
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
In our society, that is a resourced
based economy, machines free people.

1147
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
You see, we can't imagine that because
we never known that kind of world.

1148
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,000
If we look back at history, we see a very clear pattern
of machine automation slowly replacing human labour.

1149
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:35,000
From the dissapearence of the elevator man to the
near full automation of an automobile production plant.

1150
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:42,000
The fact is, as technology grows the need for
humans in the work force will continioully be diemineshed.

1151
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:50,000
This creates a serious clash, which proves the
falsness of the monitary based labour system.

1152
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,900
For human employment is in direct
competition with technological developement.

1153
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,100
Therefore given the fundamental
priority of profit by industry,

1154
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:06,001
people through time will be continually
layed off and replaced by machine.

1155
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,900
When industry takes on a machine
instead of shortening the work day,

1156
01:25:10,201 --> 01:25:15,001
they downsize. You loose your job
so you have a right to fear machines.

1157
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,500
In a high technology resourced based economy,

1158
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:26,001
it is conservative to say that about 90% of all
current occupations could be phased out by machines.

1159
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Freeing humans to live their life without servitude.
For this is the point of technology itself.

1160
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And through time with nano technology
and other highly advanced forms of science

1161
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:46,000
it is not far fetch to see how even complex medical
procedures could be performed by machines as well.

1162
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And based on the pattern with much higher
success rates than humans get today.

1163
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The path is clear but our monetary based structure
which requires labour for income blocks this progress.

1164
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,600
Humans need jobs in order to survive.

1165
01:26:02,801 --> 01:26:11,001
The bomb line is that this system must go or we will
never be free and technology will be constantly paralyzed.

1166
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
We have machines that clean out
sewers and frees human being doing that.

1167
01:26:17,201 --> 01:26:22,001
So look at machines as
extensions of human performance.

1168
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Furthermore many occupations today will have
simply no basis to exist in a resourced based economy.

1169
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Such as anything assosiated with the management
of money, advertising along with a legal system itself.

1170
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:44,000
For without money, a great majority of the crimes
that are commited today would never occur.

1171
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,700
Virtually all forms of crimes are
consequence in the moneatry system,

1172
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:54,001
either directly or by neurosis
inflicted through financial deprevation.

1173
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Therefore laws themselves
could eventually become extinct.

1174
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Instead of putting up a sign "drive carefully slippery when wet"
put a abrasive on the highway so it is not slippery when wet.

1175
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
And when a person gets in car that drunk

1176
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
and a car oscillates at great deal

1177
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
there's a little pendulum

1178
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
that swings up and back and that
will pull the car over to the side…

1179
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
- not a law. Solution.

1180
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Put sonar and radar on automobiles
so they can’t hit one another.

1181
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Man-made laws are attempts

1182
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
to deal with occuring problems

1183
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
and not knowing how to solve them

1184
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
they make a law.

1185
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
In the United States, the most privatised,

1186
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
capitalist country on the planet,

1187
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
it shall come as no surprise

1188
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
that it also has the largest prison population

1189
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
in the world - growing every year.

1190
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Statistically, most of these people

1191
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
are uneducated

1192
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and come from poor, deprived societies.

1193
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And contrary to propaganda,

1194
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
it is this enviromental conditioning, which

1195
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
lures them into criminal and violent behaviour.

1196
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
However society, looks the other way

1197
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
and regard to this point.

1198
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The legal and prison systems
are just more examples

1199
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
of how our society avoids examining

1200
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
the root-causes of behaviour.

1201
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Billions are spend each year

1202
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
on prisons and police,

1203
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
while only a fraction is spend on

1204
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
programs for poverty,

1205
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
which is one of the most fundamental variables

1206
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
responsible for crime to begin with.

1207
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And, as long as we have an economic system,

1208
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
which preferes and infact creates

1209
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,000
scarcity and deprivation,
crime will never go away.

1210
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
If people have access to the necessities of life

1211
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:53,000
without servitude, debt, barter, trade;
they behave very differently.

1212
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
You want all this things
availabe without a price tag

1213
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Now then, you’ve gotta have a price tag.

1214
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
What will motivate people?

1215
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Men gets just everything what he wants,

1216
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
he's just lay around in the sun.

1217
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
This is the myth they perpetuate.

1218
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
People in our culture are trained to believe

1219
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
that the monetary system produces incentive:

1220
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
If they have access to all things,
why should they want to do anything?

1221
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,000
They would loose their incentive.

1222
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
That's what you're taught to
support the monetary system.

1223
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
When you take money out of the scenerio,

1224
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
there would be different incentives,
very different incentives.

1225
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
When people have access to the necessities of life,

1226
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,000
their incentives change.

1227
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,000
What about the moon and the stars?

1228
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
New incentives arise.

1229
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
If you make a painting, that you enjoy,

1230
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
you will enjoy giving it to
other people - not selling it.

1231
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I think most of the education,
that I've seen today,

1232
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
is essentially producing a person for a job.

1233
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It's very specialized.
They're not generalists.

1234
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
People don't know a lot
about a lot of different subjects.

1235
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I don't think you can get people to go to war,

1236
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
if they knew a lot about a lot of things.

1237
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I think education is mostly rote

1238
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
and they're not taught how to solve problems,

1239
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,000
they're not given the tools,
emotionally or whithin their own field,

1240
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
of how to do critical thinking.

1241
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
In a resource based economy,
the education would be very different.

1242
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Our society's major concern
is mental development

1243
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
and to motivate each person

1244
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
to their highest potential.

1245
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Because our philosophy is

1246
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
the smarter people are
people are the rich of the world

1247
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
because everybody becomes a contributor.

1248
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
The smarter your kids are,

1249
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
the better my life will be.

1250
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Because they'll be contributing more
constructively to the environment

1251
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
and to my life.

1252
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Because everything that we devise

1253
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
with an resource based economy

1254
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
would be applied to society.

1255
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
There would be nothing to hold it back.

1256
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Patriotism, weapons, armies, navies,

1257
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
all that is a sign,

1258
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
that we're not civilized yet.

1259
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Kids will ask their parents:

1260
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Didn't you see the necessity of the machines?

1261
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Dad, couldn't you see, that war
was inevitable when you produce scarcity

1262
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
when you produce scarcity?

1263
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Isn't it obvious?

1264
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Of course, the kid will understand

1265
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
that you're pinheads - raised merely to serve

1266
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
the established institutions.

1267
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
We’re such an abominable, sick society
that we won’t make the history books.

1268
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:44,000
They’ll just say that large nations took land
from smaller nations, used force and violence.

1269
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:50,000
You’ll get history talked about as corrupt behavior
all the way along until the beginning of the civilized world.

1270
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,000
That’s when all the nations work together.

1271
01:31:53,500 --> 01:32:04,000
World unification, working toward common good for all human
beings and without anyone being subservient to anyone else.

1272
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:13,000
Without social stratification whether it be technical elitism
or any other kind of elitism, eradicated from the face of the earth.

1273
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:20,000
The ’state’ does nothing because there is no ’state’.

1274
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,600
The system I advocate, a resource
based global economy is not perfect,

1275
01:32:27,901 --> 01:32:34,001
it’s just a lot better than what we have.
We can never achieve perfection.

1276
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:50,000
My country is the world… and my religion is to do good.”
Thomas Paine, 1737-1809

1277
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:58,000
The social values of our society, which has manifested
in perpetual warfare, corruption, oppressive laws,

1278
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:02,700
social stratification, irrelevant
superstitions, environmental destruction,

1279
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:08,001
and a despotic socially
indifferent profit oriented ruling class

1280
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:16,000
is fundamentally the result of a collective ignorance of
two of the most basic insights humans can have about reality.

1281
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:21,000
The emergent and symbiotic aspects of natural law.

1282
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:32,000
The emergent nature of reality is that all systems; whether it is
knowledge, society, technology, philosophy, or any other creation

1283
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:37,000
will, when uninhibited, undergo fluid perpetual change.

1284
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:42,100
What we consider commonplace today such
as modern communication and transportation,

1285
01:33:42,401 --> 01:33:46,001
would have been unimaginable in ancient times.

1286
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:50,000
Likewise, the future will
contain technologies, realizations,

1287
01:33:50,301 --> 01:33:55,001
and social structures that we
cannot even fathom in the present.

1288
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:01,000
We have gone from alchemy to chemistry,
from a geocentric universe to a heliocentric

1289
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,000
from believing that demons were
the cause of illness to modern medicine.

1290
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,000
This development shows no sign of ending,

1291
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:16,000
and it is this awareness that aligns us and leads
us on a continuous path to growth and progress.

1292
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:26,000
Static empirical knowledge does not exist, rather it is
the insight of the emergence of all systems we must recognize.

1293
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:35,000
This means we must be open to new information at all times,
even if it threatens our current belief system, and hence, identities.

1294
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:40,000
Sadly society today has failed to recognize this,

1295
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:47,000
and the established institutions continue to
paralyze growth by preserving outdated social structures.

1296
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,000
Simultaneously, the population
suffers from a fear of change.

1297
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:59,000
For their conditioning assumes a static identity and challenging
ones belief system, usually results in insult and apprehension.

1298
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:09,000
For being wrong is erroneously associated with failure.
When in fact to be proven wrong should be celebrated.

1299
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:15,000
For it is elevating someone to a new
level of understanding, furthering awareness.

1300
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:19,000
The fact is, there is no such
thing as a smart human being,

1301
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:26,000
for it is merely a matter of time before
their ideas are updated, changed, or radicated.

1302
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:30,000
And this tendency to blindly hold on to a belief system,

1303
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:38,000
sheltering it from new possibly transforming information
is nothing less than a form of intelectual materialism.

1304
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:45,000
The monetary system perpetuates this materialism
not only by it’s self-preserving structures,

1305
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,000
but also throught the countless number of people

1306
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:52,000
who have been conditioned into blindly
and thoughtlessly upholding these structures,

1307
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:57,000
therefore becoming self-appointed
guardians of the status quo.

1308
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:01,500
Sheep which no longer need
a sheep-dog to control them.

1309
01:36:01,801 --> 01:36:07,001
For they control each other by
ostracizing those who step out of the norm.

1310
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:13,000
tendency to resist change and uphold
existing institutions for the sake of identity,

1311
01:36:13,301 --> 01:36:18,001
comfort, power and profit is completely unsustainable;

1312
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:25,000
and will only produce further imbalance,
fragmentation, distortion, and very invariably destruction.

1313
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
It’s time to change.

1314
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:37,000
From hunters and gatherers, to the agricultural revolution,
to the industrial revolution, the pattern is clear.

1315
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:43,000
It is time for a new social system which
reflects the understandings we have today.

1316
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:49,000
The monetary system is a product of a
period of time when scarcity was a reality.

1317
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:57,000
Now with the age of technology it is no longer relevant
to society. Gone with the aberrant behavior it manifests.

1318
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:06,000
Likewise, dominant world views such as theistic
religion operate with the same social irrelevancy.

1319
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:15,000
Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and all of the
others exist as barriers to personal and social growth.

1320
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:20,000
For each group perpetuates a closed world view.

1321
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:28,000
And this finite understanding that they acknowledge
is simply not possible in an emergent universe.

1322
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:34,000
Yet religion has succeeded in shutting
down the awareness of this emergence

1323
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:39,000
by instilling the psychological
distortion of faith upon it’s followers.

1324
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:45,000
Where logic and new information is rejected
in favor of traditionalized outdated beliefs.

1325
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:52,000
The concept of god, is really a method
of accounting for the nature of things.

1326
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:59,000
In the early days people didn’t know enough about
how things formed, how nature worked.

1327
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:06,000
So they invented their own little stories,
and the made god in their own image.

1328
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,900
A guy that get’s angry when
people don’t behave right.

1329
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:16,001
He creates floods, and earthquakes,
and they say it’s and act of god.

1330
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:23,000
A cursory glance at the suppressed history of religion
reveals that even the foundational myths themselves

1331
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:27,000
are emergent culminations developed
through influence over time.

1332
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:33,000
For example a cardinal doctrine of the Christian
faith is the death and resurrection of Christ.

1333
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,000
This notion is so important that the Bible itself states

1334
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:44,000
‘And if Christ be not risen then is our
preaching vain and your faith is also vain’

1335
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:48,000
Yet it is very difficult to
take this account literally,

1336
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:53,000
for not only is there no primary source
denoting this supernatural event in secular history,

1337
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:59,000
awareness of the enormous number of pre-Christian
saviors who also died and were resurrected

1338
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:05,000
immediately puts this story in
mythological territory by association.

1339
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:10,000
Early church figures such as Tortullian
went to great lengths to break these associations,

1340
01:39:10,301 --> 01:39:14,701
even claiming that the devil
caused the similarities to occur.

1341
01:39:14,902 --> 01:39:19,202
Stating in the second century ‘The devil,
whose business is to pervert the truth,

1342
01:39:19,403 --> 01:39:22,703
mimics the exact circumstances of the Divine Sacraments.

1343
01:39:22,904 --> 01:39:26,604
He baptizes his believers and promises forgiveness of sins…

1344
01:39:26,805 --> 01:39:30,105
he celebrates the oblation of bread,
and brings in the symbol of the resurrection.

1345
01:39:31,406 --> 01:39:38,606
Let us therefore acknowledge the craftiness of the devil,
who copied certain things of those that be Divine.

1346
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:45,007
What is truly sad however, is that when we
cease the idea that the stories from Christianity,

1347
01:39:45,108 --> 01:39:46,708
Judaism, Islam and all the others are literal history,

1348
01:39:46,909 --> 01:39:52,509
and accept them for what they really are,

1349
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:57,010
which are purely allegorical
expressions derived from many faiths,

1350
01:39:57,211 --> 01:40:00,011
we see that all religions share a common thread.

1351
01:40:00,312 --> 01:40:06,512
And it is this unifying imperative that
needs to be recognized and appreciated.

1352
01:40:08,413 --> 01:40:13,713
Religious belief has caused more fragmentation
and conflict than any other ideology.

1353
01:40:13,914 --> 01:40:18,314
Christianity alone has over 34,000 different subgroups.

1354
01:40:19,315 --> 01:40:23,115
The Bible is subject to interpretation.

1355
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:28,716
When you read it, you say ‘I think
Jesus meant this. I think Job meant that.

1356
01:40:28,817 --> 01:40:31,917
Oh No! He meant this.’ So you have the Lutheran,

1357
01:40:31,918 --> 01:40:38,118
the Seventh-day Adventist, the Catholic,
and a church divided is no church at all.

1358
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:53,719
And this point on division, which is a trademark on all theistic
religions brings us to our second failure of awareness.

1359
01:40:54,120 --> 01:41:00,720
The false assumption of separation through
the rejection of the symbiotic relationship of life.

1360
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:05,921
Apart from the understanding that
all natural systems are emergent,

1361
01:41:06,322 --> 01:41:11,422
where all notions of reality will be constantly
developed, altered, and even eradicated;

1362
01:41:11,723 --> 01:41:20,123
we must also understand that all systems are in fact
invented fragments merely for sake of conversation.

1363
01:41:20,524 --> 01:41:23,824
For there is no such thing
as independence in nature.

1364
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:28,725
The whole of nature is a unified
system of interdependent variables,

1365
01:41:29,026 --> 01:41:34,426
each a cause and a reaction,
existing only as a concentrated whole.

1366
01:41:36,127 --> 01:41:39,027
You don’t see the plug to connect to the environment,

1367
01:41:39,328 --> 01:41:42,628
so it looks like we’re free… wandering around.

1368
01:41:42,829 --> 01:41:45,429
Take the oxygen away,
we all die immediately.

1369
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:49,230
Take plant life away, we die. And without the sun,

1370
01:41:49,331 --> 01:41:52,131
all the plants die. So we are connected.

1371
01:41:52,332 --> 01:41:55,432
We really must take into account the totality.

1372
01:41:55,633 --> 01:41:58,033
This isn’t just a human experience on this planet,

1373
01:41:58,034 --> 01:42:01,834
this is a total experience. And we know we
can’t survive without plants and animals.

1374
01:42:01,935 --> 01:42:02,935
We know we can’t survive
without the four elements, you know?

1375
01:42:03,136 --> 01:42:08,236
And so, when are we really going to start taking that into account?

1376
01:42:08,437 --> 01:42:10,437
That’s what it is to be successful.

1377
01:42:10,638 --> 01:42:14,238
Success depends on how well
we relate to everything around us.

1378
01:42:15,539 --> 01:42:21,939
I’m very aware of the fact that my grandson
cannot possible hope to inherit a sustainable,

1379
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:27,440
peaceful, stable, socially just world unless
every child today growing up today in Ethiopia,

1380
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:33,541
in Indonesia, in Bolivia, in Palestine, in
Israel also has that same expectation.

1381
01:42:33,742 --> 01:42:38,242
You gotta take care of the whole community
or you’re gonna have serious problems.

1382
01:42:38,443 --> 01:42:42,343
And now we have to see that
the whole world is the community.

1383
01:42:42,544 --> 01:42:48,144
And we must all take care of each other that way.
And it’s not just a community of human beings,

1384
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:51,145
a community of plants and animals and elements.

1385
01:42:50,246 --> 01:42:56,746
And we really need to understand that. That’s
what’s gonna bring us joy too, and pleasure.

1386
01:42:56,947 --> 01:42:58,847
That’s what’s missing in our lives right now.

1387
01:42:58,948 --> 01:43:06,148
We can call it spirituality, but the fact of the
matter is joy comes from that bliss of connectedness.

1388
01:43:06,449 --> 01:43:13,349
That’s our god spirit. That’s that side of ourselves that
really feels it, and you can feel it deep inside you.

1389
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:16,450
It’s this amazing wonderful feeling,
and you know it when you get it.

1390
01:43:16,551 --> 01:43:19,651
You don’t get it from money, you get it from connection.

1391
01:43:22,552 --> 01:43:24,652
<i>"Now if that isn’t a hazard to this country.</i>

1392
01:43:26,853 --> 01:43:29,853
<i>How are we gonna keep building
nuclear weapons, you know what I mean?</i>

1393
01:43:31,054 --> 01:43:35,254
<i>What’s gonna happen to the arms
industry, when we realize we’re all one?</i>

1394
01:43:36,655 --> 01:43:48,055
<i>It’s gonna fuck up the economy.
The economy that’s fake anyway.</i>

1395
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:53,956
<i>Which would be a real bummer. You
can see why the government’s crackin’ down…</i>

1396
01:43:57,257 --> 01:43:59,957
<i>on the idea of experiencing unconditional love.”
Bill Hicks</i>

1397
01:44:01,458 --> 01:44:06,258
<i>“I believe that unarmed truth and
unconditional love will have the final word in reality.” </i>

1398
01:44:06,559 --> 01:44:10,559
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, 1929-1968

1399
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:15,160
Once we understand that the
integrity of our personal existences

1400
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:20,061
are completely dependent on the
integrity of everything else in our world,

1401
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:24,162
we have truly understood
the meaning of unconditional love.

1402
01:44:24,463 --> 01:44:28,563
For love is extensionality and seeing everything as you

1403
01:44:28,764 --> 01:44:32,164
and you as everything can have no conditionalities,

1404
01:44:32,465 --> 01:44:36,265
for in fact, we are all everything at once.

1405
01:44:36,566 --> 01:44:40,966
<i>“If it’s true that we’re all from the center of a star,
every atom on each of us from the center of a star,</i>

1406
01:44:41,167 --> 01:44:42,567
<i>then we’re all the same thing.</i>

1407
01:44:42,668 --> 01:44:47,868
<i>Even a Coke machine or a cigarette butt in the street
in buffalo is made out of atoms that came from a star. </i>

1408
01:44:48,069 --> 01:44:54,169
<i>They’ve all been recycled thousands of times, as
have you and I. And therefore, it’s only me out there.</i>

1409
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:58,370
<i>So what is there to be afraid of?
What is there that needs solace seeking?</i>

1410
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:01,471
<i>Nothing. There’s nothing to
be afraid of because it’s all us.</i>

1411
01:45:01,672 --> 01:45:07,372
<i>The trouble is we have been separated by being born
and given a name and an identity and being individuated.</i>

1412
01:45:07,573 --> 01:45:10,173
<i>We’ve been separated from the
oneness, and that’s what religion exploits.</i>

1413
01:45:10,274 --> 01:45:13,874
<i>That people have this yearning to
be part of the overall one again.</i>

1414
01:45:13,975 --> 01:45:15,175
<i>So they exploit that. </i>

1415
01:45:15,176 --> 01:45:18,776
<i>They call it god, they say he has rules, and I think it’s cruel.</i>

<i>“…an extraterrestrial visitor examining
the differences among human societies</i>

trivial compared to the similarities…</i>

“Who Speaks for Earth?” - Carl Sagan, 1934-1996

1432
01:46:09,293 --> 01:46:13,493
It’s time to claim the unity our outmoded
social systems have broken apart,

1433
01:46:13,794 --> 01:46:22,694
and work together to create a sustainable global society
where everyone is taken care of and everyone is truly free.

1434
01:46:22,895 --> 01:46:29,395
Your personal beliefs, whatever they may be are
meaningless when it comes to the necessities of life.

1435
01:46:29,596 --> 01:46:34,696
Every human being was born naked,
needing warmth, food, water, shelter.

1436
01:46:34,997 --> 01:46:36,997
Everything else is auxiliary.

1437
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:43,198
Therefore, the most important issue at hand is
the intelligent management of the Earth’s resources.

1438
01:46:43,499 --> 01:46:46,599
This can never be accomplished in a monetary system,

1439
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:52,300
for the pursuit of profit is the persuit of self
interest and therefore imbalance is inherent.

1440
01:46:54,101 --> 01:47:01,401
Simultaneously, politicians are useless. For our
true problems in life are technical not political.

1441
01:47:01,702 --> 01:47:09,902
Furthermore, ideologies that separate humanity such as religion
need strong reflection in the community in regards to it’s value,

1442
01:47:10,203 --> 01:47:16,503
purpose and social relevancy. Hopefully
through time religion will loose it’s materialism

1443
01:47:16,804 --> 01:47:21,004
and basis in superstition and
move into the useful field of philosophy.

1444
01:47:21,505 --> 01:47:24,605
The fact is, society today is backwards,

1445
01:47:24,806 --> 01:47:29,906
with politicians constantly talking about
protection and security rather than creation,

1446
01:47:30,107 --> 01:47:31,807
unity and progress.

1447
01:47:32,608 --> 01:47:37,408
The US alone now spends about
$500 billions dollars anually on defense.

1448
01:47:37,809 --> 01:47:42,409
That is enough to send every high school
senior in America to a four year college.

1449
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:48,910
In the 1940’s the Manhattan Project produced
the first true weapon of mass destruction.

1450
01:47:49,211 --> 01:47:55,211
This program employed 130,000
people, at an extreme financial cost.

1451
01:47:55,512 --> 01:47:59,812
Imagine what our life would be
like today if that group of scientists,

1452
01:48:00,213 --> 01:48:07,313
instead of working on a way of killing people, worked
on a way to create a self-sustaining abundant world.

1453
01:48:07,714 --> 01:48:11,614
Life today would be very very
different if that was their goal.

1454
01:48:13,915 --> 01:48:16,215
Instead of weapons of mass destruction,

1455
01:48:16,616 --> 01:48:20,116
it is time to unleash something much more
powerful.

1456
01:48:20,317 --> 01:48:24,517
Weapons of Mass Creation (WMCs).

1457
01:48:25,617 --> 01:48:27,617
Our true divinity is in our ability to create.

1458
01:48:27,818 --> 01:48:32,118
And armed with the understanding
of the symbiotic connections of life,

1459
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:36,119
while being guided by the emergent nature of reality,

1460
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:39,420
there is nothing we cannot do or accomplish.

1461
01:48:41,421 --> 01:48:48,121
Of course, we face strong barriers in the form of
established power structures that refuse to change.

1462
01:48:48,622 --> 01:48:52,722
At the heart of these structures is the
monetary system. As explained earlier,

1463
01:48:52,823 --> 01:48:56,423
the fractional reserve policy
is a form of slavery through debt,

1464
01:48:56,624 --> 01:49:03,924
where it is literally impossible for society to be free. In
turn, free market capitalism in the form of free trade,

1465
01:49:04,225 --> 01:49:11,625
uses debt to imprison the world and manipulate countries into
subservience to a handful of large business and political powers.

1466
01:49:12,026 --> 01:49:16,926
Apart from these obvious amoralities,
the system itself is based on competition,

1467
01:49:17,127 --> 01:49:22,927
which immediately destroys the possibility of
large scale collaborations for the common good.

1468
01:49:22,228 --> 01:49:28,228
Hence paralyzing any attempt
at true global sustainability.

1469
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:33,029
These financial and corporate structures are now obsolete,

1470
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:35,330
and they must be outgrown.

1471
01:49:35,931 --> 01:49:41,331
Of course, we can not be naive enough to think that the
business and financial elite are going to subscribe to this idea

1472
01:49:41,532 --> 01:49:43,432
for they will lose power and control.

1473
01:49:43,733 --> 01:49:47,333
Therefore, peaceful and highly
strategic action must be taken.

1474
01:49:48,034 --> 01:49:49,034
The most powerful course of action is simple.

1475
01:49:50,835 --> 01:49:56,535
We have to alter our behavior to force
the power structure to the will of the people.

1476
01:49:57,036 --> 01:50:01,536
WE MUST STOP SUPPORTING THE SYSTEM.

1477
01:50:01,737 --> 01:50:06,037
The only way the establishment will
change is by our refusal to participate

1478
01:50:06,338 --> 01:50:10,238
while continuously acknowledging
it’s endless flaws and corruptions.

1479
01:50:11,239 --> 01:50:17,539
They’re not gonna give up the monetary system,
because of our designs of what we’d recommend.

1480
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:24,440
The system has to fail, and people have
to lose confidence in their elected leaders.

1481
01:50:24,741 --> 01:50:31,941
That will be a major turning point if The
Venus Project is offered as a possible alternative.

1482
01:50:32,242 --> 01:50:34,642
If not, I fear the consequences.

1483
01:50:34,943 --> 01:50:40,243
The trends now indicate that
our country is going bankrupt.

1484
01:50:40,544 --> 01:50:45,544
The probability is our country will
move towards a military dictatorship

1485
01:50:45,745 --> 01:50:49,845
to prevent riots and complete social breakdown.

1486
01:50:50,146 --> 01:50:54,646
Once the US breaks down, all the
other cultures will undergo similar things.

1487
01:50:56,047 --> 01:51:00,847
As of now, the world financial system is on the
brink of collapse due to it’s own shortcomings.

1488
01:51:01,048 --> 01:51:07,548
The comptroller of currencies stated in 2003
that the interest on the US national debt

1489
01:51:07,749 --> 01:51:10,249
will not be affordable in less than ten years.

1490
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:16,950
This theoretically means total bankruptcy for the US
economy and it’s implications for the world are immense.

1491
01:51:17,251 --> 01:51:22,951
In turn the fractional reserve based monetary
system is reaching it’s theoretical limits of expansion

1492
01:51:23,152 --> 01:51:26,652
and the banking failures you
are seeing are just the beginning.

1493
01:51:26,853 --> 01:51:32,253
This is why inflation is skyrocketing, all
debt is at record levels and the government

1494
01:51:32,354 --> 01:51:36,054
and FED are hemorrhaging new
money to bailout the corrupt system.

1495
01:51:36,555 --> 01:51:40,055
For the only way to keep the banks
going is by making more money.

1496
01:51:40,356 --> 01:51:44,456
The only way to make more money
is to create more debt and inflation.

1497
01:51:44,757 --> 01:51:47,357
It is simply a matter of time before the tables turn

1498
01:51:47,558 --> 01:51:54,458
and no one is willing to make new loans while defaults
grow as people are unable to afford their current loans.

1499
01:51:54,859 --> 01:52:00,659
Then the expansion of money will stop and
contraction will begin on a scale never before seen.

1500
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:06,260
Ending a century long pyramid scheme.
This has already begun.

1501
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:13,661
Therefore, we need to expose this financial failure
for what it is, using this weakness to our advantage.

1502
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,000
Here are some suggestions:

1503
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,000
One. Expose the banking fraud.

1504
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:26,000
Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of America are the most
powerful controllers within the corrupt Federal Reserve system.

1505
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:29,000
It’s time to boycott these institutions.

1506
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:35,000
If you have a bank account or credit card with
any of them, move your money to another bank.

1507
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:39,000
If you have a mortgage, refinance with another bank.

1508
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:43,000
If you own their stock, sell it. If you work for them, quit.

1509
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:50,000
This gesture will express contempt fo the true powers
behind the private banking cartel known as the Federal Reserve.

1510
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:54,000
And create awareness about the fraud of the banking system itself.

1511
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:57,000
Two. Turn off the TV news.

1512
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:02,000
Visit the emerging independent news
agencies on the internet for your information.

1513
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:11,000
CNN, NBC, ABC, FOX and all the others present
all news pre-filtered to maintain the status quo.

1514
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:14,500
With four corporations owning all major media outlets,

1515
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
objective information is impossible.

1516
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,000
This is the true beauty of the internet.

1517
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:25,000
And the establishment has been losing control
because of this free flow of information.

1518
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:30,000
We must protect the internet at all times,
as it is truly our savior right now.

1519
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:41,000
Three. Don’t ever allow yourself, your family,
or anyone you know, to ever join the military.

1520
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:49,000
This is an obsolete institution now used exclusively
for maintaining an establishment that is no longer relevant.

1521
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:54,000
US soldiers in Iraq work for US corporations, not the people.

1522
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:59,000
Propaganda forces us to believe that war is natural
and the military is an honorable institution.

1523
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:08,000
Well if war is natural, why are there 18 suicides every single day
by American veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder?

1524
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:17,000
If our military men and women are so honored, why is it that
25% of the American homeless population are veterans?

1525
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:21,000
Four. Stop supporting the energy companies.

1526
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:25,000
If you live in a detached house, get off the grid.

1527
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:30,000
Investigate every means of making your
home self-sustainable with clean energy.

1528
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:35,000
Solar, wind, and other renewable energies
are now affordable consumer realities,

1529
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,500
and considering the never ending rising costs of traditional energies,

1530
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
it will likely be a cheaper investment over time.

1531
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:45,000
If you drive, get the smallest car you can and

1532
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:51,000
consider using one of the many conversion
technologies that can enable your car to be a hybrid,

1533
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:55,000
electric, or run on anything other than establishment fuels.

1534
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,000
Five. Reject the political system.

1535
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:02,300
The illusion of democracy is an insult to our intelligence.

1536
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:08,000
In a monetary system, there is no such thing
as a true democracy, and there never was.

1537
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:13,000
We have two political parties owned by the same set of corporate lobbyists.

1538
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:16,000
They are place into their positions by the corporations,

1539
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:20,000
with popularity artificially projected by their media.

1540
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:27,000
In a system of inherent corruption the change of
personnel every couple of years has very little relevance.

1541
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:34,000
Instead of pretending that the political game has any true meaning
focus your energy on how to transcend this failed system.

1542
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:39,000
Six. Join the movement.

1543
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:47,000
Go to the thezeitgeistmovement.com and help us create the
largest mass movement for social change the world has ever seen.

1544
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:53,000
We must mobilize and educate everyone about
the inherent corruption of our current world system…

1545
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:57,000
along with the only true sustainable solution,

1546
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:02,000
declaring all the natural resources
on the planet as common heritage to all people,

1547
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:06,700
while informing everyone as to the true state of technology

1548
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:12,000
and how we can all be free if the world works together rather than fights.

1549
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,000
The choice lies with you.

1550
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:19,000
You can continue to be a slave to the
financial system and watch the continuous wars,

1551
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:27,000
depressions and injustice across the globe while placating
yourself with vain entertainment and materialistic garbage;

1552
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:32,000
or you can focus your energy on
true, meaningful, holistic, lasting change

1553
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:40,000
which has the realistic ability to support
and free all humans with no one left behind.

1554
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:47,000
But in the end the most relevant change must occur first inside of you.

1555
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:53,000
The real revolution is the revolution of consciousness,

1556
01:56:53,500 --> 01:57:01,500
and each one of us first needs to eliminate the divisionary
materialistic noise we have been conditioned to think is true;

1557
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:10,000
while discovering, amplifying, and aligning
with the signal coming from our true empirical oneness.

1558
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
It is up to you.

1559
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:27,000
<i>“What we are trying in all these discussions and talks here is
to see if we cannot radically bring about a transformation of the mind.</i>

1560
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:35,000
<i>Not accept things as they are… but to understand it, </i>

1561
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:42,000
<i>to go into it, to examine it, give your heart and
your mind with every thing that you have to find out.</i>

1562
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:45,000
<i>A way of living differently.</i>

1563
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:54,000
<i>But, that depends on you and not somebody else.</i>

1564
01:57:54,500 --> 01:58:00,000
<i>Because in this there is no teacher, no pupil, there’s no leader,</i>

1565
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:04,000
<i>no guru, there’s no master, no savior.</i>

1566
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,000
<i>You yourself are the teacher, and the pupil,</i>

1567
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,500
<i>you’re the master, you’re the guru, you are the leader,</i>

1568
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,500
<i>you are everything!</i>

1569
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:22,000
<i>And to understand is to transform what is.” - J. Krishnamurti</i>

1570
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:07,200
Revolution is now!

1571
02:02:09,001 --> 02:02:16,001
We would like to thank Peter Joseph & his crew
for this jaw dropping documentary.

1572
02:02:17,502 --> 02:02:22,502
To Jeff Hemry for his arrangment of the complete transcript.

and open your mind!

1577
02:02:44,507 --> 02:02:48,507
Get prepared for the Z-DAY.

1578
02:02:49,508 --> 02:02:54,008
Salvation is close...
