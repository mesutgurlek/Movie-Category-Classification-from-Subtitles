1
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,872
Honey, I'm calling my baby honey

2
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,875
Never
Oh, my baby honey

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,678
He is my special food

4
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,275
It's strange that he never ask for me

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,954
I only give him honey

6
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,396
No matter when to use

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,879
I flied to his lips
millions of time like a bee

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,670
Because to me, even chocolate candy cannot
compare to his sweetness

9
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,518
- Gisela, I have to leave
- What are you leaving for?

10
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,590
- Gisela
- Oh, I see

11
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,799
Come on, let's go

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,119
- Ok, meet you at the English park
tomorrow noon at twelve
- in front the cabin by the lake?

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,318
- Yes, Hans really should
give me a phone call
- I'll remind him

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,632
- Has he calm down now?
- You shouldn't have yelled at him

15
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,275
Everything will be fine

16
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,669
Finally, you should have arrived earlier
Hurry, let's go

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,077
- Is this all?
- the rest has not arrived yet

18
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,469
"German people are shocked by soliders who 
fell into the abyss of death at Stalingrad

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,758
330,000 fellowmen are forced to 
death and extermination step by step

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,957
by the great strategies of our strategists 
meaninglessly and irresponsibly 

21
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,953
Little Sophielein, if you can help Willi
he must be very happy

22
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,279
This is the stamp, and this is the address

23
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,754
Thanks

25
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,557
What to do with the rest?

26
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,589
I'll go deliver them at the college tomorrow

27
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,191
- Are you crazy?
- Willi, did you forget the female
college students demonstrating
at the Germany Museum a few days ago?

28
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,068
- almost succeed
- Gestapo have been in the
first ground alert for this

29
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,879
- Hans... 
- Don't forget our slogans are everywhere

30
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,554
Hans, before we have any new envelopes
we can hide the rest under the board

31
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,108
No need. There is nothing left.
Lack of paper

32
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,636
It's already pretty dangerous
to write slogans on walls at night

33
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,749
But compare with giving out flyers
at campus in the day time...
Do you want to die?

34
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,957
We have to make our best efforts,
cannot wait anymore
Let's bring along the whole city!

35
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,873
It's the most tense moment
of the Stalingrad warfare now.
Nazi's secret agents are all over the campus!

36
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,598
If bolshevists come now,
just to kill them all...  

37
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,875
- At least we can kill them once for all
- If I were you

38
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,269
I won't hope Soviet Union
comes before Americans

39
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,793
Don't you hate bolshevist the most?
Hans, are you crazy?

40
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,918
Don't go to deliver them in colleges!

41
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,669
I'll go when they are having classes,
nobody will be in the hall...

42
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,479
I'll come out soon, entering from
the front gate and get out from the back one

43
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,074
- It's too dangerous!
- Willi...

44
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,876
I will take all the responsiblity
if anything happens.

45
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,679
Won't embroil others

46
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,754
You are going to walk through Schwabing
with a big suitcase?

47
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,239
Let's me take this

48
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,191
Hans, I don't think
we should embroil Sophie in this...

49
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,953
If we were to be checked,
it would be easier for a woman to pass

50
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,192
She is right

51
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,473
Alright, let's go

52
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,157
Alex, meet me in my place at twelve tomorrow

53
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,516
- Starting from tomorrow, no wait?
- We can wait, but Nazis won't

54
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,714
Thanks

55
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,312
Don't work too late

56
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,436
- Goodnight
- Goodnight

57
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,437
Dear Lisa,
I'm listening to Schubert's Trout Quintet

58
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,638
I feel schubert's inspriation
is flowing in air

59
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,277
I can hear the happy tweedle of birds
and little creatures

60
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,072
The piano constantly repeats
the same thematic rhythm
just like a clear, crystal creek

61
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,836
oh, they make me so enchanted
Wish I can hear from you soon

62
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,188
Best wishes, yours Sophie

63
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,278
Not sure if mom still have some jam? 
This brand they only sell turnip juice now

64
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,312
Not conspicuous enough, right?

65
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,432
- We bring the light of hope
into colleges today
- Yes

66
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,114
Good morning!

67
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,555
- Good morning
- We are going to a neurology hospital,
you want to come along?

68
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,356
- Sophie is going to Ulm by bus.
I will be there soon
- Hurry up

69
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,591
Hurry, hurry up

70
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,074
- There are some in the case, Hans
- What?

71
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,557

72
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,033
- No one is up there, wait a second
- I'm going with you

74
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,071
Freeze! Stop!

75
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,351
Stop right now!
You...don't run...stop!

76
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,553
- You are under arrested! Stop, damned
- What's wrong?

77
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,956
- You are under arrested! 
- Ridiculous, how can you arrest us randomly!

78
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,356
- You are the only people upstairs,
come with me
- We were coming out from
the Department of Psychology

79
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,715
- You are handing out fly sheets
- Nonsense

80
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,713
Let go of him,
it's me taking off those sheets

81
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,590
Good you admit that. I'm going to report you
You come with me, both of you!

82
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,038
Believe me, even in my college you cannot 
get away if you are doing that

83
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,951
"German people are shocked
by soliders at Stalingrad..."

84
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,349
Come in!

85
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,515
So many? Unbelievable!

86
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,113
- They are all here?
- Yes!

87
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,509
You can go now!

88
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,029
Schmid, write a report

89
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,594
We will catch them all

90
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,996
There...there
This college student seems to
have something in his hands...

91
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,950
Quick, give it to me!
Look, there is one more fly sheet

92
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,998
Give it to me!
Or you want me to do it myself?

93
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,152
They should be put together

94
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,956
- I'm Mohr, national police.
Long live Hitler
- Long live Hitler

95
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,275
This two, they are under arrested for now...

96
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,909
- These are the documents I took over
- It's me took these two guys...

97
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,596
Do you have any ID?

98
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,996
- Ms. ophia Magdalena Scholl?
- Yes

99
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,437
- Mr. Hans Fritz Scholl?
- Yes

100
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,075
- Brother and sister?
- Yes

101
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,189
Female

102
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,357
21 years old...

103
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,875
so, you want to resist Reich that...

104
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,797
has already taken the whole Europe?

105
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,156
when the guy noticed be watched by me
he started ripping the paper in hands

106
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,800
an unacquainted classmate
handed it over to me forcedly

107
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,474
I ripped it 'cause I don't want
to bring any trouble

108
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,672
- Is this your case?
- yes, it's mine

109
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,753
Take it!

110
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,433
I've given the order to close off the college

111
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,837
any teachers and other personnels
shall not leave the school

112
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,559
Sure! certainly I will stay too

113
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,873
- go back and tell Alex to leave me alone 
- Quiet!

114
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,112
Scholl, Hanz, get in the room
to Maller for inquest

115
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,597
follow me, madam!

116
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,553
come here please!

117
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,112
unlock cuff!

118
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,954
Thanks

120
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,833
Let's begin

121
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,759
sit down

122
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,673
Sophia Magdalena Scholl, from Ulm

123
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,716
born on May 9, 1992 in Forchtenberg

124
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,951
Christian, and your father?

125
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,557
Robert Scholl, mayor of Forchtenberg

126
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,071
- any professional nursery education before? 
- yes, I have

127
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,599
currently live in Munich,
NO 13 Franz-Joseph ST.

128
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,274
- landlord's name is Smith?
- yes

129
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,079
- any criminal record?
- none

130
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,148
you have admitted right
in front of the dorm administrator
that it was you... 

131
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,630
who spreaded the fly sheets from balustrade

132
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,790
the fly sheets were on the marble handrail

133
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,714
I spreaded them casually
when I was passing by

134
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,394
why?

135
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,789
it's my nature, see anything,
move anything ...that's it

136
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,117
I admitted it then and there
and I knew ...

137
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,556
I made a stupid mistake

138
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,958
I am very regreted,
but things can not be changed anyhow

139
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,160
Miss Scholl,
you spreaded fly sheets in college

140
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,993
and it has violated
Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung

141
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,914
do you want to know the punishement for
quislism and collaborationism?

142
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,350
- it has nothing to do with me
- imprisonment, labour reform...

143
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,389
- or execution
- it has nothing to do with me, definitely

144
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,910
- cigarettes?
- no, thanks

145
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,914
- but you do smoke, right?
- occasionally

146
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,871
perfect for this situation

147
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,679
just coincidence

148
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,871
why did you bring an empty case to school?

149
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,715
I planed to go to Ulm by car
pick up my clothes in house

150
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,509
- the clothes were taken home
for washing by my mother
- back to Ulm?

151
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,910
it's not weekend now
you want to take that long trip back home?

152
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,555
- yes
- just for some clothes?

153
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,195
not only for the clothes,
I also want to visit a friend
she just had a baby

154
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,351
- and, my mother was sick
- why didn't you wait till weekend?

155
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,637
so you skipped classes?
why did you go home so hurry?

156
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,753
because my friend suggested going to Hamburg

157
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,637
so I want to get back before weekend

158
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,757
I planed to take 12:48 train

159
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,548
and I already made the appointment with
my sister's friend in Heltz Station

160
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,358
you can ask him

161
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,669
- his name?
- Otto Aicher

162
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,832
he started from Solln
and reached Munich at 12.... 11:30

163
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,593
- Aicher, start with an "e"?
- start with "a - i"

164
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,829
you didn't put clothes
in the case to Ulm for washing?

165
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,153
no, I wash my own small clothes

166
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,748
as for the big ones,
no one is needed for washing yet

167
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,950
so, it means you don't need clean clothes yet?

168
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,676
but just now you were saying...

169
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,832
you expressly bring an empty case to home
for washed clothes?

170
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,230
I was thinking that since I went back to Ulm
I should bring next week's clothes too

171
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,915
so you want to go back to Ulm
why did you still come back to school?

172
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,675
I had an appointment with a friend
her name is Gisela Schertling

173
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,230
we planed to have lunch together
in the cabin at british park lakeside
at 12 noon

174
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,436
didn't you go to Ulm?

175
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,795
I desided that today temporarily

176
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,872
I came back to school
to cancel the appointment with Gisela

178
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,630
why did your brother accompany you to the school?

179
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,674
didn't you just come to cancel the appointment?

180
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,879
Hanz and I often go to school together
Hanz wants to go to neurosurgery school

181
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,799
dorm administrator said, about 11 o'clock
you two were on aisle of the third floor

182
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,269
- what were you doing?
- we were on the way searching for Gisela

183
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,239
she was in Pro. Huber's philosophy class

184
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,269
- but that was on 2nd floor
- yes, we were there 10 minutes early

185
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,158
so I took my brother
to psychology department for a look

186
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,955
most of my classes are in 3rd floor,
psychology department

187
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,156
where did you see the fly sheets?

188
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,193
you mean the paper? everywhere

189
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,556
- and you did not even take a look
and see what it written?
- yes, I did, but only a glance

190
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,471
- my brother told a joke about this
- a political joke?

191
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,873
no, he said it wastes paper,
he is just like me
not interested in politics

192
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,550
several days ago,
when a district principal gave speech
in Germany Museum

193
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,551
a bunch of female college students made trouble

194
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,073
were you there?

195
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,874
No

196
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,716
- everybody should be there while in the speech
- I don't attend any politics

197
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,349
what do you think of the speech
given by district principal

198
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,755
as he mentioned...

199
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,469
girls should think about
how to give birth for leaders

200
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,075
while not fooling around in college

201
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,909
He said the ugly one
can marry to his adjutant

202
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,718
This is a taste problem

203
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,153
What you did in university

204
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,471
Already make you a suspect,
I seriously advise you

205
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,189
Don't be hesitate any more
to tell the truth

206
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,756
I deny that I have any connection
with this leaflet

207
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,158
Except the joke I made,
I understand that 

208
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,919
The suspicion for us
before you finds the real wrongdoers. 

209
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,755
- But my brother and
I has nothing to do with this
- Do you really think?

210
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,316
You can hide it before me
when answer the question?
What do you think?

211
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,755
All I told you are truth

212
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,719
Mrs Scholl, my co-worker did not

213
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,799
Find anything leaflet in that case,
you brother's Confession
also proved what you said

214
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,508
You can relax now

215
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,750
I never worried

216
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,671
Let the recorder come in

217
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,997
I will let her to record my statement
You have to listen carefully

218
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,874
If there is any conflict with your affidavit
You must tell me right away
 
219
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,197
- Are you clear, Mrs Scholl?
- Yes

220
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,198
Although this will be kept
in your criminal record

221
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,709
But, we will see 
222
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,398
Maybe you still can go to Ulm
according to the plan

223
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,230
It is over

224
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,320
Metternich! Retirement certificate
Hail Hitler

225
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,953
Mr. Sch¨¹rmer, follow me

226
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,878
You students think you can be here

227
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,279
Fool us?

228
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,479
Please hand out your jewellery, watch

229
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,358
We already made up our mind to 
Use our lives to resist

230
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,349
Do not consider the world surrounding us

231
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,153
- No matter understand the necessity
of this war or not
- Necklace and pendant

232
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,710
The time for a full scale war already comes

233
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,310
Follow me

234
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,159
Let us say farewell to fear
and meaningless hesitation

235
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,276
In this fight with fate

236
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,158
Abide our rule: clean my leather coat
But do not make me wet!

237
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,630
(Means the law deprive citizen's right
for consultation in 1935)
- Please take off you cloth and give it to me

238
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,557
It is great danger

239
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,672
We must put into huge effort

240
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,309
If you still have any illegal stuff, give it me
I help you throw them in to toilet

241
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,917
I am also a prisoner
Now, that time is coming

242
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,712
I have nothing

243
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,112
Please take off your gloves

245
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,154
OK, let's continue

246
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,471
Tomorrow will knee down
to thank us our acceptance for him

247
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,472
Ladies, get in, hurry, hurry,
I want to listen to the lecture

248
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,916
Do you know how my brother is now?

249
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,918
Your brother already had it
He is waiting with other men up there

250
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,713
You are the main suspect
Because you have the case

251
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,072
Leaflets are threw down by your too
Do not admit anything!

252
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,391
I admitted nothing

253
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,435
How long have you been here?
One year and five days

254
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,753
They caught one of my letters, I quoted 
Words that Ludwig-Thoma criticizes Hitler

255
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,229
- Even though, you still work for those people
- They order me to do this

256
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,794
The reason why I am here
Is to prevent you to commit suicide

257
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,911
- Why are you again Nazi?
- My brother and I are communist

258
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,150
Even my brother has a very
senior position in an insurance company

259
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,874
I admire the selfless help in communist party

260
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,678
People have to do something

261
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,710
Scholl Sophia, go with me!

262
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,230
I hope, we never see each other, good luck!
You too, good luck!

264
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,279
Wait here

265
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,751
OK, Mrs, your release paper
You are lucky this time

267
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,914
Please speak up

268
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,434
Understood

269
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,990
Follow me, follow me

270
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,391
You can take off your coat

271
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,513
Sit down

272
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,991
Your father was put into jail for 6 weeks
Because you call our leader is

273
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,588
God's punishment for human being

274
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,068
He was arrested for the crime of conspiracy
 
275
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,119
Also his license was revoked too

276
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,475
I want to know. You join Hitler Jugend

277
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,515
What do you dad think about that?

278
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,313
My dad never influence
our political preference

279
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,391
Typical democrat
Why do you join Hitler Jugend?

280
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,875
Because I heard that
Hitler will bring our nation glory

281
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,198
Good luck and fortune,
everyone will have job and bread

282
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,039
Everybody will enjoy freedom and happiness

283
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,269
- You are single?
- I am engaged

284
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,596
With Fritz Hartnagel
He is a commander of eastern front

285
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,035
Stalingrad?
Yes

286
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,518
- When was the last time
you see each other?
- Half year ago

287
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,597
Have you seen this gun before?

288
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,359
My brother had a gun like this
He was sergeant in army

289
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,358
Why do you have 190 bullets in your drawer?

290
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,274
9mm bullets?
They are also my brother's

291
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,472
When was the last time you buy stamps?

292
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,158
- About two week ago
- Where did you buy,
and how many did you buy?

293
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,919
Leopoldstrasse street, post office 23

294
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,553
Ten 12 cents and five 6 cents
I can't remember exactly

295
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,114
- Only those, you did not buy more?
- No

296
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,117
Have you seen these stamps?

297
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,674
No

298
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,397
- Are you sure you never seen them?
- Never

299
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,873
This was what we found in your brother's room

300
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,750
Why did you never mention...

301
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,155
Your brother has alot stamps?

302
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,919
Your question is when and where
I bought stamps recently

303
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,352
one hundred and fourty?
who needs that many of stamps? for what?

304
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,278
what you need to send out?

305
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,550
compliment to friends and relative,
we are in touch. 

306
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,393
- so, your have seen those stamps?
- I am just guessing.

307
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,671
you found those from
my brother's place, not mine

309
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,151
is this your typewriter?

310
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,790
it was in my brother's room,
we borrowed it from landlord.

311
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,753
- she lent to us to type something.
- what thing?

312
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,917
An essay about philosophy and theology

313
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,276
- not for typing those handbills?
- No

314
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,955
An essay about philosophy and theology?
something like...

315
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,075
"Hitler could not win this war,
only keep it going"

316
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,752
or "a criminal cannot give Germany victory"

317
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,192
or "federation is the future of Germany,

318
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,676
freedom of speech, freedom of religion"

319
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,550
Hans didnt write those

320
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,716
- You wrote those?
- No

321
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,279
- but you believe this kind of world order
- I don't care about politics, and I won't

322
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,039
anyway, we compared all those writing,
and all those bullshit

323
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,277
are done by this typewriter,
then at the beginning of this month,

324
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,393
they are sent to different addresses,
include Munich

325
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,037
I have no idea about this

326
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,113
sit there!
watch it!

327
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,871
all those bullshit were from
your brother's place
and your were there

328
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,877
and he was planning to destroy all those bills

329
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,271
Have you seen those paper before?

330
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,070
- No
- keep your lie, but read this for me.

331
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,470
"two hundred thousands German died...

332
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,075
- just for one war opportunist"
- Does this remind you something?

333
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,994
Is it similar to other six handbills?

334
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,792
Take look at the handwriting

335
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,834
- I dont know
- Listen to me!

336
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,912
this part of evil speaking comes from 
a guy named Christoph Probst

337
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,589
He is a friend of your at lnnsbruck.
We found his letter.

338
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,597
Exactly same handwriting!

339
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,353
Probst£¬is also a student in iatrology

340
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,829
love family and mountains of motherland.

341
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,114
An other do oneself proud bastard
Never understand people are dying at battlefornt.

342
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,915
who is in, beside you,
your brother and that Christoph Probst.

343
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,468
- who did those bills?
- please stop slandering me?

344
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,149
You held back all those evidence from your home

345
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,989
Even I asked you to give me the truth

346
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,031
I just admit what I really did

347
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,033
how about listen this,
your brother, was just like you,

348
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,915
how to explain those evidence

349
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,799
"the military plan failed at eastern line...

350
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,276
U.S.A and british military force
increased unpredictablely.

351
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,109
I conclued that we could not win this war

352
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,597
after painfully thinking in long time...

353
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,315
I believe that avoiding
the meaningless death...

354
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,036
and keeping the integrality of Europe

355
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,234
the only way is finish the war
as soon as possible, in the other hand, ...

356
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,592
I also have deep fear about the way 
we treat the occupation area
and people in the area"

357
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,309
that is just his political point, 
not exculpation to your slander

358
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,509
this is ...

359
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,438
...disorganizing army
and betraying our country!

360
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,669
I dont believe my brother said that!

361
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,952
So you think your brother was lying to us?

362
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,640
Before my brother talk to me personally,

363
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,438
I won't believe that he said those

364
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,311
Eickemayer Studio
you heard about it?

365
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,994
Yes

366
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,039
Eickemayer is at Krakau in recent few months,
he gave the key...

367
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,357
of studio to us, let us take a look

368
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,994
the fingerprint on the copymachine...

369
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,798
they are your brother's

370
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,877
your brother has admited

371
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,350
he designed,

372
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,791
copyed£¬and handed out
all six kinds of handbills.

373
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,475
He tried to make me believe that, he sent out 
five thousand handbills in Munich at one night 

374
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,670
you lived with your brother

375
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,548
you were all in the hallway this morning

376
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,956
and you still want me believe 
that you have nothing to do with this?

377
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,517
you think all these slander
are meaningless? Just admit it!

378
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,997
You and your brother made
and sent those handbills!

379
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,953
YES! and I am proud of it!

380
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,869
what will happen to me and my brother?

381
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,912
You should think about
this at beginning£¬Miss Scholl

382
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,470
- Our relative will be embroiled?
- I can't decide it

383
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,355
- I have to go to washroom
- Not now!

384
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,910
Who draft out these?

385
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,191
- Me! 
- You are lying£¬Miss Scholl!
Juse few weeks ago...

386
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,709
we did the writing check

387
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,719
from the report,
we are sure they are from a male.

388
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,308
Your brother is the author and the planner!

389
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,799
- who mailed out these handbills?
- my brother and I

390
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,109
excuse me, I have to go to washroom

391
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,554
Locher!

392
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,075
Washroom!

393
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,034
follow me

396
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,956
Hurry!

397
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,993
open the handcuffs, it hurts!

398
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,829
What are you doing with them?

399
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,229
you know, Miss Scholl?
there is no leeway...

400
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,272
you know it, next door to the left

402
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,438
Who wrote these banner"Step out! Hitler!"...

403
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,078
"FREEDOM"...

404
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,678
and a crossed NSDAP badge,
University£¬Ludwig street

405
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,076
Marienplatz£¬Kaufinger street
and Schwabing everywhere 

406
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,236
my brother and I

407
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,632
Your brother said after he got arrested£º
"go back home...

408
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,228
tell Alex£¬dont wait for me"

409
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,310
Schertling was right there

410
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,796
He was telling Schmorell to run away?

411
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,550
Hans had a appointment with Schmid, 
he didnt want him wait for nothing.

412
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,275
- You mentioned about your plan to Schmorell? 
- No

413
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,439
- and Graf?
- No

414
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,833
- why are you keep lying? 
- I did not

415
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,794
here

416
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,274
this is your confession!Sign it!

417
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,154
Locher!

418
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,474
take her out!

419
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,755
I heard about Mohr told Locher:
this kind of people...

420
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,072
is what Germany needs
but we have to re-educate them

421
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,193
Maybe they will try to
rebuild your world view

422
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,790
but I will tell you, they may just wait

423
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,073
- why? 
- even the bosses are impatience

424
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,794
a lot people think allied forces will
get into Germany in eight to ten weeks

425
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,071
after that£¬sooner or later£¬
Germany will be liberated

426
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,189
If my mother know I am under arrest

427
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,875
She won't stand the shock

428
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,191
She is over 60,
and she is sick all the month

429
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,751
If Gestapo goes to my house...

430
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,194
she my get in jail cause us...

431
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,675
and your father?

432
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,555
He is 10 years younger than my mom,
he always bring us the immaterial power

433
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,957
your mom is not alone.

436
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,479
Thanks

437
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,239
"we are not silence,
we are the forgotten conscience

438
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,828
White roses let you cannot sleep in peace!"

439
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,997
- Who are "us"?
- My brother wrote this.

440
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,476
at the last line of 4th handbill£º
"please copy...

441
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,513
and pass around",
and here is about resist movement

442
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,229
- doesn't sound like couple peoples' crime
- We dont have organization

443
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,152
How much you know about Willi Graf?

444
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,398
Sergeant£¬he has same major as my brother
came to our house sometimes.

445
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,639
we knew£¬he helped you guys 
copying the handbills at the studio

446
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,717
Maybe you found his fingerprint

447
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,752
- but he went to studio at other time.
- When?

448
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,031
Middle of January, 
We were going to see Eickemayer' painting

449
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,390
that's the reason why
others' fingerprints are in studio

450
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,559
- who were there?Schmorell?
- Maybe, I dont know

451
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,752
I was just there at beginning,
then I went to concern

452
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,959
- Probst brought handbills to Salzburg and Linz?
- No

453
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,232
Hans didn't tell him anything,
cause he has wife and three children


454
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,993
here, you have to tell me the damn truth,
I am asking you.

455
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,112
Who is in?

456
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,197
Graf£¬Anneliese?

457
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,957
I totally met them about 10 times.

458
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,039
- what did you talk about?
- about lecture and science

459
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,836
- My impression of Graf is that
he has no interested in politics
- no interested£¬but knew the inside?

460
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,239
I have to say£¬Graf has nothing
to do with the handbills

461
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,318
- how about Schertling?
- Gisela met me several times.

462
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,228
we studied in same university,
and we knew each other before that.

463
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,956
- she is NSDAP
- as your saying£¬Miss Scholl

464
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,959
The member of resist movement is everywhere
in Germany they all look like
have no interested in politics

465
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,835
It is good for your, is't it? Mr Mohr

466
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,274
As our counting,
this so called "white rose"...

467
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,358
bought ten thousand papers in Jan...

468
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,079
and two thousand envelops

469
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,078
- who did that?
- my brother and I

470
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,957
only hundruds of handbills
for the 1st to 4th.

471
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,677
it makes sense.
472
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,394
But you wish I believe you two

473
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,398
copyed thousands of handills
for the 5 and 6th edition?

474
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,911
- then sent them out?
- we worked on them day and night.

475
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,110
I admire you£¬and you take class
at the same time?

476
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,875
yes£¬we were faking
there are lots of members

477
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,351
we knew£¬your brother£¬Graf£¬Schmorell

478
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,520
Furtw?ngler£¬and Wittenstein served
at eastern line before.

479
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,154
all the people got in university in Munich

480
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,356
any political movement between them?

481
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,960
My brother just told me
about innumerable death.

482
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,595
- but never talked about his comrade
- I don't believe you£¬Miss Scholl

483
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,872
At this period, everyone is careful
about their political speech.

484
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,790
Just like what you say in the handbill?

485
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,511
you found these address there?

486
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,393
copy from phonebook of German museum

487
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,157
let's take a look at Stuttgart:
Jan 27th and the morning after, totally...

488
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,317
sent out seven hundred handbills!

489
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,193
same day at Munich...

490
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,437
about two thousands handbills were sent out.

491
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,269
Just you and your brother
cannot done this job!

492
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,234
I took the fast train
to Stuttgart at 27th...

493
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,916
handbills were in a case,
when I arrived...

494
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,310
I threw half of them
into the post-box of station.

495
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,755
all the left I put
into the post-box at country side

496
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,078
your brother could't be
at Munich in Jan 20th...

497
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,873
when we found the addresses from phonebook...

498
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,118
he sent out an other two thousand handbill
in differnet place? who was helping him?

499
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,795
I wasn't at Munich

500
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,153
who support you money?

501
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,078
my father gave me one fifty each month.

502
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,475
my brother has pay from army

503
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,878
How can you afford your life and 
all the handbills and postage?

504
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,279
everytime you trip to Ulm,
it took you 15 mark

505
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,750
- we borrowed some money from friends
- from who?

506
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,518
here, up left corner...

507
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,794
"E"must stand for income

508
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,357
- it is the backer's name after amount?
- Yes 

509
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,556
your fiance were in?

510
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,750
- so he knew it!
- No!

511
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,154
everytime we borrow,
we give a pretence.

512
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,475
you can ask everyone

513
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,833
my brother and I are the only members

514
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,516
have you thought about
if you and your brother

515
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,437
assume all the crime,
what will happen to you?

516
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,590
We know every name!
