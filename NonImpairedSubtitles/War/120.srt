00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,271
-It won't be any good!
-It's perect!

2
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,077
-It won't be any good!
-I never pick a bad watermeIon!

3
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,590
-Want a bet?
-Sure. For what?

4
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,949
You're on!

5
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,798
Giddy up.

6
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,280
-I have to piss!
-My tummy hurs!

7
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,430
I'm thirsy!

8
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,994
You're the one who's no

9
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,957
HoId on. Get of now...

10
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, my poor IitIe brother
isn't feeIing weII?

11
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,829
Open wide!
Come on! Open up!

12
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,078
Mustafa, you can't
Just Iie there moaning.

13
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,076
WeIcome Keri, my son, are you weII?

14
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,311
Doctor Kirkor despite aII the warnings
our organization has given you...

15
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
...you are stiII treating Turkish patients!
See here, I won't warn you again.

16
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,796
My boy, what diference does it
make if a patient is Turkish, EngIish...

17
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,553
-A sick man is a sick man.
-Don't taIk so much!

18
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,155
Look here! This is the
Iast time I warn you!

19
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,998
Munire, I'm thirsy!

20
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,709
-Wait for me pIease.
-Yes sir Mr. Kirkor.

21
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,839
HeIIo there Mehmet my boy
Is your father home?

22
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,911
He is at schooI UncIe Kirkor. But
Mustafa is upstairs and...

23
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,273
...you are the onIy one who can
save us from his whining...

24
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,794
Don't wory, I'II take care of him.

25
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,235
-HeIIo Munire my girI, are you weII?
-I am fine, thank you UncIe Kirkor.

26
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,269
Why do you caII him?

27
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,309
Are there no doctors Ief that
you have to caII an Armenian?

28
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,236
It's not the first
time he has come here...

29
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,311
He has been Iooking afer us
since we were babies.

30
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,755
I swear, if it were up to these
guys they wouId strangIe us aII.

31
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,200
They use evey opporuniy
they can to get rid of us.

32
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,953
...and you Iet an Armenian
into your house...

33
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,600
You're Just Iike your dad SeIim.

34
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,796
It's Iike I'm Iistening to
UncIe AIi Riza taIk.

35
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,348
What's this got to do with my father?

36
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,437
You haven't eaten your
dinner Mustafa bey my son.

37
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,231
So now I have to give you an
inJection to make you stronger.

38
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,237
Munire pIease...

39
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,469
UncIe Kirkor, if it's aIright,
couId Mustafa eat his meaI.

40
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,472
...and if he doesn't get stronger,
then you couId give him the inJection?

41
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,712
WiII he eat it though? What if he
doesn't Iisten to you again?

42
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,549
-I swear I wiII... ReaIIy!
-He'II do as I ask, won't you Mustafa?

43
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,552
I wiII.

44
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,872
Its bronchitis, Iike before.
Let him rest for a few days.

45
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,110
Be carefuI about what
he eats and the medication.

46
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,280
Otherise this couId
become pneumonia. Goodbye!

47
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,669
Goodbye UncIe Kirkor, thank you.

48
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,591
Let's go.

49
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,710
Sory to bother you Aunt
AIiye, thank you for coming.

50
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,870
Don't mention it my dear.
I hope he is beter soon.

51
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,593
-Mehmet! Don't make too much noise!
-AIright Munire!

52
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,600
Have you seen anyhing
but good from that man?

53
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,636
We are the chiIdren of the war.

54
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,874
We are a generation that grew up, even as
babies, on the sorrows of war stories...

55
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,394
We did not experience any wars
at first hand in Van...

56
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,316
But there was not a singIe househoId that
had not sufered the sorrow of warare.

57
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,998
We Iearned from Grandfather
Rasih in the 93 war...

58
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,832
...from our brother Captain Mithat,
who died in the BaIkan War...

59
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
My mother passed away, unabIe
to bear the pain of that war.

60
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,228
We have aII seen the coId face of war,
but we have never feIt it ''vey cIose''.

61
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,318
UntiI that day...

62
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,237
There dead both of them.

63
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,591
That day I feIt what enmiy was
with my entire hear.

64
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,989
NotJust enmiy...

65
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,712
Hate that came up to our doors and the
war that quickIy caught up our chiIdren...

66
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,353
Friends... We have a visitor
from our IstanbuI branch.

67
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,716
He has brought us the greetings of
Mr. GabrieI, and some instructions...

68
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,950
PIease Brother Amazaso.

69
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,238
-HeIIo brothers!
-HeIIo... WeIcome.

70
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,391
When the Russian army atacks Turkey
we wiII star uprisings everhere...

71
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,153
...and oficiaI buiIdings
wiII be bombed...

72
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,275
Our brothers in the Turkish army wiII
deser from their detachments...

73
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,468
...to Join the Russian army...

74
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,631
-You have spoken to the doctor today?
-I spoke with him.

75
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,439
-It was a vey usefuI interview.
-Our brothers in Van...

76
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,637
...wiII continue to arm
and suppor our organization...

77
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,434
...when the army Ieaves the ciy
successive rebeIIions wiII begin.

78
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,078
May he rest in peace.

79
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,675
My deepest sympathy.
Let's go!

80
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,312
SeIect paricuIarIy those boys
who are of high schooI age.

81
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,672
You wiII train them to shoot...

82
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,955
But don't say they are ''Iearning to
shoot'' or that this is miIitay training...

83
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,832
Give it a more famiIy-Iike
atmosphere, Iike it is a spor.

84
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,640
In this way the young men wiII become
more famiIiar with the rifIe.

85
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,757
And the Tashnak gueriIIas wiII understand
that we aren'tJust kicking our heeIs.

86
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,509
They are geting more and more out
of hand with each passing day.

87
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,479
Find the headmaster of
the high schooI Mr. JemaI.

88
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,155
If he is free, teII him I wouId Iike
to drink cofee with him this evening.

89
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,078
Yes sir!

90
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,833
Inform JemaI Bey of the
Pasha's invitation immediateIy.

91
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,798
Ready! Fire!

92
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,519
Today, I was invited by the
army commander KamiI Pasha.

93
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,919
We had cofee together.

94
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,311
He has found a wonderuI summer task
for you. Training with rifIes.

95
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,992
First you wiII be trained, and
then there wiII be a competition...

96
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,275
When do we star, papa?

97
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,399
I thought you were too iII
even to go to the corner shop?

98
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Ah, papa!

99
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,677
Your turn wiII come.
First the bigger boys.

100
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,351
Fire!

101
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,275
He missed again.

102
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,675
Lieutenant SuIeyman?

103
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,916
My brother missed again!

104
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,633
I and Lieutenant SuIeyman knew each
other since we were chiIdren.

105
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,350
Even when we were Just stared
primay schooI he wouId say...

106
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,350
''I'm going to be a Iieutenant!'' then he
wouId say ''And I'm going to mary you!''

107
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,870
When the war finished he became a
Iieutenant and then we got engaged.

108
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,557
When we were preparing for our
wedding, the TrabIus War began...

109
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,432
...and we said Iet the war finish
and then we wiII get married...

110
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,873
...and SuIeyman went of to war.

111
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,230
You missed? Why did you miss?
Because you are stiII scared!

112
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,549
Don't wory, the rifIe won't go
of right away! Give it here!

113
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,956
Now watch!

114
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,269
You can feeI when the trigger
engages with your finger.

115
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,270
Press untiI the trigger becomes firm.

116
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,635
See, it doesn't go of...
When you feeI it become hard...

117
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,233
Then the rifIe is ready to shoot.

118
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,237
Go ahead, ty!

119
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,111
The TrabIus War finished, and the BaIkan
War stared, SuIeyman went there too.

120
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,788
...it Iasted for to years...

121
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,912
Good Job Mehmet! Do you
think we earned some tea?

122
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,956
Right away Iieutenant!

123
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,790
Years Iater that summer he came.

124
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,160
...and afer aII those years we
imagined Iiving a summer without war.

125
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,119
...even though eveyone was saying that
a great war wouId break out in Europe.''

126
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,554
Sometimes, I think you
Iove him more than me.

127
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,314
-Who, Mehmet?
-No.Your rifIe!

128
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,998
-Thank you!
-EnJoy it.

129
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,119
We were happy. We were pIanning
to get married in the autumn.

130
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,277
Ready!

131
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,872
Fire!

132
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,750
Ready!

133
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,835
Fire!

134
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,756
The resuIt of the firing competition
First pIace...

135
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,320
One of the reasons for Iast year's
defeat in the BaIkan War was...

136
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,880
...as Mahmud Muhtar Pasha said...

137
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,320
''Pride and conceit!''

138
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,235
He wouId say ''AIIah doesn't Iike pride and
conceit, and this is why we were defeated!''

139
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,997
As a nation we don't Iove
each other enough!

140
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,435
This is the actuaI probIem.

141
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,113
At Ieast we don't Iove each other as
much as the peopIe of Western countries.

142
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,798
My request to you as an
oIder brother, as an eIder...

143
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,394
AIways Iove one another, protect
one another, watch out for one another, ...

144
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,273
AIways remain friends. If you argue, don't
stop speaking to one another, never!

145
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,632
AIways keep your hears together.

146
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,473
Both for your own future
and for that of your county.

147
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,870
What is the Iatest
news in Europe Governor?

148
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,993
I am sure you have the
Iatest news from IstanbuI.

149
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,594
They say that it isn't vey
good. Things are heating up.

150
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,831
God protect us, but
if war breaks out...

151
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,274
Then the division might Ieave the town...

152
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,558
Sir, war won't break out inshaIIah
and the division wiII aIways be with us.

153
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,837
-Your ExceIIency...
-Of course, we mustn't faiI to be prepared.

154
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,833
WeII done.

155
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,552
-WeII, good evening my boy.
-Good evening my pasha!

156
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,237
-HeIIo, good evening friends.
-Good evening Pasha.

157
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,636
My pasha!

158
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,070
Your ExceIIency, we are vey
gratefuI for the rifIe training...

159
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,435
...that you have provided for our sons...

160
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,433
However... This...
What does this signif?

161
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,832
Our boys wiII one day, inshaIIah, finish
schooI and then they wiII go to the army...

162
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,955
My hope is that they are
ready a IitIe earIier...

163
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,594
It has nothing to do with the
war or the Tashnak gueriIIas.

164
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,716
The training is not because of them!

165
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,717
-Good evening Headmaster
-Good evening Sermet bey.

166
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,511
May AIIah give you repose.

167
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,273
-Good night Mehmet.
-Good night Ferit.

168
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,350
Didn't I say to you that if you couIdn't
do something, you shouIdn't ty?

169
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,439
Get inside. You have totaIIy
embarrassed me again! Get inside!

170
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,395
Mehmet? Mehmet?

171
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,748
The Ar of War.

172
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,310
...to our beIoved brother Mehmet. First
prize in the shooting contest in 1914.

173
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,750
With my Iove... KamiI Pasha Commander
GeneraI of the 19th Brigade.

174
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,596
-Who are they Sergeant Musa?
-ProbabIy Armenians. They are emigrating.

175
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,438
They are saying that there
wiII be war again sir!

176
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,714
The Russians aren't content with
Kars and Ardahan...

177
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,757
Now they have their eye
on Van and Erzurum...

178
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,235
Oh, these are the good Armenians...

179
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,078
They aren't interested in rebeIIing and aII that.

180
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,674
They Just want to get away
and save themseIves.

181
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:51,792
The gueriIIas wiII Join the Russians
to ty to take eveyhing here...

182
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,109
May AIIah not Ieave us in need.

183
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,510
Even when the enemy is asIeep
one must be aware...

184
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,032
And the enemy isn't sIeeping sir.

185
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,275
Giddy up you nag.

186
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,639
If you don't get me to Van by
afernoon, then there'II be troubIe!

187
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,593
Hear ye... Hear ye!

188
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,908
A generaI mobiIization
has been decIared!

189
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,275
AII soIdiers are to take up arms!

190
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,274
GeneraI mobiIization has been decIared!
AII soIdiers are to take up arms!

191
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,239
We are out of sugar.

192
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,109
Yes, yes we've heard. I wouId be surprised
if there is no mobiIization! Giddy up!

193
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,790
Papa!

194
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,597
-MobiIization has been decIared, Papa!
-That's what they're saying!

195
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,750
-You're not frightened, are you?
-No.

196
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,000
We Just came to town,
we were wandering around.

197
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,958
Fine, then take these provisions home,
and I wiII go see AIi Riza.

198
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,553
Thank you vey much Sergeant
Musa, God be with you.

199
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,710
Thank you sir!

200
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,793
Give a IitIe to the sergeant...
He has rights to it afer aII.

201
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,791
Ok papa.

202
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,348
Here, Mehmet. I'm tired, you
take the reins for a whiIe!

203
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,398
Giddi up you oId nag!

204
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,877
Hear ye... Hear ye.

205
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,351
GeneraI mobiIization has been decIared,
soIdiers are to take up arms!

206
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,393
SoIdiers are to take up arms!

207
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,110
You haven't been around for three days,
so you probabIy haven't heard.

208
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,956
Eveybody in Europe is at each others'
throats; Germans, Russians, EngIish, French.

209
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,350
The big war that eveybody has been taIking
about seems to have finaIIy stared.

210
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,513
That's why there is a generaI mobiIization,
we have to be prepared for war too.

211
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,271
They are caIIing aII the
young men to arms again.

212
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,397
So who are we going to fight this time?

213
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,675
They say apparentIy it is not cIear yet.

214
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,879
Whoever atacks us...

215
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,550
At Ieast it is cIear who wiII atack
us; the Russians for sure!

216
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,517
The Russians for sure, my nephew
has Just come from Erzurum...

217
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,955
He says the Tashnak bastards
are openIy saying that...

218
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,715
...they wiII demoIish Van.

219
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,075
We saw a convoy of Armenians
emigrating, cameIs...

220
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,997
...ox cars, chiIdren...

221
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,277
They have destroyed the county and
now naturaIIy they are running away...

222
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,508
ShaII I teII you something Headmaster JemaI?

223
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,480
You shouId have no mercy
for the enemies of the Turks!

224
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,435
Wherever you find them...

225
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,480
Be right back, papa.

226
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,755
They kiIIed him.

227
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,957
Dear or dear... Are there no Iimits?

228
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,270
Where are you going brothers! You
beIong here, we beIong here.

229
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,112
-Why wouId you abandon your own Iand?
-Don't ty to stop us.

230
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,029
We don't want war or Iand.

231
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,588
We are mereIy tying to find
somewhere for our chiIdren to Iive!

232
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,272
If you are thinking of
your chiIdren, turn back!

233
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,035
Up ahead are Turkish gangs,
they wiII chop you into pieces.

234
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,234
Turn back and wait for the bIessed day.

235
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,392
Our Russian brothers wiII be here soon
and this wiII once again be Armenia!

236
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,919
Come on.

237
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,916
You are making a big mistake, beIieve me.

238
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,035
Those who Iisten to us wiII be saved.

239
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,435
If you want to Iive,
Iisten to us! Don't go!

240
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,674
So, Headmaster, you think that the
situation in the viIIages isn't vey good?

241
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,399
We guessed that the Tashnak activities
had increased to such a degree...

242
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,240
That is why I wasn't surprised.

243
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,392
Look, we have reached such a state that
there is a murder nearIy evey day.

244
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,470
So, it seems that we are the next to Ieave.

245
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,315
You are one of the
peopIe I trust in this ciy.

246
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,348
Thank you, you are vey kind Pasha.

247
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,759
There is no need to
hide things from you.

248
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,956
Information from Erzurum,
from the Third Army.

249
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,237
They say that the Russians
couId atack at any moment.

250
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,275
...and we are ordered to transfer
to the border as soon as possibIe...

251
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,598
Why wory about not smoking at a time
Iike this. Light one Headmaster!

252
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,878
This order is to be kept secret...

253
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,508
We don't want the Tashnak gueriIIas
to Iearn about our deparure...

254
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,955
...untiI the Iast possibIe minute...

255
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,828
But I am going to teach
them such a Iesson.

256
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,118
That it wiII take them a
few months to recover.

257
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,117
Headmaster!

258
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,034
I entrust the young men first
to AIIah and then to you.

259
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,279
How much Ionger do we have
to wait before going into action?

260
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,316
GeneraI mobiIization has been decIared.

261
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,233
They say we shouId wait for the Andronik
Division to Ieave. We have to wait!

262
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,678
-What if they don't go?
-Don't wory. It won't be Iong!

263
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,598
Van wiII be ours, aII ours!
It wiII be ours.

264
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,910
Stop taIking so much and get
busy, come on, get on with it.

265
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,470
It wiII be ours, aII ours!

266
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,590
One day we wiII be freed from
this torment, one day.

267
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,555
We wiII strike to the East and to the
West with Iightning, haiI one day.

268
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,792
We wiII shine in the bIack
cIouds and strike with Iightning...

269
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,712
We wiII send thunder, haiI one day.

270
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,630
From Kars, Batum, the Caucasus...

271
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,076
...we wiII destroy the fors with
the nationaI cannons, one day.

272
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:00,275
We are born as Turks, we wiII Iive as
Turks, and we wiII aIways be Turks...

273
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,558
One day we wiII be free from this
viIe Russian grip, one day!

274
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,397
Bravo! WeII done! Hurray! Bravo!

275
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,757
I swear, he is notJust the great
SeIim, but Yavuz SuItan SeIim.

276
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,954
AIIah! It is time for evening prayer.
We've Iost track of time!

277
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,074
What is happening?

278
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,236
Ferit, where are you
going? It's Iate.

279
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,237
Come here!

280
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,068
What are you stupid or something?

281
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,596
Don't you ever use this?

282
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,560
MobiIization had been decIared,
eveybody is on aIer...

283
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,280
...the streets are fuII of
viIIains and thieves...

284
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,956
Our IitIe friend isn't worried
at aII, enJoying himseIf aII night!

285
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,678
Where are you going?

286
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,910
Come here!

287
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,233
Sit down there and Iisten to me!

288
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,437
The situation isn't good.
War is about to break out.

289
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,079
We have to Ieave Van immediateIy!

290
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,117
Your uncIe has writen to us. He is Iooking
for a safe pIace for the famiIy in IstanbuI.

291
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,556
He asks us to come too.
He says ''Send Ferit ahead''.

292
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,869
Go, get out of here!

293
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,040
My dear, are you hungy?
There are some beans.

294
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,874
No, thank you mother,
I ate with Mehmet!

295
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,272
Look what you've done to this boy. He
can't think of anyhing but his stomach!

296
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,480
Is a war going to star?

297
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,030
If war breaks out... Does
Lieutenant SuIeyman have to go?

298
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,031
Of course he wiII go.

299
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,953
He is the one they reaIIy need
and he wiII be one of the first to go.

300
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,113
-What about you?
-I'm not oId enough yet.

301
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,037
But if they send me of course I wiII go.
Did I do aII that training for nothing?

302
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,313
-But I haven't had any training yet!
-Don't be in such a rush...

303
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,356
You are stiII too young.

304
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,159
By the time it is your turn
the war wiII be Iong over.

305
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,640
Don't think about such things,
it's time to go to sIeep.

306
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,836
May AIIah give you comfor!

307
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,116
Mehmet...

308
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,479
WiII Chubby Ferit go as weII?

309
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,556
Sir, afer the arrivaI of the
48th troop at the border...

310
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,949
Our transition wiII be compIeted.

311
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,835
Are there any questions?

312
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,233
Keep your eyes peeIed...

313
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,594
They have managed to
take away much from us.

314
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,673
If they atack again they wiII be
atacking to take eveyhing!

315
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,032
My father for days has been
taIking about nothing but...

316
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,874
IstanbuI this, IstanbuI that.
It's aII he can think about...

317
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,399
Sometimes... I wish that I was
dead and free of aII this!

318
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,551
If you are going to die
then die in the war!

319
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,714
Why are you wasting
your Iife for nothing here?

320
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,834
We won't be here much
Ionger at any rate!

321
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,631
My father keeps saying ''The
situation is vey serious'' and...

322
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,756
He can't taIk about anyhing eIse.

323
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,990
He says we have to move
as soon as possibIe.

324
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,994
Are you moving or running away?

325
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,874
Why don't you ask your dad
when you get home?

326
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,357
Give him my greetings.
Cowards!

327
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,115
Why don't you Ieave him aIone? What
has he done? The way his father...

328
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,236
If the father is not a man what
can you expect from the son?

329
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
He shouId say ''I'm not going, I'm
not running away''...

330
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,275
He shouId say, there's been a caII up,
why don't you Join up...

331
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,593
Ferit! Wait, I'm coming too. Ferit.

332
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,478
Sometimes you know
sometimes you reaIIy are no good!

333
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,109
-Mehmet, we're going home!
-Don't get wet! Go under the Ieaves.

334
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,550
Come on, we shouId go too. Come
on. Come on, Iet's go come on.

335
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,633
Mustafa! Just Iook at you!
You've onIy Just goten beter!

336
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,433
UncIe Sabri's son died in training.

337
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,750
-They aII went to give their condoIences.
-Why didn't you go?

338
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,230
I couIdn't. I need some more time.

339
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,276
What does this mean?

340
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,039
What do you think? For Mehmet
to give him hear, a present.

341
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,071
-I'II be back!
-When wiII you come?

342
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,914
I'II be here at the first chance I get.

343
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,271
So many days...

344
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,800
So many days... I guess
you didn't have a chance.

345
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,598
...and now you give me this gun...

346
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,320
When are you going?

347
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,037
We're not going anyhere SuItan
Munire. We wiII be here.

348
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,712
Sure...

349
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,914
...and that is what you said when
you went to the TrabIus War.

350
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,838
I didn't see you for three years then.

351
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,268
That was diferent.

352
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,990
BeIieve me my dear,
nothing wiII happen!

353
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,553
What about the mobiIization? And you are
transferring to the border and the war?

354
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,874
Even if you don't go
now, you wiII go in the end!

355
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,839
Take this...

356
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,279
A present from me.

357
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,276
Even my father didn't give
the sIightest indication...

358
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,555
It was onIy days Iater that
I reaIized you had gone...

359
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,716
And without you the ciy was empy,
it had become another ciy.

360
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,833
I am afraid but I am happy!

361
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,039
Because I am gratefuI that
there is no war yet.

362
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,348
And that, inshaIIah,
there never wiII be...

363
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,479
Do you know what saddens me most?
Forget spending hoIidays together...

364
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,870
...but years have gone by and we have not
been abIe to share a Ramadan meaI.

365
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,719
That is fate. Next year, inshaIIah!

366
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,271
May AIIah keep you safe my SuIeyman,
Your Munire.

367
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,354
-May you have a bIessed hoIiday, sir.
-Happy hoIidays to you Commander!

368
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,592
-Headmaster, bIessed hoIiday!
-And to you too.

369
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,351
-Happy hoIidays!
-Happy hoIidays!

370
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,869
Sir, there is a teIegram for you.

371
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,479
The Russians have gone on
the atack towards Erzurum.

372
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,752
The war has stared gentIemen.

373
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,912
3 MONTHS LATER

374
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,029
We don't have enough
ammunition at the front.

375
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,911
Thank God there is fog everhere
and the Russians cannot move.

376
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,115
Otherise they wouId have
destroyed us by now.

377
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,475
We don't have enough
ammunition even for a week!

378
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,471
Lieutenant CoIoneI AIi Ihsan said we had
requested ammunition from Erzurum?

379
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,551
Is there no news?

380
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,269
Erzurum is waiting for more from IstanbuI.
IstanbuI is waiting for more from Germany.

381
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,474
The Germans say it'II arrive tomorrow.

382
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,915
I don't get itas things are
being dragged out so Iong...

383
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,991
...then why are we asking for
heIp aII the way from Erzurum...

384
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,275
...instead of bringing the
ammunitions that are in Van?

385
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,635
Just Iast month we asked for
reinforcements from Van.

386
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,355
They sent eveyone incIuding the
prisoners in the JaiI...

387
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,790
Other than 3-5 guards in the ciy, there
is not a man Ief who can hoId a gun.

388
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,110
Now you suggest that we take
what ammunitions they have Ief?

389
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,720
I pray that KamiI Pasha
doesn't hear you...

390
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,840
...or he wiII make you go
get the munitions in Van.

391
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,880
...and cary them here on your back.

392
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,760
Today we spoke with
the governor of Erzurum.

393
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,918
Our division isn't Ieting the
Russians through, thank God.

394
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:31,637
However... As a resuIt of 3 months of war
there aren't many carridges Ief...

395
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,237
And if repIacement munitions
don't arrive quickIy from Erzurum...

396
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,151
...they say that the situation
wiII be vey serious...

397
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,557
Ibrahim Bey, the commander of the
Home Guard, and myseIf thought...

398
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:52,474
...we have decided to send the remaining
munitions in the ciy to the division...

399
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,314
We are going to send it but
there are no horses or cars Ief.

400
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,716
We wiII send it, we want
to send it but how?

401
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,154
-Headmaster, your tea!
-Thank you Ragip Efendi.

402
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,676
So, Headmaster? What kind
of measure do you suggest?

403
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,989
We shouId cary the
munitions ourseIves!

404
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,788
That is aII fine and weII Headmaster.
How many peopIe are we here...

405
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,314
Let's say we put the munitions
on our backs and set out...

406
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,516
...the front is at Ieast a
five to six day waIk...

407
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,150
What happens if we aren't strong enough and
the munitions Iay wasted in the mountains?

408
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,471
Moreover, if we go, the schooI,
hospitaI, the province...

409
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,477
The ciy wiII aII be
compIeteIy abandoned.

410
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,278
The most imporant thing is
the securiy of our ciy.

411
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,236
Our division broke the back
of the wretched Tashnaks.

412
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,158
However, they are watching us...

413
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,712
If we go, who wiII protect our homes
if, God forbid, there is an atack?

414
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,469
-Sir I have a suggestion, but...
-Go ahead.

415
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,750
I hate to say it but...

416
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:58,595
if there is no other way
I have a 16 year oId son...

417
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:05,518
My onIy forune in this worId, my
onIy possession, the Iight of my eye...

418
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,955
I give you my son.

419
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,233
Let us gather aII the boys of his age who
are at the schooI and in the ciy.

420
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,470
Doctor, what kind of suggestion is that?
I'II pretend I didn't hear it!

421
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,790
Headmaster, I Ieave our
young ones to AIIah and you.

422
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:40,473
Protect them from danger
and accidents...

423
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,031
...the best that you can...

424
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,829
Are we the onIy ones who wiII protect
our homes against the Russians?

425
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,232
Are we to say to our chiIdren
''You are too IitIe, stay where you are?''

426
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,436
At the moment, thank God, the
Russians are not yet at our door...

427
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,356
...the Tashnak gueriIIas
have been broken...

428
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:19,834
No mater how dificuIt it is,
I can see no other soIution...

429
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,115
Go home and ask your
wife about your idea!

430
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,878
Let's see if she is as generous as you.

431
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,512
What kind of a mother wouId agree to send
her chiId on such a dangerous duy, doctor?

432
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,914
What kind of a mother...

433
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,433
What kind of a mother...

434
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,630
We'II take the munitions ourseIves,
the chiIdren are too young...

435
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,955
Doctor if you had suggested that you and I,
onIy us, were to cary the munitions...

436
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,228
...beIieve me, that wouId have
been much more reasonabIe!

437
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,596
But our chiIdren?

438
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,436
Let them take the chiIdren they say!

439
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,955
As if I found my son in the street...

440
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,278
I'm gonna Ioad him with goods and
send him of into the mountains!

441
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,996
Send your own chiIdren!

442
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,272
WeII, I don't understand either, but
Iet's wait and see what happens.

443
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,150
-Good evening.
-Good evening!

444
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,678
As if my son couId save the county!

445
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,236
Open up!

446
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,270
Did you die!

447
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,234
Eveybody in the ciy has
gone mad. Eveybody!

448
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,835
We're Ieaving, star packing.

449
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,520
Don't waste time with trinkets. Just
take what we wiII need on the road.

450
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,949
We'II set up home in IstanbuI again. We'II
set out tomorrow before the sun is up.

451
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,870
Get on with it!

452
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,510
Why are you Just siting there?

453
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,030
Get up now or I'II kiII you!

454
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:15,275
I'm not coming Papa.

455
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,074
What do you mean ''I'm not coming''?

456
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,750
Stay out of it woman!

457
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,236
-How can you taIk to your father...
-I'm not coming!

458
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,758
UngratefuI wretch! You
are no Ionger my son!

459
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,636
Stay here then! Stay and...

460
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,755
Ingrate!

461
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,837
If war breaks out does Lieutenant
SuIeyman have to go?

462
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,836
Of course he wiII go. He is
the one they reaIIy need.

463
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,670
-...he wiII be one of the first to go.
-And you?

464
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,269
If the division wasn't in the
ciy there is no doubt that...

465
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,150
...those murderers, the Tashnak gueriIIas'd
have kiIIed Dr. Kirkor in our own house.

466
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,510
...and us as weII...

467
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,551
Stay away from that!

468
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,635
Haven't aII these seperations
been enough?

469
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,274
How many more peopIe
wiII I have to cy for?

470
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,715
If it were me, I wouId go, Mehmet!

471
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,754
That night, we experienced the
darkest moments of our Iives

472
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,955
One side were thousands of soIdiers waiting
hopeIessIy for ammunition at the front.

473
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,077
Lieutenant SuIeyman... Evey
house had a Lieutenant SuIeyman.

474
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,515
...Ief without ammunition in the
middIe of the war.

475
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,875
In evey house a son, a father.

476
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,274
On the other side those who had
not yet had their fiII of chiIdhood...

477
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,396
...the young sapIings that had
not yet experienced spring.

478
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,475
I couId do nothing...

479
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,109
...haIf of my hear was pIeading,
screaming ''Don't go boys, don't do this...''

480
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,832
WhiIe the other haIf was shouting
''Don't hesitate! Run! Go right now!

481
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,590
My duy is to protect you, not to throw
you out on a dangerous Journey

482
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,351
Is it not our duy sir
to make sure that...

483
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,876
...the enemy does not trampIe
the graves of our brothers?

484
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,879
Yes, yes, this is our duy, yes...

485
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,916
That's my father!

486
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,072
WeII, if it is your father, so what
nephew? What are you frightened of?

487
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,268
What's aII this! This
isn't a barn you know!

488
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,515
-Is he here?
-He's here.

489
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,076
Come and get him
if you think you can.

490
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,677
Ok, ok, Ferit go home.
But you, come inside!

491
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,789
Ferit! Come boy.

492
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,435
You go home son. Your dad
and me are gonna have a taIk!

493
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,028
Look here! I'm Just gonna say this
once; Ieave the boy aIone!

494
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,475
Don't interere with him!

495
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,754
He has made his decision and
he is going with his friends!

496
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,990
He's not going anyhere!

497
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,438
Look here sir!

498
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,069
I'm teIIing you this for your own good
and this is the Iast time I wiII teII you...

499
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,156
How can he go? He's stiII Just a chiId.

500
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,830
We are aII smaII in your eyes man.

501
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,118
You think you are the onIy great person
in the universe, you and AIIah...

502
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,792
If you stiII beIieve in Him that is!

503
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,560
Then you go with him!

504
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,994
Stay with him! I'II give
you whatever you want!

505
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,834
Money, it's aIways money with you!

506
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,396
Is it not enough that you made peopIe
faII outJust for the sake of money...

507
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,710
...so that you wouId get rich?

508
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,998
I haven't done anyhing brother,
reaIIy. I've done nothing!

509
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,278
Stop driveIing brother! Now you
remember who your reIatives are!

510
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,948
What were you thinking when you
soId that Tashnak fiIth weapons...

511
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,031
...for a few pennies?

512
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,793
Now those weapons
are aimed at our chiIdren!

513
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,433
-See what your greed has bought you!
-What weapons? What money?

514
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,793
Say your prayers you wretch!
Say your prayers.

515
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,394
Brother.

516
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,512
Are you stiII tying to fooI us?
Where did you get aII that money?

517
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,235
Where did you get aII that money?

518
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,111
I swear brother I didn't
seII them any weapons!

519
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,717
Brother, I swear I didn't know
the weapons were going to them!

520
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,629
I swear on my chiIdren,
I didn't know brother!

521
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:55,991
If I had known wouId I have done it?
WouId I brother?

522
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,396
-Get out of here now!
-Ok brother!

523
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,271
Leave the boy aIone! Let
him do whatever he wants!

524
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,519
If I hear even a
whisper of something...

525
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:25,150
If I even suspect... I wiII rip you
apar with my bare hands, got it?

526
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,671
Now get out of here!

527
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,716
Ferit! My son!

528
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:12,076
My Iife! Don't Ieave
me, son, don't Ieave me!

529
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:29,108
Now! This is a vey dificuIt and
serious patriotic duy...

530
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:38,632
Those who are wiIIing, of their own accord,
to voIunteer, take one step forard!

531
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,953
My chiIdren! My boys!

532
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:17,152
Any rights you may owe me, any
efor I have made I reIinquish them.

533
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:24,430
BIess you!

534
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,074
BIess you!

535
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,512
That day with a unified desire
on the par of our students...

536
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,036
120 boys were chosen for this great
Journey. 120 chiIdren beteen 12 and 1 7.

537
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,236
First we turned to dressing
them for the weather...

538
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,950
...because this was to be a Iong Journey...

539
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,116
Long and arduous. For days and nights,
they wouId be crossing snoy mountains...

540
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,875
Those famiIies that couId gave sheets,
curains, bIankets, whatever they had...

541
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,520
32 chiIdren who were 15 or over were
given rifIes and were quickIy trained.

542
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,272
PIans were made for our chiIdren on this
Iong Journey. AII detaiIs were considered.

543
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,270
The governor appointed some
soIdiers to provide extra securiy.

544
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,512
''Our chiIdren need these more than we do''
they said and gave them to the convoy.

545
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,234
May AIIah make it compIete!

546
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,514
120 chiIdren...

547
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,909
...as if missing you is not enough,
now the wory of our chiIdren...

548
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,233
...has setIed in our hears.
Our prayers are with you.

549
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:51,000
AIIah keep my SuIeyman safe...
Keep aII of you safe. Your Munire.

550
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,951
Sister!

551
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,235
CouId you give this to Reyhan?

552
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,670
With AIIah's wiII we wiII deIiver the

553
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,797

Once you have stared on your way

Now my boys!

-My IitIe soIdiers!

Oh gIorious soIdier!

01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,628
AIIah's name on our
Iips, AIIahu Ekber!

584
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,229
May our army aIways be victorious!

585
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,110
-39 Idris!

586
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,115

01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,876

01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,393
Come on Iads. Come on.

592
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,996
-I think the time is right.
-Not yet be patient!

593
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,358
Let them get a bit more tired, and
then we'II pick them of, one by one!

594
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,400
Let's get to the horses!

595
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,592
The Tashnak gueriIIas were seen
near the Abadan viIIage, sir.

596
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,430
AIong the route the
chiIdren are waIking...

597
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,440
-There were many of them.
-When were they seen?

598
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,590
Two days ago!

599
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,680
What a state we are in!

600
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,831
They caII us a division, but we
don't have enough forces for anyhing...

601
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,909
Our ammunition is spent, desperateIy
we wait for a handfuI of buIIets carried...

602
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,471
...on the back of our chiIdren,
that wiII onIy heIp for a few days.

603
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,310
This is what happens if you go to war
on the promises of the Germans...

604
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,114
Our own negIect, our own Iack of wiII,
and own incompetence means that...

605
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,350
...our own innocent
chiIdren have to undergo...

606
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,670
...these dificuIties in
the spring of their Iives...

607
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,228
Put together a detachment of
the strong ones, but hury...

608
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,230
Yes sir!

609
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,631
Yes sir?

610
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,750
Be carefuI!

611
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,274

-Here!

616
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,632
The students brigade with 120 students
is ready for your orders sergeant!

617
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,318
Thank you!
At ease!

618
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,112
-Atack!
-What're you doing?

619
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,076
Get down!

620
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,791
Get down!

621
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,395
Atack!

622
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,716
Give me that.

623
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,711
Down! Down!

Agop! Agop! Go! Go around them!

01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,910
QuickIy!

626
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,349
Stay down!

627
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,351
SoIdiers!

628
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,636
Forard!

629
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,076
-Is anyone wounded?
-We are fine, sir.

630
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,278
-Sergean Musa!
-My SuIeyman!

631
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,753
My sister's fianc is
here. They saved us.

632
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,950
We have been saved thank God!

633
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,997
Atention!

634
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,872
Now, Iads. Head for the front.

635
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,395
Those are our men!

636
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,958
Our men!

637
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,476
SuIeyman...

638
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,748
They were in Abadan on the 23rd,
and they passed Tadan on the 24th...

639
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,356
They are coming my dear,
they are coming...

640
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,992
To make the route shorer,
they have Ief the main road...

641
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,355
...and are taking a shorcut
through the mountains.

642
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,151
Thank god!

643
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,751
They wiII come much faster
now they are carying Iess...

644
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:42,148
The governor says they did remarkabIy weII,
to cover eighy kiIometers in to days.

645
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,712
Our IitIe brothers were Iucky those
days as the weather was so good...

646
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,593
No one was worried in Van anymore.
I'II never forget that evening...

647
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,671
...the evening of 24 Januay.

648
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,594
We experienced the first night
of peace of mind in ten days...

649
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,635
Come on Iads. Forard march!

650
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:20,912
Mehmet, the weather is turning. Don't
Iet anyone separate from the Iine.

651
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,236
Eveyone stay cIose.

652
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,470
-Pass it down the Iine.

01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:24,150
Go! Go! Go!

658
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:46,158
Papa! Papa! Papa!

659
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,716
-Papa. Look outside!
-What's the mater dear?

660
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,870
Papa. Look outside!

661
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,951
SIow down, dear.
Don't be so quick to wory.

662
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,951
Papa, where are you going?

663
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,031
To the governor's ofice;
perhaps they have some news.

664
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,315
It's not Iong to morning now.

665
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,839
I can't Iet you go on your own
in this weather! I'm coming too.

666
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,434
-Is the governor in?
-He's upstairs.

667
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,077
PIease come in Miss, I'II take that.

668
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,710
-Teacher JemaI is here, he wants to see you.
-Show him in.

669
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,956
-Headmaster, weIcome. PIease come...
-Thank you.

670
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:12,950
...and sit down. My dear,
come sit here pIease.

671
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,477
Do you have any information
about the chiIdren?

672
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:31,638
I have been tying aII night but...

673
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,954
...the teIegraph Iines are frozen... It is
impossibIe to get in touch with nobody.

674
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,873
We must pray that the
storm hit there earIier...

675
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,039
...and that the chiIdren saw it and
did not Ieave their pIaces, inshaIIah.

676
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,470
There is nothing we can do, but
be patient and wait right now.

677
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,949
If you Iook at the mater from a
positive aspect, Headmaster...

678
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:19,316
...at Ieast the chiIdren
aren't carying anyhing!

679
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,080
Come on Iads! Come on.

680
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:24,153
Those who are in the rear,
hoId on to those in front of you.

681
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,075
Papa... Papa, Iet's go.

682
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,592
Munire!

683
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,476
We waited. We waited the
whoIe day for some news...

684
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:09,238
AII through the day, with the hours
seeming Iike centuries, we heard nothing.

685
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,595
My father and the others wanted to go
up in the mountains and Iook...

686
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:19,276
However, the governor refused
to Iet any parent Ieave the ciy...

687
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,793
UntiI we receive news about our
chiIdren no one is to Ieave the ciy!

688
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,075
Where wiII you go?
Where wiII you Iook?

689
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:31,076
Perhaps they don't even
know where they are...

690
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,309
OnIy AIIah knows where they are.

691
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,915
Get up. Get up.

692
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,669
Mehmet...

693
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,310
Get up. Get up.

694
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,348

695
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,268

Where is my Iove?

699
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:34,555

Granddad, come over here! Make

719
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,391
Granddad, your grandson has passed away.

May AIIah grant those who

What are you saying?
