1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,527
<i>In 1980, a civil war erupted</i>
<i>in the small country</i>

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:05,662
<i>of El Salvador.</i>

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:09,573
<i>It began as a conflict</i>
<i>between the Salvadorean Army</i>

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>and the peasants over land.</i>

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:16,110
<i>The peasants soon organized</i>
<i>and became the guerrilla army</i>

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,649
<i>known as the FMLN.</i>

7
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:21,813
<i>This conflict escalated</i>
<i>into a brutal civil war</i>

8
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,118
<i>that would last 12 years.</i>

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,559
<i>Cuscatanzingo was one of</i>
<i>the last villages trapped</i>

10
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,563
<i>between the guerilla</i>
<i>and the army</i>

11
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,099
<i>Here is where this story</i>
<i>takes place.</i>

12
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:49,039
INNOCENT VOICES

13
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:00,676
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

14
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,630
<i>I'm so thirsty...</i>

15
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,625
<i>...and my feet hurt.</i>

16
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,305
<i>I have rocks in my shoes.</i>

17
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,639
<i>They're going to kill</i>
<i>us for sure.</i>

18
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,294
<i>Why do they want to kill us</i>
<i>if we haven't done anything?</i>

19
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,609
<i>My dad left us and</i>
<i>went to the United States...</i>

20
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,656
<i>...when the war started.</i>

21
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,661
<i>Mom didn't come</i>
<i>out to say goodbye.</i>

22
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,323
<i>She said that now I was</i>
<i>the man of the house.</i>

23
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,606
<i>But first I had to pee.</i>

24
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,935
<i>Two wings.</i>
<i>Who could have two wings?</i>

25
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,609
<i>Two wings to fly.</i>

26
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:15,276
<i>This afternoon in the mountains,</i>
<i>I almost had them...</i>

27
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:21,282
...and the desire to spread
them open over that sleepy ocean.

28
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,311
No, not me!

29
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:44,984
Fito help me!

30
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,987
Help me!

31
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,599
Let's go.

32
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,307
I'm home, Mom!

33
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,312
I'm sorry.

34
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,316
I had to walk Antonio
and Fito home.

35
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,975
Don't they have feet
to find their own way?

36
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,653
You know how
chicken they are.

37
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,593
Don't be late again.

38
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,597
These soldiers
aren't playing.

39
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,604
One day, God forbid, they'll grab
a rifle and shoot you.

40
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,608
You understand?

41
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,610
Yes, Mom.

42
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,407
Temo! Temo!

43
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,590
<i>We were all scared</i>
<i>of turning 12...</i>

44
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,927
<i>...because that's</i>
<i>when the army takes you.</i>

45
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,271
<i>I had one year left.</i>

46
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,279
You know, Ancha?
Me and you are alike.

47
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,946
We are!
We're both little.

48
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,285
-Yes, I'm little.
-Big.

49
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,622
In size, but not up here.

50
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,289
<i>Ancha was my friend.</i>

51
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,631
<i>Everyone said he was</i>
<i>a fish brain.</i>

52
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:52,971
Thank you, Anchita.

53
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,206
<i>But he was the only one who</i>
<i>wasn't scared to have a birthday.</i>

54
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,075
Good. God bless.

55
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,124
Hi, farty sister.

56
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,766
Where were you?
It's late.

57
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,806
-Take care of your brother and sister?
-Don't worry.

58
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,168
Rosita,

59
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,905
don't feed Ricardito
after eight, ok.

60
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,136
Even if he screams.

61
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,849
Why mommy?

62
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,575
I love you.
Take out the garbage.

63
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,415
And close the door, bolt it
and don't let anybody in.

64
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,286
-You're my man of the house.
-Yeah, right, the man of the house.

65
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,826
You don't even know
how to wipe your own butt.

66
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,298
Leave my brother alone!
Come and eat.

67
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,973
He fell asleep.

68
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,582
The mattresses, Chava!

69
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,494
I want my mommy!

70
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,230
Watch out, Chava!
Don't get up there!

71
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,281
Get under the bed!
Quick! Get under here!

72
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,333
Good night.
Good night.

73
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,647
Grandma Mamatoya!

74
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,983
Mamatoya!

75
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,177
-Have you heard from Beto, mother?
-Nothing.

76
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,820
I haven't heard
from your brother...

77
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,620
...since they closed
the university.

78
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,089
Let's hope
he's alright.

79
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,992
We'd know if he wasn't.
Bad news travels fast.

80
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,796
He'll show up.

81
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,372
It was really bad
last night.

82
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,774
And the kids were
alone.

83
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,512
I have to quit my job.

84
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,673
And who's going
to support you?

85
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,850
Why don't you come
live here?

86
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,629
How can we, Mother.
There's not enough room.

87
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,291
I don't mean with me.
Refugio's house is empty.

88
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,301
That way I can keep
an eye on the kid's...

89
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,428
...and help with
their homework.

90
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,506
If we move,
he'll never find us.

91
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,774
Don't fool yourself.

92
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,981
Those who go North
get swept away.

93
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,652
Lift your head up, Kella.

94
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,885
Those who leave suffer more
than those who stay.

95
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,962
and those who stay fight.

96
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,611
Take these savings...

97
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,944
...and buy yourself a weapon.

98
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,272
<i>Since Mom started</i>
<i>working at home,</i>

99
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,280
<i>the war didn't seem</i>
<i>so big.</i>

100
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,617
<i>Beto loves you a little</i>
<i>a lot or nothing at all.</i>

101
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,625
Cecilia!
It's curfew, go home.

102
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,061
Just a little longer.

103
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,198
Angelita, don't worry
your grandma. Go inside.

104
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,302
Please, grandma, five minutes.
Tell her.

105
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:38,803
Bye.

106
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,697
You too, Chava.

107
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,261
<i>One day, there they were.</i>
<i>The Gringos.</i>

108
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,592
<i>The same as they are</i>
<i>in the movies.</i>

109
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,604
<i>They said they were</i>
<i>here to help us.</i>

110
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:26,947
Don Yeyo!

111
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,552
Spit that out, Chava.

112
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,295
-Don't you hear me? Spit it out.
-Why? It's yummy.

113
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,266
Because the men who
gave you that gum.

114
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,302
Are training our soldiers
to kills us.

115
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,298
Not so yummy anymore,
is it?

116
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,243
Angelita finished first
in her class...

117
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,254
...so her grandma is
taking her to the beach.

118
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,586
-But she's a dummy.
-What do you know?

119
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:06,589
Lots.

120
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,259
You wish.

121
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,258
-You too.
-Kids!

122
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,591
-You more.
-Kids!

123
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:12,922
Go to sleep.

124
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:17,936
Get on the floor!

125
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,276
Ricardito!

126
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,278
Ricardito!

127
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:30,949
Get down!

128
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,029
Uncle Mario!

129
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,274
Dear God... why?

130
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:30,934
Why?

131
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,610
Why? What happened?

132
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,614
You drunk!

133
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,282
Wake up!

134
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,291
Go home shame on you.

135
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,623
-I'm going to tell your mom.
-Don't get mad, lady...

136
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,626
-...he'll get his cut.
-Drunks!

137
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,292
It's for the hangover.

138
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,303
What hangover?
Go home!

139
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,239
This time nothing sold.

140
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,579
I'm sorry, Chavita.

141
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,101
Are you trying
to steal it?

142
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:08,295
-What are you doing? Answer me!
Just playing.

143
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,302
-With whose permission?
-I need to work.

144
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,274
-You want my job?
-No.

145
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,006
Take it.
It's yours.

146
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,984
I got you, kid!
I got you!

147
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,519
Why do you like driving?

148
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,594
Because... you go lots
of places...

149
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,899
cruise the streets
and make lots of money.

150
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,132
Yeah, right.

151
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,472
-How old are you?
-11.

152
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,902
Let's see. Stand up.

153
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,336
11 months?

154
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,215
Hold on, hold on.

155
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,180
You want to work?

156
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,316
Here's the deal.

157
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,027
You call the stops,
I collect the fares and drive.

158
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,631
But if you rob me,
I'll cut your balls off. Shorty.

159
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,632
Downtown!

160
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,305
Downtown!

161
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,976
Downtown!

162
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,983
What happened with
the dresses?

163
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,448
Where did you get that?

164
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,589
I didn't sell anything,
but I got a job on the bus.

165
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,056
So you don't have
to work so much.

166
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,525
You should have
asked me first.

167
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,632
Can I?

168
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,738
Will you be careful?

169
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,138
And you'll be back
before curfew everyday.

170
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,873
I promise, ma.

171
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,784
-Where did you get the money?
-I got a job.

172
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,690
-I'm driver.
-Yeah, right.

173
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,262
Did you hear Miss Sol
had a nervous breakdown?

174
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,371
-Why?
-Because of all the shooting.

175
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,302
They say she's
in the nut house.

176
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,928
Chava!
Chava!

177
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,629
The following
boys will form a line.

178
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:31,642
Pablo Argueta...

179
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,640
...Manuel Ayala...

180
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,416
...Antonio Gutiérrez...

181
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:44,989
...José Rendón...

182
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,990
...Alfredo Argueta...

183
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,328
...Mario Sánchez...

184
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,605
-What's your name?
-Temo.

185
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,282
-Temo what?
-Morales Morales.

186
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,280
-Get in line!
-He's only ten!

187
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,585
It's not fair!
How can you do this?!

188
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,452
-Temo! Temo!
-Sergeant!

189
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,298
Sergeant!

190
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,967
Mario Sánchez...

191
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,305
...Arturo Reyes...

192
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,311
...Gerber Reyes...

193
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,318
...Roberto Olsen...

194
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:54,984
Continue.

195
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,326
Roberto Olsen...

196
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,930
...Bardo Pérez...

197
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,928
...Agustin Reina.

198
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,276
Quickly!

199
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,278
Quickly!

200
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,952
You should feel proud,
boys.

201
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,958
You're going to be
soldiers like us.

202
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,966
You will defend
your country.

203
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,306
Sergeant...

204
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:43,633
...let's go.

205
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,280
Who gave the order
to do this?

206
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,606
Step aside, Father.

207
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,277
Worry about their souls.

208
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,980
Hi baby.
How was school?

209
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:04,918
Are you deaf?

210
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,917
How was school?

211
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,589
What's wrong baby?

212
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,935
Tell me.

213
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,601
Did somebody hit you?

214
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,602
-Did the teacher punish you?
-They took Antonio.

215
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,282
-Antonio? Who took him?
-The soldiers.

216
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,018
They took him in a truck
with some other boys.

217
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,613
And they took Temo.

218
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,454
Temo?

219
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,967
To find the common
denominator...

220
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,243
...multiply these two numbers...

221
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,580
-3x4
-12

222
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:03,906
Very good.

223
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,714
YOU'RE UGLIER THAN A FROG.
CHAVA

224
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,869
If you like her so much,
go tell her.

225
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,306
Don't be a chicken.

226
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,372
Hi.

227
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,444
Hi.

228
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,581
I wanted to know
if... maybe...

229
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,618
...if you can... and
if you want to...

230
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,990
...come play with Chele,
Marcos, Fito, Ancha and me.

231
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,592
We're going to fly
paper fireflies.

232
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,301
-Uglier than a frog?
-I didn't write that.

233
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,734
No?
Then who?

234
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:16,979
If you want, we can meet at
Dona Celia's at 4.

235
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,250
Okay.

236
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,763
-Let's go!
-Let's go, Chava!

237
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,329
-The paper fireflies were fun.
-Yeah.

238
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,705
Well... I have to go.

239
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,339
Bye.

240
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,618
Ancha! Lets go!

241
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,002
We were flying paper
fireflies...

242
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,975
...and they started shooting
and we had to run for it.

243
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,980
I'm going to show you some fireflies.
So you learn to be back early!

244
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,653
Sit down and eat.

245
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,345
Stinky girl!

246
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,350
Farty sister.

247
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,619
Sorry, ma.

248
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,115
Yuck...

249
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,789
...that really stinks.

250
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,664
Uncle Beto!

251
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,277
...so mom bought
a sewing machine.

252
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,280
She makes dresses
and I sell them.

253
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,815
And I give her my money
from the bus.

254
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,610
I collect fares
and call the stops.

255
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,288
Yeah? Show me.

256
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,581
Downtown! Downtown!
Downtown!

257
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,622
That's great, Munchkin.

258
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,497
And since mom keeps telling
me I'm the man of the house...

259
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,170
...I take care of my
brother and this one.

260
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,464
Yeah, right.
Especially me.

261
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,141
I'm glad you're
so responsible, munchkin.

262
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,714
Daddy!

263
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,151
Oh, this boy!
He calls every man "Daddy".

264
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,649
-What's your name, little boy?
-Ricardito.

265
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,257
Ricardito.

266
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,034
Mom is worried about you.

267
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,667
Don't disappear like
that again.

268
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,697
You're not in trouble,
are you?

269
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:07,737
My brother takes care
of me and one day...

270
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,675
...he bought me a cookie but
I dropped it and the ants ate it.

271
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,281
Chava, the mattress!

272
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,948
Chava, Rosita!
Under the bed.

273
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,977
Shhh, baby.

274
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,374
Angelita!

275
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:51,047
Angelita.
My God... Help!

276
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,554
Doña Amalia, it's Beto!
I'm coming!

277
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,199
-Beto! What are you doing?
-Angelita!

278
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,835
Angelita!

279
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,575
Get down, Chava!

280
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,076
Get down!

281
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:25,280
Baby?

282
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:28,959
Chava!

283
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,291
-What's happened?
-My girl.

284
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,300
I'm here with you,
don't be afraid.

285
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,936
Chava, press here.
Hard, okay?

286
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:47,978
Uncle Beto!

287
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:57,646
Kella!

288
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,983
Kella!
Stay there! Don't move!

289
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,918
Angelita!

290
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,591
My girl, don't leave me!

291
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,587
-Angelita!
-Help me, please!

292
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,063
My girl is dying!

293
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,267
Don't leave me.

294
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,940
Angelita! Angelita!

295
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,272
-Angelita!
-Baby!

296
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,609
Baby!
Baby!

297
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,612
Oh God!

298
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,951
Please help me!

299
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,610
Angelita!

300
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,289
My girl.

301
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,625
Dear God!

302
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,294
My girl!

303
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,292
dear God,
my girl has died.

304
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,900
What's happened?

305
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,674
Oh God, help me!

306
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,789
Don't cry, baby!

307
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,587
Don't play that Beto.
They'll kill us all.

308
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:33,503
<i>How sad the rains sounds...</i>

309
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:42,681
<i>on the cardboard</i>
<i>rooftops.</i>

310
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:52,219
<i>How sad my people live...</i>

311
00:38:55,266 --> 00:39:00,135
<i>in the cardboard houses.</i>

312
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:11,171
<i>Children the color</i>
<i>of my land...</i>

313
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:15,010
<i>with the same scars...</i>

314
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:20,315
<i>...bellies bloated with worms.</i>

315
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,292
<i>Look at the suffering.</i>

316
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,500
<i>The burden of</i>
<i>the suffering.</i>

317
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,138
<i>Above in the village...</i>

318
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,234
<i>he leaves his pregnant wife.</i>

319
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,913
<i>Below in the city...</i>

320
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,607
<i>he gets caught in it's web</i>

321
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,001
The bullet that killed Angelita could
have come from the guerrilla.

322
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,635
How long have you been
involved?

323
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,342
For a while.

324
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,515
We're preparing an offensive
to disrupt the army, Kella.

325
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,761
This is the only place left between
the capital and the guerrilla.

326
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,263
And it's going to explode.

327
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,625
It's going to get
dangerous.

328
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,634
It's going to get
much worse.

329
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,861
Chava's about to turn 12.

330
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,634
We've got to get
him out of here.

331
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:17,966
Yes...

332
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,973
...your side also
take boys.

333
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,314
Morazán and San Vicente
are liberated areas.

334
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,322
He'd have a roof.
He'd have food.

335
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,323
We're building schools.

336
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,656
What he needs Beto...

337
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,329
...is to be here,
with me.

338
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,994
He's too little.

339
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,997
-lf you stayed here with us.
-Kella...

340
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,332
...you've got
to understand.

341
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,335
The army will take
him away.

342
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,941
At least with me,
he'd be safer.

343
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,344
Let me take him.

344
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,305
-Got a girlfriend?
Just one.

345
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,307
Just one?

346
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,437
-What's her name?
-Cristina María.

347
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,842
The new teacher's
daughter.

348
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,779
She's the prettiest
of all.

349
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:41,992
Listen, Chavita.

350
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,162
What I'm about to tell you
is very important.

351
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,458
So pay attention.

352
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,302
What happened to Angelita
are things that happen.

353
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,866
Chavita, I won't lie and say
things are going to get better...

354
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:01,339
...because they'll get worse
before they get better...

355
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,936
Understand?

356
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,149
This might help you understand
what's going on.

357
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,151
Look for "Radio Venceremos"
here.

358
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,519
It's the voice
of our people.

359
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,657
It's not always on,
so you have to keep looking.

360
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:26,427
But Chava, it's banned
so you have to be careful.

361
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,968
You can find the song
I played last night.

362
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,235
Did you like it?

363
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,914
-Ratón!
-Chavita!

364
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,717
Will I see you again,
uncle?

365
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,821
Next time I'll take you
with me.

366
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:22,519
<i>At this moment we are</i>
<i>broadcasting...</i>

367
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,891
<i>Radio Venceremos, voice</i>
<i>of the guerrilla resistance...</i>

368
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,265
What's your answer?

369
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,233
Hey, no!

370
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:07,262
And you?

371
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,275
I asked you first.

372
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,277
One.

373
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,280
Two

374
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,540
-Three!
-Three!

375
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,286
Can we go out?

376
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,682
-Did you finish your homework?
-Yes.

377
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,489
Okay...

378
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:32,253
...but don't forget the curfew.
Take care of her, Chavita.

379
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,889
Let's go.

380
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,674
Don Yeyo!

381
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:55,643
Hey...

382
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,320
That's, Don Yeyo.

383
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,585
He won't talk to anyone
except to his animals.

384
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,927
Why?
Doesn't he like people?

385
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,260
This song is banned.

386
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,933
My mom says we have to fight
so that nothing is banned.

387
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:27,109
-You're really pretty.
-And you're uglier than a toad.

388
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,286
But I like you too.

389
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,520
Bastards!

390
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,152
Bastards!

391
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,596
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

392
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:15,230
See you.

393
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,209
Let them go!

394
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,280
-Let them go!
-Let them go!

395
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,942
Out of the way!
Move!

396
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,005
-Father!
-To what do I owe this miracle?

397
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,249
Are you okay?

398
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,911
Yes, Chava. Thank you.

399
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,252
The soldiers hit you
really hard.

400
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,262
There are worse pains
than this.

401
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,266
And the girls?

402
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,930
Did they recruit them too?

403
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,262
No.

404
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,605
Are they going
to kill them?

405
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,287
Here,

406
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,290
help me light
the candles.

407
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,431
Get out of the way!
Come on!

408
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,241
Come on!
Are you crazy?!

409
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,250
I hate loudmouth women.

410
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,178
Didn't you see it was
running out of gas?

411
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,016
What?
Was I the one driving?

412
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,386
Can I?

413
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,397
You look like a bald girl.

414
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,385
What's wrong with
you baby?

415
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:53,619
What happened?!

416
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,894
We were working and
we ran out of gas...

417
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,962
...he started sucking gas
from the can with the hose...

418
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,522
...he swallowed half.

419
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,892
You irresponsible
old man!

420
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,630
Daddy!

421
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,638
Daddy, my ass!

422
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:20,316
Get out! Don't come
near my son again!

423
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,316
Get Out!

424
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,329
<i>...in the cardboard houses...</i>

425
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,664
<i>Down comes the workman...</i>

426
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,667
Turn it off. Turn it off!

427
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,627
<i>Below in the city...</i>

428
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:13,291
<i>...he gets caught</i>
<i>in it's web.</i>

429
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,898
That song is forbidden,
Father.

430
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,302
Nothing is forbidden
to God.

431
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,809
I must ask you
to turn it off.

432
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,016
Turn it off yourselves. But
leave your weapons here.

433
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,912
No one may enter the house
of the Lord with weapons.

434

<i>Children the color</i>
<i>of my land...</i>

435
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,640
What kind of crap
is in your head?

436
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,946
What did I do now?

437
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:06,622
Give me the radio.

438
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,289
Why?
I didn't do anything.

439
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,294
Don't lie to me.

440
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,392
I'm sorry, mom.
I didn't mean to.

441
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,468
I won't do it again.

442
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:23,673
I know you won't.

443
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,437
Because you're going to give
me that radio right now...

444
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,308
...I won't do it again.

445
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:36,986
I'm sorry.

446
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,322
Give me that radio.

447
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,049
For the last time,
give me that radio!

448
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:19,588
Don't just sit there sulking.
Help me, fussy.

449
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,665
And don't grunt. Your mother
knows what's best.

450
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,700
Why do you always
take her side?

451
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,839
There's only one
side here.

452
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,305
But you're very touchy,
Chava.

453
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,604
You hear something you
don't like and you run away.

454
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,315
So I can be with you.

455
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,677
But when you're
on your bus...

456
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,650
...you don't see
how bad it is.

457
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,330
And it's getting worse.

458
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:58,100
And you still don't know
how to take care of yourself.

459
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,033
So you have to obey.

460
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:04,636
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

461
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:08,201
-Do you pray?
-What do you mean, do I pray?

462
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,103
Do you pray for
the war to end?

463
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,478
Not for that.

464
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,419
This damn war will
never end with a prayer.

465
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,948
Never?

466
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:36,036
Who would like
to read their poem?

467
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,771
-Okay, Yanira?
-May I go to the bathroom?

468
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,739
Go out quietly
and don't take long.

469
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,947
Let's hear yours, Chele.

470
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,663
None of the kids in my
school want to fight.

471
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:06,266
They don't like war because
they want to play...

472
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:11,235

me and my friends will hide.

474

Don't shoot!

478
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,307
There are kids

No, son!

480

Chava! You're crazy!

481
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:22,764
Go back!

482
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:33,505
Chava!

483
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,270

You let them in the bell tower.

01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:04,959
there will be
no mass today.

489
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,304
But I want to speak
to you here,

490
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,306
on the street.

491
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,706
I want to speak
to everyone.

492
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,069
The word of Our Father
must also be heard...

493
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:22,983
...by those who have not yet
found grace within themselves.

494
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,050
What is grace?

495
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:31,283
Grace is the presence
of the Divine in every one...

496
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,623
...of our actions.

497
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,655
Look around you.

498
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:41,102
The faces of our children
have lost their innocent spirit.

499
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,965
In its place,
there is fear.

500
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:50,307
Because our children have
lost the hope to survive.

501
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:56,576
The skeptics say, if God
existed, there would be no war.

502
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,480
And I respond,

503
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:04,755
...if men would obey the word of
God, then there would be no war!

504
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,999
Because God, Our Father,

505
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:14,527
has given man the privilege
to live in grace...

506
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:18,537
or, on the contrary,
to provoke disgrace.

507
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,977
I assure you, when one
lives in the grace of God,

508
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,407
war does not exist.

509
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,820
Nevertheless,
there are those who...

510
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,721
...ignore their own
divine nature,

511
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,551
and they satisfy
themselves by robbing,

512
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,560
...humiliating and killing
their own kind!

513
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,997
Brothers, it is
the time to raise...

514
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:47,662
...our voices against
them.

515
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:52,000
To defend our right
to live!

516
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:56,337
To use our strength to
oppose the force of death.

517
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:06,783
Today, brothers,
it is not enough to pray.

518
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,222
<i>They closed</i>
<i>the school for good.</i>

519
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,057
<i>Ancha hurry,</i>
<i>walk faster!</i>

520
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,668
<i>Because our village was</i>
<i>between the guerrilla...</i>

521
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,965
<i>...and the army...</i>

522
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,003
<i>...mom decided to move</i>
<i>us to the other side...</i>

523
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,440
<i>...of the river.</i>

524
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,608
<i>She said it was safer.</i>

525
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,270
Grandma Mamatoya!

526
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,345
Boys!

527
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,349
No, Ancha. The table!

528
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:00,002
I like my new house.

529
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:02,581
Why did you change
the station?

530
01:06:03,628 --> 01:06:05,596
Put on Radio Venceremos.

531
01:06:05,763 --> 01:06:08,027
Fito! Shhh.

532
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:15,829
What's up shorty?

533
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:18,735
-When are you coming back to work?
-When I grow up!

534
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,877
Then you're never
coming back!

535
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:37,884
Where are you going?!

536
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,646
You're on! Let's go!

537
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,258
You're going to run
out of gas, shorty!

538
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:02,210
<i>What's wrong little boy,</i>
<i>what's wrong...</i>

539
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:04,243
-Shut up, boys!
-<i>...they ask me at school...</i>

540
01:08:04,482 --> 01:08:08,248
<i>...and at home</i>

541
01:08:09,954 --> 01:08:13,913
<i>Now I know all of the sudden...</i>

542
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:19,252
<i>...when I heard roll call</i>
<i>and she was not there.</i>

543
01:08:21,966 --> 01:08:25,265
<i>The girl with</i>
<i>the blue backpack...</i>

544
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:29,599
<i>...and sleepy eyes...</i>

545
01:08:33,311 --> 01:08:41,616
<i>Got me very excited</i>
<i>and low grades.</i>

546
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:52,296
Super bomb!

547
01:08:53,664 --> 01:08:54,961
Super bomb!

548
01:09:07,278 --> 01:09:09,439
-Antonio!
-What's up?

549
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,170
-Where have you been?
-What are you doing here?

550
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:13,246
Just hanging around.

551
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:15,244
Look at me, like a monk.

552
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:18,251
Every day, more a hunk.

553
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:20,347
-Yeah, right.
-Who do you think you are?

554
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:22,091
Come on, let's play.

555
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:25,489
Do you know how
to skip stones?

556
01:09:28,432 --> 01:09:31,026
When we arrived at the army base
we we're more than 40...

557
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:33,259
the majority 13
and 14 years old.

558
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:36,302
I was one of the youngest,
but I learned fast,

559
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,941
because our teacher was a Gringo
who had been in Vietnam.

560
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:44,170
He showed us how to shoot
and ambush.

561
01:09:44,415 --> 01:09:48,078
Last week we ambushed some
guerrilla motherfuckers,

562
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,787
and I was the one who
caught them with this.

563
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:54,855
You guys are next.

564
01:09:55,993 --> 01:09:58,689
They're recruiting
everybody.

565
01:10:00,331 --> 01:10:01,298
Big ones...

566
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:04,301
...and little ones.

567
01:10:04,602 --> 01:10:07,366
So... are you still a
bunch of chicken shits?

568
01:10:07,605 --> 01:10:10,073
-I'm not a chicken shit!
-Me neither.

569
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:12,599
Fucking chicken shits.

570
01:10:14,178 --> 01:10:16,009
Don't call us that.

571
01:10:25,523 --> 01:10:27,320
You'll be pissing your pants
when they come to recruit you...

572
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,325
...like the chicken
shits that you are.

573
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,687
Chicken shits!

574
01:10:32,363 --> 01:10:33,387
Chicken shits!

575
01:10:45,376 --> 01:10:46,001
Chavitita!

576
01:10:47,378 --> 01:10:48,675
Don't be scared.
It's me, Raton.

577
01:10:58,389 --> 01:10:59,720
I heard shots last night.

578
01:11:00,991 --> 01:11:02,322
Was it you guys?

579
01:11:03,994 --> 01:11:06,292
-We cleaned out the area.
-And uncle Beto?

580
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:08,628
He sent a message.

581
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:13,295
The army is recruiting tomorrow.
Warn your friends.

582
01:11:14,004 --> 01:11:15,301
Hide.

583
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:29,475
Okay drivers, you know what to do.
One under each door.

584
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:32,717
Let's go!

585
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:04,220
"Recruitment tomorrow"

586
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:30,643
Where are the boys,
lady?

587
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:32,306
I haven't seen them
since this morning!

588
01:12:35,019 --> 01:12:35,986
Where are they?

589
01:12:36,053 --> 01:12:38,647
-Sergeant, there are no boys!
-Keep searching!

590
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:55,338
8...

591
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:57,340
...9...

592
01:12:58,375 --> 01:12:59,342
...10...

593
01:13:00,344 --> 01:13:01,276
...11...

594
01:13:02,313 --> 01:13:03,280
...12.

595
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:03,938
11.

596
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:07,276
Did we count right?
Chava is 11.

597
01:13:37,348 --> 01:13:42,308
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

598
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:21,950
Chava!

599
01:14:22,993 --> 01:14:24,153
Wait, Chava!

600
01:14:27,331 --> 01:14:28,298
Chava!

601
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:30,634
Chava!

602
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:38,304
You run fast.

603
01:14:48,018 --> 01:14:50,111
Here. Open it.

604
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:05,598
It's batteries
for your radio.

605
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:07,270
Toad.

606
01:15:09,306 --> 01:15:10,273
Thanks.

607
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,919
"Recruitment tomorrow"

608
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:26,953
We've got a snitch.

609

Father! Father!

614
01:16:29,153 --> 01:16:31,280
They're going to kill Raton!
Help him!

615
01:16:31,855 --> 01:16:32,344
They took
him to the river!

616
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:39,223
-Where's the priest?
-The soldiers took him yesterday.

617
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:25,129
Don Yeyo.

618
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:56,463
Chava! Did you know fat
Marcos left?

619
01:18:57,701 --> 01:18:59,293
-Where?
-To join the guerrilla.

620
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:02,938
-When?
-I don't know.

621
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:06,236
-Chava!
-What?

622
01:19:06,944 --> 01:19:08,241
Maybe we should go too?

623
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:11,239
-To join the guerrilla?
-Well, what else?

624
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,597
Let's count them.

625
01:19:32,636 --> 01:19:33,603
Look at that one!

626
01:19:35,305 --> 01:19:36,272

<i>gave it to me.</i>

649
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:24,290
-Chava, let's go.
-We know where to go.

650
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:07,677
Marco's mom said we have to get
to the Little Face Woods.

651
01:24:35,005 --> 01:24:36,973
Turn off the light!
Shut up!

652
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,638
-Who else is with you?
-No one.

653
01:24:39,843 --> 01:24:41,970
Shut up!
Follow me.

654
01:25:51,181 --> 01:25:54,309
Sleep here. Tomorrow we'll
see what to do with you.

655
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,257
Chele, Chava!

656
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:09,928
Silence! No names here.
Lie down!

657
01:26:11,301 --> 01:26:13,599
-Do you have anything to eat?
-Cookies.

658
01:26:13,803 --> 01:26:14,827
Shut up!

659
01:26:14,904 --> 01:26:16,269
Lie down and
go to sleep!

660
01:26:25,215 --> 01:26:25,977
-Want one?
-Yes.

661
01:27:27,977 --> 01:27:29,945
Hands on your heads!

662
01:27:32,982 --> 01:27:34,609
Wake up!
Wake up!

663
01:27:35,652 --> 01:27:36,619
What's wrong?

664
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:38,617
We've to go. The soldiers are coming.
They're burning everything down.

665
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:41,951
Grab their clothes!
Get dressed. Hurry!

666
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,594
-Where are we going?
-I don't know.

667
01:27:45,662 --> 01:27:48,290
For now, into town
with everyone else. Let's go!

668
01:27:48,665 --> 01:27:49,689
Baby, wake up.

669
01:27:54,671 --> 01:27:56,298
-Where's your brother?
-I don't know.

670
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,638
-Where are we going, grandma?
-We have to leave.

671
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:02,244
-Chava!
-We have to hurry.

672
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:08,250
-Because of the bullets?
-Yes, because of the bullets.

673
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:11,253
Chava! Chava!

674
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:16,258
The Birth Certificates,
where are they?

675
01:28:21,297 --> 01:28:23,595
Put yours and your
brothers clothes here.

676
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:28,767
His clothes are gone.

677
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:31,266
And his good shoes.

678
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:36,278
Where's my brother?

679
01:28:38,982 --> 01:28:39,744
Let's go.

680
01:29:10,613 --> 01:29:12,604
<i>I'm so thirsty...</i>

681
01:29:14,784 --> 01:29:17,014
<i>...and my feet hurt.</i>

682
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:21,450
<i>I have rocks in my shoe.</i>

683
01:30:45,842 --> 01:30:48,037
Take the sewing machine.
I'm going to look for him!

684
01:30:51,047 --> 01:30:53,015
Soldier go home!

685
01:30:53,082 --> 01:30:53,673
Your house is being burned
by a soldier like you.

686
01:30:56,052 --> 01:30:58,020
Murderers! Murderers!

687
01:31:14,771 --> 01:31:15,863
Chava!

688
01:34:49,018 --> 01:34:50,315
Chava!

689
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:50,808
Mommy?

690
01:40:20,049 --> 01:40:21,107
Let's go away from here.

691
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:12,630
His documents are here.

692
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:18,299
I didn't want you to sell
your sewing machine.

693
01:41:22,011 --> 01:41:23,638
Don't worry about us.

694
01:41:43,032 --> 01:41:44,659
Promise me
you'll be strong.

695
01:41:45,367 --> 01:41:46,994
-Promise
-I Promise.

696
01:41:56,378 --> 01:41:58,346
-Bye, farty sister.
-See you.

697
01:42:00,582 --> 01:42:01,514
Be careful.

698
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:03,608
Bye, brother! I'll miss you!

699
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:04,951
Take care of yourself!

700
01:42:08,324 --> 01:42:10,952
Now I'll be the man
of the house.

701
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:44,318
<i>I don't want to go</i>
<i>to the United States.</i>

702
01:42:46,362 --> 01:42:48,660
<i>But if I stay,</i>
<i>they're going to kill me.</i>

703
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,689
<i>But I'm coming back...</i>

704
01:42:55,037 --> 01:42:57,005
<i>because I promised mom,</i>
<i>I would get Ricardito out...</i>

705
01:42:57,072 --> 01:42:58,869
<i>...before he turns 12.</i>

706
01:43:17,326 --> 01:43:20,818
<i>This story could</i>
<i>have been told by Fito or Chele...</i>

707
01:43:20,896 --> 01:43:22,955
<i>...or Cristina Maria.</i>

708
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:25,626
<i>But it was left up to me.</i>

709
01:43:29,338 --> 01:43:30,635
<i>It's for them.</i>

710
01:43:47,856 --> 01:43:51,622
<i>Chava escaped</i>
<i>to the United States...</i>

711
01:43:51,693 --> 01:43:53,820
<i>...where,</i>
<i>with the help of many...</i>

712
01:43:53,896 --> 01:43:56,797
<i>...he reunited with</i>
<i>his family 6 years later.</i>

713
01:43:58,801 --> 01:44:00,035
The civil war lasted

714
01:44:00,035 --> 01:44:03,937
with more than 75,000 deaths,
and around one million exiles.

715
01:44:04,006 --> 01:44:08,773
The United States government
sent troops to train...

716
01:44:08,844 --> 01:44:13,144
the Salvadorean army
and over one billion dollars...

717
01:44:13,215 --> 01:44:14,944
...in military support.

718
01:44:15,017 --> 01:44:18,453
Today more than 300,000
children are recruited in armies...

719
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,853
around the world,
in more than 40 countries.
