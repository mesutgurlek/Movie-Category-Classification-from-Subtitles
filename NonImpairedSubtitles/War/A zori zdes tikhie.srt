IN THE SECOND ECHELON

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,715
What kind of a commander is he
if he cannot find his army boots?

21
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,552
It's right here!
I threw it under the bed.

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,153
Oh, you did, didn't you?

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,872
When fighting men return from the
front line, they like to live it up.

24
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,554
Only I won't stand for any breach
of the regulations.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,552
Comrade Major!

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,958
Five days extra guard duty!

27
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,392
She won't let me milk her without
a kerchief.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,315
You make a report, I'll reprimand
you and send you new soldiers.

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,471
And then it will be the same again,
right?

30
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,156
Try to send me non-drinking guys who
can keep their hands off the girls...

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,879
You mean eunuchs?

32
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,993
As you see fit.

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,312
You can't even maintain order.
Women!

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,950
The civilians aren't under my command,
and they are who make trouble.

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,312
Comrade Major, come in the house.
The samovar is still hot.

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,957
No, thanks, I must be going.

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,712
All right, Vaskov.

38
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,555
And you, section commander, place
yourself at the disposal of HQ.

39
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,150
Yes, sir!

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,550
I'll be sending you soldiers, Vaskov,

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,156
who'll keep their noses out of the
booze and their hands off the women.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,391
- Why can't we stay for a while?
- Let's go!

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,154
Good luck and give them hell!

44
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,959
Calm down...

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,312
- They were such good guys.
- We have only ourselves to blame.

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,313
Our respects to the Commandant!

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,473
Remember us well!

48
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,710
This is no way for Command HQ
to run things. No way at all.

49
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,394
Three days now the depot's got no
protection.

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,872
The Major acted too hot.
He got himself a problem.

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,873
Can't find good soldiers
for our section.

52
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,472
It's quiet here, isn't it?

53
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,473
It's all on account of you women.

54
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,154
I think we should ship
all the females from the front.

55
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,959
To Siberia!

56
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,868
If you did that, who would wash
for you?

57
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,634
This is it. Out you get!

58
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,390
You're here, fighters.

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,472
The anti-aircraft crew is here.

60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,151
With their own commander?

61
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,030
It doesn't look like it, Fedot
Yefgrafovich.

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,472
Thank goodness. When there're
two in charge it's awful.

63
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,712
Hey, boys, the anti-aircraft gunners
are here!

64
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,552
Let's go and see!

65
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,394
Fall in!

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,156
- So you're here.
- That's right.

67
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,195
Attention!

68
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,708
Comrade Senior Sergeant,

69
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,396
1st and 2nd squads of the 3rd section
of the 5th Anti-Aircraft Battalion

70
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,995
are here at your disposal
to defend the depot!

71
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,310
Reporting Section Leader
Kiryanova!

72
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,552
Well... So they've found
non-drinking soldiers.

73
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,157
- Hey, grab this!
- Hurry it up there.

74
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,391
- Move, girls!
- Over here.

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,392
Couldn't you find something lighter?

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,710
Set up the kitchen on the bank.

77
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,393
You won't overstrain yourself.

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,309
Can't stand on your feet?

79
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,311
Step on it, girls, get settled in.

80
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,951
The last anti-aircraft team
was housed in billets.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,470
Sure, only they were men and not
girls.

82
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,156
- What's your name?
- Lisaveta Brichkina.

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,960
- Where are you from?
- From Vologda.

84
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,959
You worked on a state farm?

85
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,632
I did.
But mostly helped my father.

86
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,229
You're a smart girl.

87
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,310
Let's get that table in place.

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,156
All right now. No one leaves camp
without my permission.

89
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,157
- Even to go gathering berries?
- Wrong time of the year.

90
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,028
Can't we even get watercress?

91
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,470
We'll get skinny without extra food.

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,033
Only don't go beyond the river.
There's a lot of it here.

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,869
Lyuda, Vera, Katya, guard duty!

94
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,951
Now just wait a minute!

95
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,559
Anything wrong, Sergeant?

96
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,234
- Katya will be guard commander.
- Well, thanks for nothing.

97
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,554
Posting of sentries should be done
strictly according to the regulations.

98
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,472
And this is just a travesty.

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,793
The regulations...
The regulations to a soldier are his...

100
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,396
The Commander personally authorized
us to do so, Comrade Sergeant.

101
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,153
For military secrecy.

102
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,549
You mind going now?
We've got to get organized.

103
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,551
You'd better think of the amenities.

104
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,031
What amenities?

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,473
Something better than the bushes
outside.

106
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,870
Hard at work, Fedot Yefgrafovich?

107
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,953
Take care and do the right size.

108
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,391
And don't overdo it either.

109
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,033
You're the only man left here.
You know, for breeding.

110
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,714
You'll be changing the roof
over your head every night.

111
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,157
You should be ashamed, Pauline!
You are the wife of a soldier.

112
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,392
- So behave accordingly.
- Come on, Fedot...

113
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,398
A woman lives on caresses,
that's a well-known fact.

114
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,635
So please accept the thanks...

115
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,631
...of all us women here.

116
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,870
Maria, you got any moonshine?

117
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,552
How about tea, Rita?

118
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,629
Time to go to bed, girls. Lights out!

119
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,392
Try knocking before you enter.
This is a barracks, not a stable.

120
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,950
- What is that?
- You mean you don't know?

121
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,312
- It attracts attention. Remove it!
- There's a regulation.

122
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,949
- What regulation?
- Army regulation.

123
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,992
Personnel of the feminine sex

124
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,471
are specially authorized to dry
washing on all fronts for camouflage.

125
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,473
I'll check on that. If it doesn't
exist, I'll take if off and burn it.

126
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,790
Who is going to let you destroy
property of the state?

127
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,155
Property of the state!

128
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,793
He's cute,
but so old-fashioned.

129
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,154
Cut it out!

130
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,315
Air raid!
Action stations!

131
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,959
Move it!

132
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,119
Don't forget your weapons!

133
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,710
Brichkina! Chetvertak!

134
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,951
Move it, girls! Move it!

135
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,554
- First group - right sector!
- Second group - left sector!

136
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,030
Civilians to the dugouts!

137
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,712
Aircraft!

138
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,392
Twelve o'clock high!

139
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,473
Ready, right!

140
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,675
Ready, left!

141
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,309
- Speed one forty!
- Speed one forty!

142
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,949
- Eighteen!
- Eighteen it is!

143
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,389
Short bursts!

144
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,711
- On target!
- Fire!

145
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,869
Speed one fifty!

146
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,235
Twelve!

147
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,549
Ten!

148
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,869
Eight!

149
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,720
Messerschmitts on the right!
Take leader!

150
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,629
Speed one eighty! Long shots!

151
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,389
Fire!

152
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,032
- Range sixteen!
- Range sixteen it is!

153
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,030
Lida!

154
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,389
Fire!

155
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,153
Why are they shooting at both planes?
They should only go for one!

156
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,951
You know it all? The girls are
fighting, and you're hiding in a hole!

157
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,550
Go out and help! Instead of hiding
behind women's skirts!

158
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,155
Everyone stays at his post in a war!

159
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,949
What, Lisaveta? How is she?

160
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,152
- A flesh wound.
- It will heal.

161
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,553
The Messerschmitts are leaving!

162
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,792
At the chassis! At three o'clock!

163
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,792
Speed one forty!

164
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,878
Correct your sights!

165
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,712
Short bursts!

166
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,553
Hit it, Rita!

167
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,870
Fire!

168
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,553
- On target.
- Fire!

169
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,550
A bull's-eye! Hit 'em!

170
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,599
- Hit 'em, girls!
- Kill 'em!

171
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,474
This is where my job begins.

172
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,395
- Where're you going?
- I must take him alive!

173
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,789
Come back!

174
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,029
Well done, Ossyanina!

175
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,788
- His parachute hasn't opened.
- Maybe he's wounded.

176
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,996
He is not going to like it in that
lake anyway.

177
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,800
Don't waste ammunition, you'll miss
anyway.

178
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,155
The other's still holding.

179
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,155
Look, Vaskov's going to swim to him.

180
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,472
He'll bring him in.

181
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,315
I wonder if he'll fall in the lake
or in the forest.

182
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,990
Wait!

183
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,075
She got him!

184
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,879
That makes both of them.

185
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,553
- Bring a stretcher, girls.
- We can carry her ourselves.

186
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,472
No, it's safer on a stretcher.

187
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,948
How she hit him!

188
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,468
Careful!

189
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,468
We did everything right.

190
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,553
No, not right!
They should've been taken alive!

191
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,233
Why don't you just...

192
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,872
You know what, or do you need details?

193
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,629
Attention!

194
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,030
- Comrade Major!
- At ease.

195
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,879
Good work. Who did this?

196
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,151
Junior Sergeant Ossyanina.

197
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,799
Ossyanina and her group.

198
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,792
Very good. You'll get a medal
for this.

199
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,393
No, no medals!

200
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,235
- You took the flyers?
- They fell in the lake.

201
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,550
The first's parachute failed to open.

202
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,153
We were just about to take the other
when she...

203
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,470
- A shame.
- That's what I say, a shame.

204
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,157
Why did they want to make
a reconnaissance over your region?

205
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,799
We have two casualties.

206
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,156
I'll ship them out. I brought you
reinforcements. Get acquainted.

207
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,473
May I talk to you a second, Margarita?

208
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,709
Hello there, new girls.

209
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,155
- How long for?
- As long as we like it here.

210
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,549
Fancy boots.

211
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,712
A high-ranking officer,
and a married man,

212
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,234
gotten pretty entangled...
Well, you know how it is.

213
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,799
What do I have to do with it?

214
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,031
Don't take offence, let me finish.

215
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,154
A member of the War Council heard
about it.

216
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,032
That colonel got transferred,
and I was ordered to take care...

217
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,719
of the said "girl friend".

218
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,154
I see.

219
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,317
- Can I be dismissed?
- You're dismissed.

220
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,233
Hey, girls, here's Rita.

221
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,950
I'm section leader Ossyanina.

222
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,314
Gunner Komelkova.

223
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,039
Gunner Gourvitch.

224
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,470
Why did you turn down that decoration?

225
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,710
I've got an account of my own
to settle.

226
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,316
Well, real independent,
aren't we?

227
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,473
There're some girls I can't
understand.

228
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,870
- You mean me?
- Yes, that's right.

229
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,159
They already told you?
All right, give me a lecture.

230
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,714
You prefer to do it now
or keep till later?

231
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,952
- I had a husband, Zhenya.
- Another girl stole him?

232
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,790
Don't try to cry on my shoulder.

233
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,553
No, he was killed on the third day
of the war.

234
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,392
While he was freezing in the snow
on the Finland front,

235
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,156
his wife was making it
with the regiment horse doctor.

236
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,952
He got the custody of his son
through the court.

237
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,392
And he put him at his mother's.

238
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,150
The garrison under my command
has the right to a bath tomorrow.

239
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,551
Report to me for a soap issue.

240
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,236
That's why I volunteered to come on
this post. To be near my son and mama.

241
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,712
I'm not alone now.

242
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,151
I'll go again tomorrow.

243
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,958
You're a lucky girl.

244
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,151
I've got no one in the whole world.

245
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,158
My brother and sister and mother -
all of them were massacred.

246
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,552
- There was an air-raid?
- No, they shot them.

247
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,152
The high-ranking officers' families
were all executed.

248
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,470
An Estonian woman hid me
at her place.

249
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,151
I've seen everything.

250
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,714
How about that colonel, Zhenya?

251
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,152
How could you do it, Zhenya?

252
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,791
Well, I did it...

253
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,796
Major Luzhin
reporting for duty.

254
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,392
Welcome.

255
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,949
This is my daughter, Zhenya.

256
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,394
I did it.

257
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,953
Give me two rations, for me and
Tatiana.

258
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,631
- Who's going to scrub my back?
- The Senior Sergeant.

259
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,030
Well, he's one who wears pants.

260
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,793
Let's draw lots for him.

261
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,312
Oh, he's just
an old boor

262
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,994
with a 20-word vocabulary, and all of
it Regulations.

263
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,152
In any case his housekeeper's
not complaining.

264
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,708
That's not true!

265
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,550
Did you hear that? She's fallen
for him!

266
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,552
Our Brichkina got a case
for that Chocolate Soldier!

267
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,871
When's the wedding?

268
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,233
Shame on you!

269
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,872
Keep to yourself everything
those women tell you.

270
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,950
Sure, you know best, a hero's widow!

271
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,992
You'd better shut up. You yourself...

272
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,550
I think I ought to warn you,
Comrade Senior Sergeant,

273
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,314
you're getting on my nerves and
I have nothing to lose.

274
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,472
What did you say?

275
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,951
Let's not start quarreling, girls.

276
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,550
Let me read a poem for you.
All right?

277
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,551
What's the matter, you silly one?

278
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,554
I don't know, Rita.
I don't know anything...

279
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,393
We lived all alone on the edge of
the forest.

280
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,152
My father was a ranger.

281
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,551
My mother always said to me,

282
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,473
"Just have faith, daughter.

283
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,316
Maybe your happiness
is just around the corner.

284
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,949
Anyway, it won't pass you by."

285
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,959
So you are leaving?

286
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,472
Yes, tomorrow.

287
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,394
- Who's there?
- It's me.

288
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,393
Feeling lonely?

289
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,313
That's right.

290
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,552
You mustn't do silly things,
even if you're lonely.

291
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,390
In the spring he sent me a postcard.

292
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,551
You should study, Lisa.

293
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,950
Come to the city in August.
I'll get you into a technical school.

294
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,157
That was last year, in 1941.

295
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,880
Have faith, Lisa. Don't give up
hoping.

296
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,154
Maybe you will find happiness around
the corner.

297
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,710
And maybe it will be tomorrow.

298
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,793
Only I have already turned my corner.

299
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,790
Sonya, read another poem.

300
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,477
I loved you once: Of love, perhaps,
an ember

301
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,950
Within my soul is not extinguished
yet;

302
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,949
But let that be no prompting to
remember,

303
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,473
Or be a cause of sadness or regret.

304
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,475
I loved you once, quite hopeless,
dumbly tender,

305
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,031
By jealousy and diffidence oppressed;

306
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,713
I loved you once with such complete
surrender

307
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,715
As may God grant you may again be
blessed.

308
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,552
What is it?

309
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,233
What's the matter?

310
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,871
Ossyanina's so lucky.

311
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,032
She had the time to get married
and to have a child.

312
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,394
And I've been a prisoner of this
uniform since I was 18!

313
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,914
Don't say that.

314
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,153
You'll have everything one day.

315
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,952
Zhenya, he's a married man.

316
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,711
But I love him, Dad.

317
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,392
Stop it!

318
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,315
- Comrade Colonel!
- What do you want?

319
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,709
Here, sir!

320
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,154
Zhenya!
What are you doing here, Zhenya?

321
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,472
What are you doing?!

322
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,031
Stop it!

323
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,478
Murderers!

324
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,391
What's wrong, Zhenya?

325
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,868
You're not the only one
with an account to be settled.

326
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,790
- Who's next?
- Komelkova.

327
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,549
- And next?
- Chetvertak.

328
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,391
- Take this, Rita.
- No, you shouldn't.

329
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,470
Take it.

330
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,790
- Next one.
- Yolkina.

331
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,234
Thank you.

332
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,154
Don't be mad at me, girls, I...

333
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,710
I overheard everything you said
yesterday.

334
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,155
I promise I'll keep it a secret
forever.

335
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,157
I've got some sugar, concentrated
milk. I always get some left.

336
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,719
Get ready for the bath.

337
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,393
Take it, Rita.

338
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,709
Section, halt!

339
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,711
At ease. Break ranks.

340
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,030
- Going fishing, Comrade Sergeant?
- No, swimming.

341
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,555
The water's so cold you'll freeze
to death.

342
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,915
It's much better in the bathhouse.

343
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,958
What if a crab grabs you?

344
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,629
Come with us. We'll scrub your back!

345
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,835
- Lisa, stop it.
- Wait!

346
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,472
Go to hell, all of you!

347
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,719
Hi, girls!

348
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,788
Oh, Zhenya, you look like a mermaid!

349
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,391
Your skin is shining through!

350
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,791
They should make statues of you.

351
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,799
You're so beautiful...

352
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,710
Putting a shape like that in an army
uniform...

353
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,713
Let's get some steam up in here!

354
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,153
Hey, you kids!
Don't touch anything!

355
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,632
Well, this is great!

356
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,712
A good hot steam bath
is a soldier's greatest friend.

357
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,235
When we'll be all old
and play with our grandchildren,

358
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,948
I guess we'll remember this steam
bath.

359
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,152
First we have to get our own children.

360
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,994
Hey, girls, look at this!

361
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,151
Lingerie is my weak spot.

362
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,714
If you dare to wear that weak spot,
I'll see you get an extra guard duty.

363
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,713
I already did so much extra duty for
that I won't know the difference.

364
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,713
- And you wore it anyway?
- What would I wear it for?

365
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,952
Oh, girls, I look so homely.

366
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,551
Oh, cut it out, Galka.

367
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,233
Come here.

368
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,878
Look how slim she is.

369
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,790
We'll make a beauty out of you!

370
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,233
- How about having a ball?
- Great idea!

371
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,392
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion, just to spite!

372
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,632
This is our village.
This is Lake Legonte.

373
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,953
Murmansk Railroad's along here.
And the White Sea Canal.

374
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,953
And arrows and circles all around.
I wonder why.

375
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,711
All the routes are marked, too.

376
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,632
They know everything.

377
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,873
Not everything.
They know the route around the lake.

378
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,552
And the marshes are indicated
as though they can't be crossed.

379
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,552
The girls have borrowed Pauline's
phonograph. They're having a party.

380
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,315
So watch out. All the steam
could make them thirsty.

381
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,993
I'll give them a party!

382
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,879
Come on.

383
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,952
Oh, Zhenya, you're a sorceress!

384
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,152
I only wish there were men to dance
with.

385
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,031
Okay, I'm willing to stand in.

386
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,312
N.K. Krupskaya State Orphanage

387
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,714
As he was saying:

388
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,473
Will you belong to me?

389
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,953
So my life be

390
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,391
Passion and fire.

391
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,032
A smile so charming,

392
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,868
Eyes' fascination

393
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,232
Promised forever

394
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,153
A bliss of desire.

395
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,555
To me, poor heart,
So he was saying,

396
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,792
To me, poor heart,
So he was saying,

397
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,035
Though he didn't,

398
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,712
No, he did not love.

399
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,317
No, he never, oh never loved me.

400
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,234
Misha!

401
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,868
Misha!

402
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,552
We're leaving today.

403
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,719
This is for you.

404
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,394
Thank you.

405
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,392
I know you love it.

406
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,231
The Germans have taken Minsk.

407
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,153
I don't know how.

408
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,949
Yes, sir.

409
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,235
Here comes that man about town.

410
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,550
- The Commandant.
- Vaskov is coming.

411
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,870
Why are you so scared?
Attention!

412
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,993
Comrade Garrison Commander!

413
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,151
The section under my command
is in recreation.

414
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,994
Four guards have been posted.
No casualties.

415
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,514
Many thanks for the bath.

416
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,950
Senior Sergeant Kiryanova
reporting.

417
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,552
Go on, dance. I'll watch a little.

418
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,713
- Will you make it back in time?
- I'm afraid I won't.

419
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,630
- A Russian dance.
- I'll ask him.

420
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,029
What dance do you like best?

421
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,960
Time to hit the sack. Reveille is
at 6.

422
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,391
Wait, Rita.

423
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,632
Zhenya, sing for us again.
The Senior Sergeant will like that.

424
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,869
No, girls, the show is over.
Regulations.

425
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,710
Yes, we could use some sleep.

426
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,798
Well, I guess I'd better be going.

427
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,316
Stay a little, Pauline.
You'll get soaked through in the rain.

428
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,473
Well then, in that case...

429
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,391
I don't feel like sleeping.
It's still light outside.

430
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,552
That's enough. Hit the sack, girls.
On the double!

431
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,392
Comrade Commandant!
Comrade Commandant!

432
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,959
Comrade Commandant!

433
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,948
What is it?

434
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,393
Germans in the forest.

435
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,155
- How do you know?
- I saw them. Paratroopers!

436
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,393
Two of them, with machine guns.

437
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,871
Give the alert!
Send Kiryanova to me! Move!

438
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,155
Yes, sir!

439
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,389
Prepare for action!

440
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,799
Kiryanova, Vaskov wants you!

441
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,869
Two Germans!

442
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,551
Seen by Sergeant Ossyanina.

443
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,872
I've put the troops on general alert.
I think we should comb the area.

444
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,958
May I have your permission to do it?

445
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,156
There're only two of them.
I could handle both of them myself.

446
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,628
While the trail's still hot.

447
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,599
Yes, Comrade Major!

448
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,232
What were you doing in the forest
at 4 in the morning?

449
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,552
Nature's call.

450
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,159
I myself constructed
that latrine for you.

451
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,152
Or is it too small?

452
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,315
There are some things
a nice girl doesn't have to explain.

453
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,155
There're no girls here!

454
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,948
Only soldiers and their commanders.
We're at war.

455
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,152
And until the war is over
we're all going to be neuter.

456
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,552
Is that why your bed still unmade,
Comrade Neuter Senior Sergeant?

457
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,949
Attention!

458
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,709
At ease.

459
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,314
Ossyanina, pick out the volunteers.

460
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,038
Zhenya!

461
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,711
- Galka!
- Wait a second, Ossyanina.

462
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,550
This is a manhunt for Germans, not
a dancing party.

463
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,394
And Germans armed with automatic
weapons.

464
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,879
- They must know how to shoot.
- They'll manage.

465
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,633
May I come too?

466
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,552
I have nothing against it.

467
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,550
Now one more thing.
Anyone here speak German?

468
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,949
I can.

469
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,032
Haven't you read the regulations?
How do you answer?

470
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,959
Gunner Gourvitch!

471
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,631
Where are your caps?

472
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,789
Say in German, "hands up".

473
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,393
Hande hoch!

474
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,549
That's right.

475
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,869
All right, I'll take Gourvitch.
We'll be leaving for two days.

476
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,959
Are you alone, Maria?

477
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,153
Yes, alone.

478
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,154
If we happen to run into the enemy,
or into some strange thing,

479
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,312
is there anybody who knows how
to make birdcalls or animal noises?

480
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,232
I asked a serious question!

481
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,318
Out in the forest we can't use speech.
The Germans have ears also.

482
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,835
I know one.

483
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,873
- One what?
- A donkey bray.

484
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,878
Sounds real.

485
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,475
There aren't any donkeys here.

486
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,872
All right, we'd better try quacking
like the ducks. I'll show you.

487
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,155
That's how the drake calls to
the duck.

488
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,472
Two quacks will mean
the enemy's in sight.

489
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,033
Three quacks means get back to me.
Is that clear, comrade gunners?

490
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,791
Form a rank!
Move it, move it! Brichkina!

491
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,949
Attention!

492
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,994
My second in command during
the course of this operation

493
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,708
is now officially
Junior Sergeant Ossyanina.

494
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,552
Don't forget about the ducks.

495
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,389
Left turn, forward march!

496
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,634
Come back soon, girls!

497
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,709
Zhenya!

498
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,790
In double column, march!

499
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,710
Galka!
Don't do anything stupid!

500
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,553
Your mother and father living?
Or are you an orphan?

501
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,634
An orphan? For all I know
I could be an orphan.

502
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,553
You mean you're not sure?

503
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,633
Who can be sure of anything these
days, Sergeant?

504
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,029
You're right.

505
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,037
My folks live in Minsk.
I studied in Moscow, and then...

506
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,793
- You haven't heard from them?
- No, nothing.

507
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,472
- Your folks are Jewish?
- Naturally.

508
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,635
Naturally. If they were in Moscow,
they'd be all right.

509
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,152
Maybe they managed to escape?

510
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,472
Those dirty sons of...

511
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,632
If you want to swear, go right ahead.
I'm getting used to it.

512
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,472
- Are you hurt?
- No.

513
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,313
All right, Gunner Gourvitch, quack
three times.

514
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,155
- What for?
- To be sure everyone's on their toes.

515
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,958
You forgot my lessons?

516
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,915
What's wrong?

517
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,029
If anything were wrong,
you all would be dead by now.

518
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,317
You came running through the under-
growth like a herd of heifers.

519
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,708
- Are you tired?
- Not a bit.

520
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,032
That's good. Did you notice
anything on the way here?

521
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,472
Not much.
A tree branch broken back there.

522
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,032
Very good. Absolutely right. And you?

523
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,231
Everything seemed normal to me.

524
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,029
- The dew was knocked off the bushes.
- Good eyesight!

525
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,551
Very good, Gunner Brichkina.

526
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,395
There were also two tracks
made by the boots of paratroopers.

527
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,032
Judging by the toes,
they're heading around the marshes.

528
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,713
That's going to take them
a twenty mile hike at least.

529
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,872
So much the better.
And we're going straight across.

530
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,314
How?

531
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,873
Not here, of course.
I know a trail.

532
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,030
Now take ten minutes for a smoke
and wash your hands.

533
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,633
Cut that out!

534
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,553
On your way!

535
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,958
Stay close together!

536
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,719
Is it very deep?

537
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,795
In some places...
It can come up to...

538
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,952
It can come up to your belt.
Keep your weapons dry.

539
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,629
Follow me! Step where I do.

540
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,314
Of all the filthy...

541
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,951
- Komelkova, keep going!
- I am!

542
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,869
Come on...

543
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,159
Don't come near her, Chetvertak!
Ossyanina, get out by yourself!

544
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,549
Go on, Galka.

545
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,392
- Comrade Sergeant!
- What do you want?

546
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,951
Keep going! Or we'll all sink!

547
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,310
One of my boots has come off!

548
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,313
- Can you see it?
- No.

549
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,393
- Where are you going?!
- I'm trying to help her!

550
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,711
Hold it! There's no turning back!

551
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,155
Brichkina, stretch out your pole.

552
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,314
Come on out of there, Komelkova!

553
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,879
Follow me! Forward!

554
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,633
How about my boot?

555
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,030
You can't find it now.

556
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,960
Come on, Komelkova. You'll make it.

557
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,038
Hold on, Zhenya!

558
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,874
Keep going, keep going.
The island's not far now.

559
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,312
Keep going. Forward!

560
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,549
Follow me, in my tracks.

561
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,755
Tired?

562
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,234
It's nothing.

563
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,153
Are there leeches here?

564
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,392
There's nothing here.
It's a dead place.

565
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,232
Don't be scared.
That's just marsh gas.

566
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,952
The local folks say
the old man of the woods lives here.

567
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,154
- Who?
- A kind of devil.

568
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,552
Just old wives' tales, that's all.

569
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,879
They're sometimes right.

570
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,239
Don't hurry, walk slowly.
Now we can take a rest.

571
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,028
Oh, that feels good.

572
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,879
Hard work, huh?

573
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,712
- You can say that again.
- Rest for a while.

574
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,952
What a bungler you are, Galka.
You should've squeezed your toes.

575
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,559
I did.

576
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,031
Don't worry. We'll make her a special
swamp boot.

577
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,715
I see.

578
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,996
- Only after the marsh. Can you wait?
- I can make it.

579
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,151
After the bath, this is all I needed.

580
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,157
I'm wet through, right to my...
I mean to my army belt.

581
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,153
Why haven't I put on my lingerie?

582
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,469
Zhenya!

583
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,799
On your feet!

584
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,552
Take your poles and follow me
in the same order.

585
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,873
We'll get dry and warm up
on the other side.

586
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,710
Zhenya, you got a mirror?

587
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,313
Zhenya, will you comb my hair?

588
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:51,473
You're cute enough as it is.
Comb it yourself!

589
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,549
- Zhenya, no time for that nonsense!
- I'm coming.

590
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,234
Everyone ready? You can come now.

591
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,473
Well, Comrades of the Red Army,
everybody okay?

592
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,472
All in order, Comrade Senior Sergeant.

593
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,952
- Not too cold?
- There's nobody to warm us anyway.

594
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,391
- You'll be steaming soon.
- Why?

595
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,959
Here, put this on.

596
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,880
So that's a swamp boot.

597
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,157
- Comfortable?
- Fine. Even better than the boot.

598
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,949
Let's get going. We've about an hour
and a half foot-slogging to do.

599
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,559
All right, on the double!

600
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,152
Move it, girls!

601
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,630
- Warmer now, Komelkova?
- No steam yet!

602
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,879
Here the Sinyukhina Crest starts
to rise.

603
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,315
On the other side of the crest
there's another lake.

604
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,871
It's called Legonte.

605
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,791
A monk by that name
used to live here.

606
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,712
He was looking for wordless peace.

607
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,029
There's enough wordless peace here.

608
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,870
The Germans have only one way through:
By the crest between the two lakes.

609
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,316
And endless strife,
Peace only a dream-like yearning.

610
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,796
Through blood and dust,
A horse of the steppe is running,

611
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,152
And tramples grass...

612
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,878
Comrade Gunners!

613
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,872
The enemy in the form of two Germans,
is moving to the Lake Vop sector,

614
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,396
intending to secretly approach
the Kirov Railroad

615
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,474
and the White Sea Canal
named after Comrade Stalin.

616
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,072
I intend to engage the enemy
in this position

617
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,878
and force him to surrender.

618
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,870
Should the enemy offer resistance,
I'll kill one and take the other alive.

619
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,312
- Everything's clear.
- So keep well out of sight.

620
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,393
- Let me do all the talking.
- In German?

621
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,556
In Russian! And you'll translate if
they don't understand. Is it clear?

622
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,391
If you stick your head out like that
in combat,

623
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,032
there's no field hospital nearby,
and no mamas either.

624
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,549
You should engage the Germans
at a distance.

625
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,554
Before you get to pull the trigger,
you'll be riddled all through.

626
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,153
So I order you to stay on the ground.

627
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,710
Stay on the ground until
I order you to open fire.

628
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,958
Or I'll forget that you're women and...

629
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,472
And no sleeping on guard duty!

630
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,710
- Germans?
- Where?

631
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,555
Damn it...
I thought that...

632
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,951
Get some rest, Fedot Yefgrafovich.

633
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,152
It's all right, Ossyanina.
I just dozed off, I guess.

634
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:21,318
It'll be the everlasting rest for me
if I miss those Germans.

635
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,633
What if they kill our officer
or blow up an important object?

636
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,791
How would I explain to the Army
Tribunal

637
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,715
that, instead of combing the forest
and catching those Germans,

638
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,791
I was sleeping somewhere.

639
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,152
Felt sorry for the girls?

640
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,313
Was afraid to lead them into an
attack? That's not an excuse.

641
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,791
No, it's no excuse if I haven't
carried out my mission.

642
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,789
Maybe they're asleep too, now?

643
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,788
- You bet.
- They're humans, too.

644
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,555
You said that the crest is the only
way for them to approach the railroad.

645
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,553
- And it is about...
- Forty miles.

646
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,315
In unknown country,
and seeing death behind every bush.

647
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,950
Margarita... what's your patronymic?

648
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,878
Just call me Rita.

649
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,789
Do you mind?

650
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,471
To a valiant defender of his country.

651
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,788
A present.

652
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,028
- Want a cigarette, Rita?
- I don't smoke.

653
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,793
And that Germans are humans too,
somehow I'd never realized that.

654
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,958
I'm glad you said it.

655
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,157
- Is it dyed?
- No, it's real.

656
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,393
Mermaid.

657
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,156
Can't a girl comb her hair here?

658
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,958
Go on, put yourself in order.

659
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,712
Sergeant,
can I ask you a question?

660
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,312
You can.

661
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,394
Are you married,
Sergeant?

662
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,950
Yes, I am, Gunner Komelkova.

663
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,711
And where is she?

664
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,878
She's home, where should she be?

665
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,394
Any children?

666
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,959
Children?

667
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,880
There was a boy.

668
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,232
What do you mean, there was?

669
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,039
Just that. My mother couldn't save him.

670
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,393
Why?

671
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,395
My wife had walked out on us.

672
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,391
Rita, you should tell him everything.

673
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,390
I will when we get back.

674
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,556
I can see you're a well-trained
soldier, Gunner Brichkina.

675
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:19,034
You're well organized.
And your quacking is just great.

676
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,232
- Did you notice anything?
- Nothing much.

677
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,037
Keep your eyes open, Lisaveta.

678
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,954
If there's any movement in the bushes,
if the birds seem upset.

679
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,153
You're a forest girl, you see
everything.

680
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,152
It's beautiful, isn't it?

681
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,151
As if there's no war.

682
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:54,794
Lisa, Lisa, Lisaveta,
Sweeter than a baked potato.

683
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,795
Choose the husband here before you,
Or I'll go and choose him for you.

684
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,315
That's a little song we used to sing
back home.

685
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,631
Are you from these parts, Sergeant?

686
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,870
I've been stationed here a while.

687
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,718
And back home we used to sing...

688
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,155
We'll sing together later, Lisaveta.

689
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,712
When we've accomplished
our mission, then we'll sing.

690
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,234
- You promise?
- I said so, didn't I?

691
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,472
Don't forget,
Comrade Sergeant!

692
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,153
Those born in the years of bane,

693
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,390
Don't remember the path they tread.

694
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,396
We, the children of Russia's pain,

695
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,800
Haven't the strength yet to forget.

696
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,711
Those burning years of destruction!

697
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,237
The harbinger of madness, or of hope?

698
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,712
The days of war, the days of
insurrection

699
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,073
Have stamped our faces with a bloody
glow...

700
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,793
Have stamped our faces with a bloody
glow.

701
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,632
Who are you reading to?

702
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,711
- I asked who are you reading to?
- No one. To myself.

703
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,632
Then why read aloud?

704
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,038
It's poetry.

705
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,153
You're straining your eyes.

706
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,152
But it's daylight, Comrade Sergeant.

707
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:26,630
I was just talking, that's all.
Don't sit too long on those rocks.

708
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,634
When they cool, they'll draw the heat
from your body. Put your coat under.

709
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,039
All right, Comrade Sergeant.
Thanks for the advice.

710
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,631
And don't do any reading aloud.

711
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,714
The evening air is thick and humid,
and dawn is quiet around here.

712
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,394
A voice can be heard nearly five
miles away.

713
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,158
To Sonya. Ever yours, Misha.

714
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,632
What are you huddled there for?

715
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,039
I'm cold.

716
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,879
Let me feel your head.

717
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,711
You have a fever, Comrade Gunner.

718
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,552
Touch of the marsh shakes.
On account of that lost boot.

719
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,790
You'll take it straight, or shall I
cut it?

720
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,870
- What's that?
- Medicine.

721
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,237
- Medicine? It's alcohol!
- Yes, alcohol.

722
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,868
No, I won't!

723
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:36,318
Drink it.
That's an order.

724
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,709
Drink up!

725
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,959
Oh, mama...

726
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,233
Hold your breath!

727
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,552
You'll see your mama
only if you survive.

728
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,151
Oh, I've gone all bubbly inside.

729
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,551
That's nothing. You'll simmer down
in a while.

730
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,475
- You'll get cold without your coat.
- Don't worry, I'm strong.

731
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:21,035
I want that fever gone by tomorrow.
So do your best. Make an effort.

732
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,472
I'll make an effort.

733
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,312
After the war, there'll be mother
for each survivor.

734
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,789
What? The Germans?

735
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,157
- Lie down. Orders are to sleep.
- How is Galka?

736
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,595
- Where's Rita?
- She's up there with Vaskov.

737
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,959
What?

738
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,798
You hear that?

739
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,959
That's birds.

740
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,033
Yes, magpies.
The magpies are all upset there.

741
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,550
It means someone's coming and
upsetting them.

742
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,236
Quick, go wake up the troops.
Get moving. Send Gourvitch over.

743
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,790
Keep under cover! Hush!

744
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,992
Good morning, Comrade Sergeant.

745
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,549
Morning. How's Chetvertak?

746
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,951
Sleeping. We didn't wake her.

747
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,631
Right. Stay beside me.
And keep your head down.

748
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,719
I will.

749
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,038
There they are!

750
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,952
See them?
There they are. The two of them.

751
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,629
Three.

752
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,153
Four.

753
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,548
Five.

754
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,799
Six.

755
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,470
Six. Seven.

756
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,870
Eight. Nine.

757
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,712
Nine. Ten.

758
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,959
Eleven.

759
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,473
Twelve.

760
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,554
Twelve. Thirteen.

761
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,152
Fourteen. Fifteen.

762
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,950
Fifteen. Sixteen.

763
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,393
Cuckoo, cuckoo in the sky,
how many years before I die?

764
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,709
One.

765
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,235
Two.

766
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,949
Three...

767
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,073
End of Part One
