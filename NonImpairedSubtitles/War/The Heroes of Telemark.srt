Major Frick! Major Frick!

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,151
Tell the commandant of Rjukan

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,272
that an attempt has been made
on the Reich-Comissar's life!

6
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,790
Arrange for 15 civilians
from Telemark to be shot in reprisal!

- Like the look of it, gentlemen?
- Most interesting.

11
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,316
We are well informed
of what you do, Herr Nilssen.

12
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,159
Just experimentation with heavy water.

13
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,999
With deuterium oxide. Yes, we know.

14
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,191
Nilssen, l must tell you...

15
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,678
the time has come to make
a transition from theory to practice.

16
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,350
You've done enough experimentation,
my dear fellow.

17
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,759
This room has more significance for us
than you can possibly realise.

18
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,192
One day perhaps he will realise,
don't you think, gentlemen?

19
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,277
Forget about fertilisers.

20
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,471
This factory is required by the Reich

21
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,478
to increase its production
of heavy water by 400%.

22
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,514
We want 10,000 pounds
of heavy water by Easter next year.

23
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,030
- That's impossible.
- Not at all, Herr Nilssen.

24
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,879
What is necessary
will always be accomplished.

25
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,311
All the more so when the whole future
of the Reich is at stake.

26
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,752
All the technical details
have been worked out in Berlin. Look.

27
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,112
Notice also our modification
of the deuterium formula.

28
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,313
But what is the reason?
l don't understand.

(Shots echoing)

30
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,273
That was a firing squad, my dear Nilssen.

31
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,395
Let it be a warning.
Major Frick will be in charge of security

32
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,636
and it will be the maximum.

33
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,799

Sorry, he's busy.
He's working in the darkroom.

You can't go barging in

Could be there all afternoon.

He wants your opinion on something.
He says only you would understand it.

55
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,033

- Slow ahead both.
- Slow ahead both.

Get that pole.

Passes, sir.

137
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,269
What the devil is heavy water?

138
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,439
lt's a liquid with a heavier hydrogen
structure than ordinary water.

139

lt possesses properties
useful in atomic energy.

What's the significance of the Germans
ordering this vast increase?

141
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,111
ln the formula that Nilssen sent,

142
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,154
the Germans have added
a new component to the equation...

143
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,116
Wait till that formula's been examined

144
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,517
by Professor Einstein
and Dr Oppenheimer in New York.

145
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,748
Surely it's something more than just
a doubt that brought you to England?

146
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,191
lt is. lt's a very great fear.

147
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,110
lf it's justified,
we'll know about it soon enough.

148

151
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,155
A moment, gentlemen, would you mind?
Thank you so much.

152
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,119
This is Professor Sir Roderick Logan.

153
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,676
Gentlemen, perhaps l should tell you -

154
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,871

incidentally, Professors Einstein,
Fermi and Oppenheimer concurring,

162
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,232
the scientific and military consensus
in America is...

163
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,628
that the Germans may be ahead of us

164
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,957
in the race to achieve
controlled atomic fission.

165
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,116
lf they are ahead
and they get their atomic bomb...

166
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,311
they've won the war.

167
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,714
There you are, Knut.
How are you? Come in.

168
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,996
- Come in, Mr Straud.
- Thank you.

169
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,720
- Come on in. Take a chair.
- Thank you.

170
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,515
We've examined the situation carefully

171
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,188
and it's been agreed
in London and Washington

172
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,750
that the factory making heavy water
must be destroyed.

173
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,750
l agree with you, Bill, that bombing
is the most obvious method.

174
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,751
At the same time, we wish, if we can,
to avoid large-scale civilian death,

175
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,111
which is also the wish
of the Norwegian government.

176
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,915
l suggest that Dr Pedersen,
who knows what's at stake,

177
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,271
and Mr Straud,
who knows his country backwards,

178
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,359
be asked to return to Telemark
in order to resolve this question.

179
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,028
That is to determine, with objectivity,

180
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,789
whether a ground attack by commandos
is practical or not.

181
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,558
Agreed?

182
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,193
Agreed.

183
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,552
- How do we get back to Norway?
- The simplest way. By parachute.

184
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,239
We're miles off course
but l know where we are.

185
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,670
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

186
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,711
Yes, if you're a reindeer.

187
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,640
Where do we go from here?

188
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,593
l'm taking you
to one of my radio operators.

189
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,950
He's our contact with London.

190
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,991
Now what?

191
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,155
Over that mountain. A farmhouse.
Another one of my operators.

192
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,590
(Wind howling)

193
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,711
l know this place.

194
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,677
Oh, Knut Straud!

195
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,595
- Come in. How are you?
- Fine.

196
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,477
Wonderful to see you.

197
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,995
- Hello, Anna.
- Good God, what are you doing here?

198
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,033
Well, just dropped in for a cup of coffee.

199
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,633
Uncle!

200
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,751
- Uncle!
- What is it?

201
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,270
- Rolf is here.
- Oh, damn!

202
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,590
- Hello, Uncle.
- What on earth are you doing here?

203
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,189
Mr Straud, always good to see you.

204
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,960
- You know each other too?
- We've met.

205
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,756
What a surprise. l had no idea
you were all such good friends.

206
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,791
Hadn't you?

207
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,270
You ought to know we've put you
in danger by coming here.

208
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,790
- What?
- We're working for the Resistance.

209
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,468
You? You're not serious?

210
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,638
- Well, he got me into it.
- Was that wise, Knut?

211
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,308
You seem to know each other quite well.

212
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,517
Oh, everybody knows everybody here.

213
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,188
Let me introduce you to my ex-wife.

214
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,269
- Can we have some coffee, Anna?
- l've no time for coffee.

215
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,596
l'm working for the Resistance.

216
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,837
We both can't be working
for the Resistance.

217
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,871
You look terrible.

218
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,674
He's been dragging me around
for two days.

219
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,759
There's pyjamas and hot water upstairs.
Go up to the bedroom.

220
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,119
l take it you know the way?

221
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,516
Yeah, l know the way.

222
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,950
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

223
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,959
lt's odd to have him in the house again.

224
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,119
What's odd about it? You and he
shared the same bed for two years.

225
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,551
As far as l remember,
you damn seldom got out of it.

226
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,994
- You should be asleep.
- l just thought l'd drop in.

227
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,031
All in the line of duty.

228
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,075
To discuss Resistance tactics
with a fellow fighter.

229
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,032
How's your resistance these days?

230
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,868
Fine. How's yours?

231
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,678
Mine?

232
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,396
Well, it was great until l met
that boy scout, Knut Straud.

233
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,431
Well...

234
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,313
l was content, l had a good life...

235
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,035
and now look where l am.

236
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,231
lt's exhausting
to commit yourself to others.

237
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,319
You still commit yourself beautifully.

238
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,351
Like you always did.

239
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,394
l'm not your wife now, Rolf.

240
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,518
l know.

241
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,235
You're not anybody's wife, are you?

242
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,318
- Go to bed.
- Sure.

243
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,988
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

244
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,071
You mean you would?

245
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,717
- You know what you were born for.
- No.

246
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,071
You know what you were born for.
Tell me.

247
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,511
Say those things to me.

248
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,554
Your voice...never out of my head.

249
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,432
You're the same. You're my love...

250
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,313
Yes, you are.

251
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,240
You've got the words wrong, Rolf.

252
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,633
You see, it's not so easy
seducing your ex-wife.

253
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,479
Students are much easier, aren't they?

254
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,633
l just don't believe in you any more.

255
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,830
- Anna...
- Please go.

256
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,831
Please.

257
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,071
Sleep well.

258
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,870
We'll make this our main transmitter hut.
Can't risk the farm.

259
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,833
l'll make sure Nilssen is at the church.

260
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,155
Good.

261
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,033
Uncle, be careful.
The town is full of Germans.

262
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,279
Merry Christmas, Uncle.
See you in church.

263
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,311
Merry Christmas!

264
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,035
(Congregation sing Silent Night)

265
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,232
Sigrid.

266
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,197
That's Arne's wife?

267
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,355
l've got a message for you from Arne.

268
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,076
- He's in England. He's fine.
- Will you see him again?

269
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,150
l have a message for him too -
he'll be a father in the spring.

270
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,354
They'll have their 10,000 pounds
of heavy water by Easter.

271
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,997
The marker - microfilm of the factory.

272
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,031
Exact details.

273
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,554
(Gurgling)

274
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,628
Ammonia and hydrogen pipes.

275
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,559
You see how close it is to the village?

276
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,711
Look how near the factory is
to their homes.

277
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,037
Look at the rabbit!

278
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,718
Land mines.

279
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,559
(lndistinct shouting)

280
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,471
Come on.

281
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,637
(Door opens)

282
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,671
(Soldier) Excuse me.

283
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,994
l don't think l've seen you
in Rjukan before. Who are you?

284
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,433
l've come to, er, visit my fiancée...
for Christmas.

285
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,676
l see. Your fiancée.

286
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,509
How very charming indeed.
And what is his name?

287
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,870
- My name...
- l'm asking her.

288
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,036
Jan Christensen.

289
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,992
Mm-hm.

290
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,308
Let me see your identity card, please.

291
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,351
Certainly.

292
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,911
Excuse me.

293
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,111
Here it is.

294
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,035
Oh.

295
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,712
Uh-huh.

296
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,430
Your text, l believe?

297
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,151
Yes, sir.

298
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

299
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,437
Auf wiedersehen.

300
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,997
Oh, and the compliments
of the season to both of you.

301
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,789
- How did you like our town, Rolf?
- l liked it.

302
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,549
You should have seen
the torch-light parades we used to have.

303
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,591
Yes. Every November.

304
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,873
Flaming torches. You could see it
from miles away in the mountains.

305
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,231
- The snow was whiter then.
- Yes.

306
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,829
lt was all the lights on the snow.

307
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,511
Then we made snowballs and threw
them at the torches. Remember, Knut?

308
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,835
(Rolf) This is a detailed layout
of the factory.

309
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,839
They've got 3,000 pounds of heavy water
ready to be shipped to Germany.

310
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,271
Let's decide on what message
we send to London.

311
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,433
There's only one message.

312
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,760
We've examined the area. Consider
ground attack totally impractical.

313
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,993
Recommend alternate method.

314
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,191
You mean to bomb it?

315
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,916
Yes.

316
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,793
lt would destroy Rjukan
and everybody in it.

317
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,998
Possibly.

318
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,871
Bombing is impossible. The factory
is deeply embedded in a gorge.

319
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,193
The one way across that gorge
is a narrow bridge 75 feet long.

320
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,914
Two men could hold off a battalion.

321
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,557
l can get inside that factory with ten men
and blow it sky-high!

322
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,228
They've got 88mm guns on every hill.

323
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,274
And without destroying
an entire village in the process.

324
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,994
Barbed wire, land mines.

325
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,034
- 6,000 lives. Do you realise...?
- Anna, keep out of this.

326
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,194
This is something that affects the world.

327
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,755
l don't give a damn about the world.

328
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,873
l'm talking about my town,
her town, his town. We live there.

329
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,436
l'm talking about people.
Do you understand? People!

330
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,235
You weren't so squeamish
when hostages were being shot.

331
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,590
lt's more important than a few trucks...

332
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,837
- l was doing my job.
- And l'm doing mine!

333
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,077
l don't like it and l didn't ask for it.

334
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,839
Anna...

335
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,068
you live here, it's natural you want
to save your own people's lives but...

336
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,748
this is something that has to be done.

337
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,479
lt's important.

338
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,672
lmportant enough to kill 6,000 people?

339
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,199
Yes.

340
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,753
Look...

341
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,794
l want to know what's so important
about heavy water.

342
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,719
l don't make the rules. l can't tell you.

343
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,480
l want to know
and you're going to tell me.

344
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,830
l'm telling you nothing.

345
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,750
Do you think that l'm going to sacrifice
the lives of 6,000 people

346
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,633
on the opinion of a playboy scientist?

347
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,879
For what? l want to know
and you're going to tell me.

348
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,308
You want to know what it's all about?
All right. l'll tell you.

349
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,196
That's what it's all about.

350
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,798
You understand?

351
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,639
- Of course you don't.
- Why, you...!

352
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,233
Stop it! Stop it!

353
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,670
l thought you boys
were here to fight the Nazis.

354
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,115
Why don't you both send in reports
and let London decide?

355
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,788
- All right.
- Fine.

356
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,876
See, Anna?

357
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,995
Knut and l fight but we still manage
to live with each other.

358
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,999
(Engine spluttering)

359
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,513
l know you're anxious
to get back to Norway.

360
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,917
Knut Straud and Rolf Pedersen are
on the mountains of Telemark waiting.

361
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,351
The main assault group -
the Royal Engineers Commando -

362
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,790
will come in two or three days.

363
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,391
We're counting on you to get
a glider landing strip on the lake ready.

364
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,876
Well, happy landings. Best of luck.

365
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,914
(Laughing)

366
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,238
Where have you been? We've been
halfway round the Arctic Circle!

367
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,230
We've been waiting for your message
for five weeks and it hasn't come!

368
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,637
- l'm starving!
- We're expecting company tomorrow.

369
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,308
- 50 commandos.
- They land tomorrow.

370
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,636
l've got a message for you from Sigrid.

371
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,673
You're going to have a baby
in the spring!

372
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,679
- How is she?
- She's pregnant.

373
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,196
Rolf!

374
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,072
- Who are you?
- My name is Jensen.

375
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,033
- What do you want?
- l'm on a hunting trip.

376
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,310
Hunting for what?

377
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,750
You'd better come with us.

378
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,600
l won't say a word. Ever.

379
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,472
On my honour.

380
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,908
Look...

381
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:07,035
My village is Hochlai.
Anyone there will tell you who l am.

382
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,109
l hate the Nazis, believe me.

383
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,675
My wife is in a Gestapo prison.

384
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,757
Listen. Her father's name is Yon Trend.

385
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,155
- That's why she's in prison.
- Trend?

386
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,919
- The Resistance leader?
- Yes.

387
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,838
lt fits.

388
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,871
Shoot him.

389
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,718
We'll keep him.

390
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,629
You can't risk the whole organisation
because of one man.

391
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,912
- l'm with Knut.
- l think Rolf is right.

392
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,951
So do l.

393
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,715
We'll have a show of hands.
Those against shooting him.

394
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,356
We'll have your skis. Take them off.

395
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,513
(Jolly whistling)

396
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,953
(Men join in humming)

397
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,911
Listen.

398
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,151
(Faint whirring of engines)

399
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,949
(Engines spluttering)

400
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,273
(Whining as plane dives)

401
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,471
l still can't believe it.

402
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,674
- They weren't even Norwegian.
- 50 British commandos.

403
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,110
ln a flash, the whole operation's over.

404
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,630
The waste. That's what
l can't get out of my head.

405
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,155
They're not going to be wasted.

406
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,593
We're going ahead. Tonight. Now.
As if they were with us.

407
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,270
- lt's the same plan. We all know it.
- What are you talking about?

408
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,438
We're going to complete
the mission ourselves.

409
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,552
- Knut, you're mad.
- We'd better wait.

410
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,230
lt'll be months before
they can mount a similar assault.

411
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,510
- Knut...
- lt's our only chance.

412
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,951
lf we win, those men won't have died
for nothing tonight.

413
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,072
There were 50 of them. Only nine of us.

414
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,999
- You won't even be nine.
- What do you mean?

415
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,835
l'm sorry, but l'm not going on
such an impossible mission.

416
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,478
Oh yes, you are, Rolf.
You're coming with us.

417
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,390
You're the only one who knows exactly
where that dynamite must be placed.

418
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,513
After tonight, that factory's
going to be jumping with guards.

419
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,359
- He's right.
- Now listen! Listen to me!

420
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,872
They have completely wiped out
our entire assault force, right?

421
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,117
- They'll be feeling safe.
- You don't have a chance.

422
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,356
50 men died tonight.

423
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,189
They came here to help us.
They weren't even Norwegian.

424
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,639
Well...who's coming with me tonight?

425
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,719
lt's ten to 12. This is an operation
launched by the British.

426
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,754
We'll wear British uniforms
so the Germans won't shoot hostages.

427
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,710
(Knut) The attack will take place at 3:15.

428
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,438
Arne, you and Henrik
will be our cover party.

429
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,758
You'll cut a hole in the fence.
The demolition party will consist...

430
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,999
The demolition party
will consist of Knut, Oli and myself.

431
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,151
Jensen? lnside.

432
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,949
(Vehicle approaching)

433
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,791
(Loud click)

434
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,077
- Gute Nacht.
- Draußen ist's kalt.

435
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,396
Gut, ich bin warm angezogen.

436
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,830
(Car engine starting)

437
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,711
(Loud click)

438
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,316
(Machinery humming)

439
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,593
Hello...

440
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,838
Hello.

441
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,711
Fritz, mach die Tür zu!

442
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,753
Be careful with those wires.
You will blow the whole place up.

443
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,271
- Ready?
- Yeah.

444
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,356
- Let's get out of here.
- My glasses! l've lost my glasses.

445
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,597
- They're on your head.
- What's going to happen to me?

446
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,836
We'll put you somewhere safe.

447
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,911
(Klaxon blaring)

448
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,030
(Shouting in German)

449
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,071
(Gunfire)

450
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,432
(Shouting in German)

451
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,670
(Firing stops)

452
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,158
Scheinwerfer jetzt da! Lass sie nicht...

453
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,635
(Gunfire)

454
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,151
Go on. Go on.

455
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,314
Gentlemen, your next mission
is to find out how neutral Sweden is.

456
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,590
Especially the girls.

457
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,270
Where's Arne?

458
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,078
Down in the gorge.

459
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,831
Let's get going.

460
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,350
lt'll be swarming with Germans
in half an hour.

461
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,159
Excellent.

462
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,918
Excellent work.

463
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,429
ls it not, my dear Nilssen?

464
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,235
An extraordinary job, you might say,
of sabotage.

465
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,834
Naturally, you had no knowledge of this.

466
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,873
Destruction, sabotage, waste.

467
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,797
All this is against
your thrifty scientific nature.

468
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,831
ls it not, Nilssen?

469
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,119
ln that case, answer me this.

470
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,915
How long before production
gets back into high gear?

471
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,271
A year at least -
new containers have to be built,

472
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,948
a new store
of heavy water accumulated -

473
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,237
before production flows at full speed.

474
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,237
A year, he says.

475
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,069
What do you think we Germans
have been doing? Sleeping?

476
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,478
What do you think your friends from
the Berlin lnstitute have been doing?

477
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,318
Playing golf?

478
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,911
The British fancy themselves very much
after what they've done here.

479
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,749
Winston Churchill is puffing
an extra big cigar today.

480
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,469
And we laugh at him.

481
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,238
Why?

482
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,956
Because all these containers
which the British did so much to destroy

483
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,835
have already been
prefabricated...in Berlin.

484
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,874
They are on their way here
and will be installed tomorrow.

485
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,516
l must say that is fantastic efficiency.

486
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,349
Don't ever make the mistake
of underrating the Germans.

487
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,950
By Easter, we will not have
10,000 pounds of heavy water

488
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,799
but 12,000 pounds of heavy water.

489
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,949
Because from now on, no one leaves
this building - not you or anybody -

490
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,993
unless it's to go
to Grini concentration camp.

491
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,509
l must protest against this.

492
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,995
Protest as much as you wish...

493
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,189
but get used to the idea!

494
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,231
You built this place.

495
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,195
You will work now in it, eat in it
and sleep in it until our victory.

496
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,358
Heil Hitler.

497
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,119
Major Frick.

498
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,791
This is one of the most disastrous
security breakdowns of the entire war

499
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,036
and you are responsible for it.

500
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:07,438
l leave you in charge of the only factory
in Europe making heavy water

501
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,552
and a dozen men in British uniforms
calmly walk in

502
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,990
and blow it up right in front of your eyes.

503
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,078
So get up into those mountains!

504
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,671
And get back every one of those men.
Dead or alive.

505
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,713
lf it turns out they're Norwegians,

506
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,469
l want a hundred hostages
rounded up and shot.

507
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,950
l don't want even a rat left alive up there!

508
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,832
Go on, get out!

509
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,476
Fertig machen! Abmarschieren!
Einsteigen! Abfahren!

510
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,671
Mit voller Ausrüstung.

511
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,072
You say you can take us to them?
You'd better be telling the truth.

512
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,430
You keep your part of the bargain,
l'll keep mine.

513
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,472
You were right.
We should have shot that quisling...

514
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,352
Forget it.

515
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,391
(Plane whirring)

516
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,560
(Machine-gun fire)

517
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,752
Abteilung 2 da lang.
Der Rest folgt mir nach.

518
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,913
Knut, go down that side.

519
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,995
(Gunfire)

520
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,398
(Gunshot)

521
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,038
(Gunshot)

522
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,157
Why?

523
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,998
Why?

524
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,479
My wife...

525
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,593
Your wife? What the hell do you mean,
your wife?

526
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,838
l made a bargain with the Nazis.

527
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,391
Who are you?

528
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,071
l was helping track down the saboteurs.
l got hurt in the foot.

529
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,716
You'd better come with us.
Abteilung vorwärts!

530
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,151
Abteilung halt! Wegtreten!

531
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,511
Saboteurs, going to
Grini concentration camp.

532
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,032
l...l think l'd better go see my doctor.

533
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,196
Thanks for your help.

534
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,917
Hey, wait a minute.

535
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,477
We have a doctor here now.
Come and see him.

536
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,717
l'd rather see my own
if it's all the same to you.

537
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,074
Oh, nonsense. Our doctor will look after
you for nothing. Why pay a civilian?

538
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,874
- Who is this fellow?
- One of the men helping our patrols.

539
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,070
lf he's helping us, we must help him.

540
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,589
- Thank you.
- That's only fair.

541
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,676
Nasty. We'd better have that seen to.

542
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,711
Herr Sturmführer!

543
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,953
l think we have got another person
for your bus.

544
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,072
Doctor?

545
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,238
- You remember me?
- No, l don't.

546
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,079
We met at the university, Dr Pedersen.

547
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,795
- l'm afraid you're mistaken, madam.
- You know this man?

548
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,151
No, l... l thought l did but l... No.

549
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,237
What did you say his name was?

550
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,670
No, please. l don't know.

551
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,796
His papers say Christensen.
What did you say?

552
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,638
His name!

553
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,196
My name is Dr Rolf Pedersen,
University of Oslo.

554
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,313
As Gestapo Headquarters will no doubt
be delighted to confirm.

555
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,113
Doctor...

556
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,151
l'm so sorry.

557
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:24,114
- Pederson...
- Pedersen, not Pederson.

558
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,311
l'm very proud of my name.

559
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,875
Let me help you. Here it is.

560
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,517
''Pedersen, Rolf. Doctor of Physics.
Believed escaped to England.''

561
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,269
- England?
- Even the Gestapo can be wrong.

562
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,078
Schnell! Schnell!

563
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,596
How long will it be, Doctor?

564
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,717
l've got to leave here.

565
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:41,749
Can you hear me, Doctor?
l can't stay here long.

566
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,795
l don't want to know who you are
but if you leave you'll be arrested

567
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,991
and so will l and my staff.

568
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,875
You will therefore stay here
until l make the arrangements.

569
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,351
(Tapping)

570
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:30,593
Anna, l told you l don't want
you using that transmitter set.

571
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,509
- London must know where Rolf is.
- l can't risk it.

572
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,915
Why can't you try to find him?

573
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,351
l'm not a member
of the Missing Person's Bureau.

574
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,118
l can't jeopardise the whole operation.

575
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,117
l am a bad ex-wife, Knut.

576
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,432
Why? Because you love him?

577
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,112
Yes. You haven't much use for that,
have you?

578
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,153
Not in this sort of war. lt softens you up.

579
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,115
But sex - now, that's something different.

580
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,510
lt seems Rolf makes
the same distinction.

581
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,830
But you don't, do you, Anna?

582
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,751
l'll get some wood.

583
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,236
They're in this area somewhere.

584
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,231
(Rhythmic tapping)

585
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,996
Leave that alone! Not for anyone!
Do you understand?

586
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,829
That transmitter remains silent
until l give the order!

587
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,269
You see, Anna,
that's what l was talking about.

588
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,193
- Morning.
- Hello, Doctor.

589
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,709
A friend of yours is here.

590
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,150
Room seven, down the corridor.

591
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,871
(Knock on door)

592
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,632
- Sigrid.
- Hello, Dr Pedersen.

593
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,593
l thought you were locked up
in the factory.

594
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,598
We are, unless we're very ill.

595
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,791
Or having a baby.

596
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:50,875
- There's something l've got to...
- Nilssen found out you were here.

597
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,116
Listen to me.

598
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,113
- l've got to tell you about Arne.
- l know.

599
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,711
The Germans
have installed new containers,

600
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,230
so heavy water production
is at full level again.

601
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,032
- Sigrid...
- When can you deliver the message?

602
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,271
Right now.

603
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,549
- We've got to contact London.
- Why? What's the matter?

604
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,797
The Nazis have restored
heavy water production.

605
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,675
- What?
- lt's taken two weeks, not two years.

606
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,711
We're back where we started.

607
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,910
Then we'll have to bomb.

608
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,759
(Planes droning)

609
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,393
(Sirens wailing)

610
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,471
(Explosions and gunfire)

611
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,595
We'll have to take his appendix out.

612
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,271
ln that case one of our security officers
must remain with him day and night.

613
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:59,315
l shan't be lonely. By the way,
how are Sigrid and her baby?

614
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,354
Excellent. She's bringing him here later
for a check-up.

615
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,916
- l'd love to see her.
- No one can communicate with Nilssen.

616
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:33,035
''67 civilians killed.
Factory virtually untouched.

617
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,071
''The Nazis...''

618
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,436
The Third Reich is going to last
for a thousand years.

619
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:48,792
Let's all go to Rjukan. Have a good
Nazi dinner, see a nice Nazi film.

620
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,070
- Rolf.
- Start getting used to it.

621
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:54,750
''The Nazis are shipping
all their heavy water to Germany

622
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,919
''by rail and ferry under the guard
of a thousand troops.

623
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,910
''The railway tank cars will leave
the factory Saturday evening.

624
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:09,478
''Be placed...on the Hydro ferry...
Sunday morning.''

625
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,638
And Nilssen lost his appendix
to deliver that.

626
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,832
Wait a minute. Wait a minute..

627
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,871
Maybe now -

628
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,710
the very moment we've all dreaded
when they take the stuff to Germany...

629
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,388
by ferry.

630
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,431
This is where we get them.

631
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,154
But, Rolf, a thousand troops?

632
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,114
But there's one place
you can't use a thousand troops.

633
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,559
Knut, do you want to do
a little dying with me?

634
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,513
l've just thought up a nice way to go.

635
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,229
lt left at nine o'clock.

636
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:08,992
lt's got to be the deepest point -
at least three, four hundred metres.

637
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,878
Now.

638
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,718
9:45.

639
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,440
You know what we're talking about?

640
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,108
Yes. We're talking about murder.

641
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,595
(Clocks ticking)

642
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,475
Why two clocks?

643
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,875
lf one doesn't go off, the other will.

644
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,548
To sink the ferry in less than a minute.

645
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,756
lt has to be done, Anna.

646
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,279
lt's all been calculated, hasn't it, Rolf?

647
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,308
Nothing left to chance.

648
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,398
Not even the hope
that one child won't drown.

649
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,754
Anna, what counts isn't
who's going to die in the ferry

650
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:09,157
but how many millions
will be saved if the ferry's sunk.

651
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,478
A nice equation, Rolf.
Put it on the blackboard and sign it.

652
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:18,434
lt's not a ''nice'' equation.
l didn't invent it. lt exists.

653
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:21,234
So do people. People exist too.

654
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,715
We're doing this for people!

655
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,275
You don't do things for people.

656
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,711
Anna, this work is tough enough
even without you.

657
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:37,034
One day, after the war,

658
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,869
a woman is going to ask
why her child had to be drowned.

659
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,275
l won't know the answer.

660
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:47,158
lt's simple as this - we have no choice.

661
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,750
What are you going to say
to that woman, Rolf?

662
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,190
We'll radio the Norwegian government
in London.

663
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,755
Tell them the plan, all its risks...

664
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,117
The Prime Minister, the King -
the whole lot.

665
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,749
Then, if they approve...

666
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:20,471
at least we've shared the responsibility.

667
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,716
(Explosion, clocks ring)

668
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,871
lt works.

669
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,271
Let's contact London.

670
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,830
Number one truck reports a contact
on 247 degrees.

671
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,110
Contact 73 degrees.

672
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,716
West south-west.
Six kilometres from here.

673
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,353
All right, Heine!

674
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,070
Shut that door, will you?

675
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:05,075
- That's better.
- l'm glad you think so.

676
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,111
Stand up!

677
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,559
lf we're not back in two hours,
don't wait for us.

678
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,752
lf you hear any shots, leave immediately.

679
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,831
(Faint voices)

680
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:34,954
(Ticking)

681
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,749
(Train approaching)

682
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,875
(Train whistle blaring)

683
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,878
(Train whistle blaring)

684
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,631
(Man) Another one.

685
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,308
(Conversation continues, indistinct)

686
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,391
(Train whistle)

687
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,511
There is nine minutes left.

688
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:11,554
- Go on to the boathouse with Knut.
- Where are you going?

689
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,515
l've got to see that the ferry
leaves on time. Then l'll join you.

690
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,551
Be careful.

691
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,477
l will.

692
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:27,719
The explosion time is 9:45.
We won't make a move until then.

693
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:12,033
(Children chattering and laughlng)

694
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,871
Papiere!

695
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,788
- Tickets.
- l'll have to pay.

696
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,558
Tickets.

697
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:23,631
(Ship's horn)

698
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:45,279
Sigrid. There you are.

699
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:48,119
- Hello, Doctor.
- l want you to understand...

700
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,596
l don't think you've met little Arne.
There we are.

701
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:55,354
- Sigrid, listen to me.
- (Man) Sigrid!

702
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:57,391
So you've met a friend?

703
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:00,956
This is Mr and Mrs Sandersen
and their little boy.

704
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:04,470
- l've got to talk to you alone.
- (Sandersen) Come and join us.

705
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,511
- l can't.
- We have sandwiches.

706
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:10,599
- Would you excuse us?
- l'm sorry, Mrs Sandersen.

707
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:21,358
What's the matter?

708
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,757
l want you to start
a children's game at the back.

709
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,916
- Game?
- As far back as you can.

710
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:29,953
- What sort of game?
- Let's call it life jackets.

711
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:34,790
Everybody puts one on when l say go.
The winner gets a bar of chocolate.

712
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,711
(Arne crying)

713
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:46,751
Excuse me.

714
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:03,955
- lf you're in trouble...
- Sigrid, do as l tell you.

715
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,514
There's not much time.
Let's organise the children.

716
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:28,071
(Ticking)

717
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:46,438
Where is Rolf? lt's only a few minutes.

718
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:49,473
We'll have to do what we can
without him.

719
01:59:56,240 --> 02:00:00,836
- l don't want to play.
- Oh, you want to play. Sure you do.

720
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:23,508
The winner gets a bar of chocolate.
You ready?

721
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,756
Oh. Your doll's cold.

722
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,514
Ready, set, go.

723
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,795
Sigrid's on board the ship.

724
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,309
And Rolf! Rolf's there as well.

725
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:56,317
l don't want to play!

726
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:59,114
You'll play if it's the last thing you do!

727
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:01,914
l won! l won!

728
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:16,199
(Klaxon blaring)

729
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,638
Sieh nach, was los ist.

730
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:17,071
Mummy! Mummy!

731
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,111
Mummy!
