Listen, occupant comrades!

9
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,399
This must be a mistake.

10
00:02:57,607 --> 00:03:01,569
I've only played the harpsichord
with the fascist-supporting orchestra.

11
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:06,156
I never hurt
a single Nazi. Even in thought.

12
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,950
I'm allergic to metal
and I have asthma.

13
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,494
I am suffering from chronic
gastritis and diabetes.

14
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:15,831
My doctor has forbidden me to
participate in any executions.

15
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,209
Fellow comrades,
do not kill me, it is Shabbat.

16
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,209
Attention.

17

Sorry, "mein Führer"

40
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:08,566
The pigs pulled me over this
morning, fined me all I've got.

41
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,276
- Have you been drinking?
- No!

42
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:13,570
I had to put the pedal to
the metal to arrive on time.

43
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,364
I sympathise, man.

47
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,508
- It's for my ill health.

Tuck back that belly.

50
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,193
I'll get you one of these days.

51
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,195
A true Aryan.

You look healthy.

How is work going?

68
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,018
I don't particularly want to talk about it.

69
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:13,771
- What is it?
- I'm sick and tired of it.

70
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:18,399
Tired of all these stories of
espionage. I am homesick.

71
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,569
I see.
Keep holding on, you're a superhero

72

the nation's oil.

73
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,949
You should relax, my boy.

74
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,202
I left you something
in the fridge, it will please you.

75
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,828
You're a real pal.

76
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,496
What would I do without you?

77

What to do? We must admit it.
The Russians are pros.

93

It seems

Everything is in order.

He  starts to annoy me.
I'm sure he's a spy.

96
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:57,699
This accusation, is it based
on evidence?

97
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:01,452
Not yet, but it will come.

98
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:03,746
Then put it on hold,

99
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:09,334

Quite to the contrary.
And I need cash.

Looking at you,

"That's a Nazi as he should be."

129
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:57,232

169
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,509
Hello, I'm Zina,
your decryptor.

170
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:17,265
Sasha Osechkin, spy.

171
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,810
A beautiful landing.

172
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:20,443
Enchanted.

173
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:23,028
Likewise.

174
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:11,619
Zina ...

175
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:13,621
Such a lovely name.

176
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:16,748
- And quite rare.
- You are spiritual.

177
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:19,375
- You are cute.
- You're extraordinary.

178
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:21,836
We have only just met.
How can you judge?

179
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:23,295
I have this hunch.

180
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:26,506
I'm not sugar
but I'll melt.

181
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:30,134
- Have I seen you somewhere before?
- Certainly on the net.

182
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,888
I must warn the central;
they could be worried.

183
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,522
I'll take this opportunity to
update my Facebook status!

184
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,775
Err, perhaps you'd better not.
He has a way to go.

185
00:33:52,236 --> 00:33:54,696
Can I take you to
the safe house?

186
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,364
How do you travel?

187
00:33:56,698 --> 00:34:00,159
I travel by ski
and I love to ATV. And you?

188
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:01,327
Ice skates.

189
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:05,247
- Will these rollers do the trick?
- No, but we will do with.

190
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,375
No more secret code
on our the rendezvous.

191
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:13,504
- Can we at least still use the roller skates?
- Let's spy and then we'll talk.

192
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,184
"Heil Hitler."

193
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:37,232
Ironman Hans von Eisen. It's been a while, 
How are you?

194
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:40,651
As usual.
The kids who whine,

195
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,195
the death rattle of the bourgeois,
a lazy wife ...

196
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:44,822
Finally, a happy life.

197
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:46,364
I see.

198
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:49,826
But I would not be bothered
personal problems.

199
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:53,954
I charge 300 Reichsmark an hour
for family therapy.
Something of a hobby.

200
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:57,707
But let's talk business.

201
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:00,877
Here, take a look at this.

202
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:04,296
I'm sure Shurenberg
is a Soviet spy.

203
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:08,758
But, Gruppenführer, we've tried radio tapping.

204
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:12,928
It is useless. I would have less
trouble getting pregnant.

205
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:14,721
Why would you do that?

206
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,433
You'd be tired,
whimsical, ill.

207
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,143
Search the world over.

208
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,103
We must find out if he is. Think about it.

209
00:35:23,312 --> 00:35:24,354
Put a contract on his head.

210
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,481
At the expense of the taxpayer?

211
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:29,484
Do something:
threat, questioning ...

212
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:32,445
Rape with foreign objects.
The old methods!

213
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:32,661
How you doin' nigga?
Where you goin'?

214
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,372
You got the rhythm
in the blood, my brother!

215
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,124
This shit moves the city man.
Gimme five.

216
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:48,842
<i> The only person in the whole Reich </ i>

217
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,927
<i> Shurenberg respected </ i>

221
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,936
50 Shillings.

222
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:08,942
I have decided to

223
00:37:09,442 --> 00:37:14,238
stay here in Berlin to enjoy
the victories and advances

224
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,157
our great reich!

225
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:22,203
I will review my plans. There are
too many successes for a leader!

226
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:24,580
So many so that I could burst!

227
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,306
Und das ist Hitler!

228
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,852
And they, our friendly soldiers!

229
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,105
Them, the Russians pigs!

230
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,329
No, help, leave me alone!

231
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:26,590
Is that clear?

232
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:33,220
I told you all that
with heart on hand

233
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,682
our soldiers can be proud of
their work across the Reich.

234
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:40,768
They will come back full of medals
on the torso, and stories in the head.

235
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,520
They are the vectors
of our triumph,

236
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:45,522
their hands stained with the enemy's blood,

237
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:48,441
with the desire to suck
the udders of the nation.

238
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:54,446
Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg,
blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg!

239
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,073
Shurenberg!

240
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:57,240
To the table!

241
00:39:01,952 --> 00:39:03,120
This does not interest you?

242
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:06,623
- Not at all, "mein Führer!"
- Not at all <i>it does</i>, or not at all <i>it doesn't</i>?

243
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:09,334
<i>It does</i>, "mein Führer!"

244
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:12,795
Then repeat
what I said, "bitte".

245
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:15,297
- Absolutely everything?
- From A to Z.

246
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:18,174
Some nerve, eh?

247
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:23,178
<i> All those years of training
would be used for something. </ i>

248
00:39:23,178 --> 00:39:24,555
I enjoy

249
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,015
advances our reich.

250
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:32,019
These are successes too
one officer must ensure!

251
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:33,812
I tell you the heart to the hand!

252
00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:47,574
That is Hitler.

253
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:51,452
And they, our friendly soldiers.

254
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:53,329
Yes, yes ...

255
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:57,040
And they, the Russian soldiers.

256
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:02,044
This is wonderful!

257
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:06,965
Is that clear?

258
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:11,761
<i> The Gestapo launched an invitation for tenders
for a secret weapon. </ i>

259
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:15,305
<i> The Kremlin asked Shurenberg
to keep an eye on the project. </ i>

260
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:17,682
- "Heil Hitler."
- Enough, Shurenberg.

261
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:21,060
At a time when the Allies
progress in our country,

262
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:22,686
you scuttle around like a ballerina.

263
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,647
But I think only of
the victory of our Reich.

264
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,317
Please, anything but that.

265
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:31,152
The shot of patriotism ...

266
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,363
Stop being the problem
child at work, you hear?.

267
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:35,864
I have a mission for you.

268
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,329
MISSION OF THE DAY:
DEATH RAY LASER

269
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:45,664
The secret weapon
we wanted.

270
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,000
You will make me
a business plan.

271
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,752
30% increase in the budget,
half under the table.

272
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:54,213
No bullshit, Shurenberg.

273
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:57,882
Do your homework.
No stains on your notebook.

274
00:40:58,299 --> 00:40:59,717
<i>Or</i> on the bed sheets.

275
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:01,135
I want a good note.

276
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:03,470
It's out of the question
to defecate on the flowers!

277
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:06,306
It messes up the buds.
Is that clear?

278
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:07,849
Questions?

279
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,561
- I can't grope girls?
- It is a distraction.

280
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,564
This mission is
the last hope of the Reich.

281
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,691
We do not fiddle with the babes.

282
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:26,156
I appreciate the confidence
you bear me.

283
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,785
I will not disappoint you
even if I can not fiddle.

284
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:33,579
Sometimes I just feel
like jumping.

285
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,017
All is well.
This is the third time today.

286
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:09,609
IN MAY: ALL OF GERMANY

287
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:16,706
ANNA SEMIOMOVICH
THE BEST SPY WORLD

288
00:43:52,236 --> 00:43:54,238
Have you no shame?

289
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:02,495
Engineer Garik?
(Famous Armenian/Russian TV entertainer)

290
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:05,831
- Yes.
- The project, I was just trying…

291
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:09,334
- To study it?
- Yeah, examen it.

292
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:11,502
Don't waste your time.

293
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:13,962
My weapon is impenetrable.

294
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:26,306
Here is my May Day Death Ray.

295
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:28,975
With it, victory is assured.

296
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:30,852
Sit.

297
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,732
Professor, would you describe yourself
as loyal to the Reich?

298
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:40,860
Standartenführer ...

299
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:44,405
I'm a businessman.
Talk to your superiors.

300
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:48,533
They make a better offer,
I take the money.

301
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,660
And you get a commission.

302
00:44:54,746 --> 00:44:55,747
Let's go.

303
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:11,177
We can talk here.
It is a safe place.

304
00:45:11,802 --> 00:45:14,721
If I tell you something,
you won't denounce me,

305
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,765
- will you?
- No.

306
00:45:16,973 --> 00:45:20,685
In fact,
I can not stand the Nazis.

307
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:24,396
<i> Thank you for your sincerity. </ i>

308
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:27,065
<i> To be honest, me neither. </ i>

309
00:45:27,315 --> 00:45:30,610
- <i> Do we have an understanding? </ i>
- <i> I think so. </ I>

310
00:45:30,776 --> 00:45:33,404
<i> - You work for the Kremlin? </ i>
<i> - Yes. </ I>

311
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:37,115
Take care of business.
Grant me asylum,

312
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:39,492
<i> a crib in central Moscow, </ i>

313
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:42,244
Three Russians,
blonde and affectionate,

314
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:44,079
and then I'll blow the fucking Nazis.

315
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:48,541
A tempting proposition.
Deal.

316
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,565
I'll have two Big McFührers and
a large Nordicola with ice.

317
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,441
And fatherland fries.

318
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:20,693
And fatherland fries!

319
00:46:24,405 --> 00:46:25,530
(unintelligible)

320
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:31,577
- It'll be ready in a minute.
- I'm not deaf.

321
00:46:34,788 --> 00:46:37,082
This is where I spy
discreetly.

322
00:46:50,593 --> 00:46:52,970
I eat like a pig.
I love it.

323
00:46:54,972 --> 00:46:57,474
A girl who has an appetite,
this is rare.

324
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:00,143
I've always felt like
a pregnant woman.

325
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:03,896
I come from a region
that has experienced famine.

326
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:06,314
I can not help it.
I see food,

327
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:10,109
and I can not resist.
I throw myself upon it.

328
00:47:10,943 --> 00:47:12,194
I had a weird childhood too.

329
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:16,990
When I was angry
against someone,

330
00:47:17,782 --> 00:47:20,284
I used to secrete
a poisonous saliva.

331
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:24,121
- You're kidding me.
- My mother used me

332
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:27,791
to kill flies.

333
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:29,959
- Stop it!
- This is the truth!

334
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,470
When I am with you,
I feel ...

335
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:45,472
in my place.

336
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:29,050
Oi! You, with the remote control.

337
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:31,260
We can embrace quietly?

338
00:48:52,194 --> 00:48:55,489
ZINA, YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY!

339
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:04,788
Stop! Halt!

340
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:08,166
Stop!

341
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:30,143
I know a very fun game they
play around the corner. What do you say?

342
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:32,394
Okay... What kind of game?

343
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:36,148
"Can you recognise it blind? "

344
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,858
- What, not up for it?
- Me?

345
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:48,291
<i> Houston, we have a problem. </ i>

YALTA CONFERENCE, FEB 1945

<i>Where is my tobacco?</ i>

348
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:10,401
And now, my dear Shurenberg,

349
00:52:10,902 --> 00:52:14,947
We loved the Reich and now...

350
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:16,948
Yes.

351
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:22,995
The situation is
far from rosy.

352
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:27,290
"Far from rosy."
A very appropriate expression.

353
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:31,460
A simple expression,
but appropriate.

354
00:52:36,048 --> 00:52:40,802
I like you a lot.
I mean, I really like you.

355
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,889
You too, I mean, err, Obergruppenführer...

356
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:49,976
- ...I think you're a good person.
- Thank you.

357
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:54,771
You look so inspired,
so intelligent and brave ...

358
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:58,108
- That's nice.
- Your smile is bedazzling.

359
00:52:58,817 --> 00:53:01,861
- Thank you, Obergruppenführer.
- Believe me,

360
00:53:02,028 --> 00:53:06,990
I'd bet you know, in the true sense,
how to satisfy a man.

361
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,617
- I'd rather not.
- Love is blind.

362
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:12,870
- I still have my eyes.
- A pitty.

363
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,039
You should
let go, forget everything,

364
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:18,083
and take the leap.

365
00:53:18,249 --> 00:53:20,168
Take the plunge

366
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:23,003
and jump in to the water like a
14 year-old virgin jugend.

367
00:53:30,885 --> 00:53:35,514

<i>Magnifique!</i>

372
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:59,951
Your intelligence
is too sharp,

373
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:02,745
you are not an Aryan.

374
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:06,164
What are you playing at,
Nazi bitch?

375
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:08,750
Come on, say it.
Come out with it!

376
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,335
Forget it. It's not in my horoscope
today, nor yours.

377
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:15,672
<i> While Shurenberg

Hello.

383
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:39,442
- Have we been drinking, perhaps?
- Forget it,

384
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,445
- you'll never catch me out.
- Please step out of the vehicle.

385
00:56:37,415 --> 00:56:39,292
Little Red Riding Hood to Central.

The wolf knows the cakes are
stuffed cabbage, not beef.

387
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:46,673
Brackets ...

388
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:50,134
The Armenian squirrel 
has left the country.

389
00:56:50,468 --> 00:56:52,386
He needs a pad in town.

390
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:54,096
Toast.

391
00:57:04,313 --> 00:57:05,397

My beloved little witch ...

394
00:57:26,748 --> 00:57:30,209
It's been a while since you last
frequented the Moscow clubs.

395
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:33,254
Girls do these things,
you will see ...

396
00:57:34,963 --> 00:57:39,217
This may be your illusion,
but you're my witch

397
00:57:39,425 --> 00:57:40,802
the only one who matters.

398
00:57:42,428 --> 00:57:44,138
Sometimes I think about us.

399
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:47,557
We live in a foreign country,
among these fascists.

400
00:57:48,558 --> 00:57:50,226
So far from our dear Russia.

401
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:53,812
But you're here,
to play spies with me.

402
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:55,856
What would I do without you?

403
00:57:56,064 --> 00:57:58,608
Once back in Moscow
what will happen?

404
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:00,860
Tramps will throw themselves at you.

405
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:02,695
What are you saying?

406
00:58:02,945 --> 00:58:05,822
They will.
And you will succumb, you'll see.

407
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:09,284
Men are all alike.
It doesn't even upset me any more.

Sasha

00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,547
I am in my third month.

413
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,512
- Is it mine?
- No, Hitler's(!)

414
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:34,930
Of course, it's yours.

My angel with pink cheeks.

A mother with big tits.

- Are you happy?
- Are you kidding or what?

418
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,526
Obviously ...

419
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,819
I'm happy.

420
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:53,195
Want to see?

421
00:58:53,737 --> 00:58:54,905
Wait!

422
00:58:55,405 --> 00:58:56,573
Look!

423
00:59:18,174 --> 00:59:19,092
I'm happy!

01:00:35,322 --> 01:00:36,239
Shurenberg.

432
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:40,326
Sorry to arrive unannounced.
The Gestapo banned texting.

433
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:44,163
I know. We'll talk about it
at the union meeting.

434
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,582
Can I get you anything?

435
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:53,003
- A tea?
- Green Tea. Without caffeine.

436
01:00:53,671 --> 01:00:57,549
What was this weird music
that I heard?

437
01:00:58,258 --> 01:01:00,009
Nothing like I've heard before.

438
01:01:00,218 --> 01:01:03,554
It was a bit of trance CMS
Nazi techno.

439
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:12,353
"Tai-pin-ho-ku"
Chinese exclusive import.

440
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:18,149
Shurenberg,

441
01:01:18,316 --> 01:01:21,193
you are aware
there are people in the Gestapo

442
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,154
who believe that you are
a Soviet spy.

443
01:01:24,488 --> 01:01:25,822
Do you want sugar?

444
01:01:26,114 --> 01:01:27,949
No, but I'll
take my tea on a saucer.

445
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:30,743
- You know, so I don't spill.
- Right.

446
01:01:32,703 --> 01:01:33,787
Moving on,

447
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:37,040
trying to find
evidence against you,

448
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:40,293
is like opening champagne
with your buttocks.

449
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:43,712
It's new and it hurts
just thinking.

450
01:01:43,921 --> 01:01:46,214
Suffice to say, it is impossible.

451
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:52,845
- Milk?
- Semi-skimmed. Thank you.

452
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:54,680
It goes without saying.

453
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:01,894
Do not get me wrong,

454
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:06,690
but I was ordered yesterday by Müller
to peruse your file.

455
01:02:06,982 --> 01:02:11,193
I'll have to ask you
a few questions.

456
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:18,533
Fine.

457
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:22,578
Let's begin.

458
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:26,581
Have you faxed our plans to Stalin?

459
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,417
This is a routine questionnaire.

460
01:02:29,709 --> 01:02:30,793
Wait.

461
01:02:31,294 --> 01:02:33,462
I left
my fingerprints on the fax?

462
01:02:35,172 --> 01:02:36,006
No no.

463
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:44,471
Continuing.
I'll ask the next question.

464
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,480
Question. Will they come
out with another "Matrix" movie or not?

465
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:58,608
Hans, it's a trilogy.

466
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,235
It was a trick question.

467
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,320
You fell into our trap.

468
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:07,699
We heard your conversation
with engineer Garik. Interesting.

469
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:10,576
So he escapes to Moscow?

470
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:13,621
He thinks we suck,
is that it?

471
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:15,163
You know?

472
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:43,771
Wait!
That's in my file?

473
01:03:56,656 --> 01:03:59,242
Leave it at that.
Otherwise I will hurt you.

474
01:04:25,264 --> 01:04:28,516
<i>The more Shurenberg
felt anger come over him, </ i>

475

476

I warned you,

477
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:10,510
My darling,
what are you doing?

478
01:05:10,843 --> 01:05:14,096
Come to bed.
Without you, I can not sleep.

479
01:05:15,222 --> 01:05:16,598
I'm coming, sweetheart.

480
01:05:16,765 --> 01:05:19,183
I have to work late.

481
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:22,103
- I'll be right there.
- Hurry up.

482
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:34,696
Not too loud, huh?
Otherwise we will awake Zina.

483
01:05:47,249 --> 01:05:49,083
THE ASHES OF IRON HANS VON EISEN

484
01:06:08,558 --> 01:06:10,351
RETURN HOME, DIRTY COMMUNIST!

485
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:55,180
<i>Hidden deep 
in suburban Berlin </ i>

486
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:58,850
<i> was the safe
house of the Red Army. </ i>

487
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:04,229
<i> Nobody could distinguish
it from the other apartments. </ i>

488
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,913
"Heil", Machin.
A and B are on a boat.

489
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:27,540
A fall in the water and B disappears.

490
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:31,335
- Who are you then? Tell me!
- NKVD.

491
01:07:31,544 --> 01:07:33,420
Perhaps. Come in.

492
01:07:44,013 --> 01:07:47,349
My cover
will soon be blown.

493
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:51,769
My contract mentions
the words "force majeure"

494
01:07:52,019 --> 01:07:53,437
so I came to see you.

495
01:07:54,813 --> 01:07:56,731
I see, yes.

496
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,525
Being unmasked is unpleasant.

497
01:07:59,734 --> 01:08:02,319
Humiliation, interrogation,

498
01:08:02,486 --> 01:08:04,988
tweezers, curlers.

499
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:07,407
- Curlers?
- The permanent ass hair.

500
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:09,909
- Have you been tortured?
- Huh?

501
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:13,078
No, it's just Chianti.
I partied yesterday.

502
01:08:13,412 --> 01:08:15,747
With some metal workers.
True saints.

503
01:08:16,915 --> 01:08:18,458
Well, let's get your equipment.

504
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:23,837
This is a beautiful sofa
I love the decor.

505
01:08:24,004 --> 01:08:26,631
I live alone. I spend
my hours masturbating.

506
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:30,426
Well, let's see.

507
01:08:34,138 --> 01:08:35,555
What have we here?

508
01:08:38,141 --> 01:08:39,350
So ...

509
01:08:39,559 --> 01:08:40,226
Cyanide

510
01:08:40,852 --> 01:08:43,270
Valium, gags,

511
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:45,606
handcuffs, range,

512
01:08:45,814 --> 01:08:49,651
slip alternative
crosswords, leather whip

513
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,485
and obviously, pear enema.

514
01:08:51,652 --> 01:08:54,196
In other words,
basic survival kit.

515
01:08:54,947 --> 01:08:56,448
- But what about the ...
- "Niet."

516
01:08:56,656 --> 01:09:00,076
No tickets for the
Moscow Midget Circus.

517
01:09:00,284 --> 01:09:01,410
Speaking of circus

518
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:03,829
you see that briefcase there?

519
01:09:03,996 --> 01:09:07,540
It's for you. Engineer Garik
asked me to give it to you.

520
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:10,209
He arrived in Moscow
and is doing well.

521
01:09:10,793 --> 01:09:12,378
He opened a casino.

522
01:09:12,586 --> 01:09:15,714
Clients from the Kremlin
down to the workers at the local kebab.

523
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:21,594
Russian resistance.
What can I do for you?

524
01:09:21,802 --> 01:09:24,263
No, we do not do home delivery

525
01:09:25,013 --> 01:09:26,348
before 7 o'-clock.

526
01:09:26,556 --> 01:09:30,101
<i> Your dues as promised.
10% commission. </ I>

527
01:09:34,855 --> 01:09:35,731
MOTHER RUSSIA

528
01:09:37,315 --> 01:09:38,858
NEUTRAL GROUND

529
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,193
TO THE REICH

530
01:09:40,401 --> 01:09:43,320
For you, comrade,
the right door.

531
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,155
MOTHER RUSSIA

532
01:09:47,157 --> 01:09:51,577
I want to go East,
you can not imagine how badly.

533
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:52,411
Listen,

534
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,914
I'll get Zina and
we'll all take the door.

535
01:09:56,081 --> 01:09:57,624
Zina was arrested at dawn.

536
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:01,085
Gestapo torture
for three hours.

537
01:10:02,878 --> 01:10:05,631
It must be
in the process of braking her soul.

538
01:10:06,214 --> 01:10:09,509
I would suggest
trying to release her,

539
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:14,972
but the orders are clear:
return home to Russia.

540
01:10:18,808 --> 01:10:20,059
Sorry, man.

541
01:10:22,978 --> 01:10:24,104
I can not.

542
01:10:24,396 --> 01:10:25,564
Be reasonable.

543
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:32,361
Return home.

544
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:34,363
You do not need Zina.

545
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:36,531
One can very easily live without a woman.

546
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:38,241
I give you my couch.

547
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:39,867
It's yours.

548
01:10:43,037 --> 01:10:43,829
Sorry.

549
01:10:47,874 --> 01:10:49,667
A hero has obligations.

550
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:13,145
Who is your contact?

551
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:15,022
Never.

552
01:11:25,405 --> 01:11:27,741
Who is your contact?

553
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:33,120
Shurenberg!

554
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:38,124
I am delighted to see you here,
Herr Clever-Boy.

555
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:40,251
At the mall

556
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:43,420
we stopped
a Russian radio operator.

557
01:11:46,006 --> 01:11:47,299
Do you know her?

558
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:52,094
- Who is your contact?
- Never.

559
01:12:00,768 --> 01:12:02,812
<i> Try not to cry. </ i>

560
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,563
Why would I know her?

561
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,238
What's wrong?

562
01:12:15,906 --> 01:12:19,075
I think I caught a cold.
I'm dizzy.

563
01:12:27,832 --> 01:12:29,209
Get well soon!

564
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:36,089
<i> Shurenberg imagined Zina </ i>

580
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,394
And you wore it?

581
01:17:01,644 --> 01:17:03,604
A Gucci?
Are you kidding?

582
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:06,690
Hugo Boss is far more dashing.

583
01:17:11,652 --> 01:17:13,404
I'll call you later.

584
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,961
- Admit it. Who is your hairdresser?
- Never!

585
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:13,587
- "Heil Hitler."
- "Heil."

586
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:16,339
Frau Otto, new orders.

587
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:20,093
I will try to get
something out of the peasant.

588
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:27,265
PAIN, INJURY,
EMERGENCY EXIT

589
01:19:31,352 --> 01:19:32,978
Where is Shurenberg, that son of a *****

590
01:19:33,187 --> 01:19:34,605
I'll **** him
from behind!

591
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:37,774
And when I'm finished,
I will not hesitate

592
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:40,735
to rip your *** open

593
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:43,487
and I'll **** in it!

594
01:20:01,961 --> 01:20:02,837
50 Shilling.

595
01:20:06,631 --> 01:20:09,801
50 Shilling,
let's do this shit, yeah?

596
01:20:50,793 --> 01:20:54,171
Why don't we go to
Chile, in the spring?

597
01:20:54,379 --> 01:20:55,255
No!

598
01:20:55,464 --> 01:20:59,592
All the Gestapo go. I get
tired of seeing the same losers.

599
01:20:59,842 --> 01:21:02,887
So start
holidaying in Dubai.

600
01:21:03,137 --> 01:21:04,721
It is expensive.

601
01:21:05,138 --> 01:21:06,473
And I drowning at work.

602
01:21:06,681 --> 01:21:10,351
Who will take care of the Reich
in my absence?

603
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,480
There has to be someone for the job.
There is more to life.

604
01:21:14,688 --> 01:21:17,315
- Eva, do not blame me.
- Blame you?

605
01:21:18,108 --> 01:21:22,778
Well, I'll talk to Müller. He'll
perhaps have time for me.

606
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,533
Forgive me.

607
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:33,495
I have a lot of trouble
because of all the stress.

608
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:39,167
You have your makeup bag?

609
01:21:39,626 --> 01:21:42,294
Of course.
What would I do without it?

610
01:21:42,503 --> 01:21:43,587
You're crazy ...

611
01:21:44,505 --> 01:21:47,215
It was you who took my nightie?

612
01:21:47,632 --> 01:21:48,800
What nightie?

613
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:53,595
My Dolce & Gabbana
leopard skin nightie.

614
01:21:53,804 --> 01:21:58,266
You crazy?
I spent the day trying to save you!

615
01:21:58,475 --> 01:21:59,267
Okay?

616
01:21:59,642 --> 01:22:01,310
Do not talk to me like that!

617
01:22:03,229 --> 01:22:07,732
Sorry, kitten, I am a little
on my nerves today.

618
01:22:07,941 --> 01:22:10,359
Anyway, this
makeup kit?

619
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:25,806
Taxi!

620
01:24:26,014 --> 01:24:28,933
- How much to take us to the frontier?
- 80 euros.

621
01:24:29,183 --> 01:24:31,936
- It's just 20 minutes!
- Go on foot.

622
01:24:32,144 --> 01:24:34,897
If you don't like it you can ride
in the back of a pickup like the other illegals.

623
01:24:35,063 --> 01:24:35,856
For the front?

624
01:24:36,064 --> 01:24:37,274
Dirty crook!

625
01:24:37,607 --> 01:24:38,733
Idiot!

626
01:24:42,069 --> 01:24:43,946
What are you waiting for?

627
01:24:44,196 --> 01:24:45,614
Hit the gas!

628
01:25:38,408 --> 01:25:39,117
We're here.

629
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:45,122
Just a minute, boss.
Let me catch my breath,

630
01:25:45,747 --> 01:25:47,165
