1
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:49,238
Archdruid Gutuart...

2
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:52,282
might makes law.

3
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:56,285
The wheel of destiny threatens
to crush us beneath it.

4
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:59,166
We are dying.
Tell us what we must do?

5
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,478
Every people, every tribe
needs its legend.

6
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:05,161
And every battle
needs a hero.

7
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,041
Behold.

8
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:11,366
The sign of the coming of a king.

9
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:15,282
The coming of a king?We
no longer have kings in Gaul.

10
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:19,686
-Perhaps then, the Romans.
-But they have no king either.

11
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,119
A hero must emerge
from the darkness.

12
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:27,963
He alone will keep the great wheel
from crushing us beneath it.

13
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,478
l must go to seek him out.

14
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,923
-Do you know the meaning of my name?
-Epona, the she-horse.

15
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,001
-Do you know the meaning of my name?
-No.

16
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:06,204
Vercingetorix, leader
of the great warriors.

17
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:31,562
Between a boy and a girl,
there should be something more.

18
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:39,801
Sorry.

19
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:44,000
-Are you a guest at the feast of May?
-Yes.

20
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:48,840
No, Y...
Well, maybe. Maybe l am.

21
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,246
And you my boy,
who are you?

22
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:55,240
l'm no boy.
l am Vercingetorix

23
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:59,083
A heavy name to bear,
leader of great warriors.

24
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:02,205
Not for the son of Celtill,
chieftain of Arvernes.

25
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,837
l am the daughter of Mosa, chief of
the Bellovaques. Who are you?

26
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:07,355
Nobody.

27
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:13,358
l am the seed blown by
the winds of fortune.

28
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:15,723
l am a spore that
may take roots.

29
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,960
-Spoken like a Druid.
-l'm just a poor minstrel.

30
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,676
ln fact, my finances might
greatly improve...

31
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:25,356
if l could gain entrance
to yonder feast...

32
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,804
by the grace of some noble guest.
Like yourself.

33
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,720
l would welcome you to Gergovia then.
Take my horse.

34
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:33,236
Thank you.

35
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,999
Tell my father l have sent you
and he will refuse you nothing.

36
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,318
Thank you, leader
of great warriors.

37
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,566
You give him your trust,
just like that.

38
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,525
He pleased me.
You please me too.

39
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:22,436
And don't forget if your brother
Celtill persists...

40
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:25,282
you must obey our laws...

41
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:28,805
and separate his soul
from his corrupted body.

42
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:33,956
Gutuart is wrong. There
must not be a king in Gaul!

43
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,765
The feast has not yet begun.

44
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:44,076
-You have no business here now.
-l'm returning the horse, uncle.

45
00:05:57,007 --> 00:06:01,159
-What are you doing, my son?
-Showing Epona the city, mother.

46
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,439
Leticia, make sure there are
flowers on every table.

47
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:06,676
Come on.

48
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,561
Someday, you'll be my queen.

49
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:22,044
Your queen? l like
the sound of that.

50
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:26,117
But there are no
more kings in Gaul.

51
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,246
For the moment.

52
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,478
-For the moment?
-lt's a secret.

53
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,279
Follow me. My father is meeting
with all the chiefs of Gaul.

54
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,285
l welcome you, noble chieftains
of the other peoples of Gaul.

55
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,966
And particularly you, Dumnorix,
chieftain of the Eduens...

56
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:09,199
and Diviciac, your brother
and grand druid...

57
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:12,917
and our friends from the north,
the great Commios...

58
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,596
-and the valiant Mosa.
-Chief of the Bellovaques.

59
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:17,760
You also Gobannitio
my brother...

60
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:21,681
and you Calarix,
senator of the Arvernes.

61
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:27,758
Gutuart, our archdruid will be
present to witness our meeting.

62
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:37,560
Do you imagine yourself becoming
the new Brennus, King of the Gauls?

63
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:41,806
Have you forgotten that the Arvernes
have proclaimed a republic?

64
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,117
l haven't forgotten, Gobannitio...

65
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:48,565
that you want to become chieftain
of this aristocratic republic...

66
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:51,241
which makes the rich richer...

67
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,085
and the poor poorer.

68
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:56,444
But let us put aside these
petty rivalries.

69
00:07:56,807 --> 00:08:00,880
We Gauls are trapped between
two great monsters.

70
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,798
To our North, the Teutons...

71
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,005
and at the South, the Romans.

72
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:09,842
Do you forget that it was you
who hired the Teuton mercenaries...

73
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:11,759
to conquer other lands?

74
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:14,077
-The Romans are no menace.
-For the moment.

75
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:15,202
What are you saying?

76
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:19,246
l'm saying you went to Rome to beg
Caesar to come to Gaul.

77
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:25,201
l say that the legions of Rome
will devastate our lands...

78
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:28,279
and destroy everything
in which we believe.

79
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:35,002
l say, better, Diviciac, the people
of Gaul united under a King.

80
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,039
l tell you, my brother...

81
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:45,841
rather a king at the head of Gaul...

82
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,475
than your secret pacts
with the Romans.

83
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:53,683
Let us unite and together expel
both the Teutons and the Romans.

84
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,645
ln great and glorious battles.

85
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,202
One day, l'll be your queen.

86
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:19,599
Here is the crown once worn
by the king of the Gauls.

87
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,836
Father, no!

88
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:32,679
Take your crown. Run!

89
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:34,601
Epona!

90
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,680
Give me that.

91
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:42,998
Vercingetorix, go.

92
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,079
This is between Arvernes.
Stay out of it.

93
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,717
Gobannitio!

94
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,121
No, my boy. Not that.

95
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:04,597
-l want to save my father.
-Of course you want, but you cannot.

96
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,676
-l must save my father.
-He has to accept his destiny...

97
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,759
and so must you.

98
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,518
According to our law...

99
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:18,845
we must separate your spirit
from your perverted body.

100
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,963
Foul reptile!

101
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:25,844
lt isn't the law that you serve,
but your own vile ambition.

102
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,887
And you my brother
are no better.

103
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:34,996
Farewell Celtill. The Eduens
will not be part of such treason.

104
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,681
Nor will the Atrebates.
Farewell.

105
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,321
You're more afraid to kill me,
than l am to die.

106
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,523
Hand me the torch, Gobannitio.

107
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,918
You're not worthy of sacrificing
your brother you betrayed.

108
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:03,559
His death belongs to him alone.

109
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:08,206
The magic of his death must
teach us the lesson of his sacrifice.

110
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:13,801
The greater the magic, the greater
the price that must be paid.

111
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:32,604
l will kill you, Gobannitio.

112
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,560
l will kill you.

113
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:54,320
l will kill you.

114
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,838
l will kill you, Gobannitio.

115
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,839
Get up. Even if everyone
in Gaul is divided...

116
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,282
here, there is neither
tribe nor people.

117
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,915
No distinctive mark.
Drop that.

118
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,166
Get up! Hurry up!

119
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:26,006
Where are you going?

120
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:31,206
lt's time for me to do what l must.
l have a task to accomplish.

121
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,805
You're not ready.
Not yet.

122
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,805
Come with me.

123
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:50,442
l will introduce you to a master.

124
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:59,121
Rhia, l've brought you
a young friend.

125
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,964
Just try not to hurt him.

126
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:12,285
Draw a single drop of my blood...

127
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,483
and you can do
whatever you want.

128
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,764
-l thought it was impossible.
-lt is impossible.

129
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,556
Fighting must be a pleasure.

130
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,765
Look at me. Learn my moves.

131
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,118
Learn to anticipate each other...

132
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:53,124
provoke your partner,
entice your opponent to dare.

133
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:56,120
Capture his rage and make
it your own.

134
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,960
Lead the dance.

135
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:02,245
lf you know what you want,
your partner will want it too.

136
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:03,966
Attack again.

137
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:18,878
To be one with your sword, you must
empty yourself of all desire.

138
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,563
And when l'll learn to do that
will l'll have a drop of your blood?

139
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,844
When you achieve that,
you'll dispose of my life.

140
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,561
You must become a master druid.

141
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,402
l will become a master druid.

142
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:42,560
Then the game will be over, and you
will accomplish your destiny.

143
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,162
Did you see your death,
Vercingetorix?

144
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,795
No. l was king.
What does it mean?

145
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:01,562
The knowledge that comes to you
in dreams is yours alone.

146
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,638
A man's destiny is also his alone.

147
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,924
-Yes.
-Then l must follow it.

148
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:11,760
The greater your destiny the greater
the price that you must pay.

149
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:19,965
Since the flames consumed my
childhood, all l've done is study.

150
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:23,799
And now, l've been told
it's time to act.

151
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,522
Just don't abandon the path
of knowledge...

152
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,996
when you take the road of action.

153
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,403
Beware of this course of action.

154
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,365
For years our chiefs have been
victims of their own demons...

155
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,087
they have formed alliances,
and betrayed each other.

156
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:55,483
l'll show you where
this will lead you.

157
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:01,717
The Romans act without true
knowledge. See what they do:

158
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:06,480
a sword of stone right through
the living heart of the land.

159
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:09,082
You must travel this road
for a while.

160
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,641
So here our paths must diverge.

161
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:15,081
Look!

162
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:18,195
-Now, kick me in the ass.
-What?

163
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:21,360
They've seen my druid's robe!
So do what l tell you.

164
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:24,439
l'm a bothersome beggar. Kick me in
the ass and hound me into the woods.

165
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,565
Alright. Go away! Go away!
Come on.

166
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:30,924
-Go away!
-Please.

167
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,964
-And don't come back!
-Please.

168
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,006
l'm sorry.

169
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,445
Where is the Druid?

170
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,281
What Druid?

171
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,639
-The man in the white robe.
-Oh, a beggar, nothing more!

172
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:06,085
Who would dare lay hands
on a Druid.

173
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,795
-Diviciac?
-You know me, Arverne?

174
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:13,599
You'd be a hard man to forget,
for the son of Celtill.

175
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:18,801
-We thought you were dead.
-Where are you going?

176
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,281
Gergovia.

177
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:26,995
Well, l am going to Bibracte
to meet the other chiefs of Gaul.

178
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,159
Would you like to join me?

179
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,239
For a while.

180
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,037
What keeps you here
so far from Rome?

181
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,767
The same thing that kept you
hidden in the woods...

182
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,077
and now sets you on my road.
Destiny!

183
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:48,965
Spoken like a Druid!

184
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,437
Actually, l was once a kind
of a druid of some kind...

185
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:56,402
a high priest of Rome.
lt cost me a lot of money.

186
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,641
Are you a druid?

187
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:03,199
-No, l chose another path.
-So did l. l choose to serve Rome.

188
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:08,443
Rome to which all roads lead:
bridges, aqueducts, roads...

189
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,596
the free movements
of goods and men...

190
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:16,082
and for the good of all
the civilised world!

191
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:20,922
So the selfless Caesar comes to Gaul
to bring civilisation...

192
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,358
to us, poor barbarians.

193
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:26,602
Yes.

194
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:29,562
Yes.

195
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:41,161
One may be born as a barbarian...

196
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:45,281
but earns the right to call
himself a citizen of Rome.

197
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:50,639
Assemble your warriors. Join
me on my expedition to Britain.

198
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:55,519
Win fame, glory, and
Roman citizenship.

199
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,482
And half of everything you seize.

200
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,562
So, our paths diverge now...

201
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,244
but not too long l think.

202
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,360
Thank you for the horse.

203
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,685
l will return it.

204
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:29,604
Do you think he could win back
Gergovia by himself?

205
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:31,959
That boy!

206
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,922
Somehow, Gistus...

207
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,205
l do believe he could!

208
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,116
He never agrees with anything!

209
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:50,997
-Sure.
-No, no, please.

210
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:56,479
Look there, he's riding a
Roman General's horse!

211
00:19:56,647 --> 00:20:00,162
-lt's beautiful.
-l wonder where he comes from.

212
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,835
Who are you? What do
you think you're doing?

213
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,759
Setting my house in order...

214
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,484
and avenging my father.

215
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:41,437
l come to offer you adventure.

216
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,680
l will lead all the warriors of Gaul
to invade the island of Britain.

217
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,722
l offer you glory and fortune.

218
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,682
l have the word of Caesar...

219
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,641
that we shall have
half the booty.

220
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:02,682
And to prove it,
he has given me his horse.

221
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:09,436
Half the booty.
Can you believe it?

222
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,557
You are welcome among us.

223
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,365
Ride at the head of our
Arverne troops...

224
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:27,601
and represent us proudly
before Caesar.

225
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:54,126
Why haven't your spies
found the archdruid?

226
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,599
l'm sure he's the one
who teaches them...

227
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:01,486
to believe in perpetual
changes.

228
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,638
He's my true enemy.

229
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:18,679
Mosa's daughter, Epona
might recognise me.

230
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,525
l salute you, friends...

231
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:32,163
and allies of Rome.

232
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:36,481
Dumnorix and Litavic,
chieftains of the Eduens...

233
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,521
Diviciac, Commios...

234
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:42,605
the valiant Mosa,
chief of the Bellovaques.

235
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:48,566
l liberated you from the Teutons
and l brought you peace.

236
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:54,523
Caesar offers pardon to those
who fought against him.

237
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:59,886
And his friendship to those
who will serve him.

238
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:06,165
Here, Britain, a rich land...

239
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:11,126
inhabited by barbarians
so primitive...

240
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:15,276
-that they paint their faces blue.
-And they go to war.

241
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,679
Let's invade Britain...

242
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:25,647
and half the booty is yours.

243
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:34,285
l can't go.

244
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,441
Why not?

245
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,919
l get seasick.

246
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:50,840
The gods are with us,
Dumnorix.

247
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:56,166
And l guarantee you the
sea will be calm.

248
00:23:57,207 --> 00:24:01,519
Caesar accepts your children as
guarantee that you will be loyal.

249
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:06,316
Epona, princess
of the Bellovaques...

250
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,520
will take care of
the younger ones.

251
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,476
Dumnorix takes hostages.

252
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:21,037
He doesn't give them. Never.

253
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:23,439
-Yes.
-Yes.

254
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:38,558
This is what l want in
exchange for the booty.

255
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:44,155
No, Caesar. This
is an incredible total.

256
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:45,840
For the arms?

257
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:49,763
For the jewellery? For
the thousands of slaves?

258
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:54,079
You still owe us what you
borrowed to pay for the festivals.

259
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:56,522
Popularity is expensive.

260
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:00,880
l don't owe you anything
anymore.

261
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,835
But from now on,
you will owe me.

262
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:08,917
The taxes will be divided between
Rome and you and me.

263
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,999
-l need another four legions.
-To conquer Britain?

264
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:16,038
l'm sending the Gauls.

265
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:20,635
-l have to get rid of them.
-What cynicism!

266
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,396
Another word for politics!

267
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,644
Open the gates!

268
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,441
You were right about
Vercingetorix.

269
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:52,397
He has done it. He's here.

270
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,081
That's a gift of the gods.

271
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,606
And l knew it.

272
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:12,484
Another future victory...

273
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:17,717
for Caius Julius Caesar,
Proconsul of Transalpine Gaul.

274
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:20,996
For the moment.
A victory over the Britons...

275
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:24,000
will bring me no closer to
a triumphal return to Rome...

276
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:27,080
and Rome no closer to the
government it must have.

277
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:31,076
Julius Caesar,
King of the Romans?

278
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:33,881
King? Vercingetorix, no.

279
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,521
A king who founds a dynasty
is a hero...

280
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:42,761
but his son is a mediocrity, and his
grand son a half-wit or a monster...

281
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:46,238
and his great grand son
probably both. No!

282
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:49,841
l don't seek to destroy
the Republic.

283
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:54,396
-Only to rule it.
-A modest enough ambition.

284
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,557
When Alexander the Great was ten
years younger than l am today...

285
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:05,120
he had conquered the
entire civilised world.

286
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:08,765
At your age, he was dead.

287
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,997
All the more reason to hurry.

288
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,559
Dine with me tonight.

289
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,317
l'm sure you will find it
interesting.

290
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:56,956
l'm afraid we will never reach
Britain in such weather.

291
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:01,206
The Gauls only fear having
the sky fall on their heads.

292
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:04,567
And the Gaul who said
that to Alexander...

293
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:07,402
was struck dead
by lightening.

294
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,683
Take this Diviciac!

295
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,205
Listen to me.

296
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,881
So Dumnorix,
still afraid of the sea?

297
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:24,004
l guarantee that the sea
will be calm.

298
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,643
lt's not the sea sickness l fear,
but Caesar.

299
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,683
He offers us half the booty,
and that's not enough for you?

300
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,758
lt's too much.

301
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:40,725
-We must respect the pact
-lt was you...

302
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,837
you, my brother who made
the pact for the Eduens.

303
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:48,159
lt's not for me or my sons
to respect it.

304
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,963
Dumnorix!
What are you going to do:

305
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:55,358
Whatever l can.
Whenever l can.

306
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:08,156
l do believe that you
know each other.

307
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,481
l do?

308
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,325
Or have you forgotten the girl
you asked to be your queen?

309
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:22,716
Epona?

310
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:26,964
Your queen?
The King's wife?

311
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:31,276
When l met him in his village,
l was a little provincial girl...

312
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:33,722
impressed by the son
of a local chieftain...

313
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,321
who was even more impressed
with himself.

314
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:38,519
And what have you become, now?

315
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:42,962
A civilised and educated woman.

316
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:47,359
lmpressed by a Roman General who is
even more impressed with himself?

317
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:53,603
l am, after all,
an impressive man.

318
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,802
We are all impressive people.

319
00:29:58,567 --> 00:29:59,841
You know...

320
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,398
sometimes l think...

321
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,565
that your father...

322
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:09,924
was ahead of his time...

323
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:16,236
-and he had very good ideas.
-To drive your legions from Gaul?

324
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,920
Too many tribes.
You have too many tribes.

325
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,445
And each chieftain has to
be elected every year.

326
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,366
That's a mess.

327
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:31,195
l want to govern Rome.
That's my destiny.

328
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:37,396
The destiny of the Gauls
might be to...

329
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:40,526
have a king...

330
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,524
chosen by Rome.

331
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:06,040
Why not a King
chosen by destiny?

332
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:22,716
-l knew you would come.
-You seem to know Caesar pretty well.

333
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:25,842
Caesar visits me often.

334
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:28,040
You're jealous?

335
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:33,839
l think often of the young
boy of Gergovia...

336
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,717
to whom l gave
a token of my fidelity.

337
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,166
Why do you think
he brought us together?

338
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:48,566
lt's always wise to assume Caesar
knows everything he should know.

339
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:50,683
Dumnorix doesn't trust him.

340
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:54,476
l trust him to be exactly
what he is: Julius Caesar.

341
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,766
l trust him as much
as l trust you.

342
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:01,402
What is that supposed
to mean Epona?

343
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,197
You are and will always be...

344
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:10,282
the leader of great warriors.

345
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:27,605
Ave! Dumnorix.
He stormed into our camp!

346
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,357
He massacred our soldiers
and then fled.

347
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,117
Continue loading the boats.

348
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:45,557
Your brother, l knew
he would betray me.

349
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,120
We should kill all the hostages.

350
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:51,801
No, please, don't
do that Caesar.

351
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,363
Dumnorix must be tried
according to our rules.

352
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:57,405
-l want to see him.
-Let me send Litavic after him.

353
00:32:58,287 --> 00:33:02,075
No, l don't trust the Eduens
anymore, and l don't trust you.

354
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,883
Then send Vercingetorix.

355
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,240
He's an Arverne.

356
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:11,081
Well...

357
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,245
if that is your choice

358
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:17,562
No hostages are to be executed.

359
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:19,924
Bring him back...

360
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,043
alive.

361
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:52,076
Like the mercenaries of Rome...

362
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,920
you still wear your cloak
on your right shoulder.

363
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:56,884
l came to bring you back.

364
00:33:57,047 --> 00:34:00,642
ls the silver-tongued Vercingetorix
trying to convince me...

365
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:04,966
or does the leader of great warriors
want to bring me back by force?

366
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:10,725
We might as well talk,
we can always fight to death later.

367
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:19,685
What order of Caesar did you come
to execute, riding his own horse?

368
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:23,601
To bring you back to be tried
according to our laws.

369
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:25,405
Your brother demanded it.

370
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:29,477
l'm very thankful, and
l am overjoyed to see myself...

371
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:33,435
being condemned by my brothers
in the camp of Caesar.

372
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,086
lf you don't come back...

373
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:38,643
the Eduen hostages will be executed,
and maybe others with them.

374
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:40,763
No, no, no.
What are you saying?

375
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,280
Even if he were furious,
and he must be...

376
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:47,120
Caesar will never kill
the hostages.

377
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:51,321
What Gaul would embark for Britain
if he executed his children?

378
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:55,564
-He will not do it.
-What do we do now?

379
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:58,801
l thought to offer you my horse...

380
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:03,683
and then together, let's go
to avenge the death of your father.

381
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,484
Have you never asked yourself...

382
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:16,845
who would set Eduens against Eduens,
and Arverne against Arverne?

383
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:20,399
Who profited the most
from the death of Celtill?

384
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:56,437
Vercingetorix, go!
Go!

385
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:05,886
Bring back to Caesar
what belongs to Caesar.

386
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:13,437
And give my tribute to him.

387
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:30,402
Your father was a good man.

388
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:46,878
l think we should go
to Gergovia, right now!

389
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,435
Let's go.

390
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:59,045
-What does this hand mean?
-That we have made an enemy...

391
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:04,003
and it would have been much better
to have him as a friend.

392
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,158
Throw the hostages into prison...

393
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:09,562
and lock Epona in a cell.

394
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:16,842
Let it be known that Caesar
will be grateful...

395
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:21,040
to the man who finds
Vercingetorix.

396
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:46,640
Close the gates!

397
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:57,441
You are banned from the city.

398
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:01,639
Caesar has put a price
on your head.

399
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:37,237
They massacred all of the druids.
But l came back to wait.

400
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:41,277
ls Gutuart still alive?

401
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,563
Brother and sister of the sword!

402
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,239
Now you can dispose of my life.

403
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,363
The game will be over soon then.

404
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:22,997
Stay here. Keep an eye on them!

405
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:37,635
We want Vercingetorix
as our war leader.

406
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:44,762
Senators, we command you
elect him chieftain of the Arvernes!

407
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:52,119
l will not be elected
by these cowards...

408
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:56,567
but by the acclamation
of my people.

409
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,846
Caesar cannot make me an outlaw!

410
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:02,965
He is my enemy and
l would be your king.

411
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:09,359
¡We want Vercingetorix
to be our leader!

412
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:26,043
Long live Vercingetorix...

413
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,803
King of the Arvernes.

414
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:32,523
ln the memory of my father...

415
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,285
l proudly accept.

416
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:24,719
People of Gaul.
Let us be what we must be...

417
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:28,361
a free and united people.

418
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:31,966
Together we will chase
the Romans out of Gaul.

419
00:43:33,927 --> 00:43:35,997
They are our enemies...

420
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,839
and all who serve them,
traitors.

421
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:17,044
-Burn the reserves and the barns.
-You want to ruin us!

422
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:19,596
Do as l say or l'll
burn them myself.

423
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,562
Here little ones,
this is for you.

424
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:52,036
He's burning all of Gaul while your
legions are dying of hunger.

425
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:55,199
The men are starting to cast
hungry looks at the horses.

426
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:57,403
He's an intelligent leader.

427
00:44:58,847 --> 00:45:03,363
He refuses to engage the enemy.
That's not a very glorious strategy.

428
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,205
But an effective one.

429
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:08,796
Let us return to
our own province.

430
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,646
Neither glorious, nor effective.

431
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:17,244
We will walk through the
fire and attack Avaricum.

432
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:22,647
Like the scorpion! l will follow
my own logic until death.

433
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:27,277
Let see which logic
Vercingetorix follows.

434
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,958
Evacuate the city...

435
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:08,995
or l will burn it to ashes
with your people still inside.

436
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,556
What right do you have, Arvern?

437
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,755
l can't let the Romans take Avaricum
with all its supplies.

438
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:19,644
l would burn Gergovia
my own town if l had to.

439
00:46:19,807 --> 00:46:24,278
-Then, defend the city with us.
-The besieged can't win.

440
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:28,440
Because of our stupidity,
Caesar would snatch his victory...

441
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,485
from thejaws of defeat
in which l have trapped him.

442
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:34,959
One life for a city.

443
00:46:35,687 --> 00:46:38,155
l offer you the innocent life
of my child.

444
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:45,601
lf you really believe it will
serve the cause of Gaul...

445
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:47,917
great king Vercingetorix,
kill him.

446
00:46:56,487 --> 00:47:00,685
May he live to become a man
worthy of his mother.

447
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:03,521
May Avaricum survive
to see it.

448
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:12,482
-Let us fight a great battle!
-We should fight them now.

449
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:14,524
l'm going to Gergovia.

450
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:26,639
Did l do the right thing?
Or will l live to regret it?

451
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:30,245
You did what you thought
was right...

452
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:33,365
instead of what you
knew was necessary.

453
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:37,004
-Was that a mistake?
-Might does not make right...

454
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:38,766
nor does wrong.

455
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,680
But might is part of this world
of human conflict...

456
00:47:41,847 --> 00:47:45,726
where we all are prisoners.
That's the real trap.

457
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:49,562
Your incomprehensible talking
does not help me.

458
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,520
Do you think so?

459
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:07,363
Now we will do what
Vercingetorix hasn't done.

460
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:20,200
Like the scorpion,
victory or death.

461
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:24,396
We'll kill all the inhabitants.
l want a blood bath.

462
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,558
Caesar, it's not necessary.

463
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,199
All the women...

464
00:48:52,047 --> 00:48:55,244
all the elders,
even all the children.

465
00:48:56,407 --> 00:48:59,046
Thanks to you,
they've all perished!

466
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:01,163
You abandoned them.

467
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:05,601
You refused to fight.
You are a coward.

468
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:09,679
And you would turn
us all into cowards.

469
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:12,437
You promised to lead us
to victory.

470
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:16,077
What victory? The one
he promised to Caesar?

471
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:20,159
You accuse me of treason?

472
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:24,361
Then kill me.

473
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,357
Yes, l betrayed Gaul.

474
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:41,004
Yes, l was a coward.

475
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:44,204
Your anger is my anger...

476
00:49:44,527 --> 00:49:46,006
at myself.

477
00:49:48,127 --> 00:49:52,166
Because l made one mistake.
l listened to you.

478
00:49:54,247 --> 00:49:57,842
The city had to burn.
And would l had done it...

479
00:49:58,247 --> 00:50:00,442
the inhabitants would
still be alive...

480
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:03,241
and the troops of Caesar famished.

481
00:50:05,207 --> 00:50:07,675
But Caesar made
a worse mistake...

482
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:10,437
when he ordered this slaughter...

483
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:15,726
which horrifies and
revolts my heart...

484
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:19,516
and yours, and the hearts
of all Gauls.

485
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:26,315
Now if you think you've done me a
favour by giving me this command...

486
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:33,483
And if you think l'm no longer
worthy of this honour...

487
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,558
l'll hand it back to you right now.

488
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:13,526
Destiny.

489
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,040
That is destiny.

490
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:34,160
Disgusting!

491
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:38,166
lt was a real useless...

492
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:42,366
slaughter.

493
00:51:44,127 --> 00:51:45,321
Useless?

494
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:53,605
Now we will have
a decisive battle.

495
00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:57,806
l've found the secret
of the Gallic swords.

496
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:19,037
We march to Gergovia.

497
00:52:52,887 --> 00:52:54,843
Position the catapults.

498
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,565
Load them.

499
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:05,207
-Hurry up!
-Why? There's no one there.

500
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:06,846
Form your lines.

501
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:11,679
Get ready.

502
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,604
Vercingetorix is surrounded.
He doesn't dare show himself.

503
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,041
Let's attack!

504
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:08,399
Your ally Litavic,
has just arrived.

505
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:11,279
On my word!

506
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:37,285
Hey, you men, we've
got something for you.

507
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:39,597
Look up here.

508
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:42,606
Come on, we're ready for you.

509
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:53,842
You're so shy!

510
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:59,086
Come taste this, please.

511
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:01,725
Take a look...

512
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:15,804
l mean to be the first.

513
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,519
Form a pyramid.

514
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:32,120
You'll get to see
what real men are like!

515
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,884
-Look what's waiting for you.
-Look.

516
00:56:55,887 --> 00:56:58,003
You're shy!

517
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:10,436
Death to Caesar,
death to Caesar.

518
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,035
Kill them all.
Death to the Romans...

519
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:32,202
We're not afraid
of any roman!

520
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:53,565
Well they're your allies.
l just hope they're up to it.

521
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:25,158
The Eduens are with you.

522
00:59:26,407 --> 00:59:29,319
Caesar has massacred Avaracum.
He's no longer our friend.

523
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,565
You, who has united us in this fight.
You are my brother.

524
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:34,640
Here.

525
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:10,484
That bastard Litavic!

526
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:29,839
May every single Gaul be cursed.

527
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:44,083
Let's attack!

528
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,124
Victory!

529
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:36,605
-Victory!
-Victory!

530
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:38,679
Victory!

531
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:40,276
Victory!

532
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:54,598
Victory!

533
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:03,004
Vercingetorix,
King of the Arvernes...

534
01:04:04,127 --> 01:04:08,643
leader of the great warriors.
What do you see after the victory?

535
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:11,436
l see all the peoples
of Gaul united.

536
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:15,836
United? Under the dark
desire of revenge?

537
01:04:16,007 --> 01:04:20,956
No. l want to force Caesar back
on the same road he himself built.

538
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:25,201
lt is roads which use the pretext of
free movement of goods and men...

539
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:28,279
to accelerate the orders of
the empire...

540
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:32,122
which strangles us
to satisfy its ambition.

541
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:37,237
ln my father's memory, l will realise
the magic he wanted to create.

542
01:04:38,847 --> 01:04:41,884
Chase the Germans and the Romans
out of Gaul.

543
01:04:43,407 --> 01:04:44,601
Gauls...

544
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:48,721
l welcome you to Bibracte.

545
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:54,076
Vercingetorix has done what
no one has ever done before.

546
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:58,843
He has defeated the mighty Caesar
at the head of his legions.

547
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:01,805
-Six legions of them at least.
-Ten!

548
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:05,521
A Hundred! A Hundred!

549
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:12,083
Our women have proven that they
could take care of a hundred legions.

550
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:20,555
Shall we elect Vercingetorix
commander in chief of the army...

551
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:24,117
to get rid of the Romans
and the Teutons.

552
01:05:29,007 --> 01:05:30,838
l don't want a battle...

553
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:33,726
even if we win.
And if we do...

554
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:39,280
Rome will not rest until
that victory is turned into defeat.

555
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:43,801
Maybe so.

556
01:05:45,327 --> 01:05:49,081
To cut Caesar roads to the north
we should hire the Teutons.

557
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:54,526
You're crazy. They burned
your father for less than that.

558
01:05:55,487 --> 01:06:00,163
That's not what they want from you.
Don't tell them such a thing. Listen.

559
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:02,795
What they all want now
is a final battle.

560
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:06,962
-We must continue.
-We will be victorious.

561
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:20,887
l took arms for
the freedom of all.

562
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:26,275
l pledge my life up to
the last drop of my blood...

563
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:30,804
no matter what sacrifice
destiny may call upon me to make.

564
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:34,676
Be with me and l will
lead you to victory...

565
01:06:35,727 --> 01:06:39,845
into thejaws of death
with a battle song in my heart.

566
01:07:57,647 --> 01:08:02,323
Now, let us choose our capital.

567
01:08:04,327 --> 01:08:06,045
The capital should be Pabracs.

568
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:07,726
Why?

569
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:11,164
The Cadurques shall follow...

570
01:08:11,327 --> 01:08:13,124
the orders of the Eduens.

571
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:28,562
The capital should be Genabum.
Genabum!

572
01:08:43,807 --> 01:08:47,277
-l was very worried about you.
-l was never afraid.

573
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:52,035
l was locked in a cell alone.
l had time to think about you...

574
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:56,360
about Caesar, about his promises
and his lies...

575
01:08:57,527 --> 01:08:59,119
but mainly about you.

576
01:08:59,407 --> 01:09:02,524
And do you still trust the
leader of the great warriors...

577
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:05,516
who wanted you to be his queen?

578
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:09,562
At the time l accepted when
l was asked by the boy.

579
01:09:09,727 --> 01:09:11,718
And now?

580
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:18,044
l'd be honoured to be asked by
the King of the Arvernes.

581
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:35,242
Not for you, for her.

582
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:47,800
Like everyone, l have come to humbly
bow before the conqueror of Caesar...

583
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:51,961
before he who had me liberated.

584
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:09,198
Wait, l want to talk to you.
Wait!

585
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:13,203
Between a boy and a girl,
there should be something more.

586
01:10:41,327 --> 01:10:44,637
l only want you as my queen,
but...

587
01:10:47,047 --> 01:10:48,241
But?

588
01:10:54,287 --> 01:10:55,606
But what?

589
01:10:55,927 --> 01:10:59,602
Well, l might be gone
for an eternity.

590
01:11:01,807 --> 01:11:05,800
Since it's only that,
take me with you then.

591
01:11:07,807 --> 01:11:11,038
No, l can't,
not to war.

592
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:14,602
My place is wherever
you will be.

593
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:18,237
-No. No, it's impossible.
-You think?

594
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:21,685
Try to stop me!

595
01:12:37,447 --> 01:12:38,960
You are beautiful.

596
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:17,439
Go and warn the others.

597
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:32,281
l want to know what the Teutons
are doing here.

598
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:35,643
-Send out scouts.
-Yes sir.

599
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,207
We must hurry.
We need shelter.

600
01:14:48,887 --> 01:14:51,003
Come on! Let's go!

601
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:39,679
He's here, he's here.

602
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:43,244
Allow me the honour of
giving you my bedroom.

603
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,681
Put it over there on the table.
Hurry up, please.

604
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:52,486
We are preparing the room
for the Bellovaque princess.

605
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:55,286
l thank you chieftain of Alesia
for your hospitality.

606
01:15:55,447 --> 01:15:59,440
l am sure the staff of our commander
can organise his own quarters.

607
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:06,320
Go and help him.
Do it!

608
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:09,400
-What?
-Help him. Over there.

609
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:14,202
As they say, war is hell.

610
01:16:15,007 --> 01:16:19,046
-l also want to be a great warrior.
-We'll talk about it later.

611
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,404
The army can retire;
we can manage on our own.

612
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:35,205
-You want to be my squire?
-Yes!

613
01:16:44,087 --> 01:16:46,157
lt's good to be inside.

614
01:16:50,207 --> 01:16:51,196
To us.

615
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:55,202
Do you know who the goddess
of Alesia is?

616
01:16:55,367 --> 01:16:56,561
-No.
-No, who?

617
01:16:57,847 --> 01:17:00,156
lt's the horse goddess Epona.

618
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:05,996
You crack yourself up,
Fancy Helmet.

619
01:17:16,247 --> 01:17:18,283
Caesar is coming
to besiege us.

620
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:22,557
Too risky for him. He knows
we have an immense army.

621
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:26,635
He must know, but that's
what l believe he will do.

622
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:32,917
-We should leave here now.
-Leave here?

623
01:17:33,207 --> 01:17:36,916
l thought you wanted one great
final battle, just like Caesar.

624
01:17:38,127 --> 01:17:40,721
ls it what Gaul really needs?
No...

625
01:17:40,887 --> 01:17:43,879
but now the die is already cast.

626
01:17:46,087 --> 01:17:50,160
The battle you longed for
has already begun.

627
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:14,643
-We've got food for one month.
-Cut the rations in half.

628
01:20:15,487 --> 01:20:18,797
Equal rations for the army
and for the civilians.

629
01:20:23,607 --> 01:20:25,484
You must ride to the four winds...

630
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:28,400
gather a huge army of relief
and return.

631
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:30,478
lt is your challenge, make it work.

632
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:36,116
lf you want to win this battle, you
must return before the next moon.

633
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:39,962
You will be the hammer,
and l will be the anvil.

634
01:20:48,287 --> 01:20:51,563
And please, remember.
Do not attack.

635
01:20:51,887 --> 01:20:54,003
-What?
-Do not attack.

636
01:21:08,367 --> 01:21:10,881
The Gauls will send
a relief army.

637
01:21:11,047 --> 01:21:15,438
l know, and l'll be ready
before they arrive.

638
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:42,275
Caesar's fortifications worry me
and demoralise the army.

639
01:21:42,447 --> 01:21:46,235
But not me. He won't
have time to finish them.

640
01:21:47,247 --> 01:21:49,522
The Teutons are everywhere...

641
01:21:49,687 --> 01:21:54,363
but our spies can't really find out
what they are really here for.

642
01:21:57,567 --> 01:21:59,319
Caesar bought them.

643
01:22:11,247 --> 01:22:14,125
There we are open
to the valley.

644
01:22:15,127 --> 01:22:19,996
l'll let you pass if you tell me
where your archdruid is.

645
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:24,320
We don't know.

646
01:22:25,247 --> 01:22:28,398
We don't understand him anyway,
so how can we tell you about him.

647
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:29,556
Strange!

648
01:22:30,727 --> 01:22:34,515
You want to join Vercingetorix,
to aid him against me.

649
01:22:34,687 --> 01:22:37,645
We don't interfere with
your world of strife.

650
01:22:37,807 --> 01:22:43,359
Your Vercingetorix dealt me
some superb and unexpected blows...

651
01:22:43,767 --> 01:22:46,998
and you enjoy it,
as much as l do.

652
01:22:48,567 --> 01:22:51,604
To you, the prize of victory
is indispensable Caesar.

653
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,837
Without it, your life
is meaningless.

654
01:22:55,047 --> 01:23:00,201
Druids. l have to establish
an absolute place to stand...

655
01:23:00,367 --> 01:23:03,120
always the same, immutable.

656
01:23:03,407 --> 01:23:07,195
l have to extend an empire
and to hold it together.

657
01:23:08,327 --> 01:23:09,521
That is destiny.

658
01:23:10,327 --> 01:23:12,887
Your words reduce
others to silence.

659
01:23:13,047 --> 01:23:15,800
But when you have suppressed
all your adversaries...

660
01:23:15,967 --> 01:23:18,276
there will be no more
combat, Caesar.

661
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:21,803
Your world will be irresistible
and your isolation complete.

662
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:24,362
l won't let you go to Alesia.

663
01:23:30,207 --> 01:23:33,882
We must elect the general
of the relief army.

664
01:23:34,727 --> 01:23:39,960
Time is short, Gauls! Vercingetorix
desperately awaits our coming.

665
01:23:40,847 --> 01:23:43,122
Each of you take a ball to vote.

666
01:23:44,087 --> 01:23:45,759
Each in turn.

667
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:54,876
Good.

668
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:01,316
Good.

669
01:24:05,327 --> 01:24:06,601
Ten!

670
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:09,999
l said each in turn.

671
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:32,926
All our foragers who tried
to reach the countryside...

672
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:35,647
were massacred by the Romans.

673
01:24:35,807 --> 01:24:39,402
And all the Romans who left their
camp were massacred by the Gauls.

674
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:43,958
Maybe, but this does not provide us
anything to eat.

675
01:24:49,287 --> 01:24:53,200
Hey! When will this famous army
of yours arrive?

676
01:24:54,567 --> 01:24:59,402
l'm saving the rat
for those traitors.

677
01:24:59,847 --> 01:25:02,520
We'll cut their balls
and eat them...

678
01:25:02,687 --> 01:25:06,202
if they ever get here,
the miserable cowards.

679
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:07,959
They will come.

680
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,726
Vercingetorix escapes us again.

681
01:25:30,767 --> 01:25:33,406
The Gauls don't eat their horses.

682
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:37,835
They send them out because
they can't feed them.

683
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:40,403
But he has stayed.

684
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:50,886
Let's attack now...

685
01:25:52,007 --> 01:25:54,601
while we still have our strength.

686
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:57,725
We must endure...

687
01:25:58,087 --> 01:26:01,477
for the sake of the army of Gauls
coming to join us.

688
01:26:01,647 --> 01:26:03,285
The fear of their coming...

689
01:26:03,807 --> 01:26:08,323
keeps the Romans working night and
day to build their fortifications.

690
01:26:10,407 --> 01:26:15,845
Listen, if they find themselves
fighting over our corpses...

691
01:26:17,727 --> 01:26:20,321
what heart do you think
they will have for it?

692
01:26:21,287 --> 01:26:25,439
Or you doubt their faithfulness
because they haven't arrived yet?

693
01:26:30,247 --> 01:26:32,317
l'm sorry, you're right.

694
01:26:35,007 --> 01:26:40,001
We cannot survive much longer
on the food we have left.

695
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:46,882
We must send everyone who
cannot fight out of Alesia.

696
01:26:47,087 --> 01:26:50,124
They might have more chances
of survival in the countryside.

697
01:26:50,287 --> 01:26:53,359
Don't send out the children.
l'll take care of them.

698
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:01,566
You're right.

699
01:27:03,367 --> 01:27:05,164
The druids will help you.

700
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:14,405
They're all asleep.

701
01:27:29,727 --> 01:27:32,195
The hammer will never
meet the anvil.

702
01:27:32,487 --> 01:27:34,364
l will win this battle...

703
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:40,682
-if the army obeys me.
-What are you afraid of?

704
01:27:44,687 --> 01:27:47,121
The deep silence of others.

705
01:27:57,967 --> 01:28:02,006
Twenty balls for Litavic.
Twenty balls for Virido.

706
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:05,760
-Twenty balls for Commios.
-Pig heads!

707
01:28:07,087 --> 01:28:08,805
The general has to
have the majority.

708
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:11,083
Twenty balls for Cassivelaun.

709
01:28:12,847 --> 01:28:14,405
This is intolerable.

710
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:17,081
The leader must be me.

711
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:20,122
Me.

712
01:28:22,567 --> 01:28:24,285
A Parisi!

713
01:28:25,207 --> 01:28:26,606
Silence!

714
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:30,243
We've lost too much time
already.

715
01:28:30,407 --> 01:28:33,604
There will be no leader,
but four equal generals

716
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,723
Yes, me.

717
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:38,163
Virido, Commios...

718
01:28:41,087 --> 01:28:43,203
Cassivelaun, and me.

719
01:30:40,527 --> 01:30:43,599
Our orders are still
not to attack.

720
01:30:49,207 --> 01:30:50,242
Yes.

721
01:30:51,327 --> 01:30:53,887
We can't stay here
doing nothing.

722
01:30:54,047 --> 01:30:55,685
What is it going to change?

723
01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:59,841
Spring will still come, grass
will still grow by itself...

724
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:03,921
and now Caesar is besieged
in his own fortifications.

725
01:31:05,087 --> 01:31:07,078
And the Teutons won't attack...

726
01:31:08,447 --> 01:31:10,517
if we stay well organised.

727
01:31:14,607 --> 01:31:17,644
-What if they don't attack?
-Then we die.

728
01:31:24,447 --> 01:31:26,961
lt's triumph or death.

729
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:29,480
And what will decide?

730
01:31:31,567 --> 01:31:34,877
Destiny, Brutus.

731
01:31:37,407 --> 01:31:38,726
Destiny!

732
01:31:55,087 --> 01:31:56,520
-Hello.
-Hi.

733
01:31:56,847 --> 01:31:58,280
Won't you play with us?

734
01:31:58,687 --> 01:32:02,441
One toss, catch with one hand.
Those are the rules!

735
01:32:03,407 --> 01:32:06,638
-lf l score the same, we play again.
-All right.

736
01:32:19,887 --> 01:32:21,639
We're even!
Play again!

737
01:32:23,047 --> 01:32:26,164
You said one toss,
with one hand.

738
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:28,642
No. The rules have changed.

739
01:32:28,807 --> 01:32:32,004
You always change the rules.
l mean, you can't play like that.

740
01:32:33,767 --> 01:32:38,318
He's right. You're even. He's
not playing to lose or to win.

741
01:32:38,807 --> 01:32:43,198
He wants to keep the game from ending
because he wants us to stay together.

742
01:32:47,087 --> 01:32:49,043
For me it's all over.

743
01:32:49,207 --> 01:32:52,324
But you must go on
and fulfil your destiny.

744
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:56,080
And now you must not let
the great wheel of destiny...

745
01:32:56,247 --> 01:32:58,317
roll over the people of Gaul.

746
01:33:14,727 --> 01:33:18,959
Go to her. There will
not be many more nights.

747
01:33:52,087 --> 01:33:55,602
Do not attack!
Do not attack!

748
01:33:56,767 --> 01:33:59,565
Carnix.

749
01:34:33,927 --> 01:34:37,476
They haven't listened.
They're attacking anyway.

750
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:39,966
How stupid!

751
01:34:53,407 --> 01:34:56,638
Caesar, they're attacking
from all sides.

752
01:34:58,807 --> 01:35:00,684
As l always told you...

753
01:35:01,927 --> 01:35:06,239
that's what happens if you don't
have a commander in chief.

754
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:23,326
Carnix. Carnix.

755
01:35:24,247 --> 01:35:25,760
Carnix.

756
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:28,955
Carnix!

757
01:35:31,527 --> 01:35:32,562
Yes!

758
01:35:56,727 --> 01:35:59,525
You. You want to fight?

759
01:36:02,967 --> 01:36:04,446
You want to die?

760
01:36:06,287 --> 01:36:08,596
You want to live forever?

761
01:36:12,007 --> 01:36:15,317
Then l will lead you,
and together...

762
01:36:17,207 --> 01:36:19,596
we will become immortal.

763
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:33,605
Don't be afraid, Brutus;

764
01:38:15,047 --> 01:38:16,446
Go!

765
01:40:44,767 --> 01:40:47,042
And now unleash the cavalry.

766
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:11,406
He has always refused
the decisive battle.

767
01:46:11,567 --> 01:46:13,876
l'm sure he's up to something.

768
01:46:15,407 --> 01:46:20,197
And l don't understand what. l do
not like what l don't understand.

769
01:46:32,607 --> 01:46:37,123
The final battle he never wanted
is a real massacre...

770
01:46:37,487 --> 01:46:39,717
and Litavic is dead.

771
01:46:39,887 --> 01:46:42,959
He wanted to hire the Teutons...

772
01:46:43,567 --> 01:46:46,639
and we stopped him.

773
01:46:47,447 --> 01:46:49,438
And now what are we to do?

774
01:46:50,087 --> 01:46:51,805
Well, it's up to him.

775
01:46:52,687 --> 01:46:54,439
We can only wait...

776
01:46:55,007 --> 01:46:56,565
and see what he'll do!

777
01:46:58,567 --> 01:47:01,604
When the people will not
follow where you lead...

778
01:47:03,087 --> 01:47:04,918
you must follow them...

779
01:47:05,807 --> 01:47:07,320
or walk alone.

780
01:47:07,647 --> 01:47:10,844
You were right, the game
should never stop.

781
01:47:11,127 --> 01:47:13,482
What does it matter
at the end...

782
01:47:13,647 --> 01:47:16,207
to win what your enemy
will lose...

783
01:47:17,527 --> 01:47:19,643
or to lose what he will win?

784
01:47:23,567 --> 01:47:25,398
Where will it lead you?

785
01:47:26,767 --> 01:47:29,520
As far as my energy will allow...

786
01:47:31,127 --> 01:47:35,484
so the greatWheel of Destiny
will follow its course...

787
01:47:36,407 --> 01:47:41,322
eternally moved by love,
as far as necessity demands.

788
01:47:48,287 --> 01:47:53,202
l've always known that
l would always love you.

789
01:47:54,167 --> 01:47:56,601
l will not have another queen...

790
01:47:57,687 --> 01:47:59,006
but you.

791
01:49:04,007 --> 01:49:06,362
He's going where nothing
more can be written.

792
01:49:09,367 --> 01:49:14,122
The greater the magic, the greater
the price that must be paid.

793
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:31,163
l have only started
what l will never finish.

794
01:52:57,767 --> 01:53:01,043
l come to offer you
the glory of your victory...

795
01:53:01,567 --> 01:53:03,842
which Rome will
forever honour...

796
01:53:04,447 --> 01:53:08,838
with inscriptions in stone
and eternal flames.

797
01:53:09,407 --> 01:53:14,606
The light of my victory will make
my invisible past failures heavier.

798
01:53:20,047 --> 01:53:22,242
l offered to make you a King.

799
01:53:22,487 --> 01:53:25,524
So accept the surrender
of a King.

800
01:54:15,047 --> 01:54:20,121
Caesar was never emperor of Rome.
On the ldes of March, 44 BC...

801
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:23,485
he was assassinated
on the steps on the senate.

802
01:54:23,647 --> 01:54:26,923
His faithful Brutus
struck the fatal blow.

803
01:54:27,087 --> 01:54:31,683
A few steps away, two years earlier,
at about two in the afternoon...

804
01:54:31,847 --> 01:54:34,919
Vercingetorix, imprisoned
in the Tulianum...

805
01:54:35,087 --> 01:54:37,999
was executed
by order of Caesar.

806
01:54:38,207 --> 01:54:39,925
He did not win the Gallic war...

807
01:54:40,087 --> 01:54:43,124
but for the first time,
he had united all its people...

808
01:54:43,287 --> 01:54:46,120
who, still today live on
in our memory.
