(WOMAN SHRIEKING)

1615
02:07:35,441 --> 02:07:37,401
(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)

1616
02:07:41,363 --> 02:07:42,698
Get him up!

1617
02:07:46,994 --> 02:07:49,455
RACHEL: It ain't just
for you to decide.

1618
02:07:51,373 --> 02:07:56,378
That child has a choice.
I didn't have no choice.

1619
02:07:58,881 --> 02:08:01,151
What kind of life do you think
is gonna be better for him?

1620
02:08:01,175 --> 02:08:02,885
Yeah, that ain't
the point.

1621
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:05,888
I don't want my boy
to get lynched.

1622
02:08:07,473 --> 02:08:08,724
Or beat.

1623
02:08:10,851 --> 02:08:12,978
I want him to
go to a school.

1624
02:08:14,271 --> 02:08:15,939
I don't want him
to drop his eyes

1625
02:08:16,023 --> 02:08:18,233
every time a
white man walk by.

1626
02:08:19,943 --> 02:08:21,820
I don't want him
to be a "boy" no more

1627
02:08:21,904 --> 02:08:23,906
once he turn into a man.

1628
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:27,534
Don't you want that, too?

1629
02:08:29,078 --> 02:08:31,497
Of course I do.

1630
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:33,123
We got to go up North.

1631
02:08:33,207 --> 02:08:34,792
Mmm-hmm.

1632
02:08:35,459 --> 02:08:38,754
It ain't your fault
we lost that war.

1633
02:08:38,837 --> 02:08:41,757
I know you tried to
win it all by yourself.

1634
02:08:46,136 --> 02:08:50,224
This is our home.
It's our home.

1635
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:00,359
PROSECUTOR: <i>We would
like to offer you</i>

1636
02:09:00,442 --> 02:09:01,693
<i>a proposal, Mr. Knight.</i>

1637
02:09:03,487 --> 02:09:07,658
This book is pretty
conclusive evidence.

1638
02:09:09,493 --> 02:09:11,537
In fact, in all my
years of prosecuting,

1639
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:13,914
I never seen a more
damning piece of evidence.

1640
02:09:15,541 --> 02:09:18,210
Now, Mr. Knight, I don't
believe you really knew

1641
02:09:18,293 --> 02:09:20,379
which side of the
family you were on.

1642
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:23,280
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
What's your offer?

1643
02:09:24,216 --> 02:09:28,011
We have no desire to send
your client to jail, Mr. Oaks,

1644
02:09:28,095 --> 02:09:30,889
but we can't tolerate
this kind of example, either.

1645
02:09:31,932 --> 02:09:34,476
So if he will get
this marriage annulled,

1646
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:35,936
leave the state
of Mississippi,

1647
02:09:37,271 --> 02:09:40,607
then we'll agree to drop
all charges against him.

1648
02:09:41,567 --> 02:09:43,068
You mean, I end my marriage?

1649
02:09:43,152 --> 02:09:44,587
PROSECUTOR: In case
you haven't been here

1650
02:09:44,611 --> 02:09:47,072
for the past three
weeks, Mr. Knight,

1651
02:09:47,156 --> 02:09:50,993
your marriage is neither
a lawful nor a proper union.

1652
02:09:52,911 --> 02:09:54,663
"Proper union"?

1653
02:09:56,832 --> 02:09:58,375
Proper...

1654
02:09:58,459 --> 02:10:00,627
I was married in
this courthouse.

1655
02:10:01,253 --> 02:10:03,672
I was married in
this courthouse!

1656
02:10:29,656 --> 02:10:32,659
But where we gonna go?
We can't get married anywhere else.

1657
02:10:36,038 --> 02:10:37,956
Up North, I guess.
(SCOFFS)

1658
02:10:39,541 --> 02:10:41,543
JUNIE LEE: <i>We don't know
anybody up North.</i>

1659
02:11:31,176 --> 02:11:34,596
JUDGE: I understand your client
wishes to change his plea, counselor.

1660
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:36,390
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
Yes, he does, Your Honor.

1661
02:11:36,473 --> 02:11:38,392
JUDGE: Is this true,
Mr. Knight?

1662
02:11:46,817 --> 02:11:48,417
No, it's not, Your Honor.
(GAVEL BANGING)

1663
02:11:48,652 --> 02:11:50,571
JUDGE: Mr. Oaks...
If I could just...

1664
02:11:50,654 --> 02:11:52,614
Your Honor,
I'm not changin' my plea

1665
02:11:52,698 --> 02:11:54,116
'cause I'm not guilty
of anything.

1666
02:11:54,199 --> 02:11:57,035
JUDGE: Young man, I don't
appreciate these games,

1667
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,788
and I am tempted to rescind
your bail right now.

1668
02:11:59,871 --> 02:12:00,872
Your Honor...

1669
02:12:00,956 --> 02:12:02,541
You can rescind
anything you want,

1670
02:12:02,624 --> 02:12:04,042
but I'm not changin' my plea.

1671
02:12:04,126 --> 02:12:05,144
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
(GAVEL POUNDING)

1672
02:12:05,168 --> 02:12:06,295
JUDGE: Fine.

1673
02:12:06,378 --> 02:12:08,630
Bailiff will take the
defendant into custody.

1674
02:12:08,714 --> 02:12:10,173
Bail is hereby rescinded.

1675
02:12:10,257 --> 02:12:11,359
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
Your Honor...

1676
02:12:11,383 --> 02:12:13,135
You missed your chance,
Mr. Oaks.

1677
02:12:13,218 --> 02:12:15,220
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.

1678
02:12:15,304 --> 02:12:16,430
I love you, honey.

1679
02:12:16,513 --> 02:12:17,593
JUNIE LEE: I love you, too.
