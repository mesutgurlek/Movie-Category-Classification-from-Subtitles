11
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,241
My name is Sakura Nishi.

12
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:57,649
I left Japan for China
in May, 1939.

13
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,588
I was assigned to the
Tienstin Army Hospital.

14
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,795
Nurse Taniguchi
and you four, surgery.

15
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,800
Nurse Nishi and you three,
general medicine.

16
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,302
Nishi.

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,709
Half of your patients are serious.
The rest are not.

18
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,379
They're mainly TB and
mentally ill patients.

19
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:30,016
Some aren't sick at all.
Be careful.

20
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:37,524
Many can demonstrate a fever
by agitating the thermometer.

21
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:43,429
Mental patients who've recovered
pretend their sick.

22
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:49,235
They prefer being here
to manning the front lines.

23
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:54,340
Seeing through their lies
is your job.

24
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,744
You'll be with them
every day.

25
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,846
Understand?

26
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:06,986
Outwardly it's just like
a military hospital in Japan.

27
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,191
But in fact it's a field hospital.

28
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,395
You're new here?

29
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,204
Where was your last post?

30
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:24,791
After graduating I spent three
years in a Tokyo Hospital.

31
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,108
Born in Tokyo?
Me too.

32
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,810
From the Kiba area.

33
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:35,315
So, your family is
in the lumber trade?

34
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,586
Grandfather was,
I don't remember.

35
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:40,920
Why not?

36
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,124
Father died before
I was born.

37
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,230
Mother also, when I was two.

38
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,205
An aunt raised me.

39
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,632
How old are you?

40
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,634
I'm 24.

41
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,239
I'm Pvt. Sakamoto, also from
Tokyo. Be good to me.

42
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,980
Tokyo, eh?
Damn it!

43
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,782
I wish I was back there.

44
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,390
Nishi, time to make
your rounds.

45
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,574
Stop it!
I'll scream!

46
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,677
Go ahead.

47
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,481
Let me go!
Let me go!

48
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,796
No use fighting back.

49
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,600
Everyone's bored.
They'll enjoy the show.

50
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,661
I reported everything
the next night.

51
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,667
I see.
Pvt. Sakamoto again?

52
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,070
You're his third victim.

53
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,900
He isn't fully recovered,

54
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,212
but this can't go on!

55
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,189
Hello, nurse.

56
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:36,596
I'm being sent back to
the front line.

57
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,600
A death sentence.

58
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,302
Congratulate me.

59
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,610
Thanks for everything.

60
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,313
Good luck.

61
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,819
I really enjoyed it.
Next time it's my turn.

62
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:05,158
Stuck here all day.
A man needs a woman.

63
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:20,673
My next posting, two months
later, was even worse.

64
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,043
Hell couldn't be much worse.

65
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:27,079
It was a front line hospital.

66
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,885
FIELD HOSPITAL

67
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,767
Bullet wound.

68
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,874
He's dead.

69
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,079
Surgery.

70
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,086
Amputation.

71
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,390
Dead.

72
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,794
Put my foot back on!

73
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,897
Forget it, son.

74
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,800
Amputation.

75
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,172
All right, son.
We'll stop the pain.

76
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,409
No saving him.

77
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,150
Surgery.

78
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,553
Help me!
Please!

79
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,456
Control yourself!

80
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,859
Separate the dead.

81
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,168
Amputation.
At the thigh.

82
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,870
Anesthetic?

83
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,372
Just local.

84
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,385
He's a kicker,
hold him down.

85
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,819
Idiot!
Get back here!

86
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,851
Mother!

87
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,957
All right, he's ready.
I'll sew him up.

88
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,311
Get me a bandage.

89
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:33,526
200 operations over
three days and three nights.

90
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,129
Lt. Okabe, the surgeon,

91
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:44,236
the medics and nurse,
all went without sleep.

92
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,943
Arm next.
Hold him down.

93
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,399
More and more men
were brought in.

94
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,704
Many died before surgery.

95
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,609
Some died during surgery.

96
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:30,216
Others died after the operation.

97
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,221
They all went to the morgue.

98
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,934
Get their tags or we
won't know who is who.

99
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,884
There was a mountain of tags.

100
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,487
It was the end
of the third day.

101
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,302
His pulse is strong.

102
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,406
He's lost too much blood.

103
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,409
He's a goner.

104
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,615
Nurse Nishi.

105
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,521
It's me, Sakamoto...

106
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,629
Save me, please!

107
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,835
I'm sorry
about what happened.

108
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,874
I don't want to die!
I want to live!

109
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,778
I'm begging you!

110
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,383
Don't leave me!

111
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:16,388
Nurse Nishi!
Please don't let me die!

112
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,592
Don't kill me...

113
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,297
Doctor.

114
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,100
He needs a transfusion.

115
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,806
Anesthetic.

116
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:42,948
Only colonels and above
get blood transfusions.

117
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:46,452
I know this man.
Please, Doctor.

118
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,621
How do you know him?

119
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,726
He was my patient in Tienstin
for a while.

120
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,529
He's not kin,
or even a friend?

121
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,563
No, sir.

122
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:04,069
We're swamped. These others
have a better chance.

123
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:13,078
If you come to my quarters
tonight, I'll do it for you.

124
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,284
Thank you, sir.

125
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,786
Just this one!

126
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,002
I didn't want him to die.

127
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:43,008
I didn't want him to think
that was my revenge.

128
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,812
That I'd deliberately kill him.

129
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,716
The transfusion didn't work.

130
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:57,122
By the end of the shift
he was dead.

131
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,163
What's up?

132
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,899
No pulse.
His pupils are dilated.

133
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,972
He's been gut shot,
it kills them every time.

134
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,407
What a waste of
precious blood.

135
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,980
We'll take him out.
Throw him in the pile.

136
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,682
One more dead!

137
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:52,111
Who is it?

138
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,053
So, you really came?

139
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,539
Were you joking?

140
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,658
No, I meant it.

141
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,862
Pour me some wine.

142
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,967
The spoils of war.

143
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:23,375
The man we gave
the transfusion to died.

144
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,983
That's no surprise.
It would've been a miracle.

145
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,254
I'm sorry I caused you trouble.

146
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,893
Don't play favorites
with the patients.

147
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,763
Soldiers aren't human beings!

148
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,731
They're just weapons.

149
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:52,905
Why did you operate if
you knew he'd die?

150
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,410
Before I was drafted,

151
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,647
I was a specialist surgeon.

152
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,650
But here, I'm no doctor.

153
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:12,224
I have to decide
who will live.

154
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,562
Sometimes I long
to be a doctor again.

155
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,368
I knew he'd die but
I did my best anyway.

156
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,040
The last vestiges of
my professionnal pride.

157
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:31,376
made me go through
the motions.

158
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,382
Have a drink.
You'll sleep better.

159
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,886
Yes, sir, I will.

160
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:47,192
How can I save
truckloads of them?

161
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,699
Ruptured blood vessels,
smashed bones...

162
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,703
Loss of blood or
gangrene gets most of them.

163
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,140
We've no blood
and very little medicine.

164
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,645
So I cut off their arms
and their legs...

165
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,548
Even those who don't need it...

166
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,253
They say that I'm an
expert at it.

167
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,759
I've cut off hundred of limbs.

168
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,862
I've crippled hundreds of men.

169
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,765
God knows how many.

170
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:32,771
But you had to save
their lives.

171
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,875
You think they believe that?

172
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,281
They'd be better off dead.

173
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,285
What I'm doing is wicked.

174
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:52,391
I either let them die,
or I cripple them. That's all.

175
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,396
Am I a doctor?

176
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,699
It's a wonder I don't
go mad.

177
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:06,004
The war's to blame.
Not you.

178
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,208
The war, eh?

179
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:14,213
As we attack,
our lines get longer.

180
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,884
The enemy turns around
and attacks our rear,

181
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,920
where our defense are weak.

182
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,525
China's too big.

183
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,229
It's a stupid war.

184
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:36,535
But that's the Army's problem,
not mine.

185
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,073
Get undressed.

186
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,944
I can't get drunk
in front of a nurse.

187
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,149
That's an order!

188
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,652
Yes, sir.

189
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:01,393
There's no tomorrow
on the battlefield.

190
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,497
We live from day to day.

191
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:11,003
What happens today,
whatever we do, fades tomorrow.

192
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,406
You need not worry.

193
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,511
Now come here!

194
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,436
What's your first name, Nishi?

195
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,570
Sakura.

196
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,941
Sakura?
Cherry blossom?

197
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,148
Just think,
if you live long enough,

198
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:00,052
you will become a 60 or 70
year-old Sakura.

199
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,855
Cherry blossom only last
a few brief days.

200
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,791
I love my name.

201
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,594
I'd like to live up to
my name.

202
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,596
Who named you?

203
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:16,301
My father.
He died before I was born.

204
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,706
In photographs, he looks like you.

205
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,312
Enough wine.
I need a shot now.

206
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,816
It's all in that drawer.

207
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,318
What kind of injection?

208
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:38,023
Never mind.
Just do as I say.

209
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,725
Yes, sir.

210
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,482
It's morphine, sir.

211
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,986
Hurry up. It's almost dawn.
There's no time.

212
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,899
I just want to sleep,
to just forget everything.

213
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,409
Nishi, will you stay here until
I fall asleep?

214
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,015
Summer nights are cold here.

215
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,620
If you're cold,
you can share my blanket.

216
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,932
I was exhausted.

217
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,737
I only wanted to sleep.

218
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,976
Next!

219
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,206
Awake?

220
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,809
It's noon.

221
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,614
You've slept for ten hours straight.
Get some more.

222
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,417
I must go.

223
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,720
They'll manage without you.

224
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,024
I said you're exhausted.

225
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,973
Doctor!

226
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,275
What?

227
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,881
Did anything happen?

228
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:22,988
You think that I tok
advantage of you?

229
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,091
You undressed me.

230
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,495
I didn't touch you...
Not that it matters.

231
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,998
What does that mean?

232
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,501
You wouldn't understand.

233
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,606
I'll go back.

234
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:58,823
We nurses went back
to Tientsin

235
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,861
in a truck with the sick
and wounded.

236
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:12,971
By that time, I couldn't get
Dr. Okabe out of my mind.

237
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,576
Perhaps I had begun
to love him.

238
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,480
"TIENTSIN MILITARY HOSPITAL"

239
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,884
How was the front line?

240
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,789
Do I smell?

241
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,490
What of?

242
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:37,696
Blood and gore. I almost
scrubbed my skin off but...

243
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:43,602
Your imagination. That's how
you become a real nurse.

244
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,909
Matron, what is Dr. Okabe
really like?

245
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,213
he's a fine officer,
an excellent surgeon.

246
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,652
You're in charge of
surgery this time.

247
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,366
Nurse, can you help
me urinate?

248
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,167
In a moment.

249
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:32,784
Why were both of your
arms amputated?

250
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:38,390
The left one was blown off.

251
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:44,295
Gangrene set in on the right one,
so the doctor...

252
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,698
Thank you.

253
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,506
Which doctor?

254
00:27:54,572 --> 00:28:00,845
Dr. Okabe. He cought the tetanus
in time. I survived.

255
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,550
How long have you been here?

256
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:11,656
Six months. My wounds have
healed, but...

257
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:17,962
You can't return to fighting.
Going home? Have you a wife?

258
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,867
I shipped out two months
after we married.

259
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,671
You want to go home, then?

260
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,674
Yes.

261
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,479
But, for some reason, I can't.

262
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,983
I only bother the others here.

263
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,089
Home will be better.

264
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:50,995
Pvt. Orihara's almost
fully recovered.

265
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,299
He hardly feels any pain.

266
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,702
Why wasn't he sent home?

267
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:03,541
I wonder. But that is
not our problem.

268
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,346
We're short of beds
as it is.

269
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:14,452
It's best for him, and for us,
that he goes home.

270
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,855
Nishi, that's quite enough!

271
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:22,160
It's not your place to
make those kind of decisions.

272
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,562
Yes, ma'am.

273
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,967
I just feel sory for him.

274
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,070
Nurses do not have feelings.

275
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:37,175
It's your duty to keep
quiet and do your work.

276
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,481
I've given up.

277
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,787
I don't think I'll ever go home.

278
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,488
Never?

279
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,994
Thanks.

280
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:02,600
Not that I think that
the war will last forever.

281
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,104
Why can't you go home?

282
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:12,010
A soldier who'd lost both
legs was finally sent back.

283
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,214
They kept him hidden.

284
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,017
He can't even see his family.

285
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,923
They'll probably keep
him institutionalizd forever.

286
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,626
That's my fate, too.

287
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,929
But why?

288
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,635
If people saw me...

289
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:42,140
they'd know how terrible
war is, and hate it.

290
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:47,912
Some would think we're
losing the war.

291
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:52,250
The Army brass
wouldn't like that at all.

292
00:30:56,087 --> 00:31:01,693
From time to time,
I wish I was dead.

293
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,896
You poor man.

294
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,700
It must be agony.

295
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,403
But I'm used to it now.

296
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,307
The one unbearable thing...

297
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,009
What is it?

298
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,112
It's...

299
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,416
No, never mind.
It's nothing.

300
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,122
Let's wipe you down.

301
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:41,803
Nurse Nishi, would you mind
doing it at night?

302
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,571
Why? I can't show you
any special favors.

303
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:49,240
I don't want the others
to see me.

304
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:57,448
Tonight, after taps.
Please.

305
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,611
Let's do it now.

306
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,317
I'm sorry to bother you.

307
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,320
Nurse Nishi...

308
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:41,025
Can you come every night
from now on?

309
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,459
If you want me to.

310
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,331
Please. I'd like you to.

311
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,640
You nurses...

312
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:01,079
...take care of our meals
and everything.

313
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,581
With never a frown.

314
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,683
It's our duty.

315
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:13,091
But there's one thing
that no one does for me.

316
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,294
Do you follow me?

317
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:23,201
Nurse Nishi,
I'm a man too.

318
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,806
I'm crippled but
I'm still healthy.

319
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:35,713
The others all can
manage somehow...

320
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,417
but I have no hands.

321
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,321
I'm helpless.

322
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:49,627
It's starting to drive
me mad.

323
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,032
Do you understand?

324
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,272
Yes, I learned about that
at nursing school.

325
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,180
Nurse Nishi, please save me.

326
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,987
Touch my body.

327
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,090
I beg you.

328
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:25,797
Have you asked the other
nurse such a thing?

329
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:31,102
No, ma'am I've never asked
anyone before.

330
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,372
Only you.

331
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:46,217
Nurse Nishi, I'm just filth.

332
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,719
I'm a hateful man.

333
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:56,227
I'm going to die without
ever seeing my wife again.

334
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,466
Nurse Nishi, please help me!

335
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,180
Medicine, everything
was scarce.

336
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:21,486
Poor Dr. Okabe could only
amputate arms and legs.

337
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:27,992
However trivial, I decided I'd
try to ease his burden...

338
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,995
...in my own way.

339
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,869
Nurse Nishi, am I asking too much?

340
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,305
Not at all.

341
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,321
Thank you.

342
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:05,963
You're the only one who
cared to save me.

343
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,269
You poor, unfortunate man.

344
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,478
Nurse Nishi, please
let me kiss you.

345
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,282
Just once is enough.

346
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,695
Sakura

347
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:44,802
I want to touch your body.

348
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,807
I don't mind, but...

349
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,111
Since I lost my hands...

350
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,115
...my toes have become
very sensitive.

351
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:04,956
I can feel with them
just like my hands.

352
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,657
So...

353
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,360
So?

354
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,365
Please.

355
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:20,171
Let me put my fot
between your legs.

356
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,874
Please!

357
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,980
Alright.

358
00:37:54,472 --> 00:38:00,244
I'm glad.
I'm very hapy.

359
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,856
Go out for a walk?

360
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,091
Yes, he can manage.

361
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,163
I think it
will be good for him.

362
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,868
But all alone?

363
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:28,973
I'll escort him.
I'm off today.

364
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,576
I see.
All right, then.

365
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,579
We can't do much
else for him.

366
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,381
Have him wear a coat...

367
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,585
...so his arms won't be
too obvious.

368
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,889
Treat him to something nive.

369
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,539
What is it?

370
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,825
Where are we going?

371
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,845
Let's find a hotel.

372
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,649
Just leave everything
to me.

373
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,887
Let's take a bath together.

374
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,091
Together?

375
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,917
I'll wash you.

376
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:18,416
You can look at me all
you want to.

377
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,419
Do anything you like.

378
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:26,023
tell me anything yo want
me to do for you.

379
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:31,228
Why are you doing
this for me?

380
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,533
No particular reason.

381
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,221
I have no arms...

382
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,124
...but I can do things
to make up for it.

383
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,629
But this won't happen again.

384
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,332
It's the last time.

385
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,933
Yes.

386
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,037
Probably.

387
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,741
Remember it.

388
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:55,946
I'll never forget
what happened today.

389
00:41:56,413 --> 00:42:00,384
I'm truly very happy.

390
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:22,206
Nishi, Private Orihara
commited suicide.

391
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,678
How?
He has no arms!

392
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:31,115
He jumped from the roof.

393
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:35,719
Fractured skull.
He died instantly.

394
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,323
I can't believe it.

395
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,426
This was found
under his pillow.

396
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,730
Used his mouth to
write it, I guess.

397
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,434
It's to you.

398
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,637
I haven't told anyone else.

399
00:42:54,772 --> 00:43:01,211
Sakura, I'll never meet anyone
like you again.

400
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,381
So, there's no point in living.

401
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:10,988
Thank you and
good-bye, Orihara.

402
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,695
Will you inform his family?

403
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:22,099
He'll be listed as
killed in action.

404
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,603
And receive a promotion to
Private First Class.

405
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,506
I believe I killed him.

406
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:36,113
I tried to help him,
but I tortured him instead.

407
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,716
It does not concern you!

408
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:43,621
in war it's each for himself
or there's no surviving it!

409
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:49,026
Forget him as soon as you can.

410
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,530
There's too much to forget.

411
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,433
I can never forget.

412
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:06,377
Pvt. Sakamoto and
then Pvt. Orihara.

413
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,382
I killed them both.

414
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,487
A month later...

415
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:23,494
...we five nurses were transfered
back to the front lines.

416
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:01,065
I'm back again.
Been keeping well, sir?

417
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:06,970
Again?
It seems you and I are fated.

418
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:13,077
You've been promoted.
Congratulations.

419
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,878
The more people we kill...

420
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,183
...the more stars they give us.

421
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,586
It's a strange life.

422
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,991
Is there a major battle.

423
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,698
Yes, Chang Kai-shek and his
allies made an attack.

424
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,402
Our army is stretched
very thin.

425
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,505
They were cut to pieces.

426
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,608
The wounded are arriving in droves.

427
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,412
You have experience.

428
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,515
I'll have you removing bullets.

429
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,519
Can we manage?

430
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,922
We have to!

431
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:05,863
A handful of Japanese soldiers
are pitted against all of China.

432
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,066
It's no easy war.

433
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,670
The wounded will increase...

434
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,074
...we're badly undermanned here.

435
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:21,779
You'll have to work
twice as hard.

436
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,484
If not, good men will die.

437
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,312
Yes, sir! We will, sir!

438
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,891
The wounded are arriving, sir!

439
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,793
Be right there.

440
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,266
Water!
Give me water!

441
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,875
Be careful!
No dead in here!

442
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,897
The bullet is still in there.
Remove it.

443
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,447
We began operating...

444
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,217
...and did so for two days
and two nights.

445
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:12,456
I, alone, removed 160 bullets.

446
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,974
Can't save him.
He's cut to pieces.

447
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,677
He's lost too much blood.

448
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:39,283
Do you know why
the enemy did this?

449
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,385
No, sir.

450
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:46,990
He swallowed this.
It's a secret code.

451
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,994
A communications man.

452
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,898
No time to burn it,
so he swallowed it.

453
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:01,338
They cut him open
to get it.

454
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,943
While he was still alive?

455
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,945
Yes.

456
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,458
A fine soldier.
You did your duty well.

457
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,162
A hero's death.

458
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:29,266
He's dead. sew him up
and ship him out.

459
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,046
Shrapnel in the lower back.

460
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:45,082
I'll have to operate.

461
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,084
Anesthetic.

462
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:22,019
I've changed my mind.
Close him up.

463
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,021
Next patient.

464
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:32,929
Why did he stop?
A waste of anesthetic.

465
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,633
Something different
about him today.

466
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:44,541
The third night, after all of
the soldiers had been treated.

467
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,678
Nishi?

468
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,047
Yes, sir.

469
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,549
Come in.

470
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,354
Sit and have a drink.

471
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:06,296
May I ask a question, sir?

472
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,099
What is it?

473
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:14,704
Why didn't you operate
after the anesthetic?

474
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:20,210
Officers need not explain
to lower ranks.

475
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:27,317
I'll explain, though you probably
won't understand.

476
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,920
Why's that, sir?

477
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,424
You're a woman, but you have
no marital experience, right?

478
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,928
What's marriage got
to do with it?

479
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:43,633
He was wounded in the sacrum.

480
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,136
Here.

481
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,341
All the sensitive nerves...

482
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,246
...that govern sex are
located there.

483
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,184
If I operated on those
damaged nerves...

484
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,387
...what would be the result?

485
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:10,193
He'd lose his masculinity.
Forever!

486
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,297
It made me think.

487
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:19,603
If it doesn't fester,
he has a chance to live.

488
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,908
If a good doctor operates
back home...

489
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,012
...he may leave the nerves intact.

490
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,918
So, I changed my mind.

491
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,821
I see.

492
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:43,627
I have no confidence
in the work I'm doing here.

493
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,129
It's all wrong.

494
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:52,736
I kill those who'd recover,
men better off dead, live as cripples.

495
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,738
But...

496
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:03,096
to men, becoming impotent...

497
00:53:03,131 --> 00:53:07,284
...is worse the being crippled.

498
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:14,191
I'm tired. Give me
a morphine shot.

499
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,493
I want some sleep.

500
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:38,515
Stay until I fall asleep...

501
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,418
...like you did last time.

502
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,222
Hold me, if you want to.

503
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,525
Yes, if I'll do, sir.

504
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,728
I wouldn't ask anyone else.

505
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,130
Will you stay 'till morning?

506
00:53:55,498 --> 00:54:00,136
Don't worry.
You'll be safe with me.

507
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,272
I won't even touch you.

508
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,374
Why not?

509
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:10,280
These days, I have no interest
in woman at all.

510
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,883
We're in different worlds.

511
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,886
I only want to sleep.

512
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,089
But why, sir ?

513
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,458
You really want to know?

514
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:23,193
Yes, I do.

515
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,098
Alright, then.
I'll tell tou.

516
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:34,004
Since I started using morphine...

517
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,806
...I'm not a man any more.

518
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,409
I haven't been for a long time.

519
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,317
You have a wife, don't you?

520
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:51,621
She died three years ago,
so it doesn't matter.

521
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:56,526
Please stop using morphine.

522
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,728
Why?

523
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:03,667
I want to be in your arms.

524
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,469
What?

525
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,774
I think I love you.

526
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,678
I want you to touch me.

527
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:19,482
You love me?
What a strange girl.

528
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,985
You ressemble my father.

529
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,122
A substitute, am I?

530
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,792
No! I really love you.

531
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,696
Sorry, I can't give up
the morphine.

532
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,999
Why not?

533
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:44,607
I'm a doctor.
But I can't do anything here.

534
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:49,312
Without the drugs,
I can't go on living.

535
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:55,118
It's the same for soldiers.

536
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:01,224
They kill and pass it off
as patriotism. That helps...

537
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:06,363
There are so many things
that I'd like to forget.

538
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:14,471
Nishi, it's no use talking.
Just give me the shot.

539
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,577
Then get into bed.

540
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,583
Yes, sir.

541
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:57,213
I missed you.
I really did.

542
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:03,953
Good night.
Good night, sir.

543
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,864
You swine!
Letting maggots hatch!

544
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,870
What's the matter?

545
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:25,975
He removed a bandage
and let flies settle on it.

546
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,977
Now it's festered!

547
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,311
Why did you do that?

548
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:34,984
He was afraid of being
sent back.

549
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:38,588
He wants to be sent home!

550
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:42,892
What if you lose your leg?

551
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,795
It's better than dying!

552
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:50,900
My wife gave birth
after I shipped out.

553
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,904
I've never seen my son!

554
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,344
Dr. Okabe wants to see you immediately.

555
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:10,253
I'm off to the front lines.

556
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,188
One doctor, two nurses...

557
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:18,962
...and three medics.
We leave tomorrow morning.

558
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,531
Were you ordered to?

559
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:22,966
Yes.

560
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,269
It's a tough battle.

561
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,571
Only one doctor there...

562
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,977
He can't cope alone.

563
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:34,634
It's an emergency.

564
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:39,082
So, it's goodbye for a while.

565
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,886
Please take me with you.

566
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:47,090
It's too dangerous.
You could be killed.

567
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,994
No! I don't want
to leave you!

568
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,695
Why not?

569
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,098
I love you!

570
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,601
Love?

571
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,240
Do as you like.

572
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,745
But don't expect a life together.

573
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,749
This is war.
We could die any day.

574
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,251
I wonder.

575
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:21,257
The only way is to regard
everyone as strangers.

576
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,091
So stay.

577
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,762
Matron said that too.

578
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,065
But I refuse.

579
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,434
It's an order!

580
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:32,669
I refuse!

581
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,938
You disobey orders?

582
00:59:34,973 --> 00:59:36,773
I do.

583
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,476
A traitor to Japan.

584
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:45,381
I'm afraid of one thing
more than anything.

585
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:51,988
That is working and dying
apart from you.

586
00:59:55,158 --> 01:00:00,797
Don't worry. I'll be back.
Wait for me.

587
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:05,001
No, please take me with you.

588
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,104
You're stubborn.

589
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,007
Who else, then?

590
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,509
Nurse Tsuruzaki.

591
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:19,716
Sh's new and inexperienced.
I'll take care of her.

592
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,132
Even further from Japan.

593
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,534
It doesn't bother me.

594
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,137
Ever nearer to death.

595
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,140
I don't care.

596
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,144
Are you ready to die?

597
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:52,148
The cherry blossom
has such a short life.

598
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,051
The sooner the better.

599
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,094
Halt!

600
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,273
Is Dr. Okabe here?

601
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:19,140
Yes. What is it?

602
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,511
Your new orders, sir.

603
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,312
Go ahead.

604
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:28,418
You're to stay with us
until further orders.

605
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,319
We're in your hands.

606
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:33,623
We'll escort you there, sir.

607
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,324
Good man.

608
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,511
We're here, sir.

609
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,118
Excuse the men, ma'am.

610
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,021
It's their first sight of
Japanese nurses.

611
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,224
They're ecstatic.

612
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,629
Time to head back.

613
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:58,040
I'm Lt. Ishida, in command
of this outpost.

614
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,942
Please be seated.

615
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:07,383
Our headquarters are
fifty kilometers from here.

616
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,487
The enemy has begun
a massive attack.

617
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,490
They broke through our lines.

618
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,393
We've been cut off.

619
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:22,298
I see. So that's why our
journey was cut short.

620
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,100
Yes, sir.

621
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:28,671
The enemy are better
equipped and outnumber us.

622
01:03:28,706 --> 01:03:31,307
We're unable to break through.

623
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,110
We're surrounded?

624
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:37,413
Yes, they're attacked twice.

625
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,819
A mobile squad helped
fight them off.

626
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,822
Just one platoon here?

627
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,591
Yes, equipped with four
light machine guns.

628
01:03:48,626 --> 01:03:50,927
That's all we have.

629
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,930
Any civilian Chinese?

630
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,934
A handful of children
and the elderly.

631
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:01,370
Doctor!

632
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,974
A 'comfort woman'
has diarrhea.

633
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:09,178
I suspect cholera.
Please examine her.

634
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,982
Attention!

635
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:35,204
It's cholera all right.

636
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,907
She's badly dehydrated.

637
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:43,913
Quarantine her and give warm
water for 48 hours.

638
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,015
She may pull through.

639
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,218
How many comfort women here?

640
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,252
Two more, sir.

641
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:54,824
They may have it, too.
Isolate them.

642
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,628
Disinfect this hut thoroughly.

643
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,264
It's off limits to the men!

644
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:09,672
Cholera?
That's one more enemy.

645
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,777
Is there nothing we can do?

646
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,181
No drug beats cholera.

647
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,084
Just isolation and disinfection.

648
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,490
Idealy, raze the vilage
and withdraw.

649
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,092
That's impossible.

650
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:35,898
This is a strategic point.
We're ordered to...

651
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,501
...hold it at any cost.

652
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:42,805
In any case, the cholera
must be contained.

653
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:46,309
Otherwise we all die.

654
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:52,815
Issue the men an
acid gargle before meals.

655
01:05:54,383 --> 01:06:00,256
The soldiers want the women
who aren't sick.

656
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,475
Here they are.

657
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,978
Back to your cribs.

658
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,584
No! They're in quarantine.

659
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:38,794
How about you, then?
Much more fun!

660
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:58,514
Stop it! Nurses aren't
comfort women!

661
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:04,253
You're hungry, aren't you?
Hungry for a man!

662
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,123
I'll pleasure you.

663
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:09,358
You animal.

664
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:15,664
This is the front. We either
kill men, screw women...

665
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,968
...or eat rations. That's all!

666
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:23,873
We get what we can
while we're still alive.

667
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,179
You idiots!

668
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:35,184
You want to die of cholera?
Get out!

669
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:42,892
You doctors get your pick
of nurses. We don't!

670
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:06,248
Twelve men and two
comfort women are infected now.

671
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,452
That's seven dead.

672
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,854
How does it look?

673
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:15,157
There will be more.

674
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:21,430
The problem is that we lost
half of our fighting strength.

675
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:24,967
If they attack,
we'll be wiped out.

676
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:31,240
Sir, all of the remaining
Chinese civilians

677
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:34,276
have slipped away.

678
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,179
Afraid of the cholera?

679
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,282
No doubt some spies too.

680
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,116
Spies?

681
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:46,489
They musthave introduced
the cholera virus.

682
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:50,059
They fed something to her.

683
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:55,498
So the enemy knows
out exact disposition?

684
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:59,902
Yes. Expect an attack any time.

685
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,439
Contact HQ.
Ask for reinforcements.

686
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:08,277
We can't, sir.
Our radio gear is down.

687
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,646
Send a courier.

688
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:14,150
To certain death?

689
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:20,856
We're surrounded.
No one could through alive.

690
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:26,962
We're expecting a truck
tomorrow morning.

691
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,765
We'll just have to wait.

692
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:36,972
What's the matter, sir?

693
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,875
I've caught it.

694
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,691
Sergeant, a signal!

695
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:06,402
That's bad.
They'll attack tonight.

696
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:38,033
The doctor's asking for you.
Go at once.

697
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:46,273
Take a break, nurse.

698
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:49,745
You're worked all night.
We'll take over.

699
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:52,248
Nurse Tsuruzaki.

700
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,184
Nishi?

701
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,020
Yes, sir.

702
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,526
Nurse Nishi reporting for duty, sir.

703
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,531
What's the latest count?

704
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,434
Four new cases, sir.

705
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:52,441
If I catch it,
I'll give it to you.

706
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,112
Same thing if you get it.

707
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:00,015
Why did you summon me, sir?

708
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,888
It's time for my shot.

709
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,991
I refuse.

710
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:10,893
But I need it.

711
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:15,229
Nishi, that's an order!

712
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:20,803
Morphine is only for the most
critical of patients.

713
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:26,375
I'm starting to suffer from
withdrawal symptoms.

714
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,011
Soon the fits will come.

715
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:34,316
I don't want the others
to see me half-crazed.

716
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,321
Please.
Go get the morphine!

717
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:45,527
If you don't quit now,
it will effect your brain.

718
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:49,331
Your heart will weaken,
and you'll die.

719
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,935
I'm better off dead.

720
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:59,341
It's also the drugs
that are keeping us apart.

721
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:02,277
Please give it up.

722
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,981
What would I gain?

723
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,985
You'd gain me.

724
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:15,391
You're a woman.

725
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:20,896
Yes, the woman who loves you.

726
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,999
How do I quit?

727
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,502
Please do as I say...

728
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,672
...as if I were a superior officer.

729
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:35,411
You're ordering me to quit?

730
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:41,016
I'll tie you up and
do what I have to do.

731
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,519
Tie me up?

732
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,220
Yes.

733
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:52,127
We're caught between cholera
and the enemy.

734
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,633
This could be our last night.

735
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,670
Be my superior officer tonight.

736
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:06,375
Do what you must.
But don't let anyone in.

737
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:20,289
The Captain is down
with cholera.

738
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,592
I'll take over the command.

739
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,396
I expect an attack tonight.

740
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,999
Man your positions!

741
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,823
Just tonight...

742
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:12,074
They'll attack tonight.
The truck comes tomorrow.

743
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,677
We must not surrender
the village!

744
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,292
Nurse Nishi...

745
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,795
Nishi.

746
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,708
You had it though...

747
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,812
I'm over it now.

748
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:55,717
Untie me.

749
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,857
How long was I thrashing?

750
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,859
Five hours.

751
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,268
Two more have got it!

752
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:27,084
Please love me as a woman.

753
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,184
Please love me.

754
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,787
I can't.

755
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:37,492
I want to be a real woman.
Not just a doll.

756
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,995
Make love to me.

757
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:44,800
I can't.
I'm not a man any more.

758
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:48,704
No! That's all in your mind.

759
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:53,208
Without the morphine,
you can.

760
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:59,314
Nishi, touch me.

761
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,763
That's what I am.
Do you understand now?

762
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:19,401
I can't love you.

763
01:17:19,436 --> 01:17:21,870
No, you're all right.

764
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:29,878
Hold me close,
as tight as you can.

765
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,882
It's no use.

766
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:38,387
Don't give up.
You can do it.

767
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:42,891
No. I'll never return
to my old self.

768
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:47,696
You can.
I know you can.

769
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,003
It's Oh-One Hundred Hours.

770
01:17:55,771 --> 01:18:00,108
Not long ntil dawn.
Hold out till then!

771
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:07,549
Their small arms
don't frighten me.

772
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:13,255
But, if they bring in mortars,
were all dead.

773
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:38,180
I can't hardly believe it,
Nishi.

774
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,184
Nurse Nishi has won.

775
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:45,087
I'm myself again.

776
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,291
It's like a miracle.

777
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:55,197
Please say that you love your
Sakura cherry blossom.

778
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:03,138
You want me to say
that I love you?

779
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,842
I want you all to myself.

780
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:09,845
You already have.

781
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:11,847
Your heart, too.

782
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:19,254
Not in wartime, no.
There's only fleeting pleasure.

783
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:21,356
Not for me.

784
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:27,062
I don't want to be
a passing fancy.

785
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,867
I want to be your trus lover.

786
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:41,676
I want no heart
to offer you now.

787
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:47,983
Then I'll look for it.

788
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,891
It's Oh-Two Hundred Hours, already.

789
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,796
Another three hours
and we'll be safe.

790
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:06,301
They like to attack at dawn!
Be alert!

791
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,623
Sakura.

792
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:35,831
I love you. Now I can say
it truthfully.

793
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:41,136
I'll never let you go.

794
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,541
Tonight we reached
our greatest ecstasy.

795
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:51,746
Though by tomorrow,
we may be dead.

796
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:54,950
You don't mind that?

797
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:58,854
This is all that's important
to me now.

798
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:06,194
Get me the wine.
It's my last bottle.

799
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:10,899
Let's drink a toast.

800
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:27,415
I didn't know that military
women were so sweet.

801
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,417
Military women?

802
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:34,522
I mean you nurses.
Put on my uniform.

803
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:48,937
Becoming?

804
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,941
Yes, wonderful.
a fine officer!

805
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:00,482
The boots.

806
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:23,774
Would they salute me
if I went out?

807
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,694
First, they'd laugh.

808
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:28,009
The sword and gun.

809
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,712
I'm afraid not.

810
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:39,421
Dr. Okabe,
pour wine for your superior.

811
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:44,225
Here, Major.

812
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:49,931
Sergeant!

813
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:51,993
-What is it?
-The enemy!

814
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:04,379
I prefer being a woman.

815
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:09,985
Then let me give you
some pleasure.

816
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:15,290
I can hear your heart thumping.

817
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,392
It's the wine.

818
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:21,496
Nishi.

819
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:28,503
I wish we'd met in
Japan in peacetime.

820
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,327
They're attacking.

821
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,370
The enemy.
There's no escape.

822
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:05,106
Will you die with me?

823
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,275
Yes!
By your side.

824
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,878
I'm 40 years old.

825
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,281
A long life,
yet short too.

826
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,684
I guess this is the end.

827
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:22,891
I can die happy.
Because I love you.

828
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,006
Your mark, Sakura?

829
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,408
I'll give you one.

830
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:42,610
Where?

831
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,915
The same place as yours.

832
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:55,123
Thanks to you,
I can die like a soldier.

833
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,727
Don't cry for me.

834
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:17,178
Enemy attack, sir!

835
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,582
Follow me!

836
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,695
Stay here!

837
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:36,598
Head down!

838
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:41,703
Hold your fire!
It's still too dark.

839
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:46,407
Don't waste ammo!
Wait 'till they're close.

840
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:49,813
What's the situation?

841
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:51,796
We're surrounded, sir.

842
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:57,619
They're using mortars
to soften us up.

843
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:00,121
Before they attack.

844
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:02,857
It doesn't look good.

845
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:07,362
But it's an hour 'till dawn.
There's a slim chance!

846
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:08,963
Good!

847
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,376
We're soldiers, too!

848
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,978
Orderlies and nurses will fight!

849
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:38,293
Fire!
Give 'em all you've got!

850
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:05,253
Pull yourself together, nurse!

851
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,356
Protect your patients!

852
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:16,965
Here they come!
Dig in!

853
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,799
Sergeant's dead, sir!

854
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:55,303
I'll take command.

855
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:06,114
Fight! fire at least
one shot before you die!

856
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:07,749
I'm scared!

857
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,551
You'll fight!

858
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,754
I'm too scared!

859
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,257
Come back!

860
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:20,962
Go get her!
She's gone crazy!

861
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:23,464
No, that'd be suicide.

862
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:49,891
I've killed yet again.
She's my third victim.

863
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:49,584
Nogami!

864
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:30,324
Somehow, I survived.

865
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,128
Not even a scratch.

866
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:02,590
Anybody still alive?

867
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:11,499
Halt!
Who goes there?

868
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:14,902
Army nurse!

869
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:22,310
We're reinforcements.
We routed them. You're safe now.

870
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:27,081
Stay back!
We have a cholera epidemic.

871
01:31:27,116 --> 01:31:28,816
Cholera!

872
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,086
Send medical personnel
immediately.

873
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:33,921
Any other survivors?

874
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,723
I don't know.

875
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,827
The cholera and the fighting
took most of them.

876
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:45,533
I understand.
Wait here.

877
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:08,789
Nurse Tsuruzaki!
Forgive me.

878
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:14,896
This is how I will
end up, too.

879
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:52,133
The bodies were stripped
of their clothing.

880
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:58,239
Weapons, clothing, boots...

881
01:32:59,106 --> 01:33:04,178
They took everything that
they could possibly use.

882
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:09,283
Doctor!

883
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:13,087
Doctor!

884
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:16,591
Dr. Okabe!

885
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:41,509
The End.
