1
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:19,822
The relatives...

2
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,771
Those interested in
the ones that disappeared...

3
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:27,972
in the 42 to 44 Russian front...

4
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:36,625
go to the right
in group 14.

5
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,375
To the right.

6
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:43,568
Again, in group 14.

7
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,729
Madam, if no communication
has come from the army...

8
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,730
or the Ministry, means that your
husband dead hasn't been accepted.

9
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,231
So, he's alive

10
00:02:58,724 --> 00:02:59,724
Alive?

11
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:03,525
Indeed he could be alive.
We believe he's missing.

12
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:06,526
But, what does missing means?

13
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,327
Can you explain it to me?

14
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:11,528
I've already told you, he could
be alive, but we don't know it.

15
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,329
Neither do I or his mother!

16
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,630
Not her and not me,
how is this possible?

17
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,631
Madam, officially he's not dead
I already told you.

18
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Then he's alive and I want
to know it and you have to tell me!

19
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,900
You have to tell me, is he alive
or not?  Is he alive?

20
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,401
Sure, you have to tell me.
Is he alive?

21
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:55,896
I'll bring him to you madam. I don't
want to see you in that black dress.

22
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,700
I'll bring your son, bring him home,
I'm sure.

23
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:02,701
Even if I have to travel
allover Russia.

24
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:16,969
Anto...

25
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:21,507
Anto, are you all right?

26
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:24,004
The rings!

27
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,760
Have you swallowed a ring?

28
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,661
Now what can I do?
They're made out of gold.

29
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,662
What can I do to swallow it.

30
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Drink!

31
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:41,052
Where can I find water?
-There, come with me.

32
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,451
It's salty.

33
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,052
The sea is salty.

34
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:17,553
Well, feel better hope
I digest it... after...

35
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,143
How sweet!

36
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,567
What are talking, I don't
understand you.  Translate.

37
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,768
Where are you from?

38
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:46,552
From northern Italy,
600 km from here.

39
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:49,128
But where precisely?

40
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,329
From Losguardo a small village
in the country.

41
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,130
Ah! Then you have a country house,
you're a farmer.

42
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:55,731
Tell me the truth are you a farmer?

43
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,732
Not a farmer, I'm an electrician.

44
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,733
If it wasn't for the war
I would have my electrician degree.

45
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,734
Come on, does my hands look as farmer
hands?  See how soft they are.

46
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,735
Then, there is nothing wrong
with being a farmer.

47
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:06,736
Was your father a farmer?

48
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:08,937
No, he was a barber,
quite different!

49
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,154
Just imagine!

50
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,080
While my father was alive,
it wasn't bad...

51
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:15,381
I had a good life.

52
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,682
Then I went to live with
my sister...

53
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:19,183
she was married to a good person

54
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:20,684
I don't complain about work...

55
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,185
I'm good at the kitchen.

56
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:23,186
Very well!

57
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,379
The sand burns...

58
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,880
How much will burn in Africa?

59
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,854
When does your regiment leaves?

60
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:38,238
The day after tomorrow, but
don't make me think as...

61
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,320
And you're going to Africa
just because?

62
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,921
Aren't you going to do something
to stay?

63
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:05,922
What can I do?

64
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:08,257
There must be a way.

65
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,367
Me, I been thinking all day...

66
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,268
Yes?  So what can we do?

67
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,080
Don't laugh if I tell you.

68
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:24,081
Won't laugh, tell me.

69
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,370
Let's get married.

70
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:32,314
Well, with me or any other.
Whoever pleases you.

71
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:35,831
You'll get 12 days wedding license.

72
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:38,432
Twelve days will go by and perhaps
then the war is over, who knows?

73
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:41,133
Or perhaps you won't be sent elsewhere
and you'll be able to remain in Italy.

74
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,134
Summarizing, I'm telling you
for your own good.

75
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:45,135
Here in Naples everyone
are doing it.

76
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,478
Listen, we're already married.

77
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,479
When

78
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,280
Eh... half an hour ago, here.

79
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,281
Don't joke with this.

80
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:00,442
See, I'm 32-years-old and
unmarried, I will never marry.

81
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,443
I can see that you haven't found
someone that you like.

82
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:05,928
Have found more than twenty.

83
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,510
Mean, ugly, blond, redhead...

84
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:09,511
rich, poor...

85
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:12,568
but when I smell church, I run.

86
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:15,069
Just imagine! Me marrying
a Neapolitan!

87
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,570
Then go to Africa, to war, to heat
and to scorpions...

88
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,571
tell the angels to care for you
and goodbye.

89
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,462
You know what?  Better scorpions
than marriage!

90
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:26,723
And who's getting married?

91
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,330
What a head!  I forgot to give you
the present!

92
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,253
-They are for me?
-Yes.

93
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,860
Madonna, they're beautiful!

94
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,409
Do you like them?
I love them!

95
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:06,934
Thanks.

96
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:13,383
But your mother should have come to
the wedding.  No one does that.

97
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,546
It hurts me more for you
than for me.

98
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:19,547
Don't worry.  My mother is old, stubborn.

99
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:24,200
Imagine that she thinks that
I'll marry for money.

100
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:28,201
Money?  What money?  I have nothing,
but you went crazy for me.

101
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,000
Be patient.  When we have a child
she'll love the kid and you.

102
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:38,179
I don't want only one child,
I want a large family.

103
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,029
And this?  Too much water, Holy Mother!

104
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:49,477
Don't be mean!

105
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:51,522
What are you doing?

106
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:17,227
Anto!

107
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,349
What are those bells?

108
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,690
Anto!

109
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,070
Anto!

110
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:32,084
What are those bells?

111
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,583
What time it is?

112
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:35,951
Seven.

113
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,652
Seven in the morning or afternoon?

114
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:39,853
Who knows...

115
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:50,398
It's "rinning"...

116
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:51,578
Translate!

117
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,096
It's raining

118
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:56,822
Can't deduce if its morning
or afternoon.

119
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,926
There are people going to Church.
What? Is Sunday?

120
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,927
Surely.

121
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,928
But, what do we care?

122
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:06,429
How come we don't care?
We arrived on Thursday.

123
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,390
Let me see... Sunday was yesterday!
Then today must be Monday.

124
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,701
Monday... then we have only 8 days!

125
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:30,593
It's a wedding, the husband is a soldier.

126
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,009
Holy Mother, I forgot
is Alfredo that works with me.

127
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:39,431
He invited me to the wedding.
Where is my head!

128
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,916
But this Alfredo also married for a license?

129
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,983
I don't know.  Could be.
Tell me the truth!

130
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,500
Isn't because you married me
only for the license?

131
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,357
Don't be stupid, I married you
because I love you.

132
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,958
But you were not sure,
you were afraid.

133
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:57,167
You said that marriage
gave you chills. -Yes.

134
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,068
And now, are you scare?

135
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,330
Giovanna, we need to cover the
windows, otherwise we'll get a fine.

136
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:14,331
They say that the alarm has been given.

137
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:23,284
Still 6? Ah! it stopped.
It's night must be one o'clock.

138
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:26,112
I don't want anything illegal!

139
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:31,935
Are you hungry?
I'll prepare some pasta.

140
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:34,436
No, you don't move from here.
Today I'm cooking.

141
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,437
What? You know how to cook?
What, haven't told you?

142
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:38,938
I'm a magician in the kitchen.
Come on.

143
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
What are you doing?

144
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:17,801
A Frittata.

145
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:20,413
How many eggs?
24.

146
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,661
And who eats 24 eggs?
My grandmother, my grandmother...

147
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:29,462
I've eaten with my grandmother
the morning after the milling.

148
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:30,963
Understood?
Lard.

149
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:35,414
Lard? In these times,
where do you find lard?

150
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:39,015
Besides Frittata is done with oil.
My mother does it with lard.

151
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,116
Your mother is wrong
as is done with oil.

152
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:43,917
By the way, she's sick
with bronchitis

153
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,676
The bronchitis she catch it on purpose
to not meet us.

154
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:48,877
Don't say that.
Salt.

155
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:52,707
This is an ugly salt.

156
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,964
Pepper.

157
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:03,783
Scientific.

158
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:06,024
Tools.

159
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:22,107
The military service has spoiled me.
Lost my practice.

160
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,388
Looks like gold,
pure gold!

161
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:32,098
My father soul was what
took care of us all.

162
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:34,226
He was a champ!

163
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,905
A true deli that you have to taste.

164
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,125
It's ready.
Me too.

165
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:09,677
The glasses.

166
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,742
Do you like it?
Yes.

167
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,287
Has good aroma.

168
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,391
To us!

169
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:47,327
Then dessert.

170
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,510
What?

171
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,209
No "mo", no "mo".

172
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,177
Translate!

173
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:58,178
Can't talk!
It's okay...

174
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,063
because I love you much.

175
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:14,644
What a heat! It's suffocating.

176
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,098
I can't breath.

177
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,099
You're revolting... eh!

178
00:17:27,843 --> 00:17:29,843
But, how my grandfather
did it?

179
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:31,644
I don't want to see an egg for a month.

180
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:33,525
Me for a year.

181
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,187
Luckily, I did add onion.

182
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,557
I'll throw this away.
Yes, take it out of my sight.

183
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:52,055
And this, where it came from?
Perhaps my mother sent it.

184
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:54,056
She knocked the door
and we didn't notice.

185
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:55,057
What are you doing?

186
00:17:56,566 --> 00:18:00,066
You're not leaving them outside,
they're my mother's eggs.

187
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:12,374
I don't want to look at them,
at least for 10 years.

188
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,219
And now? Shall we go out?

189
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:23,034
And were to?
Let's go to take some fresh air.

190
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,959
Oh! Sunrise.
At this hour my father was on the fields.

191
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:39,574
You have no strength in your legs.
What are you saying! I'm stronger than you.

192
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:55,027
I never thought you were that strong.

193
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,487
What are you laughing for?
The eggs.

194
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,488
No, I beg you, my stomach
is about to explode.

195
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:12,489
I close the eyes and see so many eggs.
Don't close them then.

196
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:14,773
But even if I open my eyes
I see them

197
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:21,429
Flares!
Be careful!

198
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,005
Stay calm. It's over.

199
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,050
I wasn't afraid.
You made me understand...

200
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:15,342
so many things, Anto.

201
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,190
I want to be with you forever.

202
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:21,191
Even if it was in the mountains.

203
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,192
How many days have gone by, Anto?

204
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,313
Eight.

205
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,700
No, ten.

206
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,790
Two days!
Only two days.

207
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Help me!

208
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:40,501
I'll kill you.

209
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,409
Help me!
Stay still, stay still.

210
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Poor woman.

211
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,115
I'll kill everyone!

212
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:07,185
Anto! What are you doing?

213
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:27,972
What happened?

214
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,573
Nothing, nothing.
How come nothing?

215
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:34,061
Nothing... nothing.
Don't know what overcome him.

216
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,238
He was calm and then...

217
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:40,689
he gets white,
the eyes full of fury...

218
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,499
then comes and puts both hands
in the neck, like this...

219
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,855
Had a really bad time!
When coming, he fell to the floor...

220
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:50,868
as people says,
I pour him cold water.

221
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:55,989
He locked himself in the kitchen
and didn't want to come out.

222
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:59,087
He was yelling,
Dammed the day I married.

223
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:04,066
What a misfortune. Maybe is over.

224
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,860
Sergeant, here he is!

225
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:36,702
Antonio

226
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:41,483
Wait!

227
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:46,273
Wait a moment!

228
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,484
I'll make him to come out.
Wait a moment!

229
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,119
No, no I'll make him to come out,
they won't do any to you I swear...

230
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,142
Don't harm him!

231
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:13,392
Antonio, come out,
they won't harm you I swear...

232
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:21,429
Do you her me, Antonio...

233
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,398
Anto.

234
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:36,355
Release me!

235
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,711
Don't harm him!

236
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:03,027
I want the Director.
I want to know why I'm inside here.

237
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:09,421
I'm Saint Joseph.
Yes, he's Saint Joseph, I guarantee it!

238
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:07,326
Come, madam.

239
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:32,402
You, you're as crazy as me.
Doctor!

240
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:37,403
You're lucid and can chose between
a process or voluntary leave to Russia.

241
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:22,363
Stop!  The first squad
gets into the train to the right...

242
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:25,364
The second squad into the
train to the left...

243
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,958
You have 15 minutes.
Dismiss!

244
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:35,723
Giovanna we have 15 mins.
Come, come.

245
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:40,432
Giovanna!
Yes.

246
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,001
I'll come back from Russia soon, you'll see.
Yes.

247
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:02,002
I'll bring you a fur.
Yes.

248
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:29,329
The war is over!

249
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:39,826
Hey! come here. What are you saying?
What is over?  -The war.

250
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,558
Do you know him?
Do you know him?

251
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,488
Maria!  Maria!

252
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,640
Do you know him?

253
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,340
But this is Antonio.
Is he alive?

254
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,279
We were together. Is he alive?
Possibly, I don't know

255
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,801
How do you know?

256
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,312
Stop!

257
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:47,174
Can't walk, I've been waiting
for this moment many years...

258
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:50,501
Have to find someone
that tells me about him...

259
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:52,502
that has seen him,
that met him

260
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:56,503
Listen, can't be standing up,
come here.

261
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:57,618
Is he alive?

262
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,430
Tell me, where have you seen him?
Where did you left him the last time?

263
00:32:04,014 --> 00:32:05,814
Where is he?

264
00:32:06,513 --> 00:32:09,513
We were together...
Where?

265
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:12,781
There, in the mountains.

266
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:16,445
It was January, an awful month.

267
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:23,356
The Russians had positioned and we
had to take them out no matter what...

268
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:30,433
We can't imagine, madam, what
snow is if you haven't been to Russia

269
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:35,503
Madam, you stay still for 3 mins
and you froze...

270
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:39,754
Meanwhile the Russians came from
everywhere.  It was hell my lady.

271
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,500
We have been inside hell.

272
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:47,501
The snow, the ice, the wind that cut
your face, thirst, hunger.

273
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,002
Always sleepless, night and day...
a true hell my lady.

274
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:39,515
I don't feel my hands. Dam it.

275
00:35:56,218 --> 00:35:59,218
Here everything is burned.
Where are we going?

276
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Look!

277
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,198
Close that door!

278
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:06,485
I can't stand it more!
Come on, stand up!

279
00:37:11,274 --> 00:37:14,274
Then, when we escape from the ravine

280
00:37:15,645 --> 00:37:18,645
we walk many kilometers in the snow.

281
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:17,596
Anto!  Come on stand up!

282
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:21,324
Have strength!

283
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:34,852
Walk!

284
00:38:43,324 --> 00:38:46,324
Anto, you should walk!
Otherwise you'll froze.

285
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,679
When I turned around, he signaled me
to go on, to not think about him

286
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:59,309
That's the last time I saw him.
You never saw him again?

287
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:05,013
And you left him there in the snow,
without giving him a had, in the cold...

288
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:11,259
What can I do?
Wasn't anybody there to help you?

289
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
What kind of people are they?

290
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,042
I don't know.

291
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,689
Perhaps someone could help you.

292
00:40:24,408 --> 00:40:25,408
Listen...

293
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,445
Come inside, I'll prepare coffee.

294
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:30,179
No, coffee makes me sick,
can't drink it.

295
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:40,456
I'm happy to see you.

296
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:51,066
Want some water?
No, thanks, no.

297
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:01,368
Some cakes?
No, please, no.

298
00:42:02,947 --> 00:42:03,947
Sit down.

299
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:10,975
He's alive, I can feel it, he's not dead.

300
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:17,583
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written?
To you or me?

301
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,230
Why he hasn't come back, as many others?

302
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:27,029
I will go, I go.

303
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,092
Now they say that things have changed.

304
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:31,093
That now isn't impossible

305
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:34,694
They say you can go there.
I'll try.

306
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,090
Even if it was impossible
I will try the same.

307
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:39,691
To Russia?
Yes, yes to Russia.

308
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:43,751
So many have tried and didn't make it...

309
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:51,831
This is the last photo he send me...

310
00:42:57,846 --> 00:42:59,046
Look madam...

311
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,445
He probably was hot with
that many clothes...

312
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,789
What are you saying...

313
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:09,812
if a soldier does not cover like this
he dies...

314
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:12,252
He's alive.

315
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:32,631
Spaziva, that's how you say it?
Yes, Spaziva.

316
00:47:28,823 --> 00:47:33,823
Here some Italian soldiers and
Russian civilians, the Germans make them

317
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,851
dig their own graves.

318
00:47:38,844 --> 00:47:39,844
See madam...

319
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:46,882
each sunflower, each tree, each
grain field hides the bodies...

320
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:53,529
of Italian soldiers, Russians, Germans
and also the bodies of many...

321
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:58,530
Russian peasants, old, women, children.

322
00:48:01,362 --> 00:48:05,362
I'm sure that my husband is not there.
Antonio is alive.

323
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:32,924
You have to find peace for your heart, madam.
There are no Italians alive in Russia.

324
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:34,715
It cannot be!

325
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:40,941
Alive Italians for sure.
Wounded, some that lost their memory.

326
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:42,942
Why not? It happens, no?

327
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:48,313
Me, I know one that came to Moscow
to a soccer game

328
00:49:48,314 --> 00:49:51,714
have seen one of those Italians.
I have spoken to them.

329
00:49:51,715 --> 00:49:52,715
And what did he say?

330
00:49:52,716 --> 00:49:54,516
No idea what he said.

331
00:49:58,385 --> 00:49:59,685
I know, it is true.

332
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:03,819
Holy Mother...

333
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,020
This gravestone recalls his fellowmen.

334
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,600
Belongs to a Russian poet.

335
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:16,287
Young man from Naples, what
brings you to this Russian field...

336
00:50:16,385 --> 00:50:19,385
Weren't you happy in your
motherland...

337
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:22,086
Me, that I found you
jailed in Moscow...

338
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,887
so far away from your land...

339
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:58,921
Are you Italian?

340
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:04,101
Italian?
No.

341
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:54,645
You are Italian.

342
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:57,203
Anyone can tell because your
hair, your eyes, everything.

343
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:04,670
But how can you be ashamed of
being Italian?  Why you're ashamed?

344
00:54:12,246 --> 00:54:13,246
It is true?

345
00:54:14,265 --> 00:54:17,265
I came here searching for my husband.

346
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,266
But I can't find if he's alive or dead.

347
00:54:39,554 --> 00:54:40,554
You're Italian.

348
00:54:41,334 --> 00:54:42,634
Where are you from?

349
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:46,433
I was Italian, now I'm Russian.

350
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:49,012
Why?

351
00:54:49,091 --> 00:54:50,391
Because... because...

352
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:56,118
It's a long story...
the because certain things...

353
00:54:57,087 --> 00:54:58,587
happen and that's enough.

354
00:55:16,303 --> 00:55:19,303
No, I don't know him.
I was an alpine man...

355
00:55:19,304 --> 00:55:22,304
If I find something
I swear I'll tell you

356
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:26,305
Why don't you go home?
Which home?

357
00:55:55,064 --> 00:55:56,064
No.

358
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:57,065
Do you know him?

359
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:05,854
Do you know him?

360
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,670
Have you seen him?

361
00:58:45,404 --> 00:58:46,404
Good day!

362
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:27,898
I know nothing.

363
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:31,835
It's too hard!

364
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:36,869
I'm very tired!

365
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Antonio was a dead body.

366
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:29,689
Almost dead

367
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:34,872
He was...

368
01:01:37,438 --> 01:01:38,438
frozen.

369
01:04:06,082 --> 01:04:07,082
Antonio...

370
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:12,531
has forgotten everything.
Everything, do you understand?

371
01:04:15,513 --> 01:04:18,513
and I was always near,
always to cure him.

372
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:40,772
Come.

373
01:07:58,717 --> 01:08:01,717
I don't want to see you anymore!
I don't want to see you anymore!

374
01:08:36,415 --> 01:08:37,415
No you wouldn't... no.

375
01:08:51,672 --> 01:08:54,672
That's not the way is done!
It's not done like this!

376
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,531
But, why are you afraid?

377
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,690
No, I'm cold.

378
01:10:12,602 --> 01:10:15,602
Let's take a ride by the village,
do you want to?

379
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:19,937
Since when do you drive a motorcycle?
Since I was a kid.

380
01:10:20,145 --> 01:10:22,745
Are we going down?
No, it is flat.

381
01:10:22,746 --> 01:10:25,746
There is nothing to be afraid,
I'm an ace driving.

382
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,968
Shall we go to the river?
Yes, let's go.

383
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,344
Dam!

384
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:13,351
But are you crazy?
The dam thing didn't brake!

385
01:11:13,432 --> 01:11:16,932
But as I say, straight into the river
who could imagine?

386
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,807
We should thank that
nothing happened to us.

387
01:11:20,808 --> 01:11:22,308
I knew I shouldn't come.

388
01:11:22,309 --> 01:11:24,609
If you told me that never before
you ride a motorcycle...

389
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,700
All right, but is this the way to do it?

390
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:27,701
There it is!

391
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:32,708
Take.

392
01:11:33,268 --> 01:11:34,368
Where are you going?

393
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:36,869
Home and I walk.
Wait!

394
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,670
Don't say!

395
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:12,707
Want to come in?

396
01:12:25,987 --> 01:12:26,987
Want to sit down?

397
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,729
Did you pull out Antonio?

398
01:12:34,325 --> 01:12:35,325
Yes.

399
01:12:36,842 --> 01:12:40,042
It's better... it would have been better
if he's dead!

400
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:43,830
Better for me, better for you,
better for everyone...

401
01:12:48,108 --> 01:12:51,608
Madam, he's alive,
has a house, a woman

402
01:12:53,211 --> 01:12:54,211
and a little girl.

403
01:16:48,616 --> 01:16:49,616
Antonio!

404
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:06,346
You like to meddle into
gossip...

405
01:22:06,347 --> 01:22:09,347
do not forget what is
more convenient for you.

406
01:22:21,799 --> 01:22:22,799
Hi!

407
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,800
Hello, Giovanna.
Who's speaking?

408
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:28,108
Giovanna, it's me, Antonio.

409
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:31,542
I'm Antonio

410
01:22:32,559 --> 01:22:33,559
Giovanna!

411
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:34,683
Where are you?

412
01:22:34,842 --> 01:22:36,642
I'm here in Milan.

413
01:22:43,849 --> 01:22:45,649
I came looking for you.

414
01:22:46,648 --> 01:22:49,148
Giovanna, when can I see you?

415
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:52,245
How did you find me?

416
01:22:52,246 --> 01:22:54,466
Went to the village and they
gave me your phone number.

417
01:22:56,925 --> 01:22:59,935
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to see you.

418
01:22:59,936 --> 01:23:02,436
No. One moment,
just one moment.

419
01:23:04,327 --> 01:23:06,327
I have come from so far away!

420
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,191
Me too I have traveled so much...

421
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,412
day, night until I find you

422
01:23:12,075 --> 01:23:14,075
don't make me tell you.

423
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,440
Anto...

424
01:23:16,615 --> 01:23:18,515
I'm not either alone.

425
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,070
Are you with someone?

426
01:23:24,271 --> 01:23:25,271
Yes.

427
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:27,118
He's a factory worker...

428
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:31,319
Now he's at the factory
has the night shift.

429
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:38,259
Then we will not met. I'm leaving
like if we have never talked...

430
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,260
is better like this.

431
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:43,833
Anyway we have nothing to do
you have another woman...

432
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:46,851
and with another woman, I don't
want to know anything about you

433
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:50,957
Then, goodbye Giovanna...

434
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:58,050
Goodbye Anto... goodbye.

435
01:25:15,018 --> 01:25:16,018
Excuse me...

436
01:25:16,072 --> 01:25:19,072
The strike also applies
to international trains?

437
01:25:19,373 --> 01:25:20,484
Where are you going?

438
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:21,974
To Vienna.

439
01:25:22,175 --> 01:25:24,675
You have to take it tomorrow
morning at 6.

440
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,100
Is there another way to do it?

441
01:25:26,514 --> 01:25:27,714
What do you mean?

442
01:25:28,527 --> 01:25:30,749
I have seen a bus service.

443
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:34,083
Yes but they go to Torino, Verona, Novara

444
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:36,084
Bologna, won't take you there

445
01:26:40,646 --> 01:26:42,866
Everything is a mess with this strike.

446
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:47,880
Look there is a bus service that
substitutes the train,  is about to leave.

447
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:49,881
But where do I have to go?

448
01:26:49,882 --> 01:26:50,882
Sorry, I believed...

449
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:54,150
Saw you buying a present and...

450
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:57,173
Ah! the doll, no, is for me.
I like them.

451
01:26:59,127 --> 01:27:00,527
Don't you like them?

452
01:27:05,294 --> 01:27:08,594
Listen, can you tell me
about a nearby hotel?

453
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:12,011
Could be The Galia, but...

454
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,561
No, a cheap hotel.

455
01:27:15,562 --> 01:27:16,562
No.

456
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:21,968
Want to sleep with me?

457
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,600
Where?

458
01:27:38,888 --> 01:27:40,062
There nearby.

459
01:27:45,308 --> 01:27:46,808
Where are you from?

460
01:27:49,502 --> 01:27:50,502
and where are you?

461
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:54,231
Do you have a phone?

462
01:27:54,774 --> 01:27:56,674
Yes, here near the door.

463
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,320
Antonio?
Yes, listen...

464
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:25,919
Lost my train, can't leave
until tomorrow...

465
01:28:27,999 --> 01:28:32,499
I want to see you, I have to speak
with you, tell me where are you?

466
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:37,867
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42.

467
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,900
Wait, wait I've to write
the address.

468
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,990
Excuse me, do you have
a pencil I have to write...

469
01:28:46,452 --> 01:28:47,752
Only an eye pencil.

470
01:28:49,596 --> 01:28:50,596
Tell me? Repeat the address.

471
01:28:53,443 --> 01:28:59,343
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42,
third floor apartment 8.

472
01:29:00,538 --> 01:29:01,538
Thanks.

473
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:07,804
Listen, how to I call a taxi?

474
01:29:08,151 --> 01:29:09,451
What, a taxi?

475
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:12,539
Why?  Are you leaving?

476
01:29:13,218 --> 01:29:14,218
Yes.

477
01:29:14,959 --> 01:29:20,159
But I got naked and
the mirror is dirty.

478
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:23,232
How much you charge?

479
01:31:50,657 --> 01:31:55,157
It's dark, meeting like this in
the dark after so much time.

480
01:32:03,595 --> 01:32:06,395
Please let me in.
I'll leave soon.

481
01:32:06,596 --> 01:32:07,896
Yes, sorry.

482
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:17,801
I'll look for a candle.
Where did I put it?

483
01:32:18,323 --> 01:32:21,323
You're all wet.
No, it's nothing...

484
01:32:34,023 --> 01:32:36,023
Can't believe you're here.

485
01:32:36,465 --> 01:32:37,465
Listen, Giovanna

486
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:45,609
I have to explain everything.

487
01:32:46,565 --> 01:32:51,065
I wanted to kill myself, but I
understood that you can live without love.

488
01:32:53,885 --> 01:32:54,885
It's true...

489
01:32:56,608 --> 01:32:58,408
don't know if you know what happened.

490
01:33:01,624 --> 01:33:05,124
I had in front of me,
one thousand kms of snow.

491
01:33:05,688 --> 01:33:08,188
When I opened my eyes...

492
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:11,509
I was in a house

493
01:33:14,384 --> 01:33:15,884
an unknown house

494
01:33:17,303 --> 01:33:19,503
with a woman I have
never seen before

495
01:33:22,176 --> 01:33:24,676
and I couldn't remember
a thing...

496
01:33:24,677 --> 01:33:27,277
for a long time I couldn't
remember a thing.

497
01:33:27,278 --> 01:33:28,778
All you're saying I already know it.

498
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:34,160
She saved your life.  She healed you
and gave you everything you needed.

499
01:33:35,253 --> 01:33:37,453
You should have given her many
thanks and come back here.

500
01:33:39,293 --> 01:33:41,393
Instead you stayed...

501
01:33:43,761 --> 01:33:45,761
and had a child with her.

502
01:33:51,328 --> 01:33:53,228
I felt that it was the only...

503
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:57,264
safe place available for me.

504
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:08,125
Do you love her?

505
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,280
For me...

506
01:34:14,796 --> 01:34:15,796
it has been...

507
01:34:18,702 --> 01:34:20,602
as if I was dead...

508
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,197
and afterwards, I was
someone else.

509
01:34:26,892 --> 01:34:29,892
Death so close,
changes people.

510
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,707
Changes, changes the feelings

511
01:34:35,691 --> 01:34:38,191
Don't know how to explain...

512
01:34:41,735 --> 01:34:44,235
Me, with her...

513
01:34:45,962 --> 01:34:47,962
I found some peace.

514
01:34:53,649 --> 01:34:57,649
How can I make you understand.
I came because I believed that...

515
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,150
easily I could explain you everything.

516
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,160
War is ugly.

517
01:35:04,629 --> 01:35:06,629
Has been...

518
01:35:07,883 --> 01:35:11,582
Has been like that...
ugly, Giovanna.

519
01:35:16,317 --> 01:35:18,317
Has been difficult...

520
01:35:33,213 --> 01:35:35,813
Don't know why it happened.

521
01:36:18,705 --> 01:36:20,305
I look for a candle.

522
01:36:40,945 --> 01:36:43,945
Don't look at me like that.
I've aged.

523
01:36:52,982 --> 01:36:55,482
You also have become an old man.

524
01:36:55,483 --> 01:36:57,683
Everything is a disaster.

525
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,180
How much white hair!

526
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Antonio!

527
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:24,701
Come back to me.
I still love you.

528
01:37:24,993 --> 01:37:27,493
And you still love me,
I can feel it.

529
01:37:27,494 --> 01:37:28,494
How could I go back to you?

530
01:37:29,274 --> 01:37:30,274
How could I go back to you?

531
01:38:05,871 --> 01:38:09,371
The baby.
Have you understood, Anto?

532
01:38:15,196 --> 01:38:18,196
But I can't leave you like this.

533
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:19,497
I'll take you with me.

534
01:38:19,498 --> 01:38:22,498
We will forge a new life
in any place.

535
01:38:22,499 --> 01:38:25,499
And where would you take me
with this child?

536
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,100
And you also have a daughter.

537
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:30,701
We will ruin the kids and you.

538
01:38:41,101 --> 01:38:42,101
Love

539
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:00,980
What's his name?
Antonio.

540
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:03,880
Like me.

541
01:39:04,451 --> 01:39:06,951
No, Antonio like Saint Anthony.

542
01:39:22,236 --> 01:39:23,236
I brought you...

543
01:39:29,912 --> 01:39:31,912
I promised you.
