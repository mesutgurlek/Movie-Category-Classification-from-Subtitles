Then tell me this, wise one:

84
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,648
Did you foresee
what has happened here?

85
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:30,983
And, if so,
did you warn the people?

00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:34,153
I see what the gods
allow me to see,

and say what
they allow me to say.

00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:42,411
Then you saw nothing,
or you said nothing?

00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:50,036
Do you have
any other questions?

90

who kill without conscience,

115

But I will not deliver you

delivered to me

Oh, I... I doubt that.

We are christians,

131

we were also pagans.

do you think we cared nothing
for our families,

our children?

135
