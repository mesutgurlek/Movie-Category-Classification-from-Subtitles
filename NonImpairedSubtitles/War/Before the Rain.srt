1
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,745
It's going to rain.
The flies are biting.

2
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:07,592
Come on, it's time.

3
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:12,387
It's already raining
down there.

4
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:24,511
This conversation is too
one-sided, Kiril.

5
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:50,066
It smells of rain.

6
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:54,793
Thunder always gives me
a jolt.

7
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:58,025
I fear they've begun
shooting here, too.

8
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:03,145
Go, go, Nin ja Turtle!
Kill him!

9
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,513
Take it easy, kid...

10
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:13,466
Time never dies.
The circle is never round.

11
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:28,626
I wanted to take a vow
of silence, like you.

12
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:32,513
But this heavenly beauty
merits words.

13
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:45,744
Bullets!

14
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:50,268
Run!

15
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,786
God help us!

16
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:38,068
Good night, son.
God be with us.

17
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,429
Sshhh!

18
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:53,147
Don't hit me, please.

19
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:00,035
'Don't give me away.

20
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:13,431
Speak to me.
Are you mute?

21
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:19,468
You don't speak Albanian.

22
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,468
I don't speak Macedonian.

23
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:17,025
What are you doing here, son?

24
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:27,189
A midnight stroll?
All right, I need a piss, too.

25
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,954
Come on, Kiril.
What are you doing there?

26
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:44,151
I haven't got all night.

27
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:07,507
My name is Zamira.

28
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:16,995
You are a good person.

29
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,509
Welcome.

30
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:37,072
Thank you, Father.

31
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,475
Well, Mitre?

32
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:51,386
We're looking for
an Albanian girl.

33
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:54,788
- She killed my brother.
- God rest his soul.

34
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:59,469
The children say
she's hiding here.

35
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:04,225
We've only had refugees from
Bosnia, Moslems.

36
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,232
We're all equal
in God's eyes.

37
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:11,113
Remember five centuries
of Moslem rule?

38
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:15,994
Father, you're one of us.
Give us the Albanian girl.

39
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,427
There's no girl in
my monastery.

40
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,229
- We'll search it.
- No.

41
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:23,465
We must!
An eye for an eye!

42
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:25,790
Bad blood.

43
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:27,995
Turn the other cheek.

44
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:29,635
We have.

45
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:37,544
Wait outside.

46
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,314
- Has anyone seen her?
- No, Father.

47
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,947
I just want to know
if she's here.

48
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:57,914
We would have told
you at once, Father.

49
00:15:58,356 --> 00:15:59,505
Kitty, kitty...

50
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:09,265
No one?

51
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,308
Father Kiril?

52
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:14,105
Have you seen a girl here?

53
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:18,952
We would have told you;
it's a sin.

54
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:21,906
So, she's not her, right,
Father Kiril?

55
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:43,391
Welcome.

56
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,914
- God sees everything.
- Forgive us, Father.

57
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,990
Might is right. - We won't
do anything to you.

58
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:54,795
But when we find her,
she'll be sorry.

59
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:08,795
Well?

60
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,987
She's not downstairs.

61
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:19,993
- What's upstairs?
- Father's Kiril cell.

62
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:24,227
Come on, Father.

63
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,991
You shouldn't do this,
Mitre.

64
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,874
For your own good, Father.

65
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:17,265
Come on.

66
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:46,271
Stojan, make sure
no one to leaves.

67
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,746
There's nothing here,
children.

68
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:56,948
This is a sin.

69
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,428
An eye for an eye.
Albanian whore!

70
00:19:00,636 --> 00:19:02,149
Stojan, under the bed.

71
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:07,905
We'll find her, even if
she hides in America.

72
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:42,029
So you're hiding a Moslem
in God's house. Speak.

73
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:44,631
Kiril hasn't spoken
for two years.

74
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:46,833
He took a vow of silence.

75
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:49,114
Mute? Deaf, too?

76
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,112
I'll fuck her Albanian
mother, too.

77
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,508
You, animal!

78
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:19,715
I'll wait for you outside.

79
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:41,985
- I win, pay up.
- Give me some brandy.

80
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,474
- Let's get his gun.
- He's crazy, he'll shoot you.

81
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,511
- Can I hold it?
- Here.

82
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:44,835
Run! Run!

83
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:19,588
"Yeah, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

84
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:25,786
...I will fear no evil:
For thou art with me."

85
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:30,432
Shame on you!

86
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:34,193
Deny thy father.

87
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:38,754
Give up thy name.

88
00:26:29,116 --> 00:26:32,188
Good luck to you both.

89
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:35,193
Thank you, Father.

90
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:43,708
Forgive me.

91
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:19,425
Kitty, kitty...

92
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:34,025
Shoot, cousin!
Shoot!

93
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:32,628
We'll go to my brother
in Skopje, he will help us.

94
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:37,752
Then to my uncle in London.

95
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:40,707
He's a famous photographer.

96
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,987
I don't understand you.

97
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:48,866
No one will find you.
No one.

98
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:51,872
You don't understand me,
do you?

99
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:01,948
No one.

100
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:16,829
Grandpa!

101
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:24,105
Where were you yesterday?

102
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:29,909
Answer me, you slut!
Where were you yesterday?

103
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:35,628
Did you go to the sheepfold
again?

104
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:38,709
Did you kill the shepherd?

105
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:43,434
Answer me.
Did you kill him?

106
00:30:45,356 --> 00:30:47,392
What the hell were you
doing here?

107
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:51,190
Blood calls for blood now.

108
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:59,630
Did you forget what
I told you?

109
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:05,385
I never hit you. Never.

110
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:11,270
I locked you up in the house.
I cut your hair.

111
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,347
Should I shave it off?

112
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:16,825
Who is he?

113
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,106
He saved me, Grandpa.
He saved me.

114
00:31:20,516 --> 00:31:22,507
Did he, you bitch?

115
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,987
Whore! Slut!

116
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:30,035
He loves me.

117
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:33,355
He loves you?

118
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:36,867
He loves me.

119
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:40,949
He loves you, eh?
Let's see.

120
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,747
Let him go.

121
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:51,591
Let him go!

122
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:54,786
Clear off!

123
00:31:58,356 --> 00:31:59,505
Run!

124
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:35,264
Don't. Don't!

125
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:39,349
Sister, no!

126
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:24,794
Forgive me.

127
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:25,831
Go fuck yourself.

128
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,788
I love you.

129
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:29,431
Motherfuckers.

130
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:08,986
I want to speak to
Alexander Kirkov.

131
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:12,390
I'm sorry, but
he's gone away.

132
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,594
Would you like to
leave a message?

133
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:19,546
No message today.
Thank you.

134
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:23,470
Where are you calling from?

135
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:26,192
Not bad, and you?
- Killing myself here.

136
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:53,545
No problem.
Do you need money?

137
00:51:00,276 --> 00:51:01,789
Take this money.
Send it.

138
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:30,307
What?

139
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:33,110
Money, money...

140
00:52:28,796 --> 00:52:30,115
I give no shit...

141
00:53:16,436 --> 00:53:19,030
Suck it.

142
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:26,985
Look at our people.

143
01:01:27,436 --> 01:01:29,233
The driver will see you
smoking.

144
01:01:29,596 --> 01:01:31,552
Don't worry, he's my uncle.
Have one.

145
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,875
- I gave up.
- Come on, relax.

146
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:42,120
- I'm off to a harvest. You?
- To a baptism.

147
01:01:42,121 --> 01:01:43,156
Whose?

148
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:46,592
- Mine.
- You're joking.

149
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:48,754
My nephew.

150
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:52,238
Nice. How long since
you were here?

151
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:54,679
Sixteen years.

152
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,430
I ran away twenty-four years
ago; I only came back once.

153
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:00,670
Do you mind?

154
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:10,355
Your wife?

155
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:15,676
She died... in a taxi.

156
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:32,029
Why come back now? Don't you
see what's going on here?

157
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:36,039
You'll be sorry when someone
chops off your head.

158
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:38,676
I won't.
It's about time.

159
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:30,158
Where are you going?

160
01:03:34,601 --> 01:03:36,159
I'll shoot.

161
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:40,157
You'll hurt yourself.

162
01:03:40,721 --> 01:03:43,110
Oh, you're one of us.

163
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:48,199
Stop.

164
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:52,195
- Where to?
- To see Bojan.

165
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:55,110
Son of Trpe,
the innkeeper.

166
01:03:58,681 --> 01:04:00,558
Anyone at home?

167
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:04,241
Give it back,
they cost a lot!

168
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:07,071
Go home,
you little shit!

169
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:10,479
My uncle Mitre will sort
you out. I'll tell him...

170
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:14,430
Tell him to suck my cock...
gently.

171
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:43,280
Good afternoon.

172
01:06:26,241 --> 01:06:27,879
Good afternoon.

173
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:32,232
Fucking hell!

174
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:21,160
It's him.

175
01:08:22,201 --> 01:08:28,595
Look at his camera,
it's from Germany.

176
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,639
Man of the house!

177
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:06,633
Quite a gun you've got.

178
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,993
Can I see it?

179
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:18,229
You little brat.

180
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:21,394
You can't catch me.

181
01:09:25,921 --> 01:09:28,116
Don't do that, son.

182
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:31,272
Let the kid go.

183
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,991
Hit me, cousin.

184
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:51,514
Aco! You old bastard!

185
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,437
I didn't recognize you.

186
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,073
A beard and a half.

187
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:04,074
- Older, too. When did you get
here? - Last night.

188
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:06,676
- Where did you sleep?
- In my old bed.

189
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:08,912
I'll wallop you.

190
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,879
You should have dined
and slept at my house.

191
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:17,400
Aco, Putziler Prize - winner.

192
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:19,831
It's been a hundred years,
you donkey.

193
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:22,158
Only sixteen.

194
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:26,756
Mitre?

195
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,759
Hi.

196
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:32,041
You took that from my nephew?

197
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,716
I should have smacked him.
Put it somewhere safe.

198
01:10:36,961 --> 01:10:38,076
Hell with it.

199
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:57,113
Give us to eat.

200
01:10:58,961 --> 01:11:01,236
Here comes my wife, Neda.

201
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:05,399
Cheers and welcome.

202
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:07,597
Thank you.

203
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:09,116
To long life.

204
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:10,960
Let me say something.

205
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:12,754
May we gather again
next year...

206
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:14,355
...with a bride.

207
01:11:15,001 --> 01:11:17,754
He's got many brides in
England.

208
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:23,191
- Cousin, do you see ever see
Hana? - Forget about her.

209
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:27,270
She's Albanian. Aren't there
enough of ours for you?

210
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:30,320
- What does that matter? - Her
father will cut your dick off,

211
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:32,239
then it will matter.

212
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:34,997
Her husband died last
year.

213
01:11:36,921 --> 01:11:38,513
She's got a beautiful
daughter.

214
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:40,434
Where have you seen her?

215
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:42,592
She hangs around
the sheepfold.

216
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:46,311
Don't be stingy, bring her
over some time.

217
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:50,312
Damn Albanians, they
breed like rabbits.

218
01:11:51,201 --> 01:11:53,032
They'll take us over.

219
01:11:53,681 --> 01:11:56,639
Stop talking rubbish.
No one's taking over anything.

220
01:11:57,361 --> 01:11:59,556
- Cousin, have a cigarette.
- No thanks, I've quit.

221
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:02,231
Don't be silly.
- No, Zdrave.

222
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:05,835
- How long are you staying?
- For good.

223
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:10,917
In that case we'll help you
fix up your house.

224
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:14,398
The roof and the windows
should be mended.

225
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:18,431
Fix it? Just look at
their house.

226
01:12:25,481 --> 01:12:28,200
Aco, take a picture of us.

227
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:55,352
Hangover?

228
01:12:55,761 --> 01:12:57,353
Hangover, yes.

229
01:12:58,081 --> 01:12:59,196
Who are you?

230
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:01,353
I'll come to you.

231
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:06,752
Are you Kate?

232
01:13:07,281 --> 01:13:09,590
You never knew when to stop.

233
01:13:10,161 --> 01:13:13,756
To stop, or not to stop?
Full stop.

234
01:13:22,601 --> 01:13:26,355
Perfect.

235
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:40,198
Don't.

236
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:46,796
Still dreaming of Hana?

237
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:49,599
Still.

238
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:53,316
She's a widow now.

239
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:57,232
I'm a divorcee.
- Are you?

240
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,919
And you?

241
01:14:01,241 --> 01:14:04,597
Me? I'm a schoolteacher.

242
01:14:07,441 --> 01:14:09,796
Have you got anyone?

243
01:14:17,481 --> 01:14:20,996
Sleep. You need it.

244
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:29,874
Good day.

245
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,360
Good day.

246
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:02,752
Where are you going?

247
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:07,478
To Hana's.

248
01:16:09,681 --> 01:16:11,433
Hana Halili.

249
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:13,956
What for?

250
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,913
She's my friend.

251
01:16:18,361 --> 01:16:23,799
From school. I haven't seen
her for sixteen years.

252
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,032
I want to pay my respects.

253
01:16:26,441 --> 01:16:28,432
I've brought presents
for the children.

254
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:34,111
I mean no harm.

255
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:42,110
Tell her it's Alexander,
from London.

256
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:51,914
Ask her father, Zekir.

257
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:57,271
Go.

258
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:02,230
Sit down.

259
01:17:26,681 --> 01:17:29,479
You've gone gray, too.

260
01:17:30,961 --> 01:17:33,031
Welcome.

261
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:35,754
Have you come from far?

262
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,394
Very far.

263
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:41,278
How do people live
in the world?

264
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:45,078
Good, if they know how,
same as here.

265
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,558
Welcome.

266
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,879
The times...
they're no good.

267
01:17:59,281 --> 01:18:02,717
They used to be better.
Blood is in the air.

268
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:14,076
It's stuffy.

269
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:17,833
It should rain.

270
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:21,073
It must,
sooner or later.

271
01:18:26,441 --> 01:18:28,477
For the children.

272
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:31,273
This was for the husband.

273
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:33,796
I didn't know he'd passed away.

274
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:38,036
Last year, in a car accident.

275
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,595
God rest his soul.

276
01:18:48,761 --> 01:18:50,717
This is for you.

277
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:53,875
For me?

278
01:18:58,281 --> 01:19:00,511
Like in American movies.

279
01:19:02,761 --> 01:19:05,195
Sitting Bull.

280
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:14,070
Come in, Hana.

281
01:19:22,361 --> 01:19:25,080
Help yourself.

282
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:46,392
Thank you.

283
01:19:51,481 --> 01:19:52,357
Go away!

284
01:19:57,761 --> 01:20:00,150
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

285
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:28,511
My grandson, Ali.

286
01:20:31,881 --> 01:20:34,156
Kiss his hand.

287
01:20:34,961 --> 01:20:36,713
Why is he here?

288
01:20:37,401 --> 01:20:39,312
- Say thank you.
- He doesn't belong here.

289
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:45,556
Take the gifts to your
sister.

290
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:47,310
He doesn't belong here.

291
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:49,116
Get out!

292
01:20:53,721 --> 01:20:56,918
I'll slit his throat!

293
01:21:46,961 --> 01:21:49,794
Mother, Father, forgive me.

294
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:53,477
We're having a wedding
without you.

295
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:55,391
Be joyful...

296
01:21:55,961 --> 01:22:00,591
If you only were here to
share our happiness.

297
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:08,476
Rest in peace.

298
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:32,596
Hello?

299
01:22:37,881 --> 01:22:39,075
What's up?

300
01:22:40,681 --> 01:22:42,239
What's up?
Hey, old man.

301
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:12,036
I want to speak to
Alexander Kirkov.

302
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:20,069
There's no such person here.

303
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:27,794
Who did they want?

304
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:29,833
Nobody.

305
01:23:33,001 --> 01:23:34,195
Come on.

306
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,720
You beauty!

307
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:09,953
Shit.

308
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:24,353
What is it going to be,
a boy or a girl?

309
01:24:24,841 --> 01:24:27,355
It doesn't matter, as long as
it's a boy.

310
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:30,712
Come on, my dear.

311
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:34,438
Where did you get to
yesterday?

312
01:24:34,761 --> 01:24:36,592
I got as drunk
as a skunk.

313
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:39,156
- It's good for your liver.
- What liver? Long gone.

314
01:24:40,161 --> 01:24:41,879
You forgot how to drink
in England.

315
01:24:42,841 --> 01:24:44,832
You've got the sexiest girls
there.

316
01:24:49,841 --> 01:24:51,320
Congratulations!

317
01:24:52,201 --> 01:24:54,761
Bojan, fetch brandy.
- We already have one here.

318
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:56,952
Come on, fetch the
good stuff.

319
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:00,356
He wasn't this worried
about his wife.

320
01:25:03,001 --> 01:25:05,561
What a bore this cousin
of yours is.

321
01:25:10,641 --> 01:25:12,677
I video-tapped a programme
about you:

322
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:14,912
Our man made it
in the big world.

323
01:25:15,481 --> 01:25:17,631
Vietnam, Beirut... - Vietnam
was before my time.

324
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:20,351
Same shit.

325
01:25:23,241 --> 01:25:25,630
- Are you tired?
- As if I'd left yesterday.

326
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:27,840
Everything is the same.

327
01:25:28,281 --> 01:25:30,158
I feel good here.
Comfortable.

328
01:25:30,601 --> 01:25:34,196
America, England, where
they don't shoot...

329
01:25:34,561 --> 01:25:36,040
...that's where
it's comfortable.

330
01:25:36,321 --> 01:25:37,959
They shoot more there.

331
01:25:38,241 --> 01:25:40,630
You can't imagine
the killings I've seen.

332
01:25:41,961 --> 01:25:44,919
"Will these hands
ne'er be clean?"

333
01:25:48,321 --> 01:25:50,596
They won't start
shooting here.

334
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:52,879
People are peaceful.

335
01:25:53,241 --> 01:25:55,232
They used to say that
about Bosnia.

336
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:58,240
Now the world's watching
a circus.

337
01:25:59,881 --> 01:26:01,234
Waiting to kill each other.

338
01:26:01,641 --> 01:26:04,155
- I was in Bosnia.
- And? Bad, huh?

339
01:26:07,721 --> 01:26:09,473
An industrial in jury?

340
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:12,278
Are you tired?

341
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:15,793
I'm tired.

342
01:26:22,561 --> 01:26:25,314
There's no reason
to fight here, Doc.

343
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:28,029
They'll find a reason;
war is a virus.

344
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:30,797
We split in two: Our village,
their village.

345
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:35,401
People give nasty looks.

346
01:26:38,921 --> 01:26:40,752
I'll go and see Hana.

347
01:26:41,401 --> 01:26:44,438
- Where's Bojan?
- You've just missed him.

348
01:26:45,521 --> 01:26:47,716
See her, but behave yourself.

349
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:50,112
Keep it in your pants.

350
01:29:13,521 --> 01:29:15,318
Come to Auntie, my dear.

351
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:17,637
Let's go.

352
01:30:25,361 --> 01:30:26,794
Hurry!

353
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:47,716
Where?

354
01:30:58,361 --> 01:31:02,274
Let the damned Albanians
rot on a pitchfork.

355
01:31:06,081 --> 01:31:07,753
One of theirs.

356
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:10,637
Whore with a pitchfork.

357
01:31:11,121 --> 01:31:15,353
The children saw the Albanian
slut with him this morning.

358
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:22,269
- I'll strangle her myself.
- And then what?

359
01:31:22,841 --> 01:31:25,719
Keep out of it,
you're not from here.

360
01:31:33,081 --> 01:31:36,596
We'll be at the sheepfold.

361
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:41,840
Take it.

362
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:44,078
It's time to collect.

363
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:47,360
Five centuries of our blood.

364
01:32:22,921 --> 01:32:25,719
Take it.
Poison yourself.

365
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,077
Did you see guns?
- Yeah.

366
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:36,114
You haven't seen anything yet.

367
01:32:37,881 --> 01:32:39,792
This is only the infantry.

368
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,312
Politicians are all
we need now.

369
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:44,154
Where is the UN now?

370
01:32:44,401 --> 01:32:46,710
Back next week,
to bury the dead.

371
01:32:47,201 --> 01:32:49,590
Have a nice war.
Take pictures.

372
01:32:50,401 --> 01:32:53,677
You know what?
You're crazy, too.

373
01:32:57,081 --> 01:33:01,472
Correct. I'm still here
in this asylum.

374
01:34:02,841 --> 01:34:04,160
Hana?

375
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:06,199
It's me.

376
01:34:16,921 --> 01:34:18,593
How are you?

377
01:34:19,441 --> 01:34:21,511
Bad.

378
01:34:36,721 --> 01:34:38,393
Tell me.

379
01:34:38,761 --> 01:34:41,116
My daughter is missing.

380
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:46,279
Your cousin.

381
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:48,871
- Zdrave?
- Yes, Zdrave.

382
01:34:55,841 --> 01:34:59,754
Do you see what's happening
to our people?

383
01:35:00,401 --> 01:35:01,629
I see.

384
01:35:01,961 --> 01:35:03,917
You just watch.

385
01:35:26,561 --> 01:35:28,711
Help me.

386
01:35:31,721 --> 01:35:35,191
As if she were yours.

387
01:39:40,561 --> 01:39:42,870
Cousin.
I almost killed you.

388
01:39:43,961 --> 01:39:46,111
Shame on you.
- Why?

389
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:50,841
She is a child. A child.

390
01:39:53,681 --> 01:39:55,831
That child killed
my brother.

391
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:58,635
How do you know? There's
the police and the law,

392
01:39:58,961 --> 01:40:00,519
let them decide.

393
01:40:00,801 --> 01:40:05,079
You left long ago, you don't
know how it is here now.

394
01:40:06,321 --> 01:40:08,357
Live your own life.

395
01:40:09,641 --> 01:40:11,597
That's why I'm here.

396
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:14,839
I couldn't live with myself
if I let you do this.

397
01:40:28,601 --> 01:40:31,035
Cousin, wait a minute.

398
01:40:34,001 --> 01:40:35,593
Aco, come back.

399
01:40:36,561 --> 01:40:38,677
Aco, I'll shoot.
Do you hear?

400
01:40:41,121 --> 01:40:44,238
- Aco, I'll shoot.
- Coward.

401
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:47,916
Alex, I'll shoot.

402
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:51,469
Shoot, cousin. Shoot!

403
01:41:10,641 --> 01:41:11,630
Run!

404
01:41:14,881 --> 01:41:18,476
Run! Run!

405
01:41:22,681 --> 01:41:24,717
Whore!

406
01:41:55,281 --> 01:41:56,919
Shoot, cousin.

407
01:41:58,561 --> 01:42:00,040
Shoot!

408
01:42:00,441 --> 01:42:03,274
Aco, don't you worry,
you'll be all right.

409
01:42:04,001 --> 01:42:05,753
Look.

410
01:42:09,721 --> 01:42:12,394
It's going to rain.

411
01:42:38,681 --> 01:42:40,956
You whore!

412
01:43:01,561 --> 01:43:03,916
Blind fool.

413
01:44:28,241 --> 01:44:30,436
It's going to rain.
The flies are biting.

414
01:44:32,201 --> 01:44:34,954
It's already raining
down there.

415
01:44:37,361 --> 01:44:41,274
Come on, it's time.
And time doesn't wait.

416
01:44:42,881 --> 01:44:46,157
And the circle
is not round.
