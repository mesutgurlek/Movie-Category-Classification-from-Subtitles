##<i>[Off-key Continues]</i>

3
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:33,642
Parade rest.

4
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:43,120
As you all know, tonight
Colonel Blake will resume his
command after a week in Tokyo.

5
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,720
Now, unless I made a few remarks
about my recent stint...

6
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:48,426
as your temporary
supreme commander,

7
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:52,198
I would be derelict
in my "officiousness."

8
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:56,401
I think you'll all agree
that by trying to introduce
more discipline, more order,

9
00:01:56,475 --> 00:02:00,343
I have hopefully made this
a more enjoyable war for all of us.

10
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,974
Leadership is
a lonely business.

11
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,383
Your Napoleons, your Kaisers,

12
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:10,445
your Attilas the Hun...

13
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:14,687
were all alone there in the front office
as I have been this week.

14
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,663
I have thought of you,
and, oh, you have thought of me.

15
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:23,133
But some of the notes in the suggestion
box were really below the belt.

16
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:27,195
I mean, why drag
my mother into this?

17
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,272
- [Mutters]
- Oh.

18
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:35,007
Well, um,

19
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:37,549
that's about it.

20
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:41,848
Corporal, deform the men.

21
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:44,947
Company, ten-hut!

22
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:48,787
Dismissed.

23

## [Off-key]

24
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:00,505
To the return of Henry Blake.

25
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,565
Able to leap tall bar stools
at a single bound.

26
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,576
Faster than a speeding nurse.

27
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,635
- It's Super Colonel!
- Ta-da!

28
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,116
- More cocoa, Frank?
- Just a smidge.

29
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:23,491
Frank, I'm gonna show you something
you've never seen before.

30
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:25,860
Oh?

31
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,900
My diary.

32
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,305
Last night's entry.

33
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:40,439
"Dear Diary. I can't go
to sleep before I tell you...

34
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:43,949
"about my scrumptious Major F.B.

35
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:49,884
"In the last few days, it's been
so exciting to watch his growth...

36
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,889
"as a commander.

37
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:56,189
"Diary, I really feel this man,
dare I say, my man,

38
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:58,730
"has greatness in him.

39
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:02,529
And I'm grateful that a little bit
of it occasionally rubs off on me."

40
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:08,269
- Oh, Margaret.
- <i>[Knocking]</i>

- <i>[Radar] Major Burns, sir?</i>
- He's not here!

42
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:14,105
<i>We had a call from Col. Blake.</i>

43
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,114
- What is it?
- <i>Are you there?</i>

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,684
I just got here.

45
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,118
He's doing a snap inspection.

46
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:24,213
<i>Yes, sirs.</i>

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,781
Just slip the message
under the door.

48
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,453
<i>It's verbal.</i>
<i>I'll get my mouth dirty.</i>

[Groaning]

50
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,966
- What is it?
- Col. Blake's apologies, sir.

51
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:38,265
He won't be home
for two more days,

52
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,101
and he said that you should
keep carrying on.

53
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:43,641
I guess that goes
for both of you.

54
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:47,110
That'll be all, Corporal.
Dismissed. Smoke if you got 'em.

55
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:50,544
I don't smoke, sir.

56
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:52,948
- Then go to sleep, on the double!
- Yes, sir.

57
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,980
Two whole days!

58
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,822
- Hit it!
- Hit it!

Ten-hut!

61
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:32,416
- The O.R. Was jumping, huh?
- Full house every night.

62
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:36,120
- I think we're ready
to open the war on Broadway.
- Lots of head wounds.

63
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,255
That comes from trying to take hills
the other guys have grown fond of.

64
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,731
You pulled every one
of'em through.

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,496
You guys make me
look awful good.

66
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:53,302
- All right, Henry, what is it?
- What is what it?

67
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,678
Henry, you're bursting with something.
Your face could open a branch smile.

68
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:59,775
Okay, guys,
brace yourselves.

69
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:02,412
- Sit down.
- We're sitting, Henry.

70
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,321
Then I'll sit. I can't sit.
I'm already sitting.

71
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,382
- Then I gotta stand.
- Henry!

72
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,878
Okay, guys, okay.
I'm in love.

73
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:10,402
Okay, guys, okay.
I'm in love.

74
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,946
Okay, okay,
I know it's crazy.

75
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:22,424
I'm 44 years old and I only hear
about half of what anybody says.

76
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,960
And I'm starting to brush
my hair with a towel.

77
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:28,555
And my hips are forming
a rain gutter for my waist.

78
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:31,395
And I'm thinking about moving
my cot into the latrine...

79
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,402
so that I can cut down
on the traveling time.

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,633
And yet, this middle-aged mess
from Bloomington, Illinois,

81
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:41,768
is head-over-heels,
puppy-dog in love.

82
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:45,211
Well, don't keep us in suspense.
Who's the man, woman or child?

83
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,478
- Check one.
- Fourth picture's the best.

84
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,815
That's a nice looking kid.

85
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:56,389
- Real winner.
- And you're in love with her mother?

86
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,189
Get out.
No, that's it. That's her.

87
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:02,060
Nancy Sue Parker.
Nancy Sue.

88
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:06,568
Henry, did you get a chance
to ask her her age before
the gym teacher called the police?

89
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,231
Just a minute here. She's no kid.
She'll be 21 in August.

90
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,173
Henry, you've got
a corn that's 21.

91
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:15,210
Okay, okay.

92
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:17,212
I know, I know.

93
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:20,348
I'm a damned fool, right?

94
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,976
- No, Henry, we didn't say that.
- Where did you meet her?

95
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:28,890
I'm in the Dai-Ichi Hotel coffee shop
with Mel Rosenbloom. He's the...

96
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,825
- The U.N. Gynecologist?
- The U.N. Gynecologist.

97
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:35,796
And we're trying to decide which
bathhouse to go to after breakfast.

98
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:39,562
Well, the hostess comes over
and she says, "Do you mind sharing?"

99
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:43,401
And wham, bang, Miss Nancy Sue Parker
of Independence, Ohio,

100
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:47,170
pulls up a chair and sits
right down in my heart.

101
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:50,872
- Hit me.
- <i>She's a clerk typist,</i>

102
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,279
a civilian,
with the air force.

103
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,718
Our eyes met and it was as though
we'd known each other all our lives.

104
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,721
Except that you're
one life up on her.

105
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,815
Half-hour later,
there I am,

106
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:06,658
Dr. Henry Blake
walking down the Ginza...

107
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,027
holding hands with
that beautiful kid,

108
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:13,262
capillaries wide open wanting to yell,
"I'm in love" to everybody in sight.

109
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:16,794
Secure in the knowledge that very few
Japanese correspond with your wife.

110
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,807
<i>[Mclntyre]</i>
<i>Oops.</i>

111
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,343
- You said the magic word.
- It's an ordinary word.

112
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,208
Something found
around the house every day.

113
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,114
Hey, what... what am I gonna
do about Lorraine?

114
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,479
Henry, what is there to do?

115
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:35,820
You've flung your fling.
You spent a week in the rumble seat
of the time machine.

116
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:40,454
Now it's back to Dr. And Mrs.
Henry Blake regret to announce
their forthcoming anniversary.

117
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,021
It's not that simple.

118
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,364
I mean, you guys
aren't reading me.

119
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,767
I've got the big "L,"

120
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:52,069
L-U-V...
the real thing.

121
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:55,133
Hawkeye pegged it, Henry. You think
you're the first to do what you did?

122
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,338
Hold it.

123
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,348
It's happened to many
a married man, dead or alive.

124
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,748
I grant you, sometimes you can't
always tell the difference.

125
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:07,483
Henry, why don't you just file
this under "Andy Hardy Remembers
His Teeth in the Glass."

126
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,618
Okay, I think you guys
will be clued in better on Friday...

127
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:15,755
when Miss Parker comes up
for the weekend from Tokyo.

128
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:18,392
Gloryosky, Henry.

129
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:21,197
It will all be
on the up-and-up, of course.

130
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,204
Well, of course.

131
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,673
I mean, she'll have her own tent
and I'll be in mine.

132
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:30,439
Right. Now, if you'll excuse us,
we'll start digging the tunnel.

What is it, Radar?

- Huh?
- You wanted to see me?

142

Yes. Captain Cosgrove confirmed

That's lovely.
Anything else?

Uh...

150
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,429
There'll beJapanese lanterns
in the officers' club...

151
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:58,160
and the cook is making a special
cocktail dip out of powdered eggs,

152
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:00,168

305
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,622
She your girl?

306
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,624
No, I'm married to my work.

307
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,819
I'm too cheap to buy a ring.

308
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:51,330
- Well, here you go.
I'll see you tomorrow, I'm sure.
- I'm sure.

309
00:20:51,398 --> 00:20:54,765
- Breakfast is at 5:00.
- But isn't it still dark then?

310
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,098
It helps if you can't see it.

311
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:04,004
- Speaking of seeing...
- The light is right on the... Here.

312
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,838
- Thanks.
- No charge.

313
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:13,181
- You're tall.
- My folks planned it that way.

314
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,552
They saved up their money,
so no matter what happened,
I'd be tall when I was 21.

315
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:20,525
- I love tall men.
- Me too. I've always been
crazy about Abe Lincoln.

316
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,721
Hawkeye, the first time we met,

317
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,731
you knew it too.

318
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,257
- It was in the air.
- That was Henry. He was sweating a lot.

319
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:34,930
Nancy.

320
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:45,512
In the first place, I wanna thank you
from the bottom of my mouth.

321
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:49,214
Secondly, we're not
in the parking lot at the prom.

322
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:53,316
And lastly, one of us loves
Henry Blake, and I think it's me.

323
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:56,055
It was nice meeting you
and your pom-poms.

324
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:07,538
- Hey, buddy.
- Beat it. I haven't got
a dime for a cup of coffee.

325
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,137
Henry's Nancy just gave me a good night
tonsillectomy you wouldn't believe.

326
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:17,547
- You're kidding.
- And Henry thinks
he's found the real thing.

327
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:22,554
Holy cow. Radar just got Henry
out of postop to talk
to his wife on the telephone.

328
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:26,284
Come on, before
he blows his marriage.

329
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,693
- Was she good?
- My lips may never walk again.

330
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:36,225
Don't send me your stubs. I can't
balance your checkbook in a war zone.

331
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:38,827
Lorraine? Lorraine?

332
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:42,705
Lorraine, please don't talk to me
and the kids at the same time.

333
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:45,404
<i>L</i>... <i>What</i>...
<i>Andrew?</i>

334
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:49,471
Andrew, I don't care if your sister did
put an ice cube down your underwear.

335
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:53,212
Girls will do that.
You mustn't hit her with the dog.

336
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:59,991
Now look, Andrew. Until I get home,
you're the man of the house.

337
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know Mommy thinks that she is,

338
00:23:03,797 --> 00:23:05,731
but you really are.

339
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,963
So behave yourself and take good care
of everybody till I get back.

340
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:12,869
Just as soon as the war
is over, son.

341
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:15,203
Okay, pal, put her on.

342
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:19,843
Lorraine, honey...
Yeah. Send me the check stubs.

343
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:22,814
I'll straighten it out.

344
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:24,816
Of course I do.

345
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,154
Good-bye, darling.

346
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,253
What do you guys want?

347
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,666
- We... We just wanted to say
good night, Henry.
- Right, yeah.

348
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:47,001
Listen. Remember I said I found
a girl who was the real thing?

349
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:51,337
Well, she's $68 overdrawn.

350
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,517
- Good night.
- Good night, Henry.

351
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,849
Good night.

352
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:06,857
- Radar?
- Sir?

353
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:10,384
- My wife was very grateful
that I called her.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

354
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,431
Makes me wish I had.

355
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:16,060
Well, I figured since you didn't
have time to answer her letters...

356
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:20,538
Good night, Radar.
See you at breakfast.

357
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,438
Yes, sir. 5:00 sharp.

358
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,206
Let's give ourselves a treat, huh?
5:15?

359
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,112
Yes, sir.

360
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:39,887
Now, you will call me,
won't you, Henry?

361
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,893
Oh, yeah, sure.

362
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:45,795
I don't get to Tokyo that often,
but you'll be the first.

363
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,799
Good-bye, Henry.

364
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,833
Rah, rah.

365
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,352
That's life, huh?

366
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,356
I couldn't wait till she got here.
Now I'm glad she's gone.

367
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,585
Just as well, Henry.

368
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,926
If you'd sucked your gut in
one more time, your belly button
would've fallen out your back.
