1
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,892
I was born on April 20, 1925,
in Peine...

2
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:00,305
Germany, Europe...

3
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:03,308
the fourth child
of Azriel Perel...

4
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:06,868
a shoe store owner,
and his wife Rebecca.

5
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,944
I was born on April 20, 1925,
in Peine, Germany, Europe.

6
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:30,178
You won't believe it...

7
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:32,656
but I remember my circumcision.

8
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:44,132
My God,
God of our forefathers...

9
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,763
let this child live...

10
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,868
...this child...

11
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,372
Solomon.

12
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:58,541
Solomon, son of Azriel.

13
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:02,519
I remember that my birthday
fell on the same day...

14
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:06,354
as that of the future Chancellor
of the Thousand-year Reich...

15
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,824
Adolf Hitler.

16
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:52,230
Maybe Father wanted to
shave his beard.

17
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:54,269
Not now he won't.

18
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:20,860
Come on, catch me!

19
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:51,322
Solly!

20
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:53,262
Hurry up!

21
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,099
What are you doing?

22
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:03,102
Come on out!
Is it your Bar Mitzvah or mine?

23
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,477
You have to cut wood.

24
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:09,446
Sure, right away.

25
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:13,178
Bertha was always jealous of me.
She wanted to be the boy.

26
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:16,946
Had I known,
I'd have leaped out of the tub.

27
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,721
Can't we close up?

28
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,024
In half an hour.

29
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:36,436
Out with the Jews!

30
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,300
Kathy!

31
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,310
What are you doing here?

32
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:13,538
And you?

33
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,712
I brought the beer.

34
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:22,845
They broke
all your windows, right?

35
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:26,049
Get me some clothes
from my house.

36
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,457
My father's forbidden
my going to your house.

37
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,190
Wait!

38
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,652
Here you are.

39
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,022
Isaac was looking for you.

40
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:28,476
My father was born in Lodz...

41
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:29,714
so we moved there.

42
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:34,782
He got us Polish passports
and said that now we were Poles.

43
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:44,932
I knew the Germans had
killed Bertha...

44
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:48,530
but I didn't want
to go to Lodz.

45
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,313
Police!

46
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,186
We lived above a movie house.
The cashier, Miss Basia...

47
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:13,561
made me her pet...

48
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:15,759
and let me in for nothing.

49
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,096
I wanted to be an actor...

50
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,660
like Clark Gable
or Eugeniusz Bodo.

51
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:35,244
I wondered whether her hump
was flesh or bone.

52
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,247
When the war broke out,
I was glad.

53
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:14,649
Now the police would forget
about the bicycle incident...

54
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,688
and Father wouldn't get angry.

55
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,586
Don't open the door!

56
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,718
Please don't!

57
00:11:58,597 --> 00:11:59,723
David!

58
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:09,231
Have you deserted?

59
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:14,034
I never even found my unit.

60
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:22,046
It's incredible. They didn't
even give me a rifle.

61
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:25,552
The can't spare any
for distribution to Jews.

62
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,592
The Germans will win.

63
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,117
In a day or two,
they'll march in here.

64
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:33,357
It's your fault!

65
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,423
You said
we'd be safe here...

66
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,128
and that they wouldn't dare
start this war.

67
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,639
Yes, yes, It's my fault.

68
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,373
The boys must leave.

69
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:50,040
Solly must not fall
into their hands.

70
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,479
Where should they go?

71
00:12:53,552 --> 00:12:55,076
East.

72
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,212
As far east as possible.

73
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,189
They could have asked us.

74
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,491
It is written...

75
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:09,898
that a son never leaves
his parents in difficult times.

76
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,936
It is also written...

77
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:15,495
that the son
must obey his parents.

78
00:13:15,574 --> 00:13:19,408
And it is also your duty
to watch over your brother.

79
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,641
And you?

80
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,584
Couldn't we all go?

81
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:30,450
Nothing will happen to us.

82
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:36,490
Stop it!

83
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:39,257
They can't lug
all these jars.

84
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:23,802
Come. We'll be back soon.

85
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:49,160
Isaac, my foot hurts!

86
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,429
Come on, Solek.
There's a war on!

87
00:14:57,976 --> 00:14:58,943
Solek!

88
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,683
Wait for me!

89
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:20,293
Wait for me
on the other side.

90
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,098
Don't be afraid!

91
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:42,049
Where are you going?
The Bolsheviks are there!

92
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,384
The Russian army!

93
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:46,924
They invaded us
from the other side.

94
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:50,257
They made a deal!
Hitler has a pact with Stalin...

95
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:52,990
and gave him the East!
There's no more Poland!

96
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,293
It's the Soviet occupation.

97
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:03,304
Wait!
I'm coming back with you!

98
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,833
The Poles preferred Hitler
and wanted to turn back.

99
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,176
The Jews swam
toward the Bolsheviks.

100
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:10,672
And l...

101
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,076
Help!

102
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,619
Take it easy!

103
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,384
I was saved
by a Russian soldier.

104
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:52,287
The next day I sat on the bank,
waiting for my brother, Isaac.

105
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:55,349
But he never came.

106
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:57,759
They took me to the orphanage
in Grodno...

107
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,627
where I stayed two years...

108
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,463
with other Jews,
Poles, and Russians.

109
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:08,097
I was turned into a Soviet
patriot and a good Communist.

110
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:50,981
Young pioneers...

111
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,348
for the struggle in the name
of Lenin and Stalin...

112
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,818
be prepared!

113
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:59,118
Always prepared!

114
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,784
Long live comrade Stalin!

115
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:05,829
Long live...

116
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:07,489
the Soviet Republic!

117
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,539
From your father?

118
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:28,074
Yes. He's a prisoner
of the Russians.

119
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:29,950
Solomon Perel!

120
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:40,293
Thanks to the Hitler-Stalin
pact, I could receive letters.

121
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:41,696
My father wrote...

122
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,496
"Dear Son,
We are happy to know...

123
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:47,163
"that you are well, safe,
and are studying.

124
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:50,298
"We are OK.
We had to move to the ghetto...

125
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,036
"as do all the Jews.

126
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,475
"Don't worry about us.

127
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:56,844
"Thinking of you
gives us courage.

128
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,315
"Are you eating Kosher?
Always remember who you are!

129
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:03,582
"Do you observe the Sabbath?
Greetings to your teachers.

130
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:06,180
"Your mother sends her love.
Your Father.

131
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,282
"P.S. Our address...

132
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,883
"is Knupfergasse 7."

133
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:17,260
Your origins?

134
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,668
You left them out.

135
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,237
Jewish.

136
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:26,038
ldiot! We know that.

137
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:28,409
We're asking about
your class origins.

138
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,712
You didn't indicate
your class origins!

139
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:33,876
He doesn't understand.

140
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:40,684
My father had a store.

141
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,651
Bourgeois.

142
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:49,394
Solly's making an effort.
He's doing a lot of social work.

143
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,061
I'll prove
I'm a worthy Komsomol.

144
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:58,135
You've been accepted into
the Komsomol? Where's the badge?

145
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:00,271
There aren't any more.

146
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:06,973
Stalinist puppet!

147
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,215
You know what would happen
if I reported that?

148
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:39,645
Bastards!

149
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:30,760
The landowners and the bourgeois
keep the people in ignorance.

150
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:36,105
They encourage
religious superstitions...

151
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:42,035
and with the help of the popes,
priests, and rabbis...

152
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:46,049
they smother
all revolutionary instinct.

153
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:52,020
That's why we call religion
the opium of the masses.

154
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,273
It's not true!

155
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:14,740
That God doesn't exist!

156
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,374
He exists!

157
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,184
Where is he?

158
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,185
He exists, that's all.

159
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,413
In Heaven.

160
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:27,652
Does anyone else
share this opinion?

161
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,397
You're alone in your beliefs.

162
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,467
Filthy Poles!

163
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:48,735
What is this?

164
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:50,747
A conspiracy?

165
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:52,874
The discussion is pointless.

166
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,680
Science has proven...

167
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:57,414
Dirty Jew!
You're the one who crucified...

168
00:22:57,488 --> 00:22:58,512
Jesus!

169
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:03,227
You're an obscurantist
and a racist!

170
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,319
Polish fascist!

171
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:06,863
Lords...

172
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:08,523
aristocrats!

173
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,830
Do you know what Lenin
said about anti-Semitism?

174
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:15,896
That It's a crime
as bad as counterrevolution!

175
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:19,466
My brother was killed
by the Germans!

176
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,307
When I return to Poland...

177
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,143
Hell will freeze over first.

178
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:26,547
Poland will never
be Poland again.

179
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:28,141
That's a lie!

180
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,880
All right.

181
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:33,219
Let's try a little experiment.

182
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:38,092
You all know how to pray,
don't you? Then pray...

183
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:42,223
Lord, as a sign
of Your existence...

184
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,200
send us candies from Heaven.

185
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:49,065
What are you waiting for?
Go on.

186
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:54,369
Lord...

187
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,077
send us candies.

188
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,247
Louder! I heard nothing, and
your God is way up in Heaven!

189
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:27,802
Now, repeat after me.

190
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:32,612
Beloved comrade Stalin,
send us candies!

191
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,909
Communism is beautiful.

192
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:32,466
War!

193
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:35,072
Hitler has attacked!

194
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:25,829
You're crazy! Dirty slut!

195
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:27,762
I'm requisitioning the truck!

196
00:26:27,832 --> 00:26:30,596
Climb in, boys, quick!

197
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:31,896
This is sabotage!

198
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:35,427
You are sabotaging the orders
of the Soviet leaders!

199
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:36,837
Your leaders...

200
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:43,472
have flown the coop!

201
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:45,743
Do what you want!

202
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:05,789
On your feet!

203
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:08,691
Hands up!

204
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,187
Jews, step forward!
You don't understand?

205
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:42,062
Jews, out front!
Get a move on!

206
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,601
Faster! Move it!

207
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:45,636
Papers!

208
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,598
No! Armenian!

209
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:49,867
I am Armenian!

210
00:28:55,813 --> 00:29:00,580
I'm not a Jew!
Check it, please!

211
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:03,020
Check it?

212
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:06,386
Good idea!

213
00:29:07,024 --> 00:29:08,514
We'll check it.

214
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,596
Armenian?!

215
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:20,535
And what's that? You wanted
to bugger us with your cock?

216
00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:21,696
Take him away.

217
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:24,604
What'll they do to us?

218
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,644
They'll shoot Jews
and political prisoners.

219
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:31,478
I know. I was already captured.
The others are put in camps.

220
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:33,176
It's shameful to spread panic.

221
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,258
Destroy the papers!

222
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:53,493
I'd rather die...

223
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:55,163
than renounce the Party.

224
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,433
Then die...

225
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:57,872
for the homeland.

226
00:29:58,743 --> 00:29:59,710
For Stalin!

227
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:06,980
Let's see those.

228
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:12,521
Hands behind your heads!

229
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:45,448
Faster! Faster!

230
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:56,464
Where are you taking me?

231
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:22,055
They were stolen.

232
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,258
You speak German well.

233
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:26,228
I am German.

234
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:27,286
Why are you here?

235
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:28,854
Maybe he's a Jew?

236
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:36,670
I am German...
a pure-bred German.

237
00:31:37,374 --> 00:31:39,035
I'm German, from Grodno.

238
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:41,100
I was in
a Bolshevik orphanage.

239
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:42,475
I can smell Jews.

240
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:46,810
I'm a German from Grodno.

241
00:31:46,884 --> 00:31:49,148
The Bolsheviks forced me
into the orphanage.

242
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,451
Schultz! Carry on!
I'll take him to the sergeant.

243
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:09,369
Amazing to find such a diamond
among such filth.

244
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,668
Who asked you?

245
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:14,336
You made your report, now go!
Nothing to do?

246
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:16,003
This is not a Jewish school!

247
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:21,807
Name?

248
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:24,753
Peters...Josef Peters.

249
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:28,189
Stop, idiot!
Your parents are German?

250
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:32,492
We say, "Jawohl!"

251
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,967
And where are your parents?

252
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:43,504
He said he was
in an orphanage.

253
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:45,735
The Bolsheviks
must have killed them.

254
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,538
Don't cry, son.

255
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,575
They'll pay for this.

256
00:32:54,285 --> 00:32:55,513
Enough!

257
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:58,919
Your papers, my boy!

258
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:01,617
You can do nothing here
without papers.

259
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:03,455
You're insane!

260
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,655
Send the kid over!

261
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,890
Josef, damn it!

262
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:09,364
Your name is Josef!

263
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,163
Go on!

264
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,967
You do speak Russian.

265
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:22,104
I clearly said
Jews should step forward.

266
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:23,544
This one's playing dumb.

267
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:28,082
Captain, I know Russian.

268
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:31,849
Tell them he's not a Jew,
and if they touch him...

269
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:32,911
they'll regret it.

270
00:33:34,858 --> 00:33:39,192
He says he's not a Jew, and if
you touch him, you'll regret it.

271
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,593
Watch it, you Russian scum!

272
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,430
Take this Jew away!

273
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:46,764
Both of them!

274
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:49,863
I said he's not a Jew!
He's Stalin's son.

275
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:58,141
Well? Translate!

276
00:33:58,215 --> 00:33:59,876
He said that...

277
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,679
that he's Stalin's son.

278
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:21,799
What does it say?

279
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:24,999
"Dzhugashvili, Yakov..."

280
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,541
"son of Yosef."

281
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:29,546
Stay here!

282
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:33,414
Don't move!
You, move along!

283
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,179
Faster!

284
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:38,050
Where'd you learn Russian?

285
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:40,488
In school. In Grodno.

286
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:43,091
I was a Komsomol.

287
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,596
Now you're obeying
these fascist pigs?

288
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:49,597
What did he want?

289
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:53,462
I didn't understand.
It's a dialect...

290
00:34:53,537 --> 00:34:56,233
Tell him to watch
where he spits.

291
00:34:56,306 --> 00:34:59,434
lf he insults a German,
he'll get himself shot.

292
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:03,869
Tell him I have orders to
drive them to the Kommandatur.

293
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:17,118
Come on, kid!
You're our good luck charm!

294
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:21,290
You witnessed the Reich's
victory. The son of Stalin!

295
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,463
Do you know what that means?

296
00:35:24,535 --> 00:35:25,695
Smile!

297
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:56,363
He speaks perfect Russian.

298
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:58,162
He'll be useful.

299
00:35:58,235 --> 00:36:00,226
You must be hungry.

300
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,039
Perel!

301
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:13,877
He's a Jew!

302
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,054
He says there's a Jew here.

303
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:25,095
Where?

304
00:36:25,963 --> 00:36:28,397
He says I'm the Jew.

305
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,961
He says It's me!

306
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:34,697
You know him?

307
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,374
So what does he want?

308
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:39,409
I don't know.

309
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:41,902
Ask him.

310
00:36:48,452 --> 00:36:51,512
Why, Zenek? Why do that?

311
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:54,148
What? Aren't you a Jew?

312
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,215
And I'm a Polish fascist?

313
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:57,682
Correct?

314
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:00,560
A fine answer!

315
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:01,598
Stop!

316
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:05,821
You're still alive, Jupp?

317
00:39:28,478 --> 00:39:30,503
The Captain wants to see you.

318
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:34,813
Wait for his questions.
Answer only yes or no.

319
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,910
Stand at attention.
He insists on that.

320
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:40,218
And don't turn around
when he paces.

321
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,348
And not a word...

322
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:45,259
about the Communist school.
He can't stand the Bolsheviks.

323
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,490
Careful! You can't fool him.

324
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:50,260
One look,
and he knows everything!

325
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,928
Peters,
to the company commander!

326
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:02,645
I'll be damned!

327
00:40:05,782 --> 00:40:07,272
Age?

328
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:08,318
Sixteen.

329
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:11,387
My men are fond of you.

330
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,186
Please.

331
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:18,819
No, Captain.

332
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:20,522
Who was your father?

333
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,092
My father...

334
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:30,369
My father was a businessman.

335
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,104
And...you have nobody left?
No relatives?

336
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:40,876
Would you stay
as our interpreter?

337
00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:45,185
I want to serve
our German homeland.

338
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:47,246
You'll have many chances.

339
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:49,792
The future belongs
to your generation.

340
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:53,988
You know against whom
we're fighting this war?

341
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:57,993
Against Russia?

342
00:40:59,202 --> 00:41:01,670
Against France?
Against England?

343
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:05,408
No, my boy. Against Jews.

344
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,074
It's our Jewish war,
our holy war.

345
00:41:11,148 --> 00:41:13,708
It's not a question
of "Lebensraum."

346
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:16,685
We must liberate Europe
from the Jews.

347
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:18,944
Do you understand?

348
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:22,692
Jawohl, Captain.

349
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:24,784
You can be proud...

350
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:28,259
to be taking part
in this holy war.

351
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:35,234
What will happen to them?
Will they be killed?

352
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:36,431
Who?

353
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:38,631
The Jews.

354
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:42,877
We'll see.

355
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:48,443
They'll be moved out.
To Madagascar or Siberia.

356
00:41:49,586 --> 00:41:50,644
Don't worry.

357
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:53,518
The Fuhrer will find
a solution.

358
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,739
Don't look.

359
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:17,844
No, let him look!

360
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:20,105
Look, Jupp!

361
00:42:21,017 --> 00:42:22,678
These swine killed
your German parents...

362
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:23,844
for being Germans!

363
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,788
They stole your home!
Watch them pay for it!

364
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:31,316
Look at the animals!
You must learn to hate!

365
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:47,737
That's when I first felt
how confused I was.

366
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:51,645
Who was my friend, who my enemy?
How could they be kind to me...

367
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:55,151
and at the same time
kill others so horribly?

368
00:42:56,653 --> 00:42:57,779
What set us apart?

369
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:00,049
A simple foreskin?

370
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:02,288
"I feel German pride...

371
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:05,920
"in spilling my blood
for Fuhrer and homeland."

372
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:11,560
Sounds a bit stiff.

373
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:15,264
Either lyrical or patriotic.

374
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:16,464
As you describe her,
It's patriotism.

375
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,132
You can add...

376
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,800
What do you call her?

377
00:43:20,744 --> 00:43:22,371
Yes, when you're alone with her.

378
00:43:24,014 --> 00:43:24,981
"My little pussy."

379
00:43:29,486 --> 00:43:30,714
Write...

380
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:33,488
"For you, my little pussy...

381
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:35,584
"I'd like to..."

382
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,425
"A shudder passes through me."

383
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:49,102
"Tears follow upon tears."

384
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,967
"The stern heart...

385
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:55,443
"has become soft."

386
00:43:56,713 --> 00:43:59,648
"And all I own
seems far away.

387
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:03,152
"And all I lost is real."

388
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,218
That's way over her head.

389
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,000
Aren't you tired?

390
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:34,242
Not yet. And you?

391
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:36,478
I'm going on watch duty.

392
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:42,482
The stars...

393
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:47,022
They're the same
as in Germany...

394
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:49,696
but farther away.

395
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:52,624
I was never there.

396
00:44:54,237 --> 00:44:55,670
That's true.

397
00:44:57,274 --> 00:45:00,141
But you'll get there.
I won't.

398
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,234
Why not?

399
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:03,602
I'm joking.
We'll go together.

400
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,011
We'll go to Berlin.

401
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:10,349
What did you do
before you became a soldier?

402
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:14,082
"Philosophy have I digested.

403
00:45:14,157 --> 00:45:17,786
"The whole of Law and Medicine,
Theology, alas thrown in.

404
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:21,888
"From each its secrets
I have wrested."

405
00:45:22,532 --> 00:45:24,864
"Poor fool,
with all this sweated lore.

406
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,959
"I stand no wiser than before."

407
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:29,429
Recognize it?

408
00:45:29,506 --> 00:45:30,905
Sure.

409
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:32,271
I'm an actor.

410
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:33,366
A real actor?

411
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:34,432
Naturally!

412
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:36,445
In movies, too?

413
00:45:36,513 --> 00:45:37,480
Naturally!

414
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:44,517
ls it hard
to play someone else?

415
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:46,953
It's much easier
than playing yourself.

416
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:22,024
Jupp, wait!

417
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:23,915
I won't do anything!

418
00:46:25,562 --> 00:46:26,529
Wait!

419
00:46:33,002 --> 00:46:34,469
Don't run!

420
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:55,387
You're circumcised.

421
00:46:56,693 --> 00:46:57,660
You're a Jew?

422
00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:00,024
My God...

423
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:07,061
No, please, get up.

424
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:09,437
Don't be afraid.

425
00:47:12,142 --> 00:47:13,268
Forgive me.

426
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:17,778
I had no idea.

427
00:47:19,983 --> 00:47:21,917
Everything will be fine.

428
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:25,318
I'll be like a brother,
like a friend.

429
00:47:27,657 --> 00:47:30,387
There now, calm down.

430
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,897
Don't cry anymore.
Don't be afraid.

431
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:40,833
Germans aren't all the same.
There are other Germans, too.

432
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:44,265
During that holiday,
you lived...

433
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,740
in the huts for a whole week?

434
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,506
Does that mean
that Jews don't have homes?

435
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:52,611
It symbolizes
our submission to God.

436
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:54,642
It is proof...

437
00:47:55,852 --> 00:47:57,683
of our faith in providence.

438
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:01,957
Bertha loved this holiday.

439
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:05,055
I hated Passover.

440
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:09,123
I had to eat eggs
dipped in salt water.

441
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:11,064
They made me nauseous.

442
00:48:20,543 --> 00:48:21,669
I was wondering...

443
00:48:22,779 --> 00:48:25,247
Do you still pray,
like at home?

444
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,609
Religion is the opium
of the masses.

445
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:42,622
Could I play a Jew?

446
00:48:44,968 --> 00:48:46,560
You look too stupid.

447
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:48,896
You racist!

448
00:49:05,054 --> 00:49:07,955
The Russians are still
on the other side.

449
00:49:08,024 --> 00:49:09,992
We just flushed them
out of here.

450
00:49:16,232 --> 00:49:17,790
Jupp, over here, fast!

451
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:21,061
Take the phone.

452
00:49:21,137 --> 00:49:22,570
Listen in.

453
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:25,070
Can you understand them?

454
00:49:25,141 --> 00:49:29,043
He says he screwed her
three times, and the fourth...

455
00:49:29,746 --> 00:49:30,770
And?

456
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:32,542
The other asks where she is.

457
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:33,980
So, where is she?

458
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:37,950
In Brunsk.
He says the Germans are there.

459
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:38,953
Great!

460
00:49:39,022 --> 00:49:41,217
Cut the line.

461
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:45,658
Russian shit! My shoes!

462
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:51,561
He's aiming at a German cycle...

463
00:49:52,101 --> 00:49:53,227
with two soldiers.

464
00:49:53,303 --> 00:49:56,033
He's about to burn their asses.

465
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:19,651
Stay there. I'm coming!

466
00:50:36,813 --> 00:50:38,144
My helmet...

467
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:51,420
You see,
you kissed me after all...

468
00:51:00,503 --> 00:51:02,733
Retreat to the forest!

469
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:06,365
And so I lost my only friend...
"the other kind of German."

470
00:52:06,436 --> 00:52:09,735
He left my life like Kathy,
the hunchback Basia...

471
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:14,607
lnna Moyseyevna, my father
and mother, Bertha and Isaac.

472
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:16,872
All those I'd loved.

473
00:52:16,946 --> 00:52:19,881
I won't go on.
I can't go on.

474
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:22,850
I want to be by myself,
to be among my own kind.

475
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:29,550
Comrade! Can you hear me?

476
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,751
Who is it?

477
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:34,957
Help me! I said I was
a pure-bred German...

478
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:38,262
but I'm a Komsomol from Grodno.

479
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:41,997
I'm a Jew. They'll kill me
if they find out.

480
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:43,095
Where are you?

481
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,105
The trench by the bridge,
just below the fire.

482
00:52:47,176 --> 00:52:50,145
We forgot the line!
Have you been listening long?

483
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:53,710
You killed them all.

484
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:57,377
Ullmayer, the sergeant,
Robert...

485
00:52:57,453 --> 00:52:59,387
Good work!

486
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,624
Hey, Komsomol,
can you hear me?

487
00:53:04,994 --> 00:53:07,485
At nightfall we hold our fire.

488
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:10,259
Get over to the river
and across the bridge.

489
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:14,431
There are seven of us
on a hill here.

490
00:53:16,672 --> 00:53:18,799
Take a rifle.
Do you have one?

491
00:53:20,243 --> 00:53:24,304
Hold it up so we recognize you.
We'll keep you covered.

492
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:27,249
And cut the line!
Right now!

493
00:54:04,387 --> 00:54:08,153
Jupp! Son,
you captured the enemy position.

494
00:54:10,393 --> 00:54:12,190
So, instead of deserting...

495
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:15,321
I became the hero
of the company.

496
00:54:16,332 --> 00:54:21,497
Captain, I'd rather stay
here with my comrades.

497
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:25,371
You've shown enough courage.

498
00:54:26,509 --> 00:54:29,535
Now you go to school, study.

499
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:34,947
And see the Reich, at last.

500
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:43,722
It's an excellent school.
You should be proud to go there.

501
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:46,718
When the war is over...

502
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:49,662
if you want to...

503
00:54:49,732 --> 00:54:53,600
I wrote to my wife...
We have no children...

504
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:57,528
We want to adopt you.

505
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:02,035
We have land in Pomerania.
You'll like it. At ease!

506
00:55:16,092 --> 00:55:17,286
For my wife.

507
00:55:17,827 --> 00:55:21,228
A special Party envoy
came out from the Reich...

508
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:22,821
to bring the hero
of the Reich...

509
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:25,697
future son
of Captain von Lerenau...

510
00:55:25,768 --> 00:55:28,532
aristocrat
and staunch anti-Semite...

511
00:55:28,604 --> 00:55:30,868
to the most elite
Hitler Youth School.

512
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:36,470
Good luck, Jupp! Our regards
to the Reich! Write to us!

513
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:53,857
A Hitler Youth doesn't smoke.

514
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,540
Will you survive?

515
00:56:06,475 --> 00:56:08,170
What else doesn't he do?

516
00:56:12,114 --> 00:56:16,778
As a war hero, you may at times
act like a man.

517
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:18,876
A German man.

518
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:21,556
A true German soldier!

519
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,227
Puff on mine if you like.

520
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:38,767
How handsome you are.

521
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:40,869
Do you know it?

522
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:44,446
My pure little golden boy.

523
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:47,582
Papers.

524
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:02,693
The young man's
temporary papers.

525
00:57:04,433 --> 00:57:05,900
Born April 20...

526
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:09,729
Lights out, please.

527
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:26,917
You were born the same day
as the Fuhrer.

528
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:29,782
Your hair is dark, like his.

529
00:57:31,127 --> 00:57:32,492
My darling...

530
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,497
So soft and tender.

531
00:57:43,572 --> 00:57:45,267
Touching him with my hand...

532
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:48,503
his hair, his lips...

533
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,891
My Fuhrer!

534
00:58:55,144 --> 00:58:58,079
Assembly!

535
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:06,214
Attention!

536
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:12,260
We welcome the German
of pure breed...

537
00:59:12,328 --> 00:59:14,592
Josef Peters...

538
00:59:14,663 --> 00:59:18,565
whom our troops liberated
from the Bolshevik orphanage.

539
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:21,465
As an interpreter
and as a soldier...

540
00:59:21,537 --> 00:59:25,166
he served our country
heroically.

541
00:59:25,241 --> 00:59:28,836
We are proud to welcome him
into our ranks.

542
00:59:29,678 --> 00:59:31,077
Josef...

543
00:59:31,147 --> 00:59:32,774
are you ready to swear
allegiance to our Fuhrer...

544
00:59:32,848 --> 00:59:35,874
Adolf Hitler?

545
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:38,180
I am ready.

546
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,231
I swear before God...

547
00:59:54,703 --> 00:59:56,500
...with this solemn oath...

548
00:59:57,873 --> 00:59:59,101
...to give the Fuhrer...

549
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,943
...of the German Reich
and its people...

550
01:00:04,647 --> 01:00:05,841
...Adolf Hitler...

551
01:00:07,516 --> 01:00:10,781
...the Commander-in-Chief
of the Hitler Youth...

552
01:00:12,721 --> 01:00:14,848
...total obedience...

553
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:18,217
...and, in case of any danger...

554
01:00:19,428 --> 01:00:20,395
...to be ready...

555
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,530
...to give up my life.

556
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:28,794
You can lower your arm.

557
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,934
Our new comrade will see...

558
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,671
that our Fuhrer has created
a community...

559
01:00:36,745 --> 01:00:38,804
in which all Germans
are brothers.

560
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:41,145
The world's strongest community.

561
01:00:41,217 --> 01:00:44,812
We salute our new comrade
with a triple...

562
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:55,288
Sharpen...

563
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:57,855
the long knives...

564
01:00:57,933 --> 01:01:00,902
on the pavement stone!

565
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:05,939
Sink the knives...

566
01:01:06,008 --> 01:01:08,602
into Jewish flesh and bone.

567
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:13,575
Let the blood flow freely!

568
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:15,872
You don't know it?

569
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,749
Didn't you sing it
at the front?

570
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:19,845
No.

571
01:01:19,922 --> 01:01:22,015
You'll learn.
You'll learn everything here.

572
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,727
Schwarz!

573
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:30,190
Look after Peters!

574
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:34,202
He's your roommate.
Get him a uniform.

575
01:01:38,307 --> 01:01:39,274
It's a pleasure.

576
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:41,276
Same here.

577
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:48,145
This will be much harder
than among the soldiers.

578
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,644
The smallest detail
could give me away.

579
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,814
"Sink the knives
into Jewish flesh and bone."

580
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:56,919
My flesh!

581
01:03:02,057 --> 01:03:03,183
That's for you.

582
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:16,896
I'm Herman.

583
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:20,342
Be seated!

584
01:03:27,116 --> 01:03:28,481
You're the new hero?

585
01:03:30,819 --> 01:03:31,945
Your name?

586
01:03:33,455 --> 01:03:34,479
Jupp, and you?

587
01:03:35,124 --> 01:03:36,148
Leni.

588
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:45,197
Having been at the front
is sufficient.

589
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:48,202
She's the best one here,
but she's unapproachable.

590
01:03:48,971 --> 01:03:50,836
lsn't he cute?

591
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,100
We pray before meals.

592
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:04,476
Eat correctly,
using knife and fork.

593
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:06,680
The knife in the right hand...

594
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,814
the fork in the left.

595
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:11,382
No slurping, no crumbs.

596
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:14,652
Respect our German bread.

597
01:04:15,864 --> 01:04:16,853
Enjoy the meal.

598
01:05:59,768 --> 01:06:01,099
Attention, Goethke!

599
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,733
How do you recognize...

600
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:10,505
a Jew?

601
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:14,239
How do you recognize a Jew?

602
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:15,941
Be seated.

603
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:21,145
That's quite simple.

604
01:06:22,124 --> 01:06:26,618
The composition of Jewish blood
is totally different from ours.

605
01:06:27,229 --> 01:06:31,633
The Jew has a high forehead...

606
01:06:31,633 --> 01:06:36,161
a hooked nose...

607
01:06:36,238 --> 01:06:39,071
a flat back of the head...

608
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:42,873
ears that stick out...

609
01:06:43,779 --> 01:06:47,408
and he has an ape-like walk.

610
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:52,643
His eyes are shitt...

611
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:54,348
and cunning.

612
01:06:55,624 --> 01:06:58,650
He never looks you in the eye.

613
01:06:59,294 --> 01:07:02,161
He waves his hands about...

614
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:05,358
makes exaggerated gestures...

615
01:07:05,434 --> 01:07:07,994
and he fawns before you.

616
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:12,507
But the minute
your back is turned...

617
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:14,574
he leaps at your throat!

618
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:22,115
The Nordic man...

619
01:07:22,184 --> 01:07:25,813
is the gem of this earth.

620
01:07:27,322 --> 01:07:29,654
He's the most glowing example...

621
01:07:29,725 --> 01:07:31,249
of the joy of creation.

622
01:07:33,028 --> 01:07:35,053
He is not only
the most talented...

623
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:38,759
but the most beautiful.

624
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:43,465
His hair is as light
as ripened wheat.

625
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:47,840
His eyes are blue
like the summer sky.

626
01:07:49,411 --> 01:07:52,244
His movements are harmonious.

627
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:55,681
His body is perfect.

628
01:08:01,223 --> 01:08:03,453
You can call me a gem.

629
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:05,493
Science...

630
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,357
is objective.

631
01:08:07,429 --> 01:08:08,828
Science...

632
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,499
is incorruptible.

633
01:08:13,735 --> 01:08:16,101
As I have already told you...

634
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:20,099
if you thoroughly understand
racial differences...

635
01:08:20,175 --> 01:08:24,578
no Jew will ever
be able to deceive you.

636
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:33,621
Step forward.

637
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,287
The eyes...

638
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,395
Look at his skull.

639
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,172
His forehead.

640
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:07,747
His profile.

641
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:16,283
Although his ancestors' blood,
over many generations...

642
01:10:16,358 --> 01:10:19,452
mingled with that
of other races...

643
01:10:19,528 --> 01:10:24,761
one still recognizes
his distinct Aryan traits.

644
01:10:26,368 --> 01:10:28,302
It's from this mixture...

645
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:32,238
that the East-Baltic race
evolved.

646
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:36,934
Unfortunately, you're not part
of our most noble race...

647
01:10:37,012 --> 01:10:40,311
but you are
an authentic Aryan.

648
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:46,012
A special bulletin!

649
01:11:00,268 --> 01:11:04,204
The heroic battle
of Stalingrad is over.

650
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,071
True to its oath,
with its dying breath...

651
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:10,737
the 6th Army, under
the outstanding leadership...

652
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:13,975
of Field Marshal Paulus,
fell to...

653
01:11:14,049 --> 01:11:15,778
the enemy's superior numbers.

654
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:22,689
Generals, officers, and simple
soldiers fought side by side...

655
01:11:22,757 --> 01:11:25,225
until the last bullet.

656
01:11:25,293 --> 01:11:28,524
The army's sacrifice
was not in vain.

657
01:11:28,597 --> 01:11:33,193
Our soldiers died
so that Germany may live.

658
01:12:31,927 --> 01:12:33,758
How do you whistle?

659
01:12:33,828 --> 01:12:34,795
Like this.

660
01:13:14,669 --> 01:13:16,136
How do you feel?

661
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:21,204
You don't know the Reich.
You don't understand.

662
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:25,906
We have complete freedom here.
Like our school for example.

663
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:29,974
My father is a teacher,
Hans' father is a mason.

664
01:13:30,051 --> 01:13:32,849
And Herman's father
is a baron.

665
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:35,116
There is no difference among us.

666
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:37,454
We all have
the same opportunities.

667
01:13:37,525 --> 01:13:38,992
You understand?

668
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:43,554
We are brothers, true brothers.

669
01:13:53,908 --> 01:13:55,637
I could eat them all.

670
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,837
They're made of plaster.

671
01:13:57,912 --> 01:14:01,006
You have no imagination.
I have too much.

672
01:14:01,082 --> 01:14:02,276
I can't look!

673
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:05,453
Are you there?

674
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:08,550
I can't see you.

675
01:14:14,596 --> 01:14:17,895
I must be going.
See you tomorrow.

676
01:14:27,308 --> 01:14:30,106
Leni's sweater inspired me
to pull my skin way down...

677
01:14:30,178 --> 01:14:32,874
and tie it with a thread.

678
01:14:32,947 --> 01:14:36,246
lf it stayed in place,
I'd never be recognized...

679
01:14:36,317 --> 01:14:37,944
and I could live like them.

680
01:15:03,845 --> 01:15:04,812
Come in.

681
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:11,816
My mother, Jupp.

682
01:15:14,222 --> 01:15:15,484
Let's sit down.

683
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:23,189
For you.

684
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:29,392
We couldn't accept
such a generous gift.

685
01:15:31,005 --> 01:15:33,064
I have plenty.

686
01:15:33,141 --> 01:15:36,577
Captain Lerenau's wife
sent me a package.

687
01:15:36,644 --> 01:15:38,544
We own property on Pommern.

688
01:15:38,613 --> 01:15:40,103
They want to adopt him.

689
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:42,741
Fine, but only
if we eat it together.

690
01:15:52,694 --> 01:15:53,661
Papa...

691
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:55,321
died in battle.

692
01:15:57,232 --> 01:15:59,359
Sit down, please.

693
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:12,037
I hear you have no parents?

694
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:14,914
I don't know where they are.

695
01:16:14,983 --> 01:16:16,450
Didn't you say that...

696
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,315
the Bolsheviks killed them?

697
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:20,647
Gerd told me.

698
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:26,854
Yes, the Bolsheviks
arrested them...

699
01:16:26,928 --> 01:16:29,294
then a truck ran them over.

700
01:16:31,366 --> 01:16:33,425
That's the official version.

701
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:38,606
Nice picture.

702
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:43,443
Really? That's me.

703
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:44,478
My cousin was a painter.

704
01:16:44,546 --> 01:16:47,481
He even knew the Fuhrer!
From Vienna!

705
01:16:47,549 --> 01:16:48,607
Leni resembles me, right?

706
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:51,946
Her father had dark hair,
like you.

707
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:56,255
Lord...

708
01:16:56,324 --> 01:17:00,454
forget not those
who suffer and are hungry.

709
01:17:00,528 --> 01:17:02,587
Comfort the lonely...

710
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:06,061
and give your blessing...

711
01:17:06,134 --> 01:17:09,592
to the orphans. Amen.

712
01:17:19,647 --> 01:17:21,171
Eat, Jupp.

713
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:24,210
Your tears will
make the ham saltier.

714
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:29,888
It's nothing.

715
01:17:31,059 --> 01:17:32,185
It's just...

716
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:38,358
It's been so long
since I've been...

717
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:40,967
in a nice home.

718
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:36,621
Are you hurt?

719
01:18:36,691 --> 01:18:38,352
No. It's nothing.

720
01:18:38,426 --> 01:18:39,358
You're lucky.

721
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:42,260
Tomorrow the doctor pays us
his annual visit.

722
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:43,797
Leave me alone!

723
01:18:45,466 --> 01:18:46,592
ls something wrong?

724
01:18:47,935 --> 01:18:50,733
That queer
grabbed my balls again.

725
01:18:51,906 --> 01:18:53,806
We have to undress?

726
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,103
Of course.

727
01:19:01,816 --> 01:19:02,783
My tooth!

728
01:19:04,952 --> 01:19:07,921
It hurts so much,
I can't talk.

729
01:19:09,524 --> 01:19:11,014
I need a dentist.

730
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:48,088
Strange,
it looks quite healthy.

731
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:38,579
Tying the foreskin
was not successful.

732
01:20:38,646 --> 01:20:40,705
Pus had formed
under the thread.

733
01:20:40,782 --> 01:20:43,478
After the thread was removed,
the skin slipped back.

734
01:20:44,085 --> 01:20:48,613
I couldn't escape my own body.
I still had to hide.

735
01:20:48,689 --> 01:20:52,216
lntimacy was impossible.
I couldn't love Leni.

736
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:03,603
You pricked me!

737
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:06,434
The golden insignia!
I didn't know!

738
01:21:15,216 --> 01:21:17,013
We could do it.

739
01:21:21,289 --> 01:21:25,157
I want to, Jupp. You understand?
I really want to.

740
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:33,263
You're much too young.

741
01:21:34,268 --> 01:21:35,792
You're really crazy!

742
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:44,070
I have to leave.

743
01:21:49,517 --> 01:21:50,541
I'll walk you.

744
01:21:51,219 --> 01:21:52,311
lf you like.

745
01:22:02,263 --> 01:22:04,060
You're really crazy, Jupp!

746
01:22:04,131 --> 01:22:05,189
Catch me!

747
01:23:03,491 --> 01:23:05,891
I didn't know there was
a Jewish cemetery here.

748
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:10,390
lf I ever catch a Jew...

749
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,396
Then what?

750
01:23:11,465 --> 01:23:13,456
I'll cut his throat.

751
01:23:14,068 --> 01:23:15,365
Why?

752
01:23:15,436 --> 01:23:16,528
Because he's a Jew.

753
01:23:18,506 --> 01:23:20,167
Captain von Lerenau said...

754
01:23:21,442 --> 01:23:24,411
Hitler said
we needn't kill them.

755
01:23:24,478 --> 01:23:25,809
We'll just send them
to Madagascar.

756
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:28,341
Lice must be crushed!

757
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:29,815
The Fuhrer knows best!

758
01:23:29,884 --> 01:23:31,146
The Fuhrer didn't
lose his father...

759
01:23:31,218 --> 01:23:33,277
in the war against
those vermin.

760
01:23:38,426 --> 01:23:39,723
You hit me...

761
01:23:41,262 --> 01:23:42,456
to defend the Jews!

762
01:23:43,998 --> 01:23:45,124
Leni, forgive me.

763
01:23:47,234 --> 01:23:51,500
Nobody hits a German woman!

764
01:23:51,572 --> 01:23:54,268
Nobody! Ever!

765
01:23:54,342 --> 01:23:56,833
Especially not a limp-dick
like you!

766
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,617
Bertha!

767
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:50,797
Father!

768
01:24:55,269 --> 01:24:56,293
Mamma...

769
01:24:57,071 --> 01:24:58,038
I'm back.

770
01:25:17,091 --> 01:25:18,058
Isaac?

771
01:25:28,469 --> 01:25:29,993
Hide. They're coming!

772
01:25:36,744 --> 01:25:40,111
He's Jewish, too. That's why he
covers it with his hands.

773
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:44,677
Look for us in the Lodz ghetto.
Knupfergasse 7!

774
01:25:46,654 --> 01:25:48,588
Don't give me away!

775
01:26:22,223 --> 01:26:23,850
What happened?

776
01:26:23,924 --> 01:26:27,087
You screamed.
You probably had a bad dream.

777
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:31,930
What words did I scream?

778
01:26:31,999 --> 01:26:34,433
I didn't understand...Russian.

779
01:26:40,407 --> 01:26:43,934
I won't visit
the Captain's wife.

780
01:26:45,045 --> 01:26:48,845
I'll go to Lodz...
to Litzmannstadt...

781
01:26:48,916 --> 01:26:51,350
Why Litzmannstadt?

782
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,588
There are many Germans there.

783
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:58,487
I might find...

784
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,027
some of my relatives.

785
01:27:24,118 --> 01:27:25,107
Stop!

786
01:27:25,886 --> 01:27:27,979
To get across town...

787
01:27:28,055 --> 01:27:30,523
take the trolley
through the ghetto.

788
01:27:30,591 --> 01:27:31,649
Over there.

789
01:27:36,497 --> 01:27:38,590
The ghetto's off-limits,
even to Germans.

790
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,865
Sit down. You're in the way.

791
01:29:34,548 --> 01:29:35,515
Mother...

792
01:29:36,951 --> 01:29:38,885
The windows must remain shut.

793
01:29:39,753 --> 01:29:41,277
I want some fresh air.

794
01:29:41,355 --> 01:29:42,379
Fresh air?

795
01:29:44,692 --> 01:29:45,750
In the ghetto?

796
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:45,970
Had it been my mother?

797
01:31:46,046 --> 01:31:50,449
I rode through the ghetto often,
but I never saw her again.

798
01:31:52,986 --> 01:31:56,387
Good! Next, forward!

799
01:31:57,991 --> 01:32:00,084
Better than that!

800
01:32:01,695 --> 01:32:03,492
Fine. Again!

801
01:32:04,264 --> 01:32:05,231
And now.

802
01:32:11,105 --> 01:32:12,037
Bad, Peters!

803
01:32:12,106 --> 01:32:13,073
Try again!

804
01:32:19,046 --> 01:32:20,673
Next, forward!

805
01:32:37,464 --> 01:32:38,795
ls Leni home?

806
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:40,633
No.

807
01:32:41,702 --> 01:32:45,866
She's rarely here. She makes
packages for the front.

808
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:49,504
Excuse me. I'll be leaving.

809
01:32:49,576 --> 01:32:52,170
No. Come in, please.

810
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,350
Sit down.
I'm nearly finished.

811
01:33:12,132 --> 01:33:13,064
May I help?

812
01:33:13,133 --> 01:33:15,567
No, thanks. I've finished.

813
01:33:33,453 --> 01:33:36,422
In case you hadn't heard...
Leni is pregnant.

814
01:33:41,061 --> 01:33:43,529
She read that
every German woman...

815
01:33:43,597 --> 01:33:45,792
must give a child
to the Fuhrer...

816
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,801
and she felt it her duty.

817
01:33:53,173 --> 01:33:55,334
She's been avoiding me lately.

818
01:33:55,409 --> 01:33:56,501
It hasn't been easy.

819
01:33:58,545 --> 01:34:00,274
Leni is fond of you, Jupp.

820
01:34:01,281 --> 01:34:02,441
Obviously.

821
01:34:05,586 --> 01:34:06,610
Goethke...

822
01:34:10,691 --> 01:34:16,357
Your teacher told her the father
had to be a Nordic type.

823
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:20,764
There were many ltalians
in my husband's family...

824
01:34:23,003 --> 01:34:24,265
and Leni was afraid
the child...

825
01:34:24,338 --> 01:34:27,774
might not be
racially pure enough...

826
01:34:28,909 --> 01:34:31,639
to be accepted
in the "Lebensborn."

827
01:34:31,712 --> 01:34:32,701
She'll give it up?

828
01:34:32,779 --> 01:34:35,077
She's offering it
to the Fuhrer.

829
01:34:35,148 --> 01:34:36,945
And you're letting her?

830
01:34:38,752 --> 01:34:41,186
What can I do?

831
01:34:42,823 --> 01:34:45,018
I no longer understand
my daughter.

832
01:34:46,393 --> 01:34:47,382
I love Leni.

833
01:34:47,461 --> 01:34:48,758
So do l.

834
01:34:48,829 --> 01:34:50,353
She's all I have.

835
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:53,257
Same here.

836
01:34:55,168 --> 01:34:57,068
At least, I thought so.

837
01:35:02,175 --> 01:35:03,642
It's Gerd, isn't it?

838
01:35:21,728 --> 01:35:25,562
Leni said you wouldn't go
beyond a certain point.

839
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:31,298
I told her
it was a sign of respect...

840
01:35:32,873 --> 01:35:33,999
but maybe...

841
01:35:40,814 --> 01:35:42,543
You think I didn't want to?

842
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:48,315
I'm not made of stone.
I have feelings, too!

843
01:36:01,802 --> 01:36:03,326
Josef, tell me.

844
01:36:08,942 --> 01:36:10,807
Are you really German?

845
01:36:14,614 --> 01:36:15,603
No.

846
01:36:21,855 --> 01:36:23,015
I'm a Jew.

847
01:36:33,033 --> 01:36:37,299
I knew it!
From the beginning.

848
01:36:42,109 --> 01:36:45,044
I swear I won't betray you.

849
01:36:51,451 --> 01:36:54,978
I had to tell someone.

850
01:36:55,622 --> 01:36:57,214
I couldn't stand it anymore.

851
01:37:15,942 --> 01:37:18,001
You mustn't tell Leni.

852
01:37:19,446 --> 01:37:21,073
Children nowadays...

853
01:37:22,449 --> 01:37:24,576
they're so different.

854
01:37:29,823 --> 01:37:34,157
You scum! Get up!
You call yourself a friend?

855
01:37:36,897 --> 01:37:38,057
What's the matter?

856
01:37:42,669 --> 01:37:44,000
I didn't want to.

857
01:37:53,013 --> 01:37:54,674
Where have you been?

858
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:57,314
Bring your papers
to the police.

859
01:37:58,151 --> 01:37:59,641
The police? Why?

860
01:37:59,719 --> 01:38:01,243
Something isn't clear to them.

861
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:08,155
I'll come along. lf we hurry,
we can do it before class.

862
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:28,748
Name?

863
01:38:33,253 --> 01:38:34,413
Which Peters?

864
01:38:34,488 --> 01:38:38,015
My parents came to Grodno
from Latvia.

865
01:38:38,091 --> 01:38:39,422
I knew a Peters...

866
01:38:39,493 --> 01:38:41,393
but from Danzig.

867
01:38:43,363 --> 01:38:45,194
We're missing many papers
from there.

868
01:38:58,645 --> 01:38:59,612
Serviceman...

869
01:39:00,447 --> 01:39:04,713
Your Certificate
of German Purity?

870
01:39:08,088 --> 01:39:09,612
It's still in Grodno.

871
01:39:09,689 --> 01:39:12,021
We must request it...

872
01:39:12,092 --> 01:39:13,821
to avoid
any unpleasant problems.

873
01:39:15,929 --> 01:39:18,625
lf the Russians take Grodno,
you'll have problems.

874
01:39:20,567 --> 01:39:21,761
You mean it could...

875
01:39:23,036 --> 01:39:26,096
Our General Staff
has a brilliant plan.

876
01:39:27,574 --> 01:39:31,408
We will pretend to retreat
on all fronts...

877
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:35,980
and then,
when all seems lost...

878
01:39:36,049 --> 01:39:38,643
the Fuhrer gives the signal...

879
01:39:38,718 --> 01:39:42,779
and with our miracle weapon,
we will annihilate the enemy!

880
01:39:49,963 --> 01:39:52,056
I saw the Fuhrer last week.

881
01:39:52,899 --> 01:39:55,561
He was confident or our victory.

882
01:40:01,107 --> 01:40:03,905
I'll write to Grodno today.

883
01:40:04,778 --> 01:40:08,874
After the victory, we'll need
10,000 trained young men...

884
01:40:09,616 --> 01:40:12,084
and you are one of them!

885
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,045
Only a miracle
could save me now.

886
01:41:32,899 --> 01:41:35,060
They'll kill us all!

887
01:41:35,702 --> 01:41:37,693
The Americans take prisoners...

888
01:41:37,771 --> 01:41:39,238
but the Russians shoot everyone.

889
01:41:42,108 --> 01:41:44,440
You defeatist! Shoot!

890
01:41:58,091 --> 01:41:59,058
Fire!

891
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:07,824
For the Fuhrer!

892
01:42:10,704 --> 01:42:15,437
What's wrong, Jupp?
Shoot!

893
01:42:16,776 --> 01:42:17,834
He's been hit!

894
01:42:27,954 --> 01:42:30,013
Shoot, Jupp!

895
01:42:34,594 --> 01:42:36,152
Jupp, shoot!

896
01:42:37,197 --> 01:42:38,459
We're surrounded!

897
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:52,307
Where are you going?

898
01:42:52,378 --> 01:42:53,538
You're insane!

899
01:42:55,014 --> 01:42:56,276
Stop!

900
01:43:27,213 --> 01:43:28,942
I'm on your side!

901
01:43:39,225 --> 01:43:40,487
Where did you learn Russian?

902
01:43:41,628 --> 01:43:44,756
At school, in Grodno...
I was a Komsomol.

903
01:43:46,666 --> 01:43:49,533
Traitor! Spy!

904
01:43:52,839 --> 01:43:56,434
I can explain.
I was hiding. I'm a Jew!

905
01:43:59,078 --> 01:44:00,045
I'm a Jew!

906
01:44:00,113 --> 01:44:01,080
A Jew?

907
01:44:08,521 --> 01:44:12,184
lf you were a Jew,
you'd look like this.

908
01:44:14,194 --> 01:44:15,491
Look!

909
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:20,329
Corpses, heads...
These children, see them?

910
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,494
And this!
Look at these heads!

911
01:44:25,205 --> 01:44:27,173
Hung, shot!

912
01:44:36,049 --> 01:44:37,175
I didn't know.

913
01:44:39,819 --> 01:44:42,287
I thought...Madagascar...

914
01:44:43,423 --> 01:44:44,321
I didn't know.

915
01:44:45,024 --> 01:44:48,084
Another one who didn't know.

916
01:44:48,161 --> 01:44:49,321
Give me that, Arkady!

917
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,367
Let's go.

918
01:45:12,585 --> 01:45:16,988
He's yours.
Do what you want.

919
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:19,354
Shoot him like a dog.

920
01:45:26,766 --> 01:45:27,733
Solek!

921
01:47:22,382 --> 01:47:26,216
My parents and all
their neighbors were killed...

922
01:47:26,285 --> 01:47:28,879
two weeks after
my leave in Lodz.

923
01:47:28,955 --> 01:47:31,947
Isaac stayed until
the liquidation of the ghetto...

924
01:47:32,025 --> 01:47:34,823
then he was taken
to a concentration camp.

925
01:47:34,894 --> 01:47:36,691
While I was shouting
"Heil Hitler"...

926
01:47:36,763 --> 01:47:38,424
and courting Leni...

927
01:47:38,498 --> 01:47:40,432
my family was already dead.

928
01:47:42,435 --> 01:47:43,402
Solek...

929
01:47:46,672 --> 01:47:48,572
We're going over
to the Americans.

930
01:47:49,776 --> 01:47:52,267
We'll get some
concentration camp clothes.

931
01:47:52,979 --> 01:47:55,345
That won't be difficult.

932
01:47:57,283 --> 01:47:58,250
You understand?

933
01:48:00,219 --> 01:48:03,052
Don't tell your story
to anyone.

934
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:05,423
Nobody will believe you.

935
01:48:07,627 --> 01:48:08,787
Lift up your head.

936
01:48:10,863 --> 01:48:12,592
We're starting a new life.

937
01:48:14,434 --> 01:48:15,401
Help me.

938
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,869
From that moment on,
I decided to be only a Jew.

939
01:48:57,944 --> 01:49:01,107
Leaving Europe,
I emigrated to Palestine.

940
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:06,083
And when I had sons, I barely
hesitated to circumcise them.

941
01:49:08,955 --> 01:49:19,991
How sweet it is to sit.

942
01:49:21,334 --> 01:49:34,941
Surrounded by your brothers.

943
01:49:36,115 --> 01:49:47,049
How sweet it is to sit.

944
01:49:47,727 --> 01:49:55,930
Surrounded by your brothers.
