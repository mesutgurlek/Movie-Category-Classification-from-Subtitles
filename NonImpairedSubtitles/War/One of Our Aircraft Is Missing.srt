<i>No sign of any other aircraft about.</i>

<i>Still no sign of B for Bertie. Over.</i>

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,473
Hello, Group.

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,994
Yes, they're all back now,
except B for Bertie.

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,357
<i>From this and other operations,</i>
<i>one of our aircraft is missing.</i>

9
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,074
Pilot speaking, pilot speaking.

10
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,116
Testing intercoms.

- Thank you, sir.

17
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,474
Group, sir, about tonight's operations.

18
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,069
Reynolds speaking. Yes. Right.

19
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,436
The target is Stuttgart,
the Mercedes-Benz works.

20
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,878
<i>Will all operational crews</i>
<i>report to briefing at 1 4:30. 1 4:30.</i>

- Thank you.

22
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,278
- One for you, Tom. Nice Halifax postmark.
- Some letter.

23
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,078
Halifax again.

24
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,118
- Oh, it's from my fiancée.
- Both of them? Have you got two?

25
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,156
The other's from Dad.

26
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,153
- Surely not the future Mrs Earnshaw?
- Whittaker & Whittaker, her dad's firm.

27
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,152
- Second best in Yorkshire.
- We know whose the best are.

28
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,038
- My dad's.
- Earnshaw & Son.

29
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,790
Mm. l'm dying to see those two
noble animals in the same meadow.

30
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,632
You won't have to wait long.

31
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,313
Here comes Corbett,
singing and dancing as usual.

32
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,276
(Airman) Billiards after lunch?

33
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,874
- You coming on this party tonight?
- l'm on ops.

34
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,996
Hazel says don't forget tomorrow night.

35
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,753
(Both) Hazel Mason,
home and forces programme.

36
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,832
9:40. George, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

37
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,992
- Tomorrow? Packing.
- No, you're listening to my wife.

38
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,230
Home and Forces Programme.
Pack tonight.

39
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,276
l'm flying tonight.

40
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,318
- We didn't know you were on ops.
- l saw the group captain.

41
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,279
As it's my last night, he agreed to let me go.
Sorry to have gone over your head.

42
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,477
That's all right. Glad to have you with us.
Eh, fellas?

43
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,118
We're honoured, Sir George.

44
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,794
l suppose Hopkins has been
told about this switch.

45
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,758
- l suppose so.
- l'd like to see Hopkins' face, Frank.

46
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,957
Poor old Hopkins.
(American accent) Well, the son of a gun.

47
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,598
- Hopkins.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,353
Sorry, but you won't be wanted tonight.

49
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,431
- l see, sir.
- Bad luck, old man.

50
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,834
The son of a gun.

51
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,233
l don't believe it. Hey, he's pulling my leg.

52
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,993
lf you're not going,
can l have your silk stockings?

53
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,594
Oh, l suppose so.

54
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,194
What's this, camouflage net?

55
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,236
That's quality if it's a pair.

56
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,437
They keep you warm as toast.
lf my girl ever finds out l lent...

57
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,512
Tell her Bob Ashley wore them.
She'll be pleased as punch.

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,273
<i>Boy, l wish you could have</i>
<i>seen that run of Welsh's,</i>

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,272
<i>a run worthy of</i>
<i>the great Bob Ashley himself.</i>

60
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,874
<i>lt had all the earmarks of an Ashley special.</i>

61
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,838
<i>So it's a free kick against the Allied Forces.</i>

62
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,070
Free kick. Now, look out for Welsh.

63
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,673
Not Welsh.

64
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,594
Not Welsh? Hear that, Len?
l'd like to see anybody else take it.

65
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,113
Course it'll be Welsh.

66
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,713
Compton will take the kick.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,237
<i>This is a tense moment. The ball is</i>
<i>on the spot. Welsh is going to kick.</i>

68
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,878
What did l say?

69
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,552
<i>Welsh is going to take the kick.</i>

70
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,675
Come on, Welsh!

71
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,036
<i>Welsh has kicked. No, he hasn't.</i>
<i>He's jumped over the ball.</i>

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,112
<i>Compton's taking the kick.</i>
<i>Compton's the man.</i>

73
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,714
<i>Goal! Well shot, Compton!</i>

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,756
<i>Well, that was a surprise.</i>

75
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,398
Not to me.

76
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,269
Cope with this indicator. lt's stuck again.

77
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,316
- l'll fix it.
- How's Bertie?

78
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,994
Perfect, sir. New coat, full stomach, a gent.

79
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,230
Fine. Bring the car back about four.

80
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,036
Did they fix that oil pressure, Jimmy?

81
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,031
Yes, it's OK now.

82
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,038
- Who's this bloke?
- Fan of yours, wants your autograph.

83
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,270
- Saw you in some play.
- That's right.

84
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,636
l saw you in the School For Scandal.
You played Joseph Surface.

85
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,278
Got a pencil?

86
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,510
- Afraid not.
- l'll do it for you tomorrow.

87
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
- Thanks.
- lt was Charles Surface.

88
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,549
Fairpath calling T for Tommy, T for Tommy.

89
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,076
lt's now 21 :35, 21 :35. You may take off.

90
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,274
Checking intercoms. Bob, are you there?

91
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,312
Sergeant Ashley, sir, receiving you all right.

92
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,589
Blasted beehive gets smaller every trip.

93
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,873
What are you grumbling about, Sir George?
You've got a carriage to yourself.

94
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,077
Fairpath calling.
Q for Queenie, Q for Queenie.

95
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,835
21 :37, 21 :37. You may take off now.

96
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,591
Check your watches, chaps.

97
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,832
ln 50 seconds, it'll be 21 :40.

98
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,878
ln...45 seconds.

99
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,237
ln...40 seconds.

100
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,994
Fairpath calling B for Bertie, B for Bertie.

101
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,230
lt is now 21 :40, 21 :40.

102
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,912
Off you go.

103
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,958
Geoff, OK to go forward.

104
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,792
OK, Skipper.

105
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,352
Stuttgart, here we come.

106
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,109
You know, l played in Stuttgart
with my club in er...1938.

107
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,714
1938...l was playing in New York.

108
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,076
- What's Stuttgart like?
- Oh, like all those continental towns.

109
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,674
Played Saturday, Sunday,
Monday on the train.

110
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,398
That was Stuttgart. Well, well.

111
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,359
- Nice girls in Stuttgart, Skipper.
- Well, one anyway.

112
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,670
What do you know about
the girls in Stuttgart?

113
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,478
l know a nurse from Stuttgart.

114
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,278
That's funny. Mine was a nurse.

115
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,918
<i>Was her name Liesel?</i>

116
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,150
No, Else. What was your nurse like?

117
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,390
Oh, she was a big blonde job.

118
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,997
Couldn't half cook too.
She worked for a doctor in Gerrards Cross.

119
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,153
Used to sing that song,
er...l Kiss Your Little Hand Madame.

120
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,713
That's right and, of course,
she used to sing it in German, you know?

121
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,116
<i>She was always singing it, l suppose, cos</i>
<i>she wasn't allowed to sing it in Germany.</i>

122
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,156
<i>The composer was a Jew, l believe.</i>

123
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,277
What was your nurse like, Skipper?

124
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,669
Else? She was blonde too.

125
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,194
- <i>Was she a good cook?</i>
- She was good at everything.

126
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,793
My next nurse wasn't so good.

127
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,235
You seem to specialise in nurses, Skipper.

128
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,073
Well, l did then. l was only two, you see.

129
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,717
- Had you there.
- l'd seen snaps of her in my father's album.

130
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,756
He was on the reparations commission.

131
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,991
Stuttgart was capital of Württemberg,
once a kingdom on its own.

132
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,108
That's right. The biggest paper there
is called the Württemberger Zeitung.

133
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,430
Liesel used to read it to me out loud.

134
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,676
Over Dutch coast.

135
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,508
Geoff, George, look out for fighters.

136
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,035
lf my course is right,
we'll be getting some flak soon.

137
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,398
(Anti-aircraft fire)

138
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,789
Your course seems all right, Frank.

139
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,795
- Cologne's just come off the air.
- l don't blame her.

140
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,830
Railroad ahead.

141
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,635
Got it. Main line to Cologne.

142
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,951
l've travelled on that line
and l was going to Stuttgart.

143
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,438
Mannheim on our right.

144
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,238
Tom, give them some leaflets.

145
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,878
Okey-doke.

146
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,593
Give them the Ashley special.

147
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,429
(Booming)

148
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,998
lt's good for you.

149
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,074
Hold the course, John, over River Neckar.

150
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,874
John, do you see what l see?

151
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,436
Big fire, dead ahead.

152
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,952
We're in the wrong end, John.

153
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,792
(Anti-aircraft fire)

154
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,914
- Can l have a smack at the searchlight?
- OK, give it a squirt or two.

155
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,838
(Machine-gun fire)

156
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,434
Can l have a go too, Skipper?
No favouritism.

157
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,078
<i>OK.</i>

158
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,711
(Machine-gun fire)

159
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,192
Now who's in the wrong end?

160
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,958
What's that fire?

161
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,070
Bet that's Queenie on the job.

162
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,191
And that'll be Tommy.

163
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,596
All right, do another circuit.

164
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,751
Bomb doors.

165
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,076
Bomb doors open.

166
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,789
- OK, let's go down.
- Going down.

167
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,191
4,000.

168
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,633
3,600.

169
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,472
Level out.

170
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,236
Steady.

171
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,276
Left, left.

172
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,918
Steady.

173
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,355
All bombs gone.

174
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,754
Shall l transmit, sir, mission completed?

175
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,069
Crikey!

176
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,912
How about it, Tom?

177
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,309
Starboard engine's packed up.
Port's all right.

178
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,232
Hello, Bob. lntercoms working?

179
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,669
Yes, sir, radio's dead though.

180
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,354
George, everything organised?

181
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,750
- <i>You may get your hands full.</i>
- All right, Skipper.

182
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,035
We'll sort 'em out, won't we, George?

183
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,519
How about it, Bob?

184
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,275
Completely cheese, sir, all tubes blown.

185
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,233
- How about cut out the corners, Frank?
- All set. Shortest route over Mainz.

186
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,878
Alter course to 301 , Johnny.

187
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,077
Bob, destroy your code signals.

188
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,116
l have, sir. They taste filthy.

189
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,718
Speed still dropping, only 90 now.

190
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,394
l'll try a steep dive. Hang on, everybody.

191
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,077
lt's no use, chaps.
We'll have to stooge home on one engine.

192
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,311
At this rate, she may stall any minute.

193
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,994
- Shall l get out and push?
- <i>Where are we, Frank?</i>

194
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,674
Over Holland. Amersfoot.
Can you see a railroad?

195
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,030
l'm not sure. How about you, Tom?

196
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,319
Yes, l think so.

197
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,960
That's the main line
from Amersfoot to Hilversum.

198
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,349
Blast! That's both engines packed up now.

199
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,630
(Engine splutters)

200
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,516
We'll have to jump for it, boys.

201
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,352
- Geoff. George.
- <i>(Both) Sir.</i>

202
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,351
- Frank. Bob. Tom.
- <i>OK.</i>

203
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,238
- <i>l'm here.</i>
- Stand by to abandon aircraft.

204
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,632
Shall we chance it together or go solo?

205
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,472
- Together.
- <i>How?</i>

206
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,358
Bail out along the railroad,
Skipper's last to leave.

207
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,274
lf we all follow the railroad northwest,
we're bound to find each other.

208
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,834
Tom, jump.

209
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,795
Frank, jump.

210
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,155
Geoff, jump.

211
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,438
George, jump.

212
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,115
Bob, jump.

213
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,116
(Engine splutters)

214
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,036
(Engine picks up)

215
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,232
(Birdsong)

216
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,157
- (George) What can you see?
- The Zuider Zee.

217
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,992
Anything else?

218
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,638
Windmills.

219
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,631
Any soldiers?

220
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,877
- No.
- What's the country like? Can you see far?

221
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,319
Yes, miles. Very flat.

222
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,278
What did you expect,
the mountains of Mourne?

223
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,836
No sign of him, then?

224
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,831
The Zuider Zee's no good to us.

225
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,638
How far is it to the North Sea?

226
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,870
- About 38 miles.
- That's not so bad.

227
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,033
- lt's 38 miles too far in this make-up.
- Clothes are the first thing to organise.

228
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,429
- Then there's Bob.
- lt's too bad about Bob.

229
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,318
- l'd rather it'd been John or Frank.
- Oh, would you?

230
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,550
- No offence.
- Anyone got a cigarette?

231
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,998
l haven't. You have lived abroad, Skipper,
and they reckon Frank's a first-class actor.

232
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,479
Sorry, last one.

233
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,473
A football pro is used to travelling with
his team. Bob'll get lost on his own.

234
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,869
Let's face it. He is lost.

235
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,436
We want to watch things like that.

236
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,431
And we'd better keep down too.

237
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,476
Bob might turn up here.

238
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,233
Well, he's three hours overdue.
Got a match?

239
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,390
We've wasted enough time already.

240
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,756
John, you command in the air.
You should command on the ground.

241
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,434
Why should anyone command?
Let's all have a say.

242
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,114
- That won't work.
- l take John's view.

243
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,156
Very well. What do you suggest?

244
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,149
Well...the first thing
we've got to do is to find Bob, obviously.

245
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,992
We can't let him down.

246
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,709
And then... Well, then
we make a plan of campaign.

247
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,789
Decide what to do and what not to do.

248
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,433
- Don't you agree, Tom?
- Hm.

249
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,308
Then er...well, act accordingly.

250
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,799
Very explicit.

251
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,598
Clear as mud.

252
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,989
- Here, come on down.
- l must say, Frank...

253
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,629
Now, listen, l've been lost dozens of times.

254
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,314
Sometimes alone,
sometimes with a regiment,

255
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,837
so l know this much, either we separate
here and now and it's each man for himself,

256
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,196
or we stick together
and somebody must command.

257
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,038
- Who's for separating?
- What are you for yourself?

258
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,872
l'll put another question.

259
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,474
Do we surrender
or do we try and get back home?

260
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,350
- Well, what do you think?
- Frank, you're navigator. Where are we?

261
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,754
l'd say somewhere...somewhere here.

262
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,554
There's Hilversum to the west,
Amsterdam and the Zuider Zee up there.

263
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,757
Now, we want to aim at a spot
somewhere south of Haarlem,

264
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,914
between Zandvoort and Katwijk...
but there's several main roads

265
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,558
and it's swarming with people.

266
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,950
- What's ''polder'' mean?
- Land that's reclaimed. Dykes and dams.

267
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,830
lt's nearly all polder country
south of Haarlem. Tulip fields.

268
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,072
Pity about that, l like a nice tulip.
What are we going to do about our clothes?

269
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,469
We've got to get into civvies somehow.

270
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,471
Well, what's George doing?

271
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,830
- Going swimming in the canal.
- How do you know there is one?

272
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,710
There's always a canal in Holland. The next
best thing to civilian clothes is to have none.

273
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,553
l'll be a swimming Dutchman
and spy out the land.

274
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,154
- Suppose you meet a Dutchman.
- l'll use gestures.

275
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,549
- Suppose it's a girl.
- Can you speak Dutch?

276
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,993
- No.
- Well, l can.

277
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,753
- Well?
- Well enough. Diplomat's Dutch.

278
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,956
l think you're going to be
the swimming Dutchman, my lad.

279
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,634
Shh. Somebody coming, l think.

280
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,912
Vicky! Vicky!

281
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,752
(Pig squeals)

282
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,398
Vicky! Vicky!

283
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,233
(Speak Dutch)

284
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,872
Vicky! Vicky!

285
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,678
That dog spots us, we're jiggered.

286
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,228
(Girl) Willem! Willem!

287
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,629
(Speaks Dutch)

288
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,029
(All) Vicky!

289
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,876
- (Barks)
- Lie down. Get!

290
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,951
Shut up. Shut up.

291
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,350
- (Continues barking)
- Vicky! Vicky!

292
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,590
Willem! Willem!

293
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,875
Maartie! Vicky!

294
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,791
Vicky! Vicky!

295
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,950
- (All) Vicky!
- (Barking)

296
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,389
(Speaks Dutch)

297
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,910
(Speaks haltingly)
Niet...afraid...zijn. Niet rennen weg.

298
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,394
lk vrienden. Engels.

299
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,190
RAF. R-A-F.

300
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,794
R-A-F. R-A-F.

301
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,476
Royal Air Force!

302
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,836
Ja. Royal Air Force. Ben jij een vriend?

303
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,990
Allebjij vrienden.

304
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,833
- He says they're friends.
- Let's go and talk to them.

305
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,478
l hope they don't scram.

306
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,391
(Speaks Dutch)

307
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,516
He asked if we've come to invade Holland.

308
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,352
(Laughs) What with?

309
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,318
Hello.

310
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,230
Hello, young fella.
We jumped out of our aeroplane.

311
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,038
Bailed out.

312
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,669
One, two, three, four...

313
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,073
five, six allez.

314
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,559
Six disparu.

315
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,949
- That's French.
- Well?

316
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,032
Johnny, over to you, over.

317
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:26,434
(Speaks haltingly) Er... Verloren...lost,
een cameraad, hier ergens.

318
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,238
Heb je hem niet gezien?

319
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,758
Hoe... Your names?

320
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,831
Willem, Maartie.

321
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,070
- Jannie.
- Hendrik.

322
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,718
Jan.

323
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,358
Tom.

324
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,793
Geoff.

325
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,189
Frank. George.

326
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,910
(Speaks Dutch)

327
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,869
- Ja. lk begrijp.
- What's this safety pin gag?

328
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,315
lt's a sign against Germans and quislings.

329
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,154
A safety pin means keep together.
Keep your mouth shut.

330
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,994
(Speaks Dutch)

331
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,834
There's someone at the farm
who speaks English. Her name is Els...

332
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,878
Els...Els Meertens. Els Meertens.

333
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,518
Els Meertens.

334
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,194
- Zij is schooljuffrouw.
- She's a schoolmarm.

335
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,952
Sounds a useful old bird.

336
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,632
ls dit invasie van Holland?

337
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,078
No, young fellow, we have not
come to invade Holland...yet.

338
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,116
l know that much Dutch already.

339
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,948
(Excited chattering)

340
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,109
Kind of a debate going on in there, l think.

341
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,278
(Speaks excitedly in Dutch)

342
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,269
Miss Meertens.

343
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,750
l'll never put a ferret down
a rabbit hole again, l know that.

344
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,389
lt's quite stuffy in here,
as if it might be a trap.

345
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,391
l'm not so sure it isn't.

346
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,116
Must be 20 of them, talking for half an hour.
What about? That's what l'd like to know.

347
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,509
Fetching Germans.
l wouldn't put it past 'em.

348
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,909
- l would.
- You would? Why?

349
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,549
l've been watching the road
ever since we got here.

350
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,835
No one's left the house.

351
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,672
Shh.

352
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,516
(Chattering stops)

353
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,078
Sorry, gentlemen, to have kept you waiting.

354
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,914
l am Els Meertens,
schoolteacher from Emmen.

355
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,919
How do you do, Miss Meertens?
My name is John Glyn Haggard and these...

356
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,754
The identities of all five of you are
of the greatest importance to us

357
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,071
but if you don't mind,
we prefer to check them for ourselves.

358
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,073
Excuse me, Miss Meertens, how do you
propose to find out if we don't tell you?

359
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,789
l see you wear an identity bracelet.

360
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,150
l'm sure you can tell me your friend's name.

361
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,798
Well? Can you or can't you?

362
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,198
- Of course. l've known him a long time.
- l didn't ask how long you had known him.

363
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,998
What is his name?

364
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,833
He's Mr Tom Earnshaw,
our second pilot, of course.

365
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,996
Right.

366
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,309
- You jumped out of your aeroplane, why?
- We didn't want to crash with it.

367
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,152
- Where did it crash?
- lt didn't.

368
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,677
- The engine picked up after we bailed out.
- l don't know very much about aeroplanes.

369
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,877
But that means you can't prove
your aircraft has crashed.

370
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,678
lt might have gone on for miles.

371
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,877
Would it surprise you to know
that so far as is known

372
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,838
no aircraft has crashed in West Holland
during the night?

373
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,989
l suppose Bertie
could have reached the sea.

374
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,231
- What do you say, John?
- Don't ask me. Your witness.

375
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,629
- Where are your parachutes?
- We buried them.

376
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,234
- All five?
- Five are all we know about.

377
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,471
- What do you mean by that?
- There were six in my crew.

378
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,710
You are captain?

379
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,199
Yes.

380
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,556
- Where is the sixth man?
- l don't know. We never found him.

381
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,428
l see. And where did you
bury your parachutes?

382
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,114
- Look here, l've had enough of...
- You don't know?

383
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,192
Of course l know.
Along the railroad where we landed.

384
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,832
Can any of you prove beyond reasonable
doubt that you are what you say you are?

385
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,070
l'll be jiggered. l've never heard such a thing.

386
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,594
- But our uniforms...
- Prove nothing.

387
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,592
- Why not?
- Anybody could get a uniform.

388
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,708
lf some people were anxious to find out how
we were to behave towards English airmen,

389
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,109
wouldn't that be the simplest way?

390
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,637
You mean you think we've come here
to get you to give yourselves away?

391
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,269
But we're English. We wouldn't
do a thing like that, would we, Frank?

392
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,316
You're not so sure about the others?

393
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,233
What are you trying to make me say?
Of course l'm sure.

394
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,630
What is the name of this gentleman?

395
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,836
- Go on, George.
- This is Frank Shelley. He's an actor.

396
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,876
And his wife is to broadcast tonight.

397
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,554
(All) 9:40, home and forces programme.

398
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,790
Frank, contrary to mess regulations,

399
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,872
l saw you tearing a piece out of the Times.
You got it on you?

400
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,758
l think that's the sort of proof
Miss Meertens wants.

401
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,592
Here you are.

402
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,070
''Broadcasting, home and forces
programme, Sunday 9:40...''

403
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,709
That's tonight.
''Hazel Mason...'' That's my wife.

404
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,554
There's the date
and there's the date on the newspaper.

405
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,070
Yes, this is yesterday's Times.

406
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,116
Your witness.

407
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,112
Does that satisfy you, Miss Meertens?

408
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,952
lt will do, l think.

409
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,190
l'm going to show it to the others.

410
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,874
You're not the only one
that had their doubts.

411
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,435
Not the only one?

412
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,557
No, there's nothing to stop you
sending for the Nazis.

413
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,870
l thought airmen had
better eyesight than that.

414
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,712
- What a girl.
- As you say.

415
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,156
- She shot you down in flames.
- What did she mean about our eyesight?

416
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,357
- Something we missed in this room.
- Let's find it.

417
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,557
- Orange blossom.
- What's orange blossom got do with it?

418
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,189
That's their Oranje altar, Orange altar,
to honour Queen Wilhemina.

419
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,633
(Geoff) But why Orange?

420
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,110
(Tom) William of Orange,
the House of Orange, shows they're loyal.

421
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,998
There should be a picture of the queen too.

422
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,236
There is.

423
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,312
Quite foxy. That Els Meertens, what a girl.

424
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,473
- We heard you the first time.
- Gentlemen, won't you come in?

425
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,512
Thank you.

426
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,194
Pieter Sluys, your host, gentlemen.

427
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,069
(Speaks Dutch)

428
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,836
Come on, John.

429
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,357
(Clears throat and speaks Dutch haltingly)

430
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,638
(People laugh softly)

431
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,110
(People laugh good-humouredly)

432
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,710
l always thought speeches
came at the end of a meal.

433
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,598
Wouldn't mind a little bit
of that ham anyway.

434
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,070
(Speak Dutch)

435
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,197
- (Els) Won't you sit down, please?
- Thank you.

436
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,992
This is very good of you
but aren't you short of food?

437
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,197
Sometimes but don't worry,
we have enough for our friends.

438
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,034
(Speaks Dutch)

439
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,510
He says, ''Don't worry, eat him.
He was a quisling pig.''

440
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,992
(Speaks Dutch)

441
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,071
- Thank you.
- Erg lekker.

442
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,553
Thank you.

443
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,310
Gesundheit.

444
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,878
Very nice.

445
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,874
We are worried about
your comrade who is lost.

446
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,758
So are we, miss.
Bob's brains are in his feet.

447
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,718
- ln his feet?
- Bob's a football player. A very good one.

448
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,153
But not very bright.

449
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,754
Still it's a pity his brains are not in his head.

450
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,832
lf he's found, the Germans
are going to look for you five.

451
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,754
Burying the parachutes was a mistake.
Freshly-dug earth will be examined.

452
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,354
- Can't we send someone to dig them up?
- We have.

453
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,238
And we will hide them,
this time in a safer place.

454
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,312
You know, young lady,
you've got your head screwed on.

455
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,152
Thank you.

456
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,196
The main thing is your escape.

457
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,794
- Any ideas?
- You agree that we can escape?

458
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,791
Others have done it. Why not you?

459
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,438
First we must get to the sea.

460
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,476
The sea is 58 kilometres away

461
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,633
and every village has its German post
and every road is patrolled.

462
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,632
- First we must get you to church.
- Why church?

463
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,269
Our church is ten kilometres west of here.

464
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,989
Ten kilometres nearer the North Sea.
You must go at once.

465
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,514
Excuse me, Miss Meertens,
what is your church?

466
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,750
We are Catholics.

467
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,839
l'm chapel.

468
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,959
So am l.

469
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,439
What is chapel?

470
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,114
- lndependent Methodist.
- Baptist.

471
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,760
Those are your English Reform churches?

472
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,398
That's it.

473
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,918
(Els) But it's our only plan.

474
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,309
lf this gets back to Halifax,
l shall never hear the last of it.

475
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,238
We will dress you in Dutch clothes.
Nobody will know.

476
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,276
(Tom) You don't know chapel folk.

477
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,750
But surely your escape
is the most important thing.

478
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,716
End justifies the means, Tom.

479
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,237
That's settled. Would it be safer to travel
at night? We'd be at the coast in three days.

480
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,393
By our plan, you will be at the coast tonight.
Jo will be waiting for you.

481
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,879
Jo? Who's Jo?

482
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,474
Jo de Vries, the wife of Hendrik de Vries.

483
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,312
Oh? Who's Hendrik de Vries?

484
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,473
Hendrik de Vries was killed by the British
in the mass air attacks on Haarlem.

485
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,155
Since then his wife hates the British
more than anything in the world.

486
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,630
A very good choice for a hostess.
What is this, a conundrum?

487
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,474
- l never heard that we bombed Haarlem.
- The Germans want us to believe it.

488
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,869
So Jo de Vries obliges them.

489
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,714
They like her because
they believe she hates the British.

490
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,951
That is what she wants,
so everyone is happy.

491
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,598
Oh, l see, a bit of camouflage.

492
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,231
Yes. We have our own ways
of managing things. Did you hear our motto?

493
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,198
(Speaks Dutch)

494
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,599
No?

495
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,913
lt means the sea's a common enemy and
against a common enemy one must unite.

496
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,353
Do you think we Hollanders

497
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,513
who threw the sea out of our country
will let the Germans have it?

498
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,511
Better the sea.

499
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,114
- (Speaks Dutch)
- Can you all ride a bicycle?

500
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,798
Well, l'm not much of a hand
at a bike myself. l never was.

501
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,792
We will find a way
but first we must find you all clothes.

502
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,031
Better keep our uniforms on,
gives us a chance if we're caught.

503
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,429
(Els) You can wear
your disguises over them.

504
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,990
lf we're going to be pushing off,
l would like more ham, Mother.

505
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,991
Ham, natuurlijk.

506
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,959
Talking of ham, Frank, this is your big
chance. What disguise will you wear?

507
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,591
You're going to see a series of perfect
Dutch character sketches, real little cameos

508
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,194
but er...what do we do for boots?

509
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,191
Klompen.

510
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,271
- Klompen?
- Clogs.

511
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,072
Ah, clogs.

512
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,156
(Giggles)

513
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,389
(Whispering)

514
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,674
l should like to see you walk up
Halifax High Street in a pair of these, Tom.

515
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,673
The old Yorkshire saying,
''From clogs to clogs in three generations.''

516
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,474
l never hoped to co-star with the great
Francis Shelley in a Dutch epic.

517
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,317
Now, George, you're doing quite well, really,
quite well, but...co-star? Really.

518
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,030
l haven't been to church since my wedding.

519
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,714
- You must have acted in church scenes.
- l did once.

520
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,554
- lt was a spy story and we all got shot.
- That can happen here too.

521
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,268
(Man reads in German)

00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,036
(Bicycle bells ring)

523
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,636
- How am l doing?
- Quite well.

524
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,511
For a beginner.

525
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,076
(Engine roars)

526
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,038
Noisy beggars, aren't they?

527
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,914
l wonder why he's in such
a tearing hurry for on a Sunday morning.

528
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,399
Probably going on leave.

529
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,356
(Bicycle bells ring)

530
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,716
(Singing hymn)

531
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,039
Anything wrong?

532
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,076
Germans found one of your parachutes.

533
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,469
But you dug them up.
l thought they were safe.

534
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,710
They are. Very safe.

535
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,756
Then it must be another one.

536
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,518
George.

537
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,717
The Jerries have found
another parachute. lt must be Bob's.

538
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,156
- Found Bob's parachute.
- Bob's parachute's found.

539
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,390
That means Bob's safe.

540
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,029
- Not so good for us.
- lt's us the armoured cars are looking for.

541
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,237
Els says they're searching villages
in the neighbourhood.

542
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,073
So long as they don't find
our parachutes, we're safe.

543
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,754
- Where are they hidden?
- Where are they hidden?

544
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,398
Where are they hidden?

545
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,029
She says that they're quite safe
and they're with us in here.

He is a traitor, paid by the Nazis.

to fraternise with the soldiers at the post

The Wilhelmus...our anthem.

624
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,195
lt comes from the post, from the Nazis.

625
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,191
(Anthem continues)

626
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,870
- What is it, the radio?
- Sounds more like a gramophone to me.

627
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,474
(Shouting in German)

628
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,869
(Jet van Dieren) lt is a gramophone!

629
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,633
(Shouting in German continues)

630
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,996
(Jet) Father, isn't it strange?

631
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,470
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

632
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,471
Perhaps it's not so strange.

633
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,079
l don't understand.

634
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,310
(Van Dieren laughs)

635
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,949
Yes, but l do. Your German friends
at the post asked you to send them

636
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,190
some gramophone records, didn't they?

637
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,829
And you chose my son for the honour
of carrying them, didn't you?

638
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,832
And you gave him a quarter
for doing it, didn't you?

639
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,908
Ah. My son... Well, he changed
all your records for ours

640
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,594
and he chose
some good ones too, trust him.

641
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,274
All records of our national anthem.

642
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,759
(Chuckles)

643
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,593
All different labels, foxtrots, tangos,

644
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,638
all pasted on so the Germans
wouldn't know what they were.

645
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,996
Oh, your friends will like you now,
won't they, quisling?

646
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,197
(National anthem plays
and shouting in German)

647
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,514
(Record slips, shouting in German)

648
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,556
(All) De Jong!

649
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,314
They won't think it's me. Why should they?

650
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,755
Why shouldn't they?
lf l was a German, l'd say,

651
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,513
''De Jong sent records.
He didn't bring them himself.

652
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,832
''They turned out to be the Dutch anthem.
Very funny joke. Let's look for de Jong.''

653
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,674
And there they go, looking,
with fixed bayonets.

654
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,836
Your move, mah jong.

655
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,913
- They'll believe me if l tell the truth.
- You'll be shot before you can prove it.

656
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,629
- Shot? They can't shoot me.
- Can and will.

657
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,840
Well, it really doesn't matter. Either
we shoot you now, or they shoot you later.

658
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,037
Shot? l won't be shot!

659
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,433
Father...help me! Tell me what to do! They'll
be after me if they don't find me at home.

660
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,275
Evidently you know your friends. You don't
think they'll believe you if you tell the truth.

661
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,669
They believe everyone wants to kill them.

662
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,877
They will shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

663
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,114
You are a servant of God!
You can't let them kill me!

664
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,320
You expect God to help you escape but l
think you were meant to fall into our hands.

665
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,230
(Man reads in German)

666
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,829
(Shouting in Dutch)

667
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,390
(Rhythmic clapping)

668
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,036
(Both speak Dutch at once)

669
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,071
<i>Achtung! Achtung!</i>

670
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,116
(Announcement in German)

671
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,197
- What's he say?
- What's Jerry say?

672
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,239
''The authorities of occupation have
to the number 200 of the crowd limited.

673
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,629
''50 must the football field at once leave.''

674
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,510
A fine cheek, ordering other people about.
What will the people do, Mr Burgomaster?

675
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,876
- What would you do in your own country?
- Tell 'em to go to hell.

676
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,155
- That would cause trouble.
- lt would that.

677
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,118
- Many people might be killed or injured.
- On both sides.

678
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,990
ln Holland, we've found a new system.
lf 50 are ordered to go, we all go.

679
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,832
Come along.

680
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,157
- That's playing their game.
- You don't understand Germans.

681
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,994
They have orderly minds.
lf they say 50, they mean 50.

682
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,479
<i>Achtung! Achtung!</i>

683
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,710
(Announcement in German)

684
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,114
''As you were, it is equally forbidden
that everybody should leave.

685
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,751
''Cancel the previous order
and continue to enjoy the game, please.''

686
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,596
Jerry seems a bit flustered.

687
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,756
Now we get on with the football.

688
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,239
(Whistle)

689
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,072
(Whistle and applause)

690
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,195
There you are, you see? Dead easy.

691
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,478
Bob Ashley.

692
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,515
There's Bob!

693
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,629
- lt is Bob!
- Well, l'll be jiggered.

694
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,436
Hurray! What's he Dutch for hurray?

695
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,829
- Hurrah.
- (All) Hurrah!

696
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,234
(Man reads hesitatingly in German)

697
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,430
(Low chattering)

698
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,794
You strolled around
with your hands in your pockets

699
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,030
speaking English
and pushing men in canals.

700
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,669
- They shouldn't have got in a flap.
- You left your parachute in a canal.

701
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,309
lt was time to get cracking.
l came back later but l couldn't find it.

702
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,356
- The Germans had it by then.
- Did they?

703
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,194
l don't understand how you could
walk along without Geoff spotting you.

704
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,239
- l don't either. Perhaps he was asleep.
- (Geoff) l certainly wasn't.

705
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,470
Did you see a train about 6:30?

706
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,074
Oh, yes, sir, it overtook me. l hid.

707
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,310
Overtook you?

708
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,520
You were walking the wrong way, my lad,
walking into Germany instead of England.

709
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,909
- Then you met a shepherd.
- Whose dog bit you.

710
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,879
Then they took me to the village
where the schoolteacher spoke English.

711
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,714
- Schoolteacher? What was she like?
- OK. That's where l had me breakfast.

712
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,553
And then they passed you along
by barge and ox cart...

713
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,198
- Bicycle.
- And what have you.

714
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,158
..until you find yourself
on the way to a football match.

715
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,151
And they said, ''Good gracious''.

716
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:35,074
They told me a truck would take me
after the game to some man called Joe...

717
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,233
Not Joe, Jo. lt's a woman, not a man,
otherwise you're all right.

718
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,629
Her name is Jo de Vries.

719
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,278
Half a minute.

720
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,470
(Sniffs)

721
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,313
- l smell the sea.
- The North Sea.

722

(Distant bugle)

723
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,798
- Hear that?
- German.

724
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,872
- How do you know?
- Heard 'em often enough in the last war.

725
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,831
(Distant bugle)

726
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,034
Hope Mrs de Vries
has her weather eye open.

727

(Shouts in German)

(Officer shouts in German)

733

Said tomorrow's dinner would be
held up if he didn't let us get through.

734
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,918
- Would that be Mrs de Vries?
- Suppose so.

735
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,509
(Woman and driver speak Dutch)

736
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,556
(Jo) Are you there?

737
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,473
- Englishmen, are you there?
- Yes, all six of us.

738
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,677
When the truck stops, the driver
will open up, get out at once.

739
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,596
(Lorry door closes)

740

(Speak German)

743

She's getting the Jerries
to unload the truck for her.

744
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,477
- She's a cool customer.
- These Dutch girls are wizard.

745
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,916
They are. Our girls would do just
the same if they had the chance.

746
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,150

the quarters of 200 German soldiers.

(Singing resumes)

752
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,832
Louis?

(Dripping)

755
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,597
We're over my house.
lt's the German headquarters.

756
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,830
My rooms are at the end of the wing.

757
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,036
All of you, in the other room.

758
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,792
Take it easy.

759
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,277
You are safe here.
This place has good walls and floors.

760
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,239
You can talk as much as you want to
and you can take off those things.

761
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,878
There's a radio here.

762
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,356
lt's tuned in to the BBC.

763
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,676
Use it if you like.

764
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,797
Only don't start dancing.
Just below here is the officers' mess.

765
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,317
l must leave you now. Got to go back the
way we came and come in by the front door,

766
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,356
or they might start thinking.

767
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,238
Lock the door behind me
and only open it to this knock.

768
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,673
(Three knocks and rap)

769
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,274
- V.
- Yes, V.

770
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,750
Pity, isn't it?
l never felt more like dancing in my life.

771
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,277
Just imagine, officers' mess below,
Jerries all over the place and no dancing.

772
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,396
Such charming partners too.

773
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,436
- What time is it?
- 21 :56.

774
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,078
Pity. We've missed the news.

775
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,833
- What time did you you say it was?
- 21 :56.

776
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,672
- Hazel!
- Who?

777
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,149
(All) Hazel Mason,
home and forces programme.

778
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,038
Oh, your wife.
l thought l recognised the voice.

779
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,111
(Woman singing on radio)

780
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,832
Steady, steady.

781
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,791
Not so fast.

782
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,036
That's better.

783
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,111
She's good.

784
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,428
She's damned good.

785
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,910
l hope your wife won't object to us
undressing during her big scene.

786
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,356
- lf she knew where you were, she'd twitter.
- Shh.

787
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,589
(Singing ends)

788
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,274
- All over.
- How was she?

789
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,112
Not bad. Not at all bad.

790
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,192
Yes...very good.

791
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,717
l hadn't thought about it till now but we'll
have been posted missing this morning.

792
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,678
- l had thought of it.
- l don't think the others have.

793
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,478
All the better for them.

794
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,596
l suppose Hazel knows about Frank by now.

795
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,750
Bound to. They'd get her at the BBC.

796
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,239
She's on tonight.

797
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,072
Where do you expect her to be, off?

798
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,430
(Bugle plays)

799
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,670
(Rhythmic marching)

800
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,998
Good blackout they got here.

801
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,074
You know, that's funny,
them blacking out because of us.

802
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,514
- l suppose we do fly over here, eh, Frank?
- Katwijk? Yes, often.

803
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,873
lt feels like the end of a long term
with a cheap supporting cast.

804
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,077
No good looking in there
for small change, my boy.

805
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,310
You know, that's very significant.

806
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,994
Five of these woollens
are German to one British.

807
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,230
Might be something in that after the war.

808
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,437
Yorkshire woollens in Holland,
they might go for it in a big way.

809
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,112
Don't let anybody know l said so.

810
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,193
l don't promise. l never talk about anything
but woollens. Can't cure myself.

811
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,477
- What's funny about woollens?
- All right, don't get excited.

812
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,633
Which should the world know more about,
British actors or British cloth?

813
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,631
(Three knocks and a rap)

814
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,550
Now, let me see you all.

815
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,078
- Frau de Vries, may l introduce...
- No, you may not.

816
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,116
l shall forget your names anyway.

817
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,873
- Well, you don't mind us thanking you?
- No.

818
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,793
Why did you do that?

819
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,270
l don't know. l was thinking of my own wife.

820
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,556
- lt wasn't only you.
- l see.

821
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,394
- Were you a diplomat before the war?
- No, Johnny's the diplomat.

822
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,994
- l'm just an actor.
- Of course.

823
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,834
No Englishman would kiss a woman's hand,
except perhaps an actor.

824
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,434
- Snub or compliment?
- Compliment.

825
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,990
The way you handled those Germans
taught me something about acting.

826
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,629
lt isn't so difficult.
They're an unhappy people.

827
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,793
l would rather be a Dutchman
in Holland now than any German soldier.

828
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,634
They want to believe that somebody's
their friend and that's the trick.

829
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,676
A dangerous trick for a woman.

830
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,274
You don't seem to think much of women.

831
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,477
Besides l have Louis and Willem.
He was your driver.

832
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,677
They're the only servants left
but they won't leave me.

833
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,994
l was afraid when l first started,

834
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,197
just as a pilot is afraid
the first time he goes solo.

835
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:54,308
Then after a few minutes, when he finds
he's still alive, begins to like it.

836
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,954
- Will you do something for me?
- Yes, of course.

837
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,999
l want you to go and see my husband
when you get back to England.

838
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,389
- Your husband?
- l'm not mad.

839
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,630
He's in London. l'll give you his address.

840
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,110
- But we heard...
- l know. l spread that story myself.

841
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,192
Nobody knows the truth,
not even my friends.

842
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,236
But he's alive and in London.

843
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,912
Do you ever hear from him?

844
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,516
Five times a week. He's one of
the Dutch announcers of Radio Oranje.

845
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,750
- What...
- Radio Orange.

846
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,875
Oh.

847
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:30,397
So you see we're two, on both sides
of the channel. We're still fighting.

848
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,870
Well, leave it to us.
Can we get cracking tonight?

849
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,077
You may be here for days or hours.
lt depends on your air force.

850
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,709
- You can only get away in a raid.
- We want to get back, raid or no raid.

851
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,711
- Look here...
- Are you in command?

852
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,314
- No, he's a Yorkshireman.
- Are you in command?

853
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,837
- No. You are.
- We have to get you back to England.

854
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,469
You won't be the first or the last
to leave this house for England.

855
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,516
You'll reach the sea in a fishing boat

856
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,990
and the fishing boat by a row boat
from the cellar of this house

857
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,036
and to the cellar by a back staircase.

858
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,237
The corridor which passes
my door leads to that staircase.

859
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:08,598
The corridor has two features,
a sentry...and a glass roof.

860
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,830
- And so?
- lf you were his officer,

861
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,070
what orders would you give in an air raid?

862
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,550
Well, tell him not to stand about
under a glass roof, l suppose.

863
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,394
Exactly. During a raid,
the corridor is left unguarded.

864
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,232
Now, do you understand?

865
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,276
Exactly.

866
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,433
Everything is prepared.
There's nothing to do now but wait.

867
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,552
(Rain falling)

868
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,471
<i>Owing to bad weather conditions,</i>

869
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,677
<i>there were no operations over</i>
<i>enemy territory last night.</i>

870
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,512
You're telling me.

871
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,838
Mon herr.

872
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,512
Pardon, mon herr.

873
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,316
Our wine has been drunk by the Germans
but being a Dutch woman,

874
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,473
l think that Dutch water is a better drink
than French champagne.

875
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,029
l'm sorry l haven't been able to give you
the food l would have liked to

876
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,076
but we haven't very much left.

877
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,674
l mean, not very much left to eat.

878
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,069
But we've kept everything else.

879
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,674
We can think and hope...

880
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,432
and fight.

881
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,157
l give you a toast. Louis.

882
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,077
Our motto since the house of Orange
drove out the Spaniards 300 years ago.

883
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,476
''Je maintiendrai.''

884
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,914
lt's nice to be a woman again,
even for half an hour.

885
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,229
What do they reckon that motto
of yours means, then, ma'am?

886
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,278
''We can take it.''

887
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:20,077
Well, l never. 300 years ago. We don't
seem to have progressed much, do we?

888
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,278
George.

889
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,270
Come on, George.

890
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,669
l don't know why everybody's looking at me.

891
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,673
After all we have a diplomat
and an actor here.

892
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,676
l suppose it's my age.

893
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:53,908
Well, my dear young lady, we can't
offer you anything except our love...

894
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:00,273
our gratitude and our admiration for
a brave woman and a fearless country.

895
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,591
But we can promise you one thing...

896
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:11,508
a growing help, an attack,
which will sweep these Germans from...

897
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,556
(Distant hum of aeroplane engines)

898
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,311
(Air-raid sirens blare)

899
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,078
Air raid!

900
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,196
(Jo and Louis speak in Dutch)

901
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,398
Come here, all of you.

902
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,436
(Distant shouts in German)

903
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,276
You see? That's what you're doing for us.

904
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,429
Can you hear them running for shelter?

905
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,910
Can you understand what that means
to all the occupied countries,

906
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,673
to enslaved people
having it drummed into their ears

907
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,069
that the Germans are masters of the earth?

908
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:12,188
Seeing those masters running for shelter,
seeing them crouching under tables

909
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,636
and hearing that steady hum
night after night,

910
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,952
that noise which is oil
for the burning fire of our hearts.

911
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,634
(Distant booming and hum of aircraft)

912
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,596
(Distant booming continues)

913
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,795
(Door thumps)

914
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,836
(Men shout in German)

915
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,549
(Speaks German)

916
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,795
(Man replies)

917
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,836
(Whispers) Stop here.

918
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,669
(Men speak German)

919
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,158
(Whistles appreciatively)

920
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,276
(Men talk excitedly in German)

921
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,556
(Jo speaks German)

922
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,116
She's leading him up
the garden path beautifully.

923
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,749
(Men chat excitedly)

924
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:48,240
- They're expecting another chap, Fritz.
- A little reception committee for Fritzy.

925
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,074
He's gone to get a Korkenzieher.
l don't know what Korkenzieher means.

926
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,470
(Jo and soldiers flirt in German)

927
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,513
Oh!

928
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,794
(Whispers) She's dropped his torch
in the drink.

929
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,953
- Since when did you speak German?
- l can understand that much.

930
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,031
(Footsteps)

931
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,076
(Calls out happily in German)

932
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,672
Hello, Fritzy.

933
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,358
OK.

934
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,436
Now, what about this Korkenzieher?

935
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,630
- Of course.
- What is it?

936
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,199
Corkscrew.

937
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,032
Cut it out.

938
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,838
l'll be Fritz.

939
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,718
You others follow as soon as the fight starts.

940
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,869
(Men speak German with Jo)

941
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,630
(All shout)

942
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,472
(Gagging)

943
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,516
(Shouts in German)

944
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,190
- All right, Mrs de Vries? Tom?
- Yes.

945
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,554
- Kiboshed.
- Bob?

946
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,675
KO.

947
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,910
- Frank? Geoff?
- All correct, sir.

948
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,118
(Speaks Dutch)

949
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,592
Louis!

950
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,830
(Both speak Dutch)

951
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,398
You can't wait for the tide to turn or the
fishing boat. These three will be missed.

952
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,597
- We can't leave you in a spot like this.
- Don't worry about me.

953
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,194
And don't worry about these Germans.

954
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,398
We didn't invite them to our country but
we can take care of them once they're here.

955
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,198
(Speaks Dutch)

956
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,236
That tunnel leads to the river.

957
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,393
Watch out for a fishing boat coming
upstream with two white diamonds on it.

958
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,756
Try and contact the fishermen.
lf you can't, trust to luck.

959
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,913
The danger will be at the swing bridge
at the mouth of the river. lt's guarded.

960
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,117
You may be challenged.
You must use your own judgment.

961
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,599
Now, hurry.

962
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,274
- What about the course?
- Due west.

963
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,477
Steer by a light
you will pick up eight miles out.

964
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,757
lt's a German rescue buoy for their airmen
who hit the sea.

965
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,513
Keep well to the left of it
and watch out for E-boats.

966
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,318
- You have your compass?
- Yes.

967
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,073
Don't waste my corkscrew, bring a bottle.

968
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,516
Well, God bless you.

969
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,997
l suppose that's
the one advantage of being old.

970
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,559
(Distant hum of aircraft)

971
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,031
Good luck.

972
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,076
(Distant booming)

973
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,472
Stand by.

974
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,038
ln.

975
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,036
- Out!
- (Booming)

976
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,236
(Explosions)

977
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,273
Swing bridge ahead.

978
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,636
(Klaxon blasts)

979
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,196
(Mutters in German)

980
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,396
(Distant booming)

981
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,756
Here come the fishing boats.

982
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,836
(Happy chattering)

983
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,113
Two white diamonds.

984
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,273
Our buoy friends.

985
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,798
Our chance will be when
the bridge starts to close again.

986
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:01,839
Stand by to cast off.
When l give the word, roll.

987
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,672
Get set.

988
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,716
Cast off.

989
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,156
(Distant booming)

990
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,036
(Whistles romantic melody)

991

ln.

992
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,472

ln.

994

(Whistling continues)

995
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,072
Quicken up.

996
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,074
Out.

997
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,156
(Stops whistling)

998
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,196
(Resumes whistling)

999
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,513
(Stops whistling)

1000
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,999
Halt!

1001
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,996
Now, row!

1002
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,756
(Guard) Halt!

1003
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,552
- ln, out, in...
- (Gunshot)

1004
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:28,154
- Keep down.
- We're not going to be caught!

1005
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,958

- ln, out...

1008

- ln, out, in, out...

1009
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,836
(Distant hum of aircraft)

1010
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,832
Our luck.

1011
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:00,310
They don't dare use searchlights
cos of our chaps.

1012
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,430
Let's slow it down. l'm done.

1013
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,953
What's your course, George?
We're going a bit north.

1014
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,791
Do you want any help, sir?

1015
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,836
You all right, George?

1016
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,349
George?

1017
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,749
- He's hurt.
- Steer, somebody.

1018
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,953
- Are you hurt badly, George?
- The tiller...

1019
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,792
Oh, don't worry about that.

1020
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,791
Here. Geoff.

1021
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,396
(Mutters)

1022
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,436
Here, pass me that sack.

1023
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,192
Oh, Lord.

1024
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,552
You all right now, George?

1025
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,673
lf l can stick it till morning, l'll do all right.

1026
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,994
l suppose this is what they call choppy.

1027
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,957
lt's what l call nasty.

1028
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,791
Hey, here they come.

1029
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,549
- They've spotted us, sir.
- Blast.

1030
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,438
They'll be here in three minutes.

1031
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,115
- lf this comes off, we're going to be all right.
- Shut the hatch.

1032
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,156
(Clanking)

1033
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,676
- Are they still jabbering, sir?
- Yes.

1034
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,309
They're ordering these two thugs
to sit quiet till E-boats get here.

1035
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,073
(Speaks German)

1036
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,794
What are we going to do about
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?

1037
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,836
You two stay put, understand?

1038
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,229
(Speaks German)

1039
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,074
You're far too cocky.
You understand that all right.

1040
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,718
OK.

1041
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,874
No need to have an empty stomach anyway.

1042
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,918
(Klaxon blares)

1043
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,069
(Klaxon stops)

1044
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,194
Try to pick up something from our side.

1045
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,236
(Approaching engine)

1046
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,558
(Shouting in German)

1047
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,432
Out!

1048
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,637
(Man) They don't seem
to understand my German, sir.

1049
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,676
He's one of us!

1050
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,478
All line up!

1051
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,869
Steady! Watch it!

1052
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,278
- Hello? Air Force?
- That's right, six of us.

1053
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,751
What are you birds doing here?

1054
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,631
- A wonder Jerry didn't pick you up.
- Matter of fact, we picked up two of them.

1055
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,473
Jerries? Are they your prisoners?

1056
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,074
We've been arguing
about that since we got here.

1057
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,230
They were here first and radioed for help.

1058
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,198
l see their point.
Technically you're their prisoners.

1059
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,350
(Geoff) What, six to two? l like that.

1060
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,192
Sir.

1061
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,590
Got a bit too cocky, so we took their guns.

1062
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,798
Legally that weakens your status but don't
mind me, l'm a barrister when l'm ashore.

1063
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,838
Then we loosened the cables
and hoped we'd drift.

1064
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,357
You drifted all right. Another hour with
this tide and you'd be in our own minefields.

1065
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,079
- How long have you been in the pot?
- Since four.

1066
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,391
We saw you coming, sir.
We thought you was Jerries, sir.

1067
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:51,553
Trouble with you fellows is you can't see
anything unless you're 10,000 feet up.

1068
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,437
We heard they were sending E-boats.

1069
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,431
- When did you hear?
- Ten minutes ago.

1070
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,114
Ten minutes? What are we waiting for?
Get aboard.

1071
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,395
One of us is wounded.

1072
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,597
We shan't be able to get him
across to your boat.

1073
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,079
Yes. l quite agree. He can't be moved.

1074
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,914
Bit old for a flyer, isn't he?
Well, how do you feel about it?

1075
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,594
He's our rear gunner.

1076
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,194
Yes...if it wasn't for those E-boats.

1077
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:26,353
Of course, you don't want to leave him.
lt would be the wisest thing to do.

1078
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,830
We can't do that.
We're all the one crew, you see?

1079
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,036
Yes, l quite agree.

1080
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,638
- Coxswain!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1081
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,314
- Take this lobster pot in tow!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1082
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,152
What about the E-boats?

1083
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,754
That to the E-boats. Next stop Dover.

1084
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,914
- That's all, Corbett.
- Thank you, sir.

1085
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,318
Well, George, this is the new kite.
How do you like it?

1086
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,356
Yes, that's more my size.

1087
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,358
Right. The target's Berlin.
