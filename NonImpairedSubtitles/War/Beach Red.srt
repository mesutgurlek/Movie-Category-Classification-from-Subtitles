1
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:22,217
Some of us put up a better front
than others, but underneath...

2
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,560
all of us were god-awful scared.

3
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,623
I was scared
until just a few minutes ago,

4
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,167
when our landing craft came up.

5
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,100
But now it's gone.

6
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,001
I feel fine, you know?

7
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,596
It's the waiting, I guess.

8
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,440
Once you get into action,
the adrenaline gets into your system.

9
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,672
Tell us all about it, Mouse.

10
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,877
Us kids wanna hear the facts of life
from a tried-and-true hero.

11
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,350
Cut it out, Sarge.

12
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,284
I was just saying how I feel.

13
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,685
When are we gonna go in?

14
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,384
We've stood around
that compartment since 0500.

15
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,949
That's why you're getting
that big fat salary for, Red.

16
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,518
Just hold your water.

17
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,461
Hey, Colombo,
maybe the Japs took off...

18
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,624
when they saw
that we're here in force.

19
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,861
- Maybe, huh?
- Stop dreaming, Chubby.

20
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,336
They are dug in
ten, twenty feet underground.

21
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,102
Sure, they're just laying low
till we hit the beach.

22
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,110
God, that bombardment last night
must've softened them up some.

23
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,338
Hey, Colombo.

24
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,711
How long was
that Bougainville operation?

25
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,010
Too long, man.

26
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,846
Pushing through those jungles got me.

27
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,351
My boondockers rotted off.

28
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,355
And this is worse,
with these lousy beaches.

29
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,688
We're going in for a wet landing
about 200 yards off.

30
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,124
Holy mackerel!

31
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,222
For God's sakes, Colombo.

32
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,459
Hey, what do you
want me to do, kiss it?

33
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,502
Come on, come on. Clear the way.
Let old Gopher get his shot.

34
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,212
Would there be wars
if clocks had never been invented?

35
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,380
Cut the philosophy.

36
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,117
You're not a lawyer anymore,
you're an officer.

37
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,658
And this is it.

38
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,088
Don't get impatient
in the landing craft, you men.

39
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:08,259
We're going to be circling a long time
in the rendezvous area before we go in.

40
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,997
In the landing craft,
until the Coxswain lowers the ramp,

41
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,972
keep your heads down
and your helmets on.

42
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,000
Keep your weapons close by
and try to keep them dry.

43
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,409
Good luck to all of you.

44
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,054
I could get killed today.

45
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,821
Well, boys, here we go.

46
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,380
All right, move!

47
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,483
Hey, wait a minute!

48
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,721
Me first. I wanna shoot up as you're
coming down. Get your best angle.

49
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,893
Let's go!

50
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,667
Move!
Get your ass over!

51
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,910
All right, girls! Don't let 'em step
on your tiny little hand! Let's go!

52
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,542
Move! Let's go!

53
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,048
Go!

54
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,891
Move!

55
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,431
Let's go!

56
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,864
Let's go!

57
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,269
Move!

58
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,172
I thought I had it.
I studied all the points...

59
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,514
...sticking up.
They'll cut hell out of you.

60
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,679
What were you doing? Praying?
Nothing wrong with it.

61
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,814
Just now?
No, not really.

62
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,222
I was... I was just thinking
about all these fish

63
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,320
that are gonna get blown up today,
and then about back home.

64
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,558
I used to go fishing a lot with my pop.

65
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:30,329
What's your old man do?
Is he a doctor or something like that?

66
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,927
Worse. He's a minister.

67
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,404
That's why I was named
Joseph Joshua Cliff.

68
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,236
A minister! Sure enough?

69
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,867
But he's a great guy, too.

70
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,844
I mean, most people think
because he's a minister,

71
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,437
he's gotta be square...
not fun, not human.

72
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,780
You should hear him at church.
He gets more laughs than Bob Hope.

73
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,183
I never heard a minister
but he was funny as a graveyard.

74
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,723
He's serious, too.

75
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,554
I mean, he makes people think.

76
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,493
Most people, he says, pray
like they were going to the bathroom

77
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,224
or brushing their teeth...
a reflex, almost.

78
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,927
"Forgive us our trespasses, and help us
to forgive those who trespass against us."

79
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,994
How many people ever stop to think
what that really means?

80
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,939
Yeah. You're damn right.

81
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,737
When is something gonna happen?

82
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,573
When are we going in?

83
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,614
Goldberg said it'd be
at least an hour more.

84
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,690
...sometime tomorrow.
Anytime.

85
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,462
Your folks still alive?

86
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,865
Hell, I ain't seen 'em since I was four.

87
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,799
That sits just fine with me.

88
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,308
For God's sakes, Colombo.

89
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,609
Only man among living things
says prayers.

90
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,485
Or needs to.

91
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,882
They can't get me.

92
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,327
I hope we don't have
any hand-to-hand fighting.

93
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,577
What the hell?

94
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,083
Keep your fat head down,
you won't catch any spray.

95
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,882
Let's go! Go!

96
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,042
Move!

97
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,904
Get the hell on your feet!

98
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,972
Corpsman! Let's go!

99
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,223
I got to move faster.

100
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,698
I can't move.
I can't move.

101
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,428
Oh, please.

102
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,135
You're ruining my shot.

103
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,113
Get the hell out of there, you slo...

104
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,441
Oh, my God.

105
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,011
Yes, there's very heavy fire,
mostly mortars and machine guns.

106
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,683
Yes, sir, we're moving. Out.

107
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,657
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.

108
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,786
All right, come on.

109
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,151
Come on, move.

110
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,854
Charlie One to Charlie Six.

111
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,061
That damn smoke.

112
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,965
I'll stop it down, make it a 5.6.

113
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,631
Oh, please.
Oh, please.

114
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,609
Egan, get that...

115
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,374
Mouse!

116
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,213
Not there! Move up!

117
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,057
Charlie One. Charlie One.

118
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,189
Move them out to the next shelter.

119
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,655
Move up!

120
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,170
All right, every man move up.
Move up!

121
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,712
Move up!

122
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,942
You too, Colombo! Go!

123
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,411
Okay, you, move up!

124
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,648
Move!

125
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,376
Egan, get some fire
on that gun!

126
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,545
Move up!

127
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,446
Move up!

128
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,750
Spread out! Move up!

129
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,360
All right, Mike.

130
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,904
Come on, son.

131
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,652
Please.

132
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,885
Oh, please.

133
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,519
You men seen Mouse?

134
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,687
Not in some time.

135
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,355
Go look for him!

136
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,798
God!

137
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,538
Mouse!

138
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,615
No. No.

139
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,499
Gotta get 'em off this beach.

140
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,750
Get up here!

141
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,984
Get up, Colombo!
Get your butt up here!

142
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,089
Charlie One.
Charlie One.

143
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,034
This is Charlie Six.
Move 'em out, Domingo.

144
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,128
Yes, sir.
Over and out.

145
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,872
Move 'em out!

146
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,806
Move out! Move out!

147
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,017
I'm gonna move over.
You follow me!

148
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,418
Come on up here!

149
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,979
Automatic weapons, cover!

150
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,388
Let's go!

151
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,416
- Over the line!
- All right!

152
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,131
Oh, Jesus!

153
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,669
Oh, Jesus.

154
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,184
Oh, Jesus...

155
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,397
Corpsman!

156
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,477
Oh, Jesus!

157
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,187
- Honeywell! Lindstrom!
- Here!

158
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,760
Corpsman!

159
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,597
Hey, Gunny.

160
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,658
We're in a crossfire here.

161
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,726
You get that right gun.

162
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:13,964
Lindstrom...

163
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,804
- Go ahead fast.
- All right.

164
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,372
Cover me.
I'm going for that machine gun.

165
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,812
Corpsman...

166
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,857
Don't forget to cover me.

167
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,554
Corpsman! Corpsman!
We need a corpsman over here!

168
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,953
Coming.

169
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,687
Corpsman!

170
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,340
Move 'em out!

171
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,748
Move 'em!

172
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,384
Egan, Cliff, move up.

173
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,006
Hell, my eyes aren't as good
as they used to be.

174
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,668
I'll have to get glasses
when I get back.

175
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,973
Pardon me... if I get back.

176
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,756
Hold it, you two!

177
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,233
We got the son of a bitch!

178
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,570
Get back here!

179
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,233
Hey! It's a dummy!

180
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,671
Cliff and Egan didn't do too bad.

181
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,146
That Cliff though...
I don't know.

182
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:55,209
He'll grow up
or he'll go to pieces or he'll be dead.

183
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,187
It's so easy to get killed.

184
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,750
I never saw a man die before today.
Or even a dead man.

185
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,370
They can't get me.

186
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,376
I tell you,
they ain't gonna get me.

187
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,273
Weaver and Ullman...
and poor Huff.

188
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,512
Always yakking
about his wife and kids.

189
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:31,419
I'll have a lot of those...
those letters to write.

190
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,821
I'd rather get shot, I think.

191
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,085
Gunny, let's hold them up here.

192
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,495
Hold up!

193
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,659
The tanks will be here in a minute.
We'll wait for them.

194
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:21,068
We don't know what the hell
to expect in these damn rice paddies.

195
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,299
Fix bayonets.

196
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,806
Fix bayonets!

197
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,524
Charlie Six calling Pickax Six.

198
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,261
Come in, Pickax.
Come in, Pickax.

199
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,667
Yes, sir?

200
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,002
Oh, we've crossed
through the Palm Belt,

201
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,237
and we're in the Rice Paddy area...
we're crossing that.

202
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,305
No, sir.
No incoming fire.

203
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,477
Hey, Egan.
How come you're still alive?

204
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,714
Hell, boy, they can't get me
till I get me one more woman.

205
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:13,279
I bet you a pack of cigarettes
they get you before they get me.

206
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,191
If I win, you won't pay off.

207
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,457
Yes, sir.

208
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,367
Right.
Roger and out.

209
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,761
You gotta figure the odds.
We got 8,000 guys here.

210
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,172
Now, why should I buy it?

211
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,972
The best thing to do is
to get yourself a wound...

212
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,775
a good one
that doesn't hurt too damn much.

213
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,046
Then you're on your way home,
out of this muck.

214
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,298
Hit the deck!
Hit the deck!

215
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,435
Move 'em out!

216
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,871
Move out!

217
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:16,667
Hey, Domingo, Gunny,
get that tank on that machine gun,

218
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,733
the other one on the bunker,
and send us a flamethrower.

219
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,868
Aye, aye, Skip.

220
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,776
I'll get that one
on the machine gun.

221
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,310
All right, get that tank
to zero on that bunker,

222
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,545
and then you bring up
the flamethrower.

223
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,753
12:00.

224
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,256
I've got you.

225
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,168
A little lower.

226
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,602
Gunny, drop the packs.

227
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,171
Drop your packs!

228
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,687
Are you crazy?!
Are you crazy?!

229
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,525
All right, move up
across that ditch

230
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,264
and cover the flamethrower.

231
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,498
Let's go!

232
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,574
Move up!

233
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,881
I got him!

234
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,551
Oh, my God...
I got him.

235
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,060
Don't!

236
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,965
You do your job, Sir Galahad.
I'll do mine.

237
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,492
I'm just glad I got boots
to fight this war.

238
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,376
Colombo! Snyder! Down!

239
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,992
Corpsman! Corpsman!

240
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,724
What about Snyder...
is he gone?

241
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,130
Yeah, Skipper.
He caught one in the head.

242
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,692
Well, then forget the corpsman.

243
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,704
I think it missed the bone.

244
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,706
Let's put a bandage on it
and let's go.

245
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,436
You're damn lucky, Skipper.
A couple of inches lower...

246
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,711
Looks like it went clean through flesh.
Move your arm around a little bit.

247
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,271
It's okay.

248
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,546
Gunny, don't let those men bunch up.
Get the Lieutenant.

249
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,110
And, Lindstrom,
keep those people back.

250
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,348
Aye, aye, sir.

251
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,358
All right,
forget the corpsman!

252
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:46,021
The Skipper wants to see the Lieutenant!
The rest of you people spread out!

253
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,927
Skipper's okay!

254
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,727
- Gonzalez!
- Yes, sir!

255
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,872
Pickax Six,
this is Charlie Six.

256
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,433
We have objective Able.

257
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,445
Moving out to Baker.

258
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,175
Yes, sir.
Roger. Out.

259
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,580
Is it all right, skipper?

260
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,141
Yeah. Domingo...

261
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,880
there's that beautiful jungle.

262
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:13,150
We're going in in column.

263
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,624
You take the advance guard,
find us a trail.

264
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,786
Yes, sir.

265
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,692
Lindstrom, move 'em out!

266
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,223
Cliff...
you stay back with me.

267
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:27,236
Egan, you and Ginger
take the point.

268
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,363
Colombo, you and Bill keep back.

269
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,035
Now, watch out for an ambush
and keep quiet. Let's go.

270
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,149
Egan, it's so easy
to get killed.

271
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,648
Yeah, it sure is.

272
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,155
Hope I never get it
like Mouse did.

273
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,026
Yeah... his arm.

274
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,734
I never figured
on this kind of war.

275
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,537
Bunkers, pillboxes... hell, we're out
in the open like a possum on a dead tree.

276
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,011
How many men did it cost us
to take that bunker?

277
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:01,711
Those Japs went up in flames
like... like tissue paper.

278
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:05,243
Yeah. Everything goes poof
except the skull and the kneecaps.

279
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,784
That bunker really shook me.

280
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:11,593
The flamethrower's the worst. I...

281
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,823
I mean, I'd rather
get shot or anything.

282
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,863
Except maybe a bayonet.

283
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,235
Mouse'll be okay, I guess.

284
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,706
Yeah.
They'll take care of him.

285
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,938
I know a lot of guys
that would settle for that right now.

286
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,070
I suppose.

287
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:33,548
Why did he have to get it like that?
I mean, Mouse, of all people.

288
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,209
What did he ever do wrong?

289
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,812
Bullets don't give a damn
about that, I reckon.

290
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,684
There ain't no use
thinking about it.

291
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,391
Come on, buddy.
We got some diggin' to do.

292
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:56,133
There's gotta be some other way.
There's just gotta be.

293
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,040
Or what's the point?

294
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,616
Not bad. Not bad.

295
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,418
I'd thought it'd be a lot worse,
seeing it's you.

296
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,358
Look, Sarge, why do we have
to go through all this trouble?

297
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,156
'Cause I said so, that's why.

298
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,060
We may only be here
a couple of hours.

299
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,621
We may be here all night.

300
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:27,102
I bet you ten bucks. Ten bucks
we'll move out in... in three hours.

301
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,161
And I have 1411.

302
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,298
You make it five bucks,
you're on.

303
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,032
Okay, five bucks.

304
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,169
Okay.

305
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:40,180
Well, who renovated this hotel?
I don't know if I can afford it.

306
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,911
My work of art, Captain.

307
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,816
Great job, Colombo.

308
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,219
Too bad we're
moving out pretty quick.

309
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,691
Charlie Company is out
on perimeter security.

310
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,755
Not a sign of a Jap
anywhere around.

311
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,823
Battalion needs prisoners.

312
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,766
Domingo,
I'm gonna give you this job

313
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,031
because we lost Menasco
back on the beach.

314
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,266
You're the only one
who understands Japanese.

315
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,665
This is the area.

316
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,243
Take the Gunny
and pick the rest yourself.

317
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,513
Now, let's get this clear.

318
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,312
We need prisoners,
but take no unnecessary risks.

319
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:16,875
Here's your coffee, Captain.

320
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,550
Wow. Damn, that's good.

321
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,958
Now, good luck to you.

322
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:28,020
And password is "Lucky,"
the countersign, "Darling."

323
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,690
Aye, Skipper.
Let's go, Gunny.

324
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:30,926
"Lucky darling."

325
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,366
Darling.

326
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,735
Darling, you really
should read the comics.

327
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,678
They just kill me.

328
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,842
This one is really marvelous!

329
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,409
It's just too much!

330
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,323
Up you go!
Don't you like it?

331
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,705
Higher!

332
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,400
Those were the good times.

333
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:15,104
Sometimes I think
I ought to wear more makeup.

334
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,443
Maybe you'd like me
to be all glamorous and jazzed up.

335
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,712
I'd ratherjust wash my face
and forget it.

336
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,412
Don't watch.

337
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:24,977
Don't watch me, darling.

338
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,647
It makes me laugh!

339
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,385
Please don't watch!

340
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,154
Darling!

341
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,788
Darling! Darling!

342
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,354
Oh, my darling.

343
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,629
I love you so much.

344
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,934
You don't know.

345
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,494
Yes, I do.

346
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,131
What am I going to do?

347
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:49,104
What am I going to do
without you?

348
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,239
You have to report
in two weeks.

349
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,784
They've called up
your reserve unit.

350
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,911
In two weeks!

351
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,513
- Darling!
- Don't be like this, love.

352
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,684
It's not the end of the world.
I'm not the only one.

353
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,091
I don't care!

354
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,654
I don't care about anyone else
on this whole earth but you.

355
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,102
I love you, Julie mine.

356
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,576
I'll miss you terribly, too.

357
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,307
Let's make the most
of these two weeks, huh?

358
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,316
Oh, I swore I wouldn't tell you.

359
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,545
I even hid the telegram.

360
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,716
Then I put on all this perfume
and this silly negligee

361
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,591
and... and it took me two hours
to iron the damn thing.

362
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,392
I'm sorry, love.

363
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,387
Hey, Egan,
it's Christmastime.

364
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,559
I got a gift for you.
Your favorite chow.

365
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,966
Beans.

366
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,995
That's real nice.
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

367
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,666
Egan, how in the world can you
eat so much of that crud?

368
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,905
That's the fifth can
you've had today.

369
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,746
I've had better,
but I've had worse... most of the time.

370
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,341
Worse than nothin'.

371
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:20,253
Different for you, I guess, your being
from a nice home and a big town.

372
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:21,813
Oh, it's not that big.

373
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,381
It would be to me.

374
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,520
Damn little one-store town
I come from.

375
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,427
You know something?

376
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,160
There wasn't no flush toilet
in the whole damn place.

377
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,067
I never saw one till I got
to the recruiting station.

378
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,799
Or a new car
or a big store.

379
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,602
And the same gals,
what there was,

380
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,404
every fella was trying to catch 'em

381
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,536
soon as they was
old enough to wear a bra.

382
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,641
Some of them
was real ugly, too.

383
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,707
I mean, you had to cover
their heads with a paper bag.

384
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,679
For real!

385
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,313
Keep eatin', Egan, baby.

386
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,655
This is just for the record.

387
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,990
Might use it
in the Gourmet Magazine...

388
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,996
or maybe a recruiting film.

389
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,955
I'm famous!

390
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:09,633
Hey, don't bunch up, you men.
Come on, now.

391
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:13,198
Okay, Captain. I was just trying
to make Egan here immortal.

392
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:17,269
We're gonna put his picture on every
can of C-rations. He eats the stuff!

393
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,481
How do you feel, sir?

394
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,815
Okay. Hey, is that
your lunch, Egan?

395
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,684
He ate all of these, Captain.

396
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,183
I'll put you in
for a new medal, Egan,

397
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,954
for abdominal fortitude.

398
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,091
You know, Captain,
I've decided when this is all over,

399
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,597
I'm not going back to school.

400
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:39,829
I'm gonna take Egan out on the road
for eating contests. Make a million.

401
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,564
What were you majoring in, Cliff?

402
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,538
I was gonna be a lawyer
like you, sir.

403
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,938
Keep planning on it.
You'll make it.

404
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,842
Might even be a better lawyer
for having gone through this.

405
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,306
Why did I say that?

406
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,909
Is anybody better
for having gone through this?

407
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,648
I suppose some are.
I don't know.

408
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:09,548
You won't do no more killing,
but you'll talk.

409
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:32,128
It's a little tough. Could've been here
two or three weeks, but it's food.

410
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:34,534
- Looks good to me.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot, Sarge.

411
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,233
Boy! I really stink, don't I?

412
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,472
Yeah, you're real raunchy, Egan.

413
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:46,880
You get upwind of the Japs
and they'll just surrender.

414
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,941
Tell Captain MacDonald.

415
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:52,182
Hey, Cliff...
what do you miss the most?

416
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,850
Well, I don't know.
A good, clean bed, maybe.

417
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,188
You know the one thing
that I really miss is a woman.

418
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,993
I tell ya, some nights I think
I'm just gonna go nuts.

419
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,057
I tell you,
when this operation's over,

420
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:07,729
I'm gonna scout out
every inch of this damn island.

421
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,534
There just has to be a woman
on this patch of sand somewhere.

422
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,735
I mean one woman... any damn woman...
even a paper-bagger.

423
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:18,972
Hey, Cliff...

424
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,611
when was your last time?

425
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:24,545
A babe?

426
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:29,322
Just before I left home.

427
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:37,698
Hey, kid, now how old are you?
Now, I mean really.

428
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:41,594
I'm almost 19.
How old are you?

429
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,873
Well, I'm 24, but sometimes I feel
like I was your old man.

430
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,739
What difference does it make, Egan?

431
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,681
I bet you never
really had a woman.

432
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,844
Not once.
Come on, now.

433
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,581
I don't care what you think!

434
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,247
What I know is what counts!

435
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,156
Okay, okay.
Don't scratch my itch either way.

436
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,558
That's what counts, all right.
What you know.

437
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,860
I don't want anybody
to know, Cliff.

438
01:01:11,935 --> 01:01:14,096
Not anybody. Promise?

439
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:17,140
'Course, honey. Why would I?
What kind of guy do you think I am?

440
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:27,973
Wait just a little bit, darling, please.

441
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,349
I'm scared. Really scared.

442
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,479
Why, honey? Why?

443
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:37,050
You know. Not just that you
might hurt me, but what if...

444
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,960
I mean, if anything happened
and you were away, what would I do?

445
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,021
I'd kill myself, Cliff. Honest.

446
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,760
Don't talk like that.

447
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,326
Nothing's gonna happen.

448
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,098
Susie!

449
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:57,440
- Susie, are you out there?
- Yes, Daddy?

450
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,244
You'd better come in now, dear.
It's getting late.

451
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,444
All right, Daddy.
We were just about to.

452
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:05,113
We would like to say goodbye
to Cliff too, you know.

453
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,019
Yes, sir. Thank you.

454
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,189
Damn beans.

455
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,395
Hold it, Egan. Where the hell
do you think you're going?

456
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,566
I gotta go to the ladies' room.
I got your permission, Mother?

457
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,633
You know the orders.
Nobody goes without a guard.

458
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,042
This place could be full of Japs,

459
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,706
and I can't think of any better target
than that great big fat...

460
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,510
- I'll go.
- All right.

461
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,049
- Wait a minute.
- I can't!

462
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:37,609
- You know the password?
- Lucky.

463
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,747
- The countersign?
- Darling. Let's go!

464
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:41,882
Let's go!

465
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,290
Wouldn't it be a hell of a thing
in the middle of an attack, Egan?

466
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,192
Is something happening?
I'll be right with you.

467
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,994
Oh, no, you won't. You point that thing
at me, and I'll shoot ya! I swear!

468
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,638
Lucky!

469
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:09,511
Lucky!

470
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:11,679
Damn it!

471
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:16,022
Cliff, put that damn pipe down!
Come here!

472
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,695
What's happening?!

473
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:27,863
Honeywell,
what the hell's going on?!

474
01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:30,536
Honeywell, I asked you what's going on.

475
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:34,441
There's your prisoner.
A Jap captain.

476
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:37,503
That slope-headed dummy there
just shot him dead!

477
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:40,141
Damn it, Cliff.
What's the matter with you?

478
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,785
What happened to his arms?

479
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,186
I broke 'em.

480
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:49,886
- You broke his arms?
- Yes, sir.

481
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,123
One after he knocked off the lieutenant,
one after he gave me this.

482
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,720
Daniel's dead, too.

483
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,332
Sergeant, get these men
back to their holes.

484
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,766
Get the hell outta here!
Get back to your hole!

485
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,365
You, too. Move!

486
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:10,071
Everybody back.
Come on, move!

487
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,479
Honeywell, I want an explanation.
What was the point?

488
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,042
Was it necessary to break both his arms?
Was it unavoidable?

489
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,611
Will the captain drop rank
for a minute, sir?

490
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:21,717
Go ahead.

491
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:23,919
I'm a Marine.

492
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:26,053
Who gives a damn
about this dead Jap now?

493
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:27,858
He's nothing!
He's worth nothing!

494
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:30,263
When I brought him in here,
he was worth something... to talk!

495
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:33,666
He didn't need his arms for that!
That's the way I look at it, sir.

496
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:37,571
More of these little slobs would be alive
right now if they thought like me.

497
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,131
I'm gonna kill these bastards.

498
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,870
I'm gonna shoot 'em,
I'm gonna bayonet 'em,

499
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:43,777
I'm gonna break their arms
so they don't give us no more trouble.

500
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:45,940
That's what we're here for... to kill!

501
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:48,678
That's what they're doing to us
any way they can.

502
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,313
Everything else is just a lot of crap!

503
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,155
That's all, sir.

504
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,225
I want you
to understand me, Honeywell.

505
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,757
I want this company to fight hard...
as hard as they can.

506
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,666
But I don't want these boys
to be professional killers.

507
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,830
I don't want them to break a man's arms
unless it's a necessity!

508
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,498
Not just out of hate!

509
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:14,103
This isn't the end of everything.

510
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:17,669
A lot of us have been killed,
and a lot more of us are going to be killed.

511
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,772
But a lot more of us
are going home.

512
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,680
You understand me, Honeywell?

513
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,581
I hear ya, sir,
but it don't change anything for me.

514
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,590
Can I go now?
I wanna get a burial detail.

515
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,956
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

516
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,669
I guess that's
what happens with killing.

517
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:45,640
After a while,
we forget why we're doing it.

518
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,543
That's the danger...
the real danger.

519
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:52,274
Oh, God, my shoulder hurts.

520
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:00,553
Hey, Cliff.
Take a look.

521
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,316
Come on. Take a look.

522
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,725
If you squint your eyes a bit
with the light on,

523
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,956
you can almost
damn fool yourself.

524
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,424
See what I mean?

525
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,264
Don't that look like the real thing,
though, Cliff?

526
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,828
Well, yeah. And that rock
really looks like her belly, too.

527
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:17,964
Yeah.

528
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:22,341
I wish she had
some thighs and legs.

529
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:24,573
Damn, she looks
pretty good, though.

530
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:30,317
If we stay out here till nighttime,
you better look out.

531
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:34,717
Brace yourself.

532
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,726
You know, she reminds me
a bit of my last woman.

533
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:40,285
Did I tell you
about that last one?

534
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,593
Which one?
I don't know with you anymore.

535
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,499
This was the last one,
before we left, on my weekend pass.

536
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:49,231
A real big gal. Tall.

537
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:51,702
We hit it off
the first damn minute.

538
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,108
She was sitting in one of those
little sports cars, waitin' for a light.

539
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:58,511
When I saw her,
I started to paw the ground.

540
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:00,742
I asked her for a lift,
and she said, "Where?"

541
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:03,650
I said, "Wherever you're goin'."
She thought that was pretty cute.

542
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,214
So the next thing, we were up in her room,
real nice with a big, soft bed.

543
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,622
You know.

544
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:15,530
I bought a bottle of hundred proof
to hurry things along.

545
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:17,930
And I got her
in a game of strip poker.

546
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:21,835
Okay, now. This time
you're gonna win... I bet you.

547
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,671
Boy, did I cheat.

548
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,239
I better!

549
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:33,079
Come on, now.
Let's play. Come on.

550
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,609
Let's dance.

551
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,676
- Come on, let's play.
- No, I wanna dance!

552
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:39,244
- I wanna play.
- Come on, come on.

553
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,586
She had a better idea.

554
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:43,250
She wanted to dance.

555
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:53,396
She was the tallest damn gal
I ever danced with.

556
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:57,037
But I didn't mind
a damn little bit.

557
01:07:58,341 --> 01:08:00,741
I even scooched down some.

558
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:05,540
Boy, what a king-sized dish she was.

559
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:07,674
I really hit the jackpot.

560
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,409
You're a little goof.

561
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:14,423
The only hitch was that damn tall gal
could out-drink anybody.

562
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,322
Me with that hundred proof...

563
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:19,054
You had a little bit
too much to drink!

564
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,618
Yes, ma'am.

565
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:31,463
Say... Iooky here!
Looky here! I win again!

566
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,237
I'm sorry, sugar.

567
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,972
But, hell. Remember...

568
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:41,710
Unlucky at cards...
lucky in love.

569
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,578
Well...

570
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:48,987
I suppose that sooner or later...

571
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:05,438
I know we had
one dadgum hell of a ball,

572
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:08,841
but now when I wanna dwell on it,
I can't remember!

573
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,302
Ain't that hell?

574
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:10,333
So the answer must lie
somewhere in this area.

575
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:14,638
The Colonel's ordered up patrols out of
the other outfits that cover around here

576
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,202
with no reports of anything
out of the ordinary.

577
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,680
We've got to find out
what's up. It's...

578
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:23,344
it's unnatural the Japs
haven't counterattacked by now.

579
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:26,149
So it's up to you men,
before we get our heads pounded off,

580
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,713
to find out what the hell is going on.

581
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:34,494
I've marked some red X's here
where I think you may find a clue.

582
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:37,328
You could use some morphine, sir.
Shall I send someone?

583
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,992
No, later. I...

584
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,392
Thank you.

585
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,733
What was I saying?

586
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:48,808
Oh, yes. I want you all to try
to remember out there

587
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:52,177
all the instructions you've been given
about that jungle.

588
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:56,685
In some ways,
it's as deadly as the Japs.

589
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,120
- Good luck, Lindstrom.
- Thank you, sir.

590
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,418
- Colombo.
- Yeah, thanks.

591
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:04,352
- Cliff.
- Thank you, Captain.

592
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,786
Thank you, sir.

593
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,564
There are instructions on everything...

594
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,397
...except on how to die.

595
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,166
The mosquitoes are out there
waiting for you.

596
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:22,473
The anopheles, the aedes, the culex...
operating under unified command.

597
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:24,843
Their target... you.

598
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,083
The ticks are waiting, too,

599
01:11:28,151 --> 01:11:31,416
to bury their heads under your skin
and suck your blood.

600
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:36,083
There are vicious sand flies,
bloodsucking flies, buffalo great fly,

601
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,854
assassin bugs,

602
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:42,921
colonies of fleas, mandated gnats,
whole republics of mites.

603
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:46,264
Leeches make getting
next to your skin their life's ambition.

604
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:50,032
All these insects will attack you
with a Japanese accent.

605
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:55,510
Their bites can cause malaria,
filariasis, espundia, typhus,

606
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:59,173
trench fever, bubonic plague.

607
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:02,706
The growing things of the jungle
can spell death, too.

608
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:05,879
Jungle fungus will damage
and pigment your skin.

609
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:09,584
The sap of the beach apple
and mango tree bring sores

610
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,320
that never seem to heal.

611
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:15,888
The milky sap of the buta-buta
can cause total blindness.

612
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:19,958
The oil of the Kamanday tree,
if it enters your body, will be fatal.

613
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:22,698
Equally fatal
is the bark of the abuab tree

614
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:24,967
or the sap of the Dalit.

615
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:29,910
But your greatest danger will be
from your fellow man.

616
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,638
I think I sprung a leak.

617
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:46,446
God.

618
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:47,812
I'm sorry, Sarge.

619
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,613
You guys are wasting your time.

620
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:00,491
We gotta get Lindstrom outta here.

621
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:01,757
One of us, anyway.

622
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,932
Why don't we all
get the hell outta here?

623
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:10,262
Take Lindstrom back.

624
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,604
Captain MacDonald says
we gotta know what's out there.

625
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,768
You gotta.

626
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:15,902
I don't.

627
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,003
I don't need no medals.

628
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,816
Hey. What about you, Egan?

629
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,618
No, I think we gotta go on.

630
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,319
What hell good will it do us or them
if we are dead?

631
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:39,090
Hell, Colombo, now,
I ain't no more a hero than you are.

632
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:42,660
Me and Cliff, we're going on.
Right, buddy?

633
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:48,569
All right, Colombo,
somebody's gotta get Lindstrom back.

634
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,112
You got the urge to head that way,
so how about it?

635
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,272
You gonna take him?

636
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:54,578
Okay. Okay.

637
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,515
Help me get him on my back.

638
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:59,482
I don't wanna bust his guts.

639
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,133
Egan doesn't seem scared.

640
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:16,035
I hope it doesn't show
how scared I am.

641
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,137
Let's go report to Captain MacDonald.

642
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,266
Yeah.

643
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:37,248
If I get him back okay,
the odds are I won't get sent out again.

644
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:39,487
Not for a while, anyway.

645
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:41,663
I'll be a hero.

646
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,887
This'll ease the pain, sir,
but you can carry on.

647
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,549
Good. Good.

648
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,656
Captain MacDonald.

649
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,359
This is Red 22.

650
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,629
Red 22, this is Charlie 6.

651
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:22,671
I've been parked in this hole
sweating you out.

652
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:25,172
Why in hell
haven't you kept me informed?

653
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,868
Lindstrom's a casualty, sir.

654
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,500
Colombo's taking him in.

655
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:30,477
I think you'll
have to send some Corpsmen.

656
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:32,013
He'll need some blood.

657
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:34,606
Just have them follow
the telephone wire.

658
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,651
Lindstrom. My God.

659
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,421
Okay, Cliff, who's in charge
of the patrol now?

660
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:43,683
You've got to!
You're older.

661
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:46,751
L... I guess no one, Captain.

662
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,789
I think Egan ought to.

663
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,627
He's older.

664
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:54,027
Well, all right, Cliff.

665
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:56,731
Yes, l... I guess you're right.

666
01:17:56,806 --> 01:17:58,740
Let Egan be in charge.
Put him on.

667
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:00,608
You heard him.
You're it.

668
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,703
Okay! I mean, yes, sir.

669
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,804
Egan,

670
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:07,906
you're in charge now.

671
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,149
What's your present position?

672
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:17,617
We can't be more than 500 yards out
past the first X mark on the map, Captain.

673
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,092
All right, good.

674
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:24,224
Now I want you to tell me everything
you see and hear, you understand?

675
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,791
Yes, sir. Okay.

676
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:50,257
What good is a medal
if this is gonna give me a heart attack?

677
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,902
How is it, Sarge?

678
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:09,442
- Bad?
- Can't make it.

679
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:14,607
You mean me carrying you?

680
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,547
Too tough.

681
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,680
You're right, Sarge.

682
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,952
I think you're right.

683
01:19:24,026 --> 01:19:28,326
Maybe I could hurry on back
and send a Corpsman for you.

684
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:30,621
You're still the boss.

685
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,933
Is that you want, huh?

686
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:34,999
I'd go on.

687
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,298
I'll hurry.

688
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,040
I can make it pretty fast alone.

689
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,205
You're right, Sarge.

690
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:23,351
Look at that!

691
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,952
Thank you!

692
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:50,540
Come on, Sarge.

693
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:53,582
Hey, you didn't think
I'd leave you here, did you?

694
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:57,115
Come on.

695
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,086
Colombo'll get you back.

696
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:13,860
The odds aren't as good this way,
but I can't leave old Sarge out there.

697
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:17,929
Hell, Colombo, you're a dope.

698
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:29,608
I'm hung up.

699
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:33,113
That's got it.

700
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,649
Boy, I sure don't like this.

701
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,455
They can't get me
till I get me one more woman.

702
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:42,053
Not till I get one more woman.

703
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:38,847
You wanna stop for a minute?

704
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:40,752
I got a can of beans.

705
01:22:40,823 --> 01:22:42,882
No. We'd better not.

706
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,555
Why in the hell am I always so hungry?

707
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:42,916
Get back!

708
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,147
They're coming!

709
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,519
Look, Egan!

710
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:54,721
The phone, Egan.

711
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,859
Hello, hello.

712
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:04,906
What's going on out there?
Can you hear me?

713
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,168
They're coming, they're coming!

714
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:12,477
- How many?
- I don't know, Captain.

715
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,277
Good Lord, they're everywhere.

716
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:15,611
A patrol?

717
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:18,551
No. Dozens of them,
all heading past us.

718
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,650
How many?

719
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:07,234
This place is too hot.
We gotta get out of here.

720
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:10,169
Captain.
Captain MacDonald?

721
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:13,003
Look, Cliff, Egan, they've gone
past you now, haven't they?

722
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:14,133
Yes, sir.

723
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:17,303
All right, so you're in no danger
this damn minute, are you?

724
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:19,813
Well, not exactly this damn minute, sir.

725
01:25:19,882 --> 01:25:23,511
Well, now, those Japs who just went
past you, they were going somewhere.

726
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,611
It's important for us to know
where and why.

727
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:29,589
Now, you... you two are the patrol.

728
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:30,716
Make your decision.

729
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:34,023
Do you wanna go on or come back?

730
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:42,366
Well, we... I guess
it'd be better to go on, maybe.

731
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:46,533
I want you men to remember that
it's all right if you change your minds.

732
01:25:47,209 --> 01:25:48,608
Yes, sir.

733
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:50,872
We might get around to doing that.

734
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:04,984
The gardenerjust doesn't water enough
in my little garden...

735
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:08,791
just splashes around where it shows,
and then off he sneaks.

736
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,997
Everything is in bloom now at home.

737
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:16,463
Camellias, azaleas.

738
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:21,700
If I lose one camellia, I'll fire him.

739
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:24,405
- Why are you laughing?
- Because you're funny.

740
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:30,415
Bang! Bang!

741
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:35,389
You must never point a gun
at anybody, Mike.

742
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:36,949
Bang!

743
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:40,085
Bang!

744
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:42,786
Bang!

745
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,161
Colombo, Snyder, down!

746
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:48,534
I keep worrying that the war might spread
and you'd be in it.

747
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:51,937
That horrible crazy little Hitler!

748
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:54,840
I don't think the Japanese
would fight us, do you?

749
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:58,175
I like them so much...
their gardens and their politeness.

750
01:26:58,246 --> 01:27:01,113
It's so cute,
the way they bow and smile.

751
01:27:01,183 --> 01:27:03,913
Would you miss me if you had to go?

752
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,647
God, how I miss you.

753
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:29,110
I love you.

754
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:35,983
I think of your hair on warm days
at home when you dry it out of doors

755
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:37,951
and the sun shines through it.

756
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,317
I hate my hair.

757
01:27:40,389 --> 01:27:44,018
It's so straight and it takes forever to try,
even in the sun.

758
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,151
I wish I had curly hair like you.

759
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,627
Would you like me better
with curly hair?

760
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:51,063
I love you just the way you are.

761
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:34,424
Captain, you know that sharp rise?
The bare one?

762
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:37,870
We're just under that,
and that's where they all are.

763
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,270
And you know something?

764
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,904
There are hundreds of them.
And they're dressed like us...

765
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:45,378
helmets and everything.

766
01:30:02,297 --> 01:30:03,389
What's all the yelling?

767
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:06,332
Somebody was making a speech.

768
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,528
And now they're all yelling.

769
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:17,511
They're all runnin' off
toward the beach, down that ravine.

770
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:20,810
Good God, I've got it.

771
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:25,017
They're going down that ravine
on the right flank of Beach Red.

772
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,951
They'll launch an attack behind us.

773
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:28,887
They'll look like us
long enough to raise hell.

774
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:30,652
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

775
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:32,454
I'm sorry, sir.

776
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,623
Egan, I'm going to call air attack
on that area and on that beach,

777
01:30:36,698 --> 01:30:38,529
so get out of there as fast as you can.

778
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,397
You men, you've done a good job.

779
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,163
Now drop the wire and move.

780
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:44,296
Boy, let's git.

781
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:10,675
Hey, we did it!

782
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:13,414
- Looks like we did it!
- I guess we did.

783
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,347
Come on.

784
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:20,522
- There go the flyboys.
- Yes, sir.

785
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:33,645
Come on.
Grab some wind.

786
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:47,934
Where in the hell is it?

787
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,206
I've lost the wire.
Is this right?

788
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,606
Yeah. There's that big tree.

789
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:58,634
Come on!

790
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:32,215
That's one more.

791
01:41:49,237 --> 01:41:51,364
Corpsman! Corpsman!

792
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:06,413
There ain't nothin' moving
but his watch.
