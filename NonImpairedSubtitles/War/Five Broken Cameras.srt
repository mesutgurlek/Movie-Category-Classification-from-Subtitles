3
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,179
I've lived through
so many experiences.

4
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:52,575
they burn in my head

5
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,258
like a hot flame

6
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,658
Pain and joy

7
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:00,157
fears and hope

8
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:02,757
are all mixed together.

9
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:05,357
I'm losing track.

10
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:11,657
The old wouds don't
have time to heal

11
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:14,657
New wounds will cover them up

12
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,157
So I film

13
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,857
to hold onto my memories

14
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,109
These are my five cameras

15
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:33,209
Every camera is an episode in my life

16
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:52,029
Five Broken Cameras

17
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:59,648
I was born and lived all my life in Bil'in,

18
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,410
a village surrounded by hills,

19
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:06,898
just inside the occupied
territories of the West Bank

20
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:12,417
I'm a "falah" a peasent.
Like my entire family.

21
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,763
Then land draws us inward

22
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:25,749
As a boy, I used to work
the land with my father.

23
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,341
We would pick olives.

24
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:31,113
Once, I didn't fell like working

25
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:34,197
My father hit me in the head.

26
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,741
So I ran away.

27
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:43,852
I preferred wandering

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,160
in the open valley with my friends.

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,700
One day,

30
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,250
Israeli surveyors come
to take measurements

31
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,455
to put a separation barrier

32
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:09,275
in the middle of our land.

33
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:27,757
The first days the bulldozers
come are very hard.

34
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:33,698
Yet those are also
very happy days for me

35
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:36,926
Our fourth son, Gibreel, is born.

36
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:48,866
I get my first camera to film Gilbreel.

37
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,649
let me film too, Daddy.

38
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,332
Soraya and I

39
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:29,313
have four sons.

40
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:37,658
Each boy is a phase of our lives.

41
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,561
Each boy experienced a
different childhood.

42
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,879
Mohamad, our eldest, was born in 1955,

43
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,390
in the time of hope after
The Oslo Peace Accords

44
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:01,742
In his childhood,things
were more open.

45
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:05,142
We could go to the sea every summer.

46
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:11,136
Yasin was born 3 years
later,in a time of uncertainly

47
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:17,333
The very day the Intifada began in 2000,

48
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:19,948
Taki -Ydin was born.

49
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:26,268
The hospital was full of
the dead and wounded.

50
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:29,413
His childhood was shaped

51
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:34,141
by the long siege the
West Bank was under,

52
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,908
In february 2005, Gibreel was born,

53
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,709
Between my childhood
and Gilreel's birth,

54
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,590
settlements were built
closer and closer...

55
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:57,613
taking up more and
more cultivated land,

56
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:01,009
so Israeli settlers could move in.

57
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:07,145
Modi'in-hit, the most
recent settlement,

58
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:11,036
doubled in population within 5 years.

59
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,773
The barrier is supposed to secure

60
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,817
and separate the settlers.

61
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,185
But it's being built far
from the settlement

62
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:23,888
and very close to Bil'in

63
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,671
So more land

64
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:30,095
is taken from the surrounding villages

65
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,760
Emad, don't let the kids out.
Soldiers are in the village.

66
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,552
When something happens in the village,

67
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,129
my instinct is to film it.

68
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,620
I never thought of making films.

69
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:07,738
But now that I have a camera,

70
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:11,058
people begin to call me

71
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:14,949
to shoot special events in the village

72
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:17,997
So I've become the Bil'in cameraman.

73
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:23,973
But my camera doesn't work well.

74
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:29,141
What I have to film
demands a strong camera,

75
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:32,391
not a fragile one.

76
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:44,669
This man used as a guinea
pig is my friend Phil.

77
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:54,694
The kids call him "El-Phil."

78
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,634
It's a nickname. It
means "the elephant."

79
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:10,032
O often find El-Phil hanging
around with the village kids

80
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:15,925
I think kids like him

81
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:19,287
because they see a lot of hope in him

82
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,661
which is something not
easy to find in adults.

83
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:45,744
Repaving the streets will
solve all our problems.

84
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:49,295
How's our neighborhood?
We'll fix everything today.

85
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,125
Have a drink! There's some juice.

86
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:56,184
But nothing to eat.

87
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:13,913
When fall comes, we pick
olives on the part of our land

88
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,956
beyond the planned route of the barrier.

89
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,940
Stay off the construction site!

90
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:46,241
You'll be forcibly evacuated!

91
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,410
Don't come fordward!

92
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:57,415
No to the fence!

93
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,491
I am confused.

94
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:11,738
Seeing my brother Riyad
hit by these people,

95
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,650
it takes me a while to realize that

96
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,258
they are special unit Israeli
soldiers disguised as Palestinians

97
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:23,181
and planted among us to create chaos.

98
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:31,977
Shut up! Get going!

99
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,670
Let me go!

100
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,921
Untie me!

101
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:00,657
We begin to organize demostrations

102
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,645
with Israeli activists joining us.

103
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:08,773
Is there anything important
you want to say?

104
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:13,885
Bil'in is here,

105
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,421
Part of the Matetyahu
settlement is on Bil'in land

106
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:23,335
So is part of the Qiryat Sefer settlement.

107
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:27,146
and the new plan goes to here.

108
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:30,225
We want to know

109
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:35,353
how the Israeli Army
approved taking these lands

110
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:39,085
How did the construction
companies take them?

111
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:43,303
And then we decide that

112
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:46,090
every week, after the Friday prayer,

113
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,362
we'd try to get that land and protest.

114
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,746
Good morning, Bil'in!

115
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:59,031
Come and join us!

116
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:01,459
Men and women,

117
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,875
old and young!

118
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,665
We're not afraid

119
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:12,623
of tears gas or guns!

120
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,939
This is our land!

121
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:36,371
It's not use.

122
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,882
This is a small village

123
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:42,459
What do you think?

124
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,462
Have you no heart? No family?

125
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:51,010
Every one of you knows
that this is village land!

126
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:54,623
You stole my land!

127
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:59,481
Don't do that! I'm telling you!

128
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,729
That's Adeeb.

129
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,558
Adeeb is always

130
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:09,362
looking for an opportunity
to make a scene

131
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:18,621
We were born on this land

132
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,905
and we'll die here.

133
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:28,135
We'll live on this land for
the rest of our lives!

134
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:37,878
The barrier construction continues,

135
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,477
without delay.

136
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,016
We have to be solid.

137
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:52,966
People from all over the
world join our resistance.

138
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,158
They bring creative ideas to our protest.

139
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,764
They're with us in
everything that happens.

140
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:09,894
That day, a gas grenade breaks my first camera.

141
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:54,186
The first camera witnessed
winter 2005 to autumn 2005.

142
00:15:54,212 --> 00:16:01,406
When it was shot, Emad
also injuried his hand.

143
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,059
I have no job or fixed income.

144
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:16,222
Like most of the villagers,
I live off the land.

145
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:29,034
In order to keep filming, my friend
Yisrael gives me his camera.

146
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:33,585
Here's the camera.

147
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,776
The sunshade will fall off

148
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,758
if you walk or run while you're shooting.

149
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,490
Otherwise, it works just fine

150
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:52,305
My brother is released
after a month of jail.

151
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,567
He was the first man arrested
since demostrations began.

152
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:38,969
Gibreel's first year flew by.

153
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,357
I observe how every gesture
is an exciting move.

154
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:52,583
I watch him through my camera,

155
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:56,312
trying to rediscover the
world through his eyes.

156
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:06,546
Thanks to our pressure,

157
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,461
we are temporarily allowed

158
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,044
to cross the barrier.

159
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:27,317
When Gibreel pronounces his first words

160
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,619
it is a magical moment.

161
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,850
Where are we?

162
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,373
"Jidar", the wall.

163
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,302
"Matat," cartridge

164
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:44,133
There's a "matat."

165
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:53,216
Watch out!

166
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:57,454
Don't be afraid.

167
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:06,141
- What?
-"Jesh," army.

168
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:09,553
"Jesh." What did they do?

169
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,813
"Jesh," Daddy.

170
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:15,448
Run, run!

171
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:25,721
We walk at our own pace,
taking baby steps,

172
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:28,772
as buildings pop out!

173
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:30,023
of the land.

174
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,096
Hello, Abu-Mohamad (Emad).

175
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,319
Are you getting married?

176
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:55,483
A day of demostration in the village

177
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:59,076
is better than a wedding.

178
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,526
All groups - Spanish,

179
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:34,922
French, German...

180
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:40,297
Bil'in becomes a symbol of popular resistence

181
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:42,044
all over the world.

182
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:48,480
We respond to every political act,

183
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,189
like Israel's attack on Lebanon

184
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:52,849
in 2006.

185
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:55,928
Adeeb and Phil are

186
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,915
always on the front lines.

187
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,934
At least this time, it isn't me!

188
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:18,090
What happened?

189
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,216
They shot your camera?

190
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:45,023
Shoot him!

191
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,174
I'm bleeding!

192
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:00,081
I'm bleeding!

193
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:13,126
Calm down, Adeeb! It's not serious.

194
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,524
Oh, my leg!

195
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:40,817
He could have died!

196
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:43,429
Why do that?

197
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,097
Are you crazy?

198
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,959
You killed him!

199
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:53,310
Take him Don't argue!

200
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:56,285
Go on, take me!

201
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,714
Phil is released in the same day.

202
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:13,194
It takes Adeeb a year to recover.

203
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:15,238
But he never gives up.

204
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:24,459
Adeeb, Phil and I are very different.

205
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:27,738
During the time of demostrations,

206
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:32,478
a close bond develops between us.

207
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:36,714
Through the camera I
see Adeeb's endurance,

208
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,602
Phil's great spirit.

209
00:23:38,902 --> 00:23:42,028
They both have such a love of life

210
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,577
They have a coop but they won't go in it.

211
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:50,824
Everyday - wintertime, summertime...

212
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:54,688
They climb the tree everyday
- Why?

213
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:56,490
They have their freedom!

214
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:05,228
It takes strength to turn anger
into something positive.

215
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:08,637
Phil and I are worried about Adeeb.

216
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:19,815
Wait!

217
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:45,726
My oldest son, Mohamad,
likes to film me.

218
00:24:57,986 --> 00:24:59,898
I look at Soraya. She is a Palestinian

219
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,306
but she grew up in Brazil.

220
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:06,221
She loves picking olives
working the land.

221
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,967
This place ties us together.

222
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:16,189
More than feeding us,
the land connects us.

223
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:13,190
Israel uses lots of techniques
for occupying lands.

224
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:18,160
Some are illegal, even
according to their own laws.

225
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:21,029
One way is allowing settlers

226
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:23,039
to place trailers

227
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:26,079
on Palestine land.

228
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:29,508
Once they do, it becomes fact.

229
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:35,151
So we try to keep them
from placing them.

230
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,550
No way is this going down!

231
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:53,862
I'll bust your ass!
Get lost!

232
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,165
Go on, hit me!

233
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:03,827
Don't touch me!

234
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,552
I'll sue you.
I know who you are.

235
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:13,813
We're non violent.
There's no need for violence!

236
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:17,819
In the end,
they beat us all up

237
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:25,977
You're killing me!

238
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,922
Don't film this!

239
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:32,973
Don't tell us not to film!

240
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,215
We can't keep the settlers

241
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:45,729
from putting down their trailers.

242
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,076
So we have another idea.

243
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:53,715
Why not put down our own trailer

244
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:58,440
on our stolen land
on the other side of the barrier?

245
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,894
Sit down! Let Emad film.

246
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:17,360
Good morning,
Please vacate this land

247
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:25,214
What do you want me to do?

248
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,532
It doesn't take long to move it.

249
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:38,941
So we bring a second one

250
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,052
Only this time,

251
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:52,228
we lock ourselves inside

252
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:30,617
There are people inside!

253
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:35,375
And then the second trailer is removed.

254
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,349
After the trailers,
the settlers build concrete outposts.

255
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:56,590
They make use of a law
that prevents the army

256
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:59,857
from destroying concrete
structures.

257
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:05,183
Once they claim the land,
construction companies can step in.

258
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:14,883
So we decide to use the same law
to hold onto our land.

259
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,661
Throw another one!

260
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:03,226
Daba!

261
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,894
How did you sleep
in the new outpost?

262
00:31:10,297 --> 00:31:13,403
How did you sleep
in the new outpost?

263
00:31:15,412 --> 00:31:16,613
Did you sleep well?

264
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:20,689
Wake up!
The soldiers are here.

265
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:33,319
Why are you filming me?

266
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,072
You just got here.
I was already here.

267
00:31:36,316 --> 00:31:39,463
Did you ever film in your house?

268
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,252
Who cares?
What are you doing here?

269
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:44,729
I'm filming here.

270
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,359
If you point that camera at me again,

271
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:50,066
I'll bust it, okay?

272
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,483
Okay.

273
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:59,705
The settlers retaliate at night

274
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:17,769
The settlers did this!

275
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:20,234
You see, Emad!

276
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:23,161
The olive trees!
What did the olive trees do?

277
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:27,368
This olive tree that prays to God,
what did they do?

278
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:43,425
We have to plant this on our land.

279
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:45,218
Don't swear!

280
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:48,828
I'm just saying no to the wall!

281
00:32:50,513 --> 00:32:52,770
Do it nice and quietly.

282
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,212
We'll plant it

283
00:32:56,512 --> 00:33:01,257
and it'll feed us with olives.

284
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:05,912
We'll destroy you, fence!

285
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,376
No, no to the wall!

286
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,233
A tear gas grenade hits Yisrael.

287
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:02,178
Did it hit your face?

288
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:12,926
What did hey do?

289
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:18,142
Eyad is my second brother
to be arrested.

290
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:39,260
It's an endless cycle.

291
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:54,053
They destroyed our outpost.

292
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:57,734
We're rebuilding it.

293
00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:15,413
it's impressive how Phil and Adeeb

294
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:20,838
can raise morale
even when things seem hopeless

295
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:37,404
The outpost becomes our hangout.

296
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:49,783
I look at Phil and Gibreel.

297
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,388
Something connects them.

298
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:54,037
Something strong
that I can't explain.

299
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:33,963
What's up?

300
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:36,663
What can we do?

301
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:41,754
They're gobbling up
all our land, Emad.

302
00:36:42,054 --> 00:36:46,021
They'll never take down the wall

303
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:49,999
if they can
keep building the settlement.

304
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,463
It's all for nothing!

305
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:21,362
When we get to the settlement!,

306
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:23,530
we see Phil's brother, Daba,

307
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,836
trying to stop construction alone.

308
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,221
Daba never seems too worried.

309
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:46,756
He always has that childlike grin.

310
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,142
I'll sue you!

311
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,451
- Film them.
- You were told not to come here.

312
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,518
- Protect the cameraman!
- I have permission to film.

313
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:04,593
They're attacking me.

314
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:06,167
What's the problem?

315
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,247
I'll file a complaint.

316
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:14,210
Stopo filming!

317
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,961
if he films, I'll break his bones!

318
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:21,715
Tell them to go away.

319
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:25,431
We're not doing anything wrong.

320
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:30,825
What's up, man?

321
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:41,186
The second camera witnessed winter
2006 to spring 2007.

322
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,991
The focus isn't working.

323
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,580
Why won't it turn?

324
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:36,460
As months pass,
Gibreel becomes more and more

325
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,154
sensitive to the world around him.

326
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:52,230
Bil'in keeps demostrating,
week after week.

327
00:40:03,914 --> 00:40:07,322
Where's Israeli TV?

328
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:08,265
Film your soldiers!

329
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:16,810
Now thay Gibreel is old enough
to understand,

330
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,325
he comes to see the demostrations.

331
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:31,611
What are you doing?

332
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:53,051
He sees people he knows
getting arrested

333
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,563
but doesn't understand why

334
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:04,059
Jaffar is my third brother
to be arrested.

335
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:18,878
Close the windows!

336
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:24,325
Close the windows!

337
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:32,567
Then the soldiers came
and started shooting.

338
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:36,078
They were everywhere.

339
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,232
But I wasn't afraid.

340
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:44,747
They were in front of Daddys's car.

341
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:47,064
And you weren't afraid?

342
00:41:47,564 --> 00:41:51,888
Weren't you afraid they'd take you?

343
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,666
Weren't you afraid, Gibreel?

344
00:41:56,866 --> 00:41:57,721
Yes, I was.

345
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:01,651
If there's tear gas,
just smell the onion.

346
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:03,582
You're a hero.

347
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:05,556
- No!
- A hero.

348
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,797
Gibreel's skin is so sensitive,

349
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,423
even the scratch of a sponge
leaves marks on his back.

350
00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:25,293
I hpe he'll develop
a thick skin fast.

351
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,493
The army comes into the village
more and more often.

352
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:46,504
They try to keep people
from demostrating.

353
00:42:59,946 --> 00:43:02,514
When I film,
I feel like the camera

354
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:03,914
protects me.

355
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,615
But it's an illusion.

356
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:14,307
I film my brother Khaled's arrest.

357
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:17,970
My mother and father
try to stop the jeep.

358
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:22,049
I keep thinking,
"What should I do?"

359
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:26,042
I have to believe that capturing
these images

360
00:43:26,535 --> 00:43:28,396
will have some meaning.

361
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,834
Now the soldiers
start comming at night.

362
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,102
Mostly for kids.

363
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:26,737
They're trying to force us to quit.

364
00:44:30,807 --> 00:44:32,961
Welcome to the club, Bil'in!

365
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,048
Go in and shut the door.

366
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,595
How can you arrest a child?

367
00:45:20,738 --> 00:45:23,173
Hush, little baby, don't say a word

368
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:26,441
Mama's gonna trap you a bird

369
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:47,808
Where are you going?

370
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:52,044
Where are you going?

371
00:45:54,964 --> 00:45:56,089
To the wall.

372
00:45:56,689 --> 00:45:59,174
Watch out, you're gonna fall!

373
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:02,977
- Why?
- Because they're taking our land!

374
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:07,604
To take back the land
the army stole!

375
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:13,254
We want to sleep!

376
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:28,724
Stop filming.
Get behind the fence.

377
00:46:40,435 --> 00:46:43,313
You're strong Gibreel.
- Don't be afraid.

378
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:48,687
Look!
They're afraid of a bunch of kids

379
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:05,072
If you go back,
nobody will throw stones at you!

380
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:08,391
This is a small village.

381
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:10,888
Lots of Israelis come here.

382
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:14,136
These people want peace

383
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:16,716
The Israelis are

384
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,924
our cousings, my friend.

385
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,131
If you leave,

386
00:47:21,431 --> 00:47:24,639
we'll go back to our village.

387
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:26,930
What's this?

388
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:05,635
You've wounded and Israeli!

389
00:48:06,273 --> 00:48:08,004
Call an ambulance!

390
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:11,725
He's bleeding!

391
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:25,678
Open up!

392
00:48:58,184 --> 00:48:59,560
Get out of here!

393
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:04,160
There are no kids here!

394
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:24,462
- What?
- They shot your brother, Eyad,

395
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,683
in the shoulder.

396
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:34,866
Let's see your shoulder.

397
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,243
It's not serious.

398
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,367
Sit down and let me see.

399
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:42,021
It's nothing, Mom

400
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:43,897
It's superficial, okay?

401
00:50:04,578 --> 00:50:08,473
Le tme see the brochure
the soldiers distributed.

402
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:15,108
It says, "Stay away from the Wall

403
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:18,520
all day during
friday dimostrations"

404
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,611
So we'll demostrate on Saturdays

405
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:26,564
Let's look at the map

406
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:29,120
This is Bil'in

407
00:50:29,275 --> 00:50:31,840
They took all this.
What's left?

408
00:50:39,806 --> 00:50:42,977
They can't tell us what to do

409
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:46,915
We''ll stop when we decide to stop.

410
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,339
Open up!

411
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,838
Now it's my turn.

412
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:30,538
I take the camera
to protect myself.

413
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:35,408
- I ask you to stop filming.
- I can film in my own house.

414
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:36,952
Show me your I.D.

415
00:51:37,152 --> 00:51:39,569
Get my I.D.

416
00:51:41,023 --> 00:51:43,964
- What's the matter?
- This is a Closed Military Zone.

417
00:51:48,923 --> 00:51:52,986
"The military has declared this area

418
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,217
a Closed Military Zone."

419
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:59,945
"Anyone found
in a Closed Military Zone

420
00:52:00,145 --> 00:52:02,817
must evacuate the area at once.

421
00:52:03,145 --> 00:52:07,159
"No one can enter
or remain on the premises..."

422
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:19,238
You are now in violation
of the order

423
00:52:19,438 --> 00:52:22,977
- I ask you to stop filming.
- I'm a journalist, I can film.

424
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:27,026
This is a Closed Military Zone.
Stop filming.

425
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:28,613
Put down the camera.

426
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:32,319
I'm a journalist
and I'm in my own home.

427
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:36,908
Put down the camera.
That's an order

428
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:40,775
Turn the lens to the wall.

429
00:52:41,649 --> 00:52:44,836
Give it to your son,
He can put it down.

430
00:52:54,977 --> 00:52:56,617
Why is he being taken?

431
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:05,468
The police interrogate me
and accuse me of throwing rocks.

432
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:17,407
I do time in jail.

433
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:22,319
My lawyer gets them to release me

434
00:53:22,834 --> 00:53:26,254
under house arrest.

435
00:53:31,533 --> 00:53:34,129
I'm held in a house outside Bil'in.

436
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:38,343
The camera is pretty much
all I took.

437
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:57,742
He'll talk to you.

438
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:10,455
I'm a psychologist.
I do evaluations for the court.

439
00:54:12,396 --> 00:54:14,304
Is that constantly filming?

440
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:18,139
I'm used to filming.

441
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:22,183
I haven't done it for a while.
Because I was in jail

442
00:54:22,483 --> 00:54:25,074
and now I'm under house arrest.

443
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,500
It's been a month now.

444
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:32,223
I've got nothing to do here,
so I film.

445
00:54:40,933 --> 00:54:43,335
Nature gives me new vitality.

446
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,130
I know I have a purpose in life.

447
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:53,230
The price may be high
but the path I've chosen

448
00:54:55,494 --> 00:54:58,756
is the one meant for me.
It's my destiny.

449
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:07,653
After a while, I'm back in Bil'in.

450
00:55:07,953 --> 00:55:13,233
My case is closed.
They claim they lost the evidence

451
00:55:22,462 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm happy to see that people

452
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,959
continue to meet at the outpost.

453
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:36,263
Through our lawsuit
against the barrier,

454
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:41,343
we,ve discovered a lot about the land

455
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:45,268
on the other side of the barrier.

456
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,177
We found out that

457
00:55:49,477 --> 00:55:53,668
all the construction was illegal.

458
00:55:55,004 --> 00:55:58,276
We have a warrant
to stop construction

459
00:55:58,476 --> 00:56:01,961
and prohibit occupation
of the new buildings.

460
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:10,603
I'm off to the demostration.

461
00:56:11,343 --> 00:56:15,127
But, Emad, It's a holy day.
No, not today!

462
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:18,910
Haven't you had enough problems?

463
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,751
Don't go!
I want us to be together.

464
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:26,177
It's a holy day
There's no demostration.

465
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:30,496
Enough with the filming!

466
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,443
I have to go on filming.

467
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:58,236
All I can hear is
Phil's voice in my other ear.

468
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,107
Your camera's busted.

469
00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:19,767
My third camera
may have saved my life.

470
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:24,376
The bullet is lodged in it,

471
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:28,323
as a remainder of life's fragility.

472
00:57:37,652 --> 00:57:40,882
The third camera sustained 
from winter 2007 to winter 2008

473
00:57:43,785 --> 00:57:46,814
During this time, it was shot
and repaired twice.

474
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:57,479
I wanna see it.

475
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,949
- Where you going?
- To the snow.

476
00:58:10,702 --> 00:58:15,517
I have to find the inner strength
to keep on doing

477
00:58:15,717 --> 00:58:17,798
all the good things we like to do.

478
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:24,771
Daba, get up!

479
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:33,905
Time passes.

480
00:58:34,205 --> 00:58:36,838
People keep demostrating
on Fridays.

481
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:41,725
But the barrier wends it's way
to other villages.

482
00:58:42,626 --> 00:58:48,729
People feel that nothing will stop
the occupation from its course.

483
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:55,686
So I decide to do something

484
00:58:55,986 --> 00:58:57,497
to boost morale.

485
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:06,600
Screening my footage
allows the villagers

486
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,511
to gain some distance
from those events.

487
00:59:13,089 --> 00:59:15,522
I think it contributes

488
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:18,274
to the solidarity among us.

489
00:59:20,335 --> 00:59:24,448
It encourages them
to get more villages

490
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,204
to start protesting.

491
00:59:31,827 --> 00:59:34,485
By 2008, many new villages,

492
00:59:34,685 --> 00:59:36,559
alla across the West Banck

493
00:59:36,759 --> 00:59:38,448
adopt the Bil'in struggle

494
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:42,086
as a model for a new
kind of resistance.

495
00:59:48,942 --> 00:59:53,210
The Israeli government
fears that the protest

496
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,783
will become a third Intifada.

497
00:59:57,203 --> 00:59:59,525
The army is under pressure.

498
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:08,982
Someone is shot dead in Nil'in,
a nearby village.

499
01:00:10,919 --> 01:00:14,049
So we all go to show our support.

500
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,729
In the middle of the chaos in 
Nil'in,

501
01:00:53,677 --> 01:00:56,556
they take Daba
and shoot him in the leg.

502
01:01:13,765 --> 01:01:16,518
The soldiers use a lots of gas

503
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,385
and live ammunition.

504
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:21,670
Snipers surround the village.

505
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:39,251
We have children here!

506
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:56,459
From Nil'in to Bil'in!

507
01:01:58,379 --> 01:02:00,764
We're one with Bil'in!

508
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,934
From Bil'in to Beiruth!

509
01:02:15,248 --> 01:02:18,406
An 11 -year- old boy
is killed in Nil'in.

510
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:22,939
Snipers shot him near his home.

511
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:40,329
Immediatly after the funeral,
a 17 -year- old boy is also killed.

512
01:02:41,556 --> 01:02:46,368
Clinging to nonviolent ideals
isn't easy...

513
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,787
when dead is alla around.

514
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:03,189
These images
bring back old memories.

515
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:08,265
Memories I'd rather keep
from my children.

516
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:19,691
Danger is creeping closer.

517
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,423
I'm thinking about my children.

518
01:03:25,129 --> 01:03:26,694
I want to protect them.

519
01:03:27,021 --> 01:03:30,762
But the occupation
always catches you off guard.

520
01:03:32,588 --> 01:03:35,088
They have to become tough men.

521
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:57,103
Phil is the only one
who's still optimistic.

522
01:03:59,192 --> 01:04:01,283
He's like his nickname,
"the elephant"

523
01:04:02,454 --> 01:04:05,870
Strong and thick-skinned.

524
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,244
But he's a gentle man.

525
01:04:10,548 --> 01:04:14,565
He seems so sure
that things will work out.

526
01:04:33,468 --> 01:04:36,269
That's when we get good news.

527
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:44,392
We're reinforced
by the Israeli court decision

528
01:04:45,834 --> 01:04:49,047
to dismantle a section
of the barrier.

529
01:05:37,452 --> 01:05:39,165
A year after that moment of joy,

530
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:45,268
There is no physical evidence
of the court's decision.

531
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:50,865
I've been waiting for 4 hours.

532
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,495
I don't know where I am.

533
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:43,155
So much land has been destroyed.

534
01:06:47,848 --> 01:06:49,581
I feel dizzy.

535
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:19,769
Two o'clock in Bil'in!

536
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,158
We're all in rebellion.

537
01:07:41,315 --> 01:07:45,752
Then the truck I'm driving
crashes into the barrier.

538
01:07:50,422 --> 01:07:55,311
These are the last images
recorded by my fourth camera.

539
01:07:58,432 --> 01:08:01,610
The fourth camera operated
all of 2008.

540
01:08:08,176 --> 01:08:11,884
I could die but no one realizes it.

541
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,971
I can't help feeling

542
01:08:19,855 --> 01:08:22,896
that I crashed
because of the barrier.

543
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:27,141
But crashing into it
probably saved my life.

544
01:08:28,156 --> 01:08:32,294
Then the soldiers have to take me
to an Isreali hospital.

545
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:43,061
Take him to a hospital in Israel

546
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:51,016
On one hand
I know it's a God's decision.

547
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:56,718
On the other, if I had been taken to
an average Palestinian hospital,

548
01:08:57,144 --> 01:08:59,895
I probably wouldn't have survived.

549
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:07,951
Much of my body is severely
injured.

550
01:09:09,364 --> 01:09:12,069
I lose consciousness for 20 days.

551
01:09:24,117 --> 01:09:26,974
When I wake up 
in the Tel Aviv hospital,

552
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:29,694
Israel is beginning

553
01:09:29,994 --> 01:09:33,594
its massive attack on Gaza
of late 2008

554
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:44,163
My recovery is just a drop
in that sea of violence.

555
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:02,972
Two months later, I go home

556
01:10:03,209 --> 01:10:05,710
without much of a welcome.

557
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,918
People are in mourning for Gaza.

558
01:10:20,644 --> 01:10:21,737
Daddy!

559
01:10:36,559 --> 01:10:38,048
What's up, Gibreel?

560
01:10:47,261 --> 01:10:52,103
The doctor say I can never
do physical work again.

561
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:56,051
I'm not an Isreali citizen,

562
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:58,696
so I have huge hospital bills.

563
01:10:58,896 --> 01:11:00,450
I have to find funding

564
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,532
to continue my treatment.

565
01:11:02,732 --> 01:11:07,156
The Palestinian Authority
doesn't consider my accident

566
01:11:07,456 --> 01:11:09,157
to be resistance-related.

567
01:11:10,512 --> 01:11:14,573
If you don't fit
the resistance image,

568
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:16,799
you're on your own.

569
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:36,241
Lots of people use symbols
for political profit

570
01:11:39,578 --> 01:11:44,218
Whether it's a symbol of Bil'in
or a symbol of a Palestinian state.

571
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:50,449
Bil'in is attracting
more politicians of all stripes.

572
01:11:57,326 --> 01:12:01,039
I film Adeeb onserving them
from behing.

573
01:12:01,574 --> 01:12:04,700
I'm sure he doesn't like it.

574
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:12,906
I'd rather be with the real people.

575
01:12:21,143 --> 01:12:25,493
Will you get back
some of your land now?

576
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,381
No, none of it.

577
01:12:27,581 --> 01:12:28,756
There's no way?

578
01:12:29,056 --> 01:12:32,348
They've built buildings on it.

579
01:12:35,152 --> 01:12:38,757
- There are no olive trees left?
- They're all gone.

580
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:44,248
If they move the wall back
just one yard,

581
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:46,802
we'll have succeeded.

582
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:52,827
We've been waiting here
for a change for 4 years.

583
01:12:53,227 --> 01:12:56,706
We want to see them retreat!

584
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:07,452
New settlres are allowed
to move into the buildings,

585
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:11,847
on the land we lost,

586
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:15,004
with the permission
of the Isreali court.

587
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:19,035
Get the furniture here fast.

588
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:20,543
Hang the mezuzah

589
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,797
to stablish ownership

590
01:13:44,423 --> 01:13:47,245
I meet Phil, watching the
World Cup

591
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:50,311
with the kids at the outpost.

592
01:13:53,017 --> 01:13:57,246
He still dreams about
fixing the world.

593
01:14:14,002 --> 01:14:17,257
But dreming can be dangerous.

594
01:14:22,496 --> 01:14:26,676
Gibreel is 4 years old now,
so is Bil'in's resistance.

595
01:14:28,904 --> 01:14:32,271
The only protection
I can offer him

596
01:14:34,312 --> 01:14:38,183
is allowing him to see everything
with his own eyes,

597
01:14:44,715 --> 01:14:47,575
just how vulnerable life is.

598
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:12,605
Soldier!

599
01:15:13,605 --> 01:15:17,499
Don't shoot!
Go back home!

600
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:22,178
If you kill anyone
you'll be responsible!

601
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:45,840
Back then, I didn't realize

602
01:15:48,231 --> 01:15:50,958
that death was hovering over us.

603
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:54,262
Officer, you shot an Israeli girl!

604
01:15:54,514 --> 01:15:56,391
it only became clear to me...

605
01:16:00,062 --> 01:16:01,805
when Phil was killed

606
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:19,536
Stop shooting!

607
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:16,651
At night, Daba hangs posters
of his martyred brother.

608
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:52,939
The entire village is in shock.

609
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:43,186
Maybe it's just the kids
who were Phil's friends

610
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:44,893
like my kids

611
01:18:46,525 --> 01:18:48,462
who still can't digest it.

612
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:53,027
They kiss him goodbye
but it will take weeks

613
01:18:54,695 --> 01:18:58,870
for hate and anger
to rise from within

614
01:19:06,078 --> 01:19:08,298
When someone dies,

615
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:10,077
the anger is so overwhelming

616
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:13,750
that people's feelings erupt

617
01:19:14,812 --> 01:19:17,702
and they're ready to die.

618
01:19:30,844 --> 01:19:33,715
Where's your heart?

619
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:38,528
Your commander has no heart!

620
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,320
Why are you doing this?

621
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:48,598
I wanna die!
Like that!

622
01:19:48,855 --> 01:19:51,878
Let me have it!
I wanna die!

623
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,789
This is our land!

624
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:02,660
Daddy...

625
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:13,882
Why don't you kill the soldiers
with a knife?

626
01:20:14,105 --> 01:20:16,652
Because they'd shoot me.

627
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:22,674
Will there be any left?

628
01:20:23,231 --> 01:20:25,241
There will be.

629
01:20:25,952 --> 01:20:28,083
Why do you want to hurt them?

630
01:20:28,514 --> 01:20:30,338
Because they shot my Phil

631
01:20:30,538 --> 01:20:32,732
Why did they shoot Phil?

632
01:20:33,318 --> 01:20:39,196
What did he do to them?

633
01:20:43,065 --> 01:20:46,477
We all lose our childhood
at some point.

634
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,274
Like Daba lost his childlike grin.

635
01:21:02,204 --> 01:21:06,488
But while we erase
every piece of our childhood,

636
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,921
it's the angers that remains.

637
01:21:12,178 --> 01:21:14,361
All together!

638
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:18,833
Gaza and the West Banck!

639
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:33,805
I think about the children
like my son Gibreel.

640
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:36,068
Or Adeeb's son

641
01:21:36,268 --> 01:21:40,196
on the day his father
was arrested and sent to jail.

642
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:46,279
How will they be able
to bear their anger?

643
01:21:48,831 --> 01:21:51,050
Release my father!

644
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:57,006
Release my father!

645
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:43,292
Shortly after that
I receive an arrested warrant.

646
01:22:46,151 --> 01:22:47,538
What did they say?

647
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:52,234
They said they were going
to arrest me again tonight.

648
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,346
What will you do?

649
01:22:54,746 --> 01:22:56,025
What can I do?

650
01:22:56,278 --> 01:23:00,973
See what's happening to us
because of your filming!

651
01:23:01,273 --> 01:23:04,060
Now they're taking you!

652
01:23:04,436 --> 01:23:06,329
You nevver know what they're up to!

653
01:23:06,526 --> 01:23:12,671
If they take you,
what'll we do, the kids and I?

654
01:23:13,525 --> 01:23:16,353
You saw what they did to you before

655
01:23:16,653 --> 01:23:18,133
But you never learn!

656
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:22,629
I've told you to stop
a thousand times!

657
01:23:23,282 --> 01:23:27,071
Stay home with our kids
and find something else to do!

658
01:23:27,171 --> 01:23:30,530
Why didn't you?
Why, Emad?

659
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:33,269
If they come, what will we do?

660
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:35,989
What will I do?

661
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,613
And the kids?

662
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:42,672
It happened once, twice...

663
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:45,233
I can't take this a third time!

664
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:49,562
Stop!
Enough with the filming!

665
01:23:50,062 --> 01:23:52,766
I'm so tired!

666
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:54,950
Stop with the filming!

667
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:06,247
Emad, what are you doing?

668
01:24:10,303 --> 01:24:13,736
There's not many soldiers today
Why?

669
01:24:14,029 --> 01:24:15,905
They're tearing down the fence.

670
01:24:16,205 --> 01:24:19,188
- You think so?
- Yeah, I do.

671
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:22,721
- So no tear gas today?
- No tear gas!

672
01:24:23,821 --> 01:24:25,936
For the first time in 5 years?

673
01:24:57,876 --> 01:25:00,239
The speed of an M16 bullet is...

674
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,602
2,800 feet per second.

675
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,115
it takes the bullet 3 milliseconds

676
01:25:14,017 --> 01:25:16,078
to hit my camera.

677
01:25:19,442 --> 01:25:21,281
In that flash of time.

678
01:25:23,212 --> 01:25:24,688
before the experience

679
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,644
becomes a memory,

680
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,189
everything I know vanishes.

681
01:25:38,603 --> 01:25:41,445
The fifth camera
lasted from winter 2009

682
01:25:41,545 --> 01:25:44,485
to spring 2010.
It was smashed by a soldier

683
01:25:44,685 --> 01:25:47,050
and repaired
before veing shot.

684
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:04,382
It's been a year
that Adeeb's been in jail.

685
01:26:19,887 --> 01:26:23,398
The court's decision
begins to be implemented.

686
01:26:26,009 --> 01:26:27,684
The barrier is dismantled.

687
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:49,224
It's a victory,
however small, for the village.

688
01:27:00,706 --> 01:27:04,383
A concrete wall is being built
further from our village.

689
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,601
Some lands will be returned
to the owners

690
01:27:11,558 --> 01:27:15,158
but Bil'in continues
to resist the new wall.

691
01:27:42,515 --> 01:27:44,887
Barriers can be removed

692
01:27:45,525 --> 01:27:49,498
but the land will always
bear the scars.

693
01:27:58,472 --> 01:28:01,264
Gibreel has grown
from a baby into a boy.

694
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:05,234
That means letting go of innocence.

695
01:28:06,427 --> 01:28:09,750
This rapid coming of age
saddens me a bit.

696
01:28:22,426 --> 01:28:25,194
Healing is a challenge in life.

697
01:28:29,355 --> 01:28:32,578
It's a victim's sole obligation.

698
01:28:35,278 --> 01:28:37,845
By healing, you resist oppression.

699
01:28:43,163 --> 01:28:46,050
But when I'm hurt
over and over again,

700
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:50,374
I forget the wounds
that rule my life.

701
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:55,220
Forgotten wounds can't be healed.

702
01:28:57,588 --> 01:29:00,322
So I film to heal.

703
01:29:04,758 --> 01:29:08,410
I know they may knock at my door
at any moment.

704
01:29:09,867 --> 01:29:11,907
But I'll just keep filming.

705
01:29:14,532 --> 01:29:16,868
It helps me confront life

706
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:18,916
and survive.

707
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:32,655
Gibreel, do you want
to go to the sea?

708
01:29:36,635 --> 01:29:38,046
Say you want to!

709
01:29:38,246 --> 01:29:40,230
Daddy leave me alone.

710
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:43,563
Yes, I want to.

711
01:29:49,299 --> 01:29:51,725
For my last treatment in Tel Aviv,

712
01:29:52,025 --> 01:29:55,857
Gibreel and Taki-Ydin
are allowed to come with me.

713
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,349
I've waited for this for so long

714
01:30:36,351 --> 01:30:38,294
What are you so happy about?

715
01:30:38,494 --> 01:30:40,399
The sea!

716
01:31:07,675 --> 01:31:10,360
The sixth camera witnessed spring 2010.
At the last day of filming

717
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:15,179
the destruction of the wall,
Emad was hit by a stun grenade

718
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:28,129
