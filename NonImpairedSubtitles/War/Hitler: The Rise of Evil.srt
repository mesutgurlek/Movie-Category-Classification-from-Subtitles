1
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,892
Parsifal is the German ideal.

2
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,785
A combination of stength,
determination and purity.

3
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,606
Hello, gentlemen!

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,242
My son, Adolf.

5
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:48,593
That used to be my desk
before I retired,

6
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:52,849
which is why you need to apply
yourself at school.

7
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,730
Stupid old fool.

8
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,466
He's perfectly normal for a boy his age.

9
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:01,853
He's God's curse on me
for marrying my niece.

10
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,780
Uncle, don't be absurd.

11
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,041
You'll get what you want in the end.

12
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:29,143
You'll be a painter, an artist...

13
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:34,010
anything you want.
Oh, my little genius.

14
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:50,924
You little bastard.
You burned my beehives again!

15
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,764
Uncle. Do you know what I think?

16
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:09,241
I think, we should
take him out of school.

17
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,673
He's so talented an artist

18
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:14,660
and what does he need
with science and mathematics?

19
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,375
Uncle?

20
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,336
Uncle. What is it?

21
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,505
Oh. My God!

22
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:32,887
Adi. Adi, quickly.
Come help me with your father. Uncle?

23
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:36,390
- I' m going to Vienna, Mother.
- What?

24
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:40,102
I want to see opera. Great opera.

25
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:43,064
I want to study at the Fine Arts Academy.

26
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:47,443
It's too far. You'll get lost.

27
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:51,364
I' ve heard too many stories
of Jews and gypsies taking advantage.

28
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,035
I am not a boy, Mother!

29
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:03,376
She's very sick.
She won't live until Christmas.

30
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,548
She has cancer of the breast.

31
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,054
It's a lie.

32
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:17,181
I know it's hard.

33
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:21,018
She'll do anything to ruin my career.

34
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:26,315
You may begin.

35
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:31,988
At the end of 30 minutes, I will collect
the sketches. And this time tomorrow,

36
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:37,118
the names of those who have passed this part
of the exmination will be posted on the door.

37
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:39,829
Did you do well
in your drawing exam?

38
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:47,712
Were you accepted?

39
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:53,134
Someday I shall be a great artist, Mother.

40
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:55,386
I know you will.

41
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,889
Angela...

42
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,602
... I know he's only your half-brother...

43
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:07,356
... but I want you to take care of him
as if he were your own.

44
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,234
He's so sensitive.

45
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,738
I don't know how he'll survive
without me.

46
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,282
Yes.

47
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,992
Amen.

48
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:35,676
Adi, I know it's hard,
but you have to be brave.

49
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,595
Don't tell me how to feel.

50
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,393
You didn't love her.

51
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,563
She was only your stepmother.

52
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,941
You wouldn't know how to love anyone.

53
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:52,902
You're just a lump, a peasant.

54
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:57,156
God for nothing
but breeding more bitches like you.

55
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:06,499
I'm sorry, Herr Hitler.
You don't have a style.

56
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:09,460
Your people are like buildings.
There's no life to them.

57
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:13,381
Perhaps if you tried architecture
or theatrical design. I'm truly sorry.

58
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:15,383
I have a class to teach.

59
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,511
Best of luck...

60
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,884
I'm all right. I'm just waiting
for my inheritance, that's all.

61
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,554
It's the Jews' fault, you know.

62
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:05,016
They swarm into our country,
steal the bread from our tables.

63
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,934
Just ask our mayor.

64
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,603
Well said, Herr Doctor!

65
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:12,231
- They are wolves.
- Hear, hear!

66
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:14,817
Beasts of prey in human form!

67
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,326
Soup! Soup!

68
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,671
It's all their fault, you know.

69
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:39,800
They swarm into our country,
take the food from our mouths.

70
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,347
And here we are, German and hungry.

71
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:49,393
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry, I thought...

72
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:53,147
I thought you were a Jew.
You look like one.

73
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:17,922
Come on. Wake up!
Out of your bed. Come on.

74
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,342
You've got ten minutes to get out of here!

75
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,534
"My dearest sister...

76
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:50,830
My studies are going very well here.
My art is getting a lot of attention.

77
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,957
I'll be famous before you know it.

78
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,961
I look forward to my upcoming birthday
when my inheritance is due.

79
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,213
I wonder could you bring it in person?

80
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:03,634
I'll wait for you in the railway station.
Under the big clock."

81
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,311
Adi? It's you.

82
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:15,438
Angela.

83
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:19,317
Godness, what happened?
I thought you said you were doing fine.

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,444
A bit of bad luck...
Do you have it?

85
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:25,823
I wish you would have said something.
You could have come home.

86
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,783
Say hello to your Uncle Dolf, Geli.

87
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:33,748
She's a shy girl,
but very affectionate.

88
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:40,421
Well, it's the Jews. It's the Jews. They run
the galleries and won't buy my paintings.

89
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:44,133
The Poles... they work... or next to nothing,
so I can't get a job.

90
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:48,429
That's terrible. You know,
there's plenty of work in Linz.

91
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:51,057
- Oh, you must be joking.
- No, I'm serious.

92
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:55,770
Here. Happy birthday.

93
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:58,648
Our father worked hard for this.

94
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:04,987
Linz - it's the last place I would go.

95
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:09,242
You can't stay here.

96
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:13,162
Of course not. The sooner I leave
this Babylon of races the better.

97
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:15,289
I'm off where the real Germans are.

98
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:32,155
War! War! Austrian Archduke's
assassination leads to war!

99
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:36,694
Come closer.

100
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:40,974
Let me speak!

101
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:45,747
England, France and Russia
are joining forces against our ally Austria.

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,044
We must stand with her,

103
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,783
united, ready to sacrifice.

104
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:55,991
Our lives are nothing.
Our country is everything.

105
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,425
We are now only Germans!

106
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:20,052
War! War! War! War!

107
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:35,722
I need one of you men
to deliver a message.

108
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,180
- Here, sergeant!
- Stay down. Stay down.

109
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:49,756
Take this to Lieutenant Guttman
at the command post. Wait for a reply.

110
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,460
Sit. Foxl, sit.

111
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,492
Sit!

112
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:30,270
Looks like your fiancee's got
a mind of her own, Adi.

113
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:35,937
Foxl, sit! Sit!

114
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,537
You make a fool out of me.

115
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,303
You try to humiliate me.

116
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:54,838
You must learn... to... sit... down!

117
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:56,266
That's enough.

118
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:12,610
Everyone was killed.
The entire coompany wiped out.

119
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:16,624
The entire company - except me, of course.

120
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:21,212
Even my dog, my little Foxl.

121
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:25,508
Just seconds before the bomb landed,

122
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:27,635
she led me outside as if she knew.

123
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,308
She's so loving, so affectionate...

124
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:37,228
and then in one brief moment... she's gone.

125
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:40,148
No, she's not.

126
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,191
I think... she's in the stew.

127
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:48,134
Pacifists. Marxists.

128
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,137
Socialists.

129
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,139
Jews.

130
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:57,852
They call themselves Communist now
and they're everywhere -

131
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,938
exept here at the front.

132
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:04,108
Who pissed in your brain?

133
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,611
Please.

134
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:09,489
Do you know any Jew soldiers? Hm?

135
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:12,367
Look around you. Do you see any?

136
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,703
I'm a Jew, Adi...

137
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:17,872
so shut up and eat.

138
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:37,517
This has to get through as soon as possible.
We don't have much time left. It's dangerous.

139
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,770
If either of you makes it,
you'll deserve an Iron Cross.

140
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,272
- Yes, sir.
- Go with God.

141
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,071
- Yes, Corporal?
- Nothing, sir.

142
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,166
I followed your orders, sir.

143
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,045
I deserve this medal.
I risked my life.

144
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,381
We all risk our lives - every day.

145
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:11,509
- You gave me your word, Lieutenant.
- Believe me, if it was up to me...

146
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:13,386
I did believe you.

147
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,472
Anyone else would have laughed.

148
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:24,147
- What do you mean by that?
- I've always stood up for your people.

149
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,817
When anyone said,
"Oh, you can't trust them"...

150
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,322
... I pointed to you, sir.

151
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:50,381
Take a deep breath, gents.
You can almost smell the French perfume.

152
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,801
- Wait till We get to Paris.
- Attention! Sir!

153
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,682
Good evening, gentlemen. I'm here to tell you
you'll all be packing out in the morning.

154
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:05,224
- We're being deployed to the eastern front.
- But, sir, we're only 50km from Paris.

155
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,126
They'll think..we're on the retreat.

156
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:10,652
Those are General Hindenburg's orders,
Corporal.

157
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:15,239
There's your prize.
Now go tell the men on the front lines.

158
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:16,866
Sir!

159
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,411
This is no way to win a war.

160
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:28,502
Mustard gas!

161
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,850
Masks on!
Mustard gas!

162
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:42,551
Masks on!
Mustard gas!

163
00:15:56,454 --> 00:16:00,491
You're not blind, Corporal.
Gas wouldn't do that.

164
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,996
It irritates the eyes, swells the lids.

165
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:08,335
Once we have these bandages off,
you will see as well as ever.

166
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,592
I have to get back!
I have to get back... to the front.

167
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,879
- A message, Herr Doctor.
- To push!

168
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:26,056
Gentlemen...
may I have your attention?

169
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:32,645
Earlier today, the army high command
agreed to negotiate the terms of surrender.

170
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,001
The war is over.

171
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,782
No!

172
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,100
We must place ourselves now
at the mercy of the victors...

173
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,547
Shut up! Shut up!

174
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:42,631
... and pray they will be generous.

175
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,209
Shut up!

176
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,223
It isn't the end.

177
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,522
It's the beginning.

178
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,159
Down with the Kaiser!

179
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,776
Death to the Kaiser!

180
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:25,078
We're all together, comrades!

181
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:31,963
Death to the Kaiser!

182
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:21,177
The Free Corps Militia led by Captain
Ernst Röhm and others, took back the city today

183
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:23,054
after a tense two weeks of Communist rule.

184
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,708
What happens now that Germany's
best-kept secret is out -

185
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:31,782
that the demobilised soldiers of the war
are still active and armed in our countrysides?

186
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:35,360
- Herr Gerlich, you'll be late.
- Don't worry, Frau Schmidt.

187
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:37,249
These things never start on time.

188
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:42,165
With the collapse of the monarchy
and now the Communist regime,

189
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:44,646
what new form of government awaits us?

190
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:49,360
Deep feelings of nationalistic pride
are springing up against...

191
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:53,360
No, no... in defiance of the Communists,

192
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:57,440
the allies of anyone
who thinks Germany is finished.

193
00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:01,037
All right, everybody. Come on now.
Let's get started. Let's get started.

194
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:05,593
What are you doing here?

195
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,793
Sorry. Sorry.

196
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,423
- Judge.
- Ah, Herr Gerlich.

197
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:21,600
Good day for the news, bad for a wedding.
Thank you for waiting.

198
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:24,569
I couldn't very well start without you.

199
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:32,832
Officially the Reds are gone but
the army needs to make sure they stay gone.

200
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:37,358
It's my job as head of Army lnformation
to prevent the sort of civil unrest

201
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,690
that happened last spring
from happening again.

202
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,277
I gather you're very outspoken
in your nationalist leanings.

203
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,074
- I believe in Germany, sir.
- Good.

204
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,083
There are nearly 50 political factions
in this  city at the moment

205
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:55,138
and I use informants to identify the more
aggressive ones. Does this interest you?

206
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,504
- Informing, sir?

207
00:19:57,025 --> 00:20:02,464
One of these groups is the German Workers'
Party led by a man called Anton Drexler.

208
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,842
They gather in the
back room of a beer hall.

209
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:10,370
Just an excuse to have a drink I expect but...
pay them a visit and tell me what they're planning.

210
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,301
- I don't drink, sir.
- Just listen then.

211
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,075
But interest equals slavery.

212
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:24,681
The Berlin-centred economy,
which is currently collapsing...

213
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,889
... leaves us no other choice than to declare
Bavarian independence.

214
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,412
- Waiter, two more beers.

215
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:39,988
The state of Bavaria must separate from the rest
of Germany and form its own nation.

216
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:41,295
Insane.

217
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:46,984
Of course, we are a different society.

218
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,200
We are predominantly Catholic.
They are not.

219
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,416
We're all German.

220
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,437
Culturally, perhaps, there are similarities,
but even there...

221
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:03,381
What about Parsifal? Lohengrin?

222
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:09,759
Young man, I'm talking about
reality not fairy tales.

223
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:15,346
You're talking about the purity
of the German people... which is no fairy tale.

224
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:23,310
- As I was saying. Interest equals...
- Find out who he is.

225
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,064
- What's this?
- It's my report on the German Workers' Party, sir.

226
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:31,833
I only asked for a few words.

227
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,108
They've asked me if I'd like to join.

228
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,913
I haven't... accepted yet.

229
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,652
Should we be concerned about them?
That's all I need to know.

230
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,703
It's club life of the lowest form, sir.

231
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,085
But I like the underlying politics.

232
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:49,816
"The Nationalist agenda
must include elimination of the Jews."

233
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:54,196
What's this have to do with your report?

234
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:58,422
Just some thoughts of my own I added.

235
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,008
You disagree?

236
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:03,156
- It's just not feasible.
- Oh, it's very feasible, sir.

237
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:06,599
Just drive them out.
Deport them if necessary.

238
00:22:08,632 --> 00:22:10,149
Can you imagine a world without them?

239
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:12,621
How pure.

240
00:22:13,572 --> 00:22:14,801
How holy.

241
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,567
Do you think...
there are any Jews in Valhalla?

242
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,675
Do you have my papers, Mayr?

243
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:27,367
Yes, Captain Röhm.

244
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:31,919
I should like to introduce you
to Corporal Hitler, sir.

245
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,333
He's one of our informants.

246
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,688
If you'll excuse us, Corporal.

247
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:46,406
He's an odd one, isn't he?

248
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:54,057
It is my pleasure to introduce to you
our guest speaker for this evening.

249
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:59,521
Many of you may remember him
by his comments at our last meeting.

250
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:04,666
So please welcome Herr Adolf...

251
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:06,883
... Adolf Hitler.

252
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:20,821
When I was a boy, I heard the story...

253
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,848
Louder.

254
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,352
... I heard the story of the Holy Grail...

255
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:33,342
.. and how it could only be found
by one who was pure of heart.

256
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,651
Indeed, we have a history of purity
in this country.

257
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:43,346
But we have fallen on hard times.

258
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:46,044
Our military is in tatters.

259
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,798
Our economy collapsing.

260
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:54,580
But it's not poverty or weakness
that's our problem...

261
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,619
- Speak up.
-... it's indifference.

262
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,208
Is anyone listening?

263
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:02,932
That's the problem nowadays, isn't it?

264
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,305
No-one cares.

265
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,261
No wonder we face extinction.

266
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,752
Pride...

267
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:20,879
pride is a weapon.

268
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:24,007
A sword to be used against our enemies.

269
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:27,969
But don't be deceived. They are strong.

270
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:29,930
Stronger than we are.

271
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:33,850
And it's not the French or the English
I'm talking about.

272
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,685
Our enemies...

273
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,813
live among us.

274
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:45,111
Socialists.

275
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:47,239
Communists.

276
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:52,869
The foreign invaders who come to our country
to destroy us and take over our lives!

277
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:08,885
In the six months since the fall
of the Communist government.

278
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:12,722
the new German democracy has given birth
to dozens of political factions.

279
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:16,977
But none is growing more rapidly
than the German Workers' Party.

280
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,149
newly dubbed
the Party of the National Socialists,

281
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:24,276
whose fiery speaker...

282
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,112
... Adolf Hitler...

283
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:32,784
... preaches against the influence
of foreign invaders.

284
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:37,539
Who alone are responsible for the moral
decadence that now riddles our society?

285
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:41,042
- The Jews!
- The Jews! Yes!

286
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:46,590
Who call themselves German,
and who are now, and who have always been

287
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:49,468
unwelcome, unwanted,
and they are everywhere.

288
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:58,518
Invading our government, stripping us of our
savings, raping our families and our heritage.

289
00:25:58,602 --> 00:26:02,898
I tell you friends, this is war -
a war that is soon to turn.

290
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:05,859
For the invaders will become the victims!

291
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,633
Hello?

292
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:33,712
Frieda.

293
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:35,839
Herr Hanfstaengl.

294
00:26:35,922 --> 00:26:38,299
Oh, it's good to see you.

295
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:40,885
Look... at you.

296
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:43,847
- Who's this? Is this little Egon?
- Mm-hm.

297
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,808
He looks just like you did
when you were his age.

298
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:49,561
Frieda, this is my wife Helene.

299
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:54,607
She was raised in America, but don't worry,
she's bred from good German stock...

300
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,527
- Her family's from Bremen.
- Oh, how do you do, Frau Hanfstaengl.

301
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,280
I apologise for the mess.
I'll have it clean by morning.

302
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:03,116
Frieda, don't worry yourself. It's lovely.

303
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,744
- lt'll be just fine.
- Would you like to hold him?

304
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:07,871
Yes, I'd love it.

305
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,248
Ssh.

306
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:12,083
- He's so gorgeous.
- Come.

307
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,847
Do you like it?

308
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,604
It's extraordinary.

309
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:37,359
- It's everything that you promised.
- And this isn't the half of it.

310
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:40,028
There are such opportunities
here for us now.

311
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:46,242
Germany is starting to rebuild itself
and we... are going to make pots of money.

312
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:49,509
Darling, it's impolite to talk about money.

313
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:53,700
It'll be good for the country, too.
Wait till you hear my plans.

314
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:58,213
Don't bother me with your plans.
You just let me handle the dinner parties.

315
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:05,319
Hitler! Hitler! Hitler! Hitler!

316
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:19,291
Sit down.

317
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,677
Where have you been?
It's almost time to start.

318
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:34,264
Oh, and come in the front next time,
where people can see you.

319
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:36,391
My supporters would slow me down.

320
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:39,228
- It seems a little empty tonight.
- Nonsense.

321
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,355
The crowd is bigger than last time.

322
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:45,609
Unfortunately, there are
some Communists out there.

323
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:50,489
So, go easy on the rhetoric.
A riot would only get us in the papers.

324
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:53,617
Isn't that what we want?

325
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:12,511
Universal military service
shall be abolished in Germany.

326
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:20,936
Germany will pay war reparations for all damage
done to Allied civilians and their property.

327
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:24,731
Responsibility for the outbreak of the war...

328
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:28,819
... rests solely on German shoulders.

329
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:34,199
But a few of the demands
of the Treaty of Versailles.

330
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,954
Impossible, you say.

331
00:29:39,037 --> 00:29:41,081
It will break us.

332
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:43,870
But don't you see, that's the point?

333
00:29:44,556 --> 00:29:46,558
They want to break... us.

334
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:48,560
And who do I mean by "them"?

335
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:51,729
I mean the Reds.

336
00:29:53,648 --> 00:29:58,903
These fools who spread a disease called
Communism to empty-headed dreamers.

337
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:01,114
- Look who's talking.
- Right! Rubbish!

338
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:03,533
The most effective medicine is a bullet.

339
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:07,078
That's the best way
to cure us of these idiots.

340
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:09,454
- ldiots are men like you with nothing to say!
- Shut up!

341
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,343
Marx was a Jew.
The Communist Party is run by Jews.

342
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:22,598
It's all a plot to destroy Germany.

343
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,615
To bastardise our blood.
Infiltrate our lives.

344
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:33,368
They want to wipe the Aryan race
from the face of the earth!

345
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:55,433
Fritz, you're writing.

346
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:57,560
No, I'm just thinking, that's all.

347
00:30:57,643 --> 00:30:59,687
About?

348
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,774
About what's happening.
Munich. Bavaria. Germany.

349
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:07,486
- My three rivals.
- It's so exciting.

350
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:13,367
Sophie, Germany is at the
crossroads of history.

351
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:19,790
We grew up with the Kaiser telling us what to do
and we're finally thinking on our own.

352
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:23,461
We have the Communists on the left,
Social Democrats on the middle,

353
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:27,965
the Free Corps joining forces with the right.
It's one big political brawl.

354
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:30,426
- That doesn't worry you?
- Why should it?

355
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,472
Nothing good ever comes from brawls.

356
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:38,684
- When are you men going to learn that?
- When are you women going to learn

357
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:42,271
that extraordinary times
demand extraordinary measures?

358
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:44,440
Yes - war, assassination...

359
00:31:44,523 --> 00:31:46,484
All right, all right.

360
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:49,528
I won't argue with you on that.

361
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:56,410
But I promise you that whatever comes
of this brawl will be extraordinary.

362
00:31:56,494 --> 00:32:01,123
- Here. Go.
- We need more men like you in the party.

363
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:04,877
Oh, we hate the Communists -
wherever they go we'll go.

364
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:08,881
Whether or not we'll do anything
for the party is entirely up to you.

365
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:11,008
Here. Go!

366
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:16,472
You know, I've always been a great admirer
of yours - your reputation, your war medals.

367
00:32:16,556 --> 00:32:18,558
Oh, my war medal is here.

368
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:21,936
I'm prouder of this
than of any Iron Cross.

369
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,773
Speak of me, Herr Hitler,
you speak of all my men.

370
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,692
We're all soldiers here.

371
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:32,530
These men, together with thousands and
thousands of others, served our country well.

372
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:36,409
Even after they were abandoned
by the army they continued to fight

373
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:39,245
- to put down a Communist revolution.
- Yes.

374
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:43,541
Now, all of a sudden, the rich that
backed us up are charming away

375
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:45,835
Why?

376
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:47,795
I don't understand.

377
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:54,260
But if my men can crush a revolution,
they can also create one.

378
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:58,097
Because they love this country
as much as you or I do.

379
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,849
Yes.

380
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:02,560
The only little problem is...

381
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:05,688
they're unemployed.

382
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:07,815
Yes.

383
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:14,530
Not so long ago,
we Germans thirsted after blood

384
00:33:14,614 --> 00:33:18,034
We had half the world in trenches,
crawling through the mud

385
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:21,913
We were close to victory,
how come we lost the war?

386
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:25,791
Where were all those leaders
that we counted on before?

387
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:30,004
Oh, my God. Ernst, is that you?

388
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:34,216
Friedrich. Friedrich Hollander, my God.
What are you doing here?

389
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,304
I run this place. I direct this show,
I write these songs - I am this place.

390
00:33:38,387 --> 00:33:42,308
Freddie and I went to school together.
We were... sparring partners.

391
00:33:42,391 --> 00:33:44,185
- In the fencing club.
- That too.

392
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:47,313
- And this beautiful lady is?
- His current sparring partner.

393
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:49,815
Helene Hanfstaengl.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

394
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:51,859
Friedrich Hollander.

395
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:53,861
That's my wife.

396
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:55,654
... poison gas

397
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:59,283
And now that we have seen
the face of war

398
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:03,412
We're not the same men
that we were before...

399
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:06,916
Everyone's depressed -
bad for the economy but excellent for cabaret.

400
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:09,877
German people don't need democracy,
for God's sake,

401
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,922
they need music, laughter,
someone to tell them what to do

402
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:16,884
- so they can get in line and follow.
- Don't tell me you've become a nationalist?

403
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,596
I'm a satirist, Ernst, the most
dangerous politician of the mob.

404
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:24,642
Who just fell and scraped your knee?

405
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:27,895
It's time for fun and games
again in Germany...

406
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:35,486
Speaking of humour, I'm going to hear Hitler
tomorrow - would you like to come?

407
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:38,197
Hitler? The anti-Semite?

408
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,411
The National Socialist anti-Semite.
Call them Nazis just to piss them off.

409
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:48,040
- I hear he's fascinating.
- Well, that's very open-minded of you.

410
00:34:48,124 --> 00:34:49,583
- You mean for a jew?
- Yes.

411
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,919
I'm not supporting him, for God's sake.

412
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:55,256
I need new material.

413
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:56,966
... the face of war

414
00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:01,303
We're not the same men
that we were before

415
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:04,682
And we can say without hypocrisy

416
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:09,395
Oh, the next one that we fight
will end in victory!

417
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,985
We will survive.

418
00:35:16,068 --> 00:35:18,112
That's what they tell us.

419
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:21,198
What they mean is - they will survive.

420
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:26,912
We surrendered in November at a time
when we were perched on the edge of victory.

421
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:31,792
betrayed by the cowards
and the traitors within our ranks.

422
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:36,380
Communist pigs!

423
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,883
How do we fight them?

424
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:42,928
We unite. We must join
together for a greater Germany.

425
00:35:44,388 --> 00:35:47,099
Clean him up a bit,
he might be worth something.

426
00:35:48,184 --> 00:35:50,227
He's a cartoon.

427
00:35:55,024 --> 00:36:00,529
We will sacrifice, we will struggle, yes,
but only then will we triumph.

428
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:02,656
And we will triumph!

429
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,913
With the hero Lohengrin
as our model

430
00:36:08,996 --> 00:36:11,624
and the music of Wagner
as our inspiration,

431
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:14,919
we will hang the profiteers,
crush the Communists.

432
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:18,422
We will disinfect our country
of the Jewish vermin.

433
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:24,804
Funny... after 500 years
you'd think I'd be used to it.

434
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:28,516
Ernst.

435
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,643
Ernst?

436
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:34,772
We will triumph!

437
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:37,316
We will triumph!

438
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,736
We will triumph!
We will triumph!

439
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,198
We will triumph!
We will triumph!

440
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:15,146
Excuse me, Herr Hitler.

441
00:37:58,314 --> 00:38:01,317
I heard you speak... last night.
You mentioned Wagner.

442
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,069
Ssh.

443
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:12,495
I was told I could find you here,
that you never leave.

444
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,413
Herr Hitler, I was wondering...

445
00:38:14,497 --> 00:38:16,540
Ssh, just... just play.

446
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,103
I know some people

447
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:41,607
who would love to hear you speak...,
who are not likely to go to a beer hall.

448
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,901
The wealthy. I've met a few.

449
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:48,739
Armchair politicians who care more about
their money than they do their own country.

450
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:50,783
But as your party's propaganda leader

451
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:54,662
you must know that to defend their money,
they'll spend a good deal of it.

452
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:59,375
That is, if someone they trust
tells them it's a safe bet. That's where I come in.

453
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:03,295
Herr Hitler... I can make you very popular.

454
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,465
Far more popular than him.

455
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:12,805
But you have to admit
the colour catches the eye.

456
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:16,600
Why don't you have a poster?

457
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:20,396
And a flag?

458
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:25,651
Your picture should be everywhere.
With your name in large letters.

459
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:29,864
You might consider a more distinctive look..

460
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:33,868
For exmple. When you think of Lenin.
You think of bearded and bald.

461
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:38,956
Not that that's attractive but...
but it does stick with you.

462
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:26,842
Herr Hitler.

463
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:30,553
I'm Helene, Ernst's wife.

464
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:34,286
He's told me so much about you. Come.

465
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:43,185
With respect, the Kaiser's a coward.

466
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:45,368
Better off without him really.

467
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:51,866
No, we need someone with courage,
courage to drive out these foreign agitators.

468
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:58,235
A man who would smile in the face of
the machine gun and scare the rabble shitless.

469
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:03,506
Would that be you, sir?

470
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:06,682
No, Captain Göring, not me, sir.

471
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,980
I'm just a voice crying in the wilderness.

472
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:18,058
Above all, we must remove the Jews.

473
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:25,636
They run our banks, they lost us the war. They're
responsible for the economic disaster we're in.

474
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:32,125
Sir, my father was a Jew and a stronger patriot
could not be found at this table.

475
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,333
I am the man I am
today because of him.

476
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,245
Baron...

477
00:41:45,814 --> 00:41:47,935
surely he wasn't talking
about your father.

478
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:52,177
He meant the Communist Jews,
didn't you, Herr Hitler.

479
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:10,011
You will excuse us,
Frau Hanfstaengl.

480
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:14,203
Darling.

481
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,460
Herr Hitler.

482
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:32,109
Please.

483
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:38,034
Please accept my apologies.
I'm sure he meant no disrespect.

484
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,880
My husband and I have several
Jewish friends in America.

485
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:45,073
What this man is doing, Madame, is heating up
the hatred in this country to boiling point.

486
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:47,641
And all for his own purposes,
I might add.

487
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:54,397
May God forgive you and
your husband for supporting him.

488
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:06,618
... I to know what it's like
to be mistaken in a friend.

489
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:09,204
If he has deceived you as to his heritage,

490
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,331
who knows what else is he capable of?

491
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:14,709
You 're a very gifted speaker, Herr Hitler.

492
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:18,922
I think... it is an honour
to be at this table with you.

493
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:31,768
I began life as a quite
gifted artist, Captain Göring.

494
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,442
And I brought something
I want you all to see.

495
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:46,408
Simple.

496
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:47,826
Aryan.

497
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:50,120
What does it mean?

498
00:43:50,203 --> 00:43:52,914
It means the unconquerable.

499
00:44:03,592 --> 00:44:06,011
Do you like it, Frau Hanfstaengl?

500
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:11,808
It's very... hypnotic.

501
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:22,235
Tell us, Herr Hitler,
have you considered publishing?

502
00:44:27,824 --> 00:44:29,868
Well done.

503
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:31,995
Thank you.

504
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,335
Thank you.

505
00:44:38,627 --> 00:44:42,923
The turning point in my life was when
the blindfold was ripped from my eyes!

506
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:46,051
And only then will we triumph.
And we will triumph!

507
00:44:46,134 --> 00:44:51,723
The Jew in all his terrible shame!
We will hang the profiteers!

508
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:55,644
We recognise him.
We recognise him.

509
00:44:57,312 --> 00:45:00,148
We will make them pay!

510
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:09,783
We will triumph!
We will triumph! We will triumph!

511
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,456
We will triumph!

512
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:29,845
What's going on?

513
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:33,223
Herr Hitler... we er...

514
00:45:34,683 --> 00:45:36,393
Who is this?

515
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:39,354
My new friends.
What are you arguing about?

516
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:43,483
We have been approached
by the German Socialist Party to join forces.

517
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:48,864
Our principles are similar, we can negotiate
a new platform to eliminate our differences,

518
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,908
and together both parties will be even stronger.

519
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:56,621
Er... some of the others here disagree.

520
00:45:58,832 --> 00:46:00,876
I see.

521
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,920
- Would you like to know what I think?.
- Yes, of course.

522
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:06,423
- I think you're a traitor.
- But Herr Hitler...

523
00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:09,009
Compromise is not possible!

524
00:46:12,387 --> 00:46:17,184
If their members wish to quit their party
and join ours that's another thing,

525
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:21,521
but our principles are our principles
and cannot be changed!

526
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:29,654
Once again, Drexler, you prove my point.

527
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:37,120
This is a tedious,
amateur organisation

528
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:39,581
and you are a jealous fool.

529
00:46:43,877 --> 00:46:45,921
Which brings me to this.

530
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,840
Who wrote this?

531
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:53,303
Don't pretend you don't know what it is.

532
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:57,849
One of our own members
calls me a dangerous demagogue.

533
00:47:00,352 --> 00:47:02,395
Are you out to destroy me?

534
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:07,776
I tell you, sir,
I don't need you or your Party.

535
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,904
I will form my own Party.

536
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:27,833
Herr Hitler, Herr Hitler!

537
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:31,712
Herr Hitler, please.

538
00:47:33,362 --> 00:47:34,725
You're right, of course.

539
00:47:38,354 --> 00:47:40,398
May I have your attention?

540
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:46,779
The leadership committee
has just made an important decision.

541
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,870
I no longer feel qualified
to lead our struggle

542
00:47:53,953 --> 00:48:00,418
so it is my privilege to present you
with our new leader.

543
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:03,045
Our new Führer...

544
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:07,341
... Adolf Hitler.

545
00:48:53,137 --> 00:48:55,181
Oh, my God.

546
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:03,120
No, no, a little higher.
That's good. That's very good.

547
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:05,790
Beautiful, marvellous.

548
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:10,002
No. No.

549
00:49:11,087 --> 00:49:12,505
Yes.

550
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:17,927
Wonderful choice, my Führer,
but don't you think... this look is better?

551
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:22,849
Excuse me, Herr Hitler, a message
from Bavarian Prime Minister Von Kahr.

552
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:45,454
It seems I'm being asked
to cancel my speeches.

553
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:47,999
Not asked, ordered.

554
00:49:53,045 --> 00:49:57,550
The Chancellor wants to pay war reparations
and honour the Treaty of Versailles.

555
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:00,970
As a consequence,
the people are ready to riot.

556
00:50:02,054 --> 00:50:05,766
Kahr's ordered a state of emergency.
placed himself in charge.

557
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,435
He adds...

558
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:12,300
"If Hitler speaks, it may only stir things up."

559
00:50:12,383 --> 00:50:14,010
Stir things up.

560
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:16,721
Stir things up?

561
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:23,895
Have you been to the marketplace?

562
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:28,024
Do you know how much it costs
for a loaf of bread these days?

563
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:30,985
500.000 marks.

564
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,945
500.000 marks.

565
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:36,657
The wheelbarrows aren't big enough
to carry the money in!

566
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:42,038
And he's afraid I'll stir things up?

567
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,875
You tell Commissar Kahr

568
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:49,295
this is not a time for silence,

569
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:51,381
this is a time for revolution.

570
00:51:08,147 --> 00:51:11,984
Right, well, I suppose that leaves me.

571
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,462
I know you're upset.

572
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,589
Of course you are.

573
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,051
Commissar Von Kahr is acting rashly.

574
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,595
Herr Hitler, you mustn't take it personally.

575
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,765
We both want the same thing.

576
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,812
Right now Von Kahr
thinks that he doesn't need you.

577
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:50,982
You must be clever
and show him that he does.

578
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:53,317
That you have the support of the people.

579
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,237
Hm?

580
00:51:57,066 --> 00:51:59,118
I want to show you something.

581
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:06,679
This is an article by an editor named Fritz
Gerlich that is, on the whole, complimentary.

582
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:11,642
Everyone who's anyone reads him and...

583
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:16,189
he also happens to Write
Commissar Von Kahr's speeches.

584
00:52:16,272 --> 00:52:18,316
I think you shoould pay him a visit.

585
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:22,528
I baked these this morning.
I hope you like them.

586
00:52:26,217 --> 00:52:28,678
You must have been very brave,
Herr Hitler.

587
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:32,265
The lron Cross is no small feat.

588
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:39,939
Thank you, dear.

589
00:52:47,906 --> 00:52:49,949
I've heard you speak...,
Herr Hitler.

590
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,076
You're very persuasive.

591
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:59,542
You know, we share some beliefs - the need
for a political leader, strong voice to guide.

592
00:52:59,626 --> 00:53:02,337
Yes, well, we need someone to take charge...

593
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:06,341
... throw out this Treaty of Versailles,

594
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:10,095
refuse to pay the war reparations.

595
00:53:10,178 --> 00:53:12,555
War reparations. I agree with that.

596
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,680
What's that?.

597
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:21,254
- It helps me to keep notes during an interview.
- What?

598
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:23,764
- That way when I get back...
- This isn't an interview.

599
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:25,932
What made you think that?

600
00:53:39,473 --> 00:53:40,993
Kahr's a fool.

601
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:46,670
I know he's your friend,
but he has to realise I am not the enemy.

602
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:50,962
If he wants to make a stand against Berlin.
Fine. I won't stop him.

603
00:53:51,379 --> 00:53:52,755
In fact...

604
00:53:54,056 --> 00:53:55,697
... I should be his partner.

605
00:53:57,615 --> 00:54:01,280
But you have fundamental areas
of disagreement. You both wish to lead.

606
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:02,392
Lead?

607
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,979
I have no ambition to lead.

608
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:11,071
So long as Kahr keeps us a place
in his government, that's all we want.

609
00:54:13,785 --> 00:54:18,433
A little... little piece of the cake, as it were.

610
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:26,889
You know...

611
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:30,071
you know we could use a man like you.

612
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:38,107
You could perhaps...
write... for us.

613
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,939
On behalf of the Nationalist Socialist Party.

614
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,333
Yes.

615
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:46,214
But I don't write propaganda.

616
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:48,407
Who said anything about propaganda?

617
00:54:49,446 --> 00:54:51,189
I'm talking about the truth.

618
00:54:52,252 --> 00:54:53,448
Look around you.

619
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:57,663
Immigrants, Jews.
Stealing everything we work for.

620
00:54:57,974 --> 00:55:02,023
The German Jews? Any party that comes
to power will surely guarantee that...

621
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:04,414
We're talking about Jews here!

622
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:07,251
They're not citizens.
They have no rights.

623
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:09,496
You are supposed to be a Nationalist.

624
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:13,526
You should know better.

625
00:55:14,553 --> 00:55:17,290
I will never compromise on the Jews.

626
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:20,531
Never.

627
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,213
He's insane.
A complete psychotic.

628
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:36,791
He may be a compelling
speaker on stage but...

629
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:41,461
... in person I could see into his eyes
and what I saw was...

630
00:55:42,678 --> 00:55:44,819
... terrifying.

631
00:55:45,534 --> 00:55:48,364
And I intend to shut him down.

632
00:55:48,504 --> 00:55:53,917
With all due respect, Commissar Von Kahr...
you need to handle him with care.

633
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:56,239
Don't worry, I will.

634
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:59,573
I know how to deal with Adolf Hitler.

635
00:56:01,035 --> 00:56:04,038
There were over 40 political
murders last weekend.

636
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:08,259
Reds killing SA. SA killing Reds.

637
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:14,974
General Von Lossow and Colonel Seisser here
are very concerned, as am l.

638
00:56:15,057 --> 00:56:17,727
Well, if my party had a voice
in your government,

639
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:21,522
perhaps we might find less violent ways
of expressing ourselves.

640
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:24,275
Which is exactly what I'm
prepared to offer you.

641
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:35,077
In... a few weeks' time, General Von Lossow
and Colones Seisser intend to march on Berlin.

642
00:56:35,244 --> 00:56:38,831
A putsch to bring the national
government under our control.

643
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,621
Would you like to be
part of that putsch?

644
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:50,293
Yes, of course.

645
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:54,422
Then you must be very quiet.

646
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:59,869
You can speak...
give the impression of business as usual.

647
00:56:59,953 --> 00:57:01,996
But you must also promise me...

648
00:57:03,373 --> 00:57:10,004
... if you wish to play any part in our government,
there will be no more violence.

649
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:13,258
Berlin mustn't believe we have
designs against them.

650
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:17,178
You have my full support.

651
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,396
Just keep your men quiet.

652
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:27,648
I can't do that.

653
00:57:27,732 --> 00:57:29,775
Of course you can.

654
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:32,028
You're the leader, they listen to you.

655
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:34,322
I pay them to listen to you.

656
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:37,408
It's not a question about money,
it's the principle.

657
00:57:38,492 --> 00:57:42,121
If there's a Red anywhere near,
there's going to be a fight.

658
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:46,501
Look... I don't care how you do this...

659
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:49,879
... just keep them quiet.

660
00:57:57,637 --> 00:58:02,183
He won't listen. We have to find some other way,
some kind of figurehead.

661
00:58:02,725 --> 00:58:05,895
Make it tighter.
So, how is your father, Hess?

662
00:58:05,978 --> 00:58:08,856
Very well, General Ludendorff,
he sends his best.

663
00:58:10,775 --> 00:58:12,276
Who is this?

664
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:15,530
May I present Herr Hitler,
to you, sir?

665
00:58:16,132 --> 00:58:20,326
I believe you've met before
at one of Captain Göring's soirees.

666
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,955
Oh, yes. Er, what can I do for you?

667
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:26,415
No, no, that's too tight. Let it out.

668
00:58:26,499 --> 00:58:29,919
Your Excellency is the...

669
00:58:30,002 --> 00:58:35,132
our... heroic leader of the Nationalist Right,
while I'm but its spokesman.

670
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:37,176
No, more, more, I can't breathe.

671
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,888
I was wondering if I could perhaps
discuss a little plan I have,

672
00:58:40,972 --> 00:58:44,976
we're confident of gaining
Your Excellency's support.

673
00:58:46,394 --> 00:58:48,771
Support? For what?

674
00:58:48,855 --> 00:58:51,190
We're planning a transference of power.

675
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:54,277
Bavarian Commissar Von Kahr
has seen the wisdom

676
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,738
of joining the National Socialists
for a march on Berlin.

677
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:01,951
Well... good for you.

678
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:07,582
Those idiots at the Reichstag
haven't learned their lesson, so... kick them out.

679
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:13,588
We need true Germans running this
country again, like we had with Bismarck...

680
00:59:13,671 --> 00:59:15,715
I knew him, you know. Hm.

681
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,843
My God, what a man.

682
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:22,471
So... what's your plan?

683
00:59:22,555 --> 00:59:26,642
And can you carry this off?
I won't be made a fool of, you know.

684
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:29,812
Your Excellency,
we are confident of our success.

685
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,942
By the way, I'm speaking
next week... at the Circus Krone.

686
00:59:35,026 --> 00:59:37,570
I would be honoured
if you would be my guest.

687
00:59:46,787 --> 00:59:48,873
For many years, my friends,

688
00:59:48,956 --> 00:59:51,000
I was like a prisoner -

689
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:54,712
blindfolded, fending off
flaws from every directions.

690
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:58,174
What had I done
to deserve this treatment?

691
00:59:58,257 --> 01:00:00,551
I did not even know
who my enemy was.

692
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:07,475
An innocent victim of greed
and of hatred and of cunning!

693
01:00:10,895 --> 01:00:13,564
In recent years
we have all suffered like this.

694
01:00:14,649 --> 01:00:16,692
Germany more than any of us.

695
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:22,281
Yet there is no need
to live in darkness.

696
01:00:23,616 --> 01:00:28,287
The turning point in my life was when
the blindfold was ripped from my eyes.

697
01:00:29,413 --> 01:00:33,668
And I could see my enemy.
Our enemy - the Jew!

698
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,795
We recognise him.

699
01:00:35,878 --> 01:00:37,922
We recognise him.

700
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:40,508
Nobody leaves. No-one.

701
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:45,054
We see how his filth and his greed have
staggered the heart of this great country.

702
01:00:46,597 --> 01:00:48,641
We must crush this vermin!

703
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:51,435
We must wipe this plague
from our nation!

704
01:00:54,397 --> 01:00:57,984
What we say tonight
will soon be forgotten.

705
01:00:58,067 --> 01:01:02,113
What we do will live on
for a thousand, thousand years!

706
01:01:29,515 --> 01:01:30,808
What's the matter?

707
01:01:30,892 --> 01:01:36,105
Lossow has said we have to wait
two more weeks before they take action.

708
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:39,734
Seisser was in Berlin.

709
01:01:39,817 --> 01:01:41,485
Some important meeting.

710
01:01:42,128 --> 01:01:44,114
Kahr wouldn't see me.

711
01:01:44,397 --> 01:01:48,776
But in two days he intends to address
all the right-wing political factions

712
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,614
at one of their beer halls.
All of them, that is, except you.

713
01:01:53,698 --> 01:01:55,700
He's outfoxed you, lad.

714
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:59,537
He clearly intends to form a coalition
with all of your competitors

715
01:01:59,621 --> 01:02:02,540
and create a new government
without you.

716
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:06,845
He brought you into this
simply to keep you quiet.

717
01:02:11,348 --> 01:02:13,225
We'll move without them, then.

718
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:18,355
We'll seize Munich.
We'll march on Berlin.

719
01:02:17,953 --> 01:02:20,607
The people are with us.
Listen to them.

720
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,993
Gentlemen, our time has come.

721
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:07,438
I'll confront Kahr here.

722
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:09,565
Röhm and his men wait here.

723
01:03:10,292 --> 01:03:13,486
We surround the barracks...
then attack...

724
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:18,026
Once the situation is secure,
I'll telepohone Röhm here at the beer hall.

725
01:03:18,364 --> 01:03:21,359
Half of my men will cut the lines
at the telephone exchange.

726
01:03:21,618 --> 01:03:24,127
The rest of us will secure
the military barracks.

727
01:03:24,428 --> 01:03:28,130
No information in or out of Munich
unless I say so.

728
01:03:32,066 --> 01:03:33,625
Gentlemen...

729
01:03:34,664 --> 01:03:38,226
... I know this is often said and deeply felt...

730
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:41,049
... but none more deeply than tonight -

731
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:46,597
may God and the people
of Germany be with us.

732
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:56,937
We're brothers, you and l.

733
01:03:57,021 --> 01:03:59,857
Together we will make history.

734
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:09,422
Your papers, please.

735
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:15,018
I couldn't sleep last night worrying
about this speech. His popularity's rising.

736
01:04:15,236 --> 01:04:17,527
- If people don't hear the truth...
- Don't worry. They will.

737
00:58:34,079 --> 01:04:21,602
Tonight we unify the other parties
and put an end to Adolf Hitler.

738
01:04:34,866 --> 01:04:36,784
The circus rules

739
01:04:36,868 --> 01:04:39,620
And I'm the lion tamer

740
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:42,957
An all-or-nothing savage autocrat

741
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,668
I crack my whip

742
01:04:45,752 --> 01:04:48,796
The king of all the jungle

743
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,631
Just starts to purr

744
01:04:50,715 --> 01:04:52,717
Like he's my pussycat

745
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,635
But smell the stench

746
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:57,154
You can't escape the jungle

747
01:04:57,238 --> 01:04:58,865
And though at peace

748
01:04:58,948 --> 01:05:01,284
The animals still roar

749
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:03,202
Those darling beasts

750
01:05:03,286 --> 01:05:05,538
They long to slay each other

751
01:05:05,621 --> 01:05:07,081
Only my whip

752
01:05:07,164 --> 01:05:10,209
Keeps them froom going to war

753
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:11,878
They throw an attack...

754
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:21,345
Gentlemen, history has brought us
to the edge of chaos...

755
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:24,932
.. and now we have a choice.

756
01:05:25,016 --> 01:05:26,851
Men act like beasts

757
01:05:26,934 --> 01:05:28,644
Beasts act like men

758
01:05:28,728 --> 01:05:31,814
They both need training now and then

759
01:05:31,898 --> 01:05:35,943
Or we can, with courage
and faith, leap...

760
01:05:36,027 --> 01:05:38,237
What's that drumming?
What's coming?

761
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,163
The national revolution has begun.

762
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:51,167
The building is surrounded.
No-one may leave.

763
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,877
Any trouble, you will be shot.

764
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:58,466
Inside.

765
01:06:01,779 --> 01:06:02,553
Inside!

766
01:06:12,355 --> 01:06:16,067
Stay calm.
Remain in your places.

767
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,611
We have the building surrounded.

768
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:21,364
Get me Ludendorff.

769
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:25,868
Sorry to surprise you like this,

770
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:28,746
but then you're no stranger
to intrigue, are you?

771
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,292
I am forming a provisional
Reich government.

772
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:35,419
I will be in charge of the police,

773
01:06:35,503 --> 01:06:38,381
General Ludendorff will be in charge
of the army,

774
01:06:38,464 --> 01:06:41,482
and I will have a post for each of you.

775
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:43,678
I need your support.

776
01:06:46,264 --> 01:06:48,724
You seem to have planned this well.

777
01:06:48,808 --> 01:06:51,561
And where is General Ludendorff?

778
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:55,064
If he supports you
as you say he does...

779
01:06:55,147 --> 01:06:57,191
why is he not here?

780
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,905
Oh, so the little man
pulled it off, did he?

781
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:05,741
Give me a moment.

782
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:10,621
Keep your heads!

783
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:12,748
Stay calm!

784
01:07:12,832 --> 01:07:16,335
- He's a little late.
- Gentlemen. please!

785
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:22,424
What's going on?

786
01:07:23,993 --> 01:07:25,630
- You sure he's coming at all?.
- Shut up!

787
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:28,264
Stay calm!

788
01:07:28,347 --> 01:07:29,807
Shut up!

789
01:07:31,851 --> 01:07:34,937
- Take your seats. Remain calm!
- Ludendorff's here.

790
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:38,934
He's here.

791
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:44,155
Your leaders are with us.

792
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:46,282
Will you join them?

793
01:07:46,365 --> 01:07:48,159
Will you stand behind us?

794
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:57,210
The German revolution begins tonight!

795
01:08:14,143 --> 01:08:15,686
Yes?

796
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:18,314
Good.

797
01:08:18,856 --> 01:08:20,441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

798
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,610
Stop.

799
01:08:33,016 --> 01:08:34,413
There's an armed group
heading towards the barracks.

800
01:08:49,053 --> 01:08:51,097
Fall back!

801
01:08:57,725 --> 01:08:58,688
Get out of my way!

802
01:08:58,771 --> 01:09:01,315
What doo yoou mean they fell back?

803
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:05,111
I can't believe this is happening.
Nobody does anything right.

804
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:11,534
- Where's your conscience?
- Conscience.

805
01:09:11,617 --> 01:09:13,536
A Jewish invention, sir.

806
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:15,580
Conscience.

807
01:09:16,831 --> 01:09:20,418
Do you mind if we visit our wives, General?
They'll be worried.

808
01:09:22,086 --> 01:09:27,049
Of course, of course,
mustn't worry, poor women.

809
01:09:31,387 --> 01:09:33,931
Mobilise the army. Now.

810
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:41,439
What the hell's happening?

811
01:09:41,522 --> 01:09:45,234
There are too many of them.
Somebody must have betrayed us.

812
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:48,404
What are you doing here?
Where's Kahr and the others?

813
01:09:48,487 --> 01:09:51,657
Oh, I let them go. Their wives
were a concern. That's all right.

814
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:54,577
They gave me their word
they wouldn't notify the authorities.

815
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,996
Good God!

816
01:09:57,079 --> 01:09:58,831
- Follow me.
- Let's go.

817
01:09:58,915 --> 01:10:02,627
We'll take to the streets.
We'll take to the streets.

818
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:07,548
We'll go to the War Ministry. There were 8000
people at the Circus Krone the other night.

819
01:10:07,632 --> 01:10:10,885
As soon as they know what's happened,
they will support us.

820
01:11:03,145 --> 01:11:04,897
Fire!

821
01:11:13,826 --> 01:11:15,575
Hurry up. Retreat!

822
01:11:15,658 --> 01:11:17,410
Get him out of here!

823
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:27,253
Fall back... fall back!

824
01:11:37,972 --> 01:11:39,891
Children!

825
01:11:40,975 --> 01:11:43,019
Papa! Mama!

826
01:11:48,441 --> 01:11:50,193
Go. Drive.

827
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:06,209
Hello.

828
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:07,919
Darling, it's me.

829
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:12,744
I've got to get out. It's all gone sour.
Don't let anyone in.

830
01:12:12,965 --> 01:12:15,387
I want you to take the children
and go to your mother's.

831
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:16,716
Ernst, what happened?

832
01:12:16,594 --> 01:12:18,387
I'll call you there.

833
01:12:21,928 --> 01:12:22,558
Frieda!

834
01:12:23,684 --> 01:12:24,936
Frieda!

835
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:33,903
I know a safe place.
Turn right up ahead.

836
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:48,084
- You're frightening the children.
- Go get the door.

837
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:50,336
Go, Frieda, now.

838
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:19,198
Frieda! Frieda, stop it!

839
01:13:19,282 --> 01:13:21,117
Shut up! Shut up!

840
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,244
Now take the children outside.

841
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:25,371
Go on. Now.

842
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:28,124
Mummy!

843
01:14:09,207 --> 01:14:12,668
Frau Hanfstaengl. Open the door!
We know he's in there!

844
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:14,670
Frau Hanfstaengl!

845
01:14:15,796 --> 01:14:17,840
Open the door!

846
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:32,980
Up you come. C ome on.

847
01:14:48,412 --> 01:14:50,456
Herr Hitler.

848
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:57,004
Of course, that's what...
that's exactly what they want...

849
01:14:59,715 --> 01:15:01,759
He's on a hunger strike.

850
01:15:01,843 --> 01:15:06,597
If he doesn't testify or worse, if he dies,
they'll come after everyone including us.

851
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:09,809
- You're out of your mind.
- Helene, someone has to answer for the putsch.

852
01:15:09,892 --> 01:15:12,270
For God's sake, it was treason.

853
01:15:13,521 --> 01:15:18,401
He won't listen to his men, but he likes you.
All you have to do is shore up his confidence.

854
01:15:18,484 --> 01:15:20,152
- No.
- Helene!

855
01:15:22,071 --> 01:15:27,118
Our lives, our future, depend on this.

856
01:15:46,762 --> 01:15:48,806
I baked these myself.

857
01:15:54,979 --> 01:15:57,190
You mustn't lose hope.

858
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:01,903
So many people believe in you.

859
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:05,698
Do you?

860
01:16:08,701 --> 01:16:10,745
The first time I saw you...

861
01:16:12,163 --> 01:16:16,083
... I knew that you were a great... man.

862
01:16:51,077 --> 01:16:53,120
There he is.

863
01:17:34,453 --> 01:17:37,039
Let us proceed.

864
01:17:37,123 --> 01:17:39,375
General Ludendorff...

865
01:17:40,183 --> 01:17:43,254
you have been accused of high treason.

866
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:46,716
How do you plead?

867
01:17:46,799 --> 01:17:48,676
Not guilty.

868
01:17:57,141 --> 01:17:59,478
Adolf Hitler...

869
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,817
... you have been accused of high treason.

870
01:18:06,076 --> 01:18:08,154
How do you plead?

871
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:37,517
Guilty.

872
01:18:52,823 --> 01:18:56,285
Herr Hitler, are you a German citizen?

873
01:18:58,204 --> 01:19:00,331
Are you talking about a piece of paper

874
01:19:00,414 --> 01:19:03,292
or the blood that runs through my veins?

875
01:19:08,089 --> 01:19:10,258
Answer the question.

876
01:19:15,273 --> 01:19:15,930
No.

877
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:18,266
In November of last year

878
01:19:18,349 --> 01:19:22,562
you led a putsch against the Bavarian
state and German Reich.

879
01:19:22,645 --> 01:19:29,277
You coerced and threatened Commissar Kahr,
General Lossow and Colonel Seisser.

880
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,406
You have been accused of high treason
and called an enemy of the state.

881
01:19:33,489 --> 01:19:38,953
If a thief takes your money and you take it back...
does that make you also a thief?

882
01:19:47,378 --> 01:19:51,841
In 1918 we were betrayed
by the November Criminals,

883
01:19:51,924 --> 01:19:55,136
the ones who claimed
to be our leaders.

884
01:19:55,219 --> 01:20:00,391
They ended the war,
signed the Treaty of Versailles.

885
01:20:00,474 --> 01:20:03,603
And that... was high treason.

886
01:20:08,274 --> 01:20:11,652
This is supposed to be an interrogation,
not a speech.

887
01:20:13,529 --> 01:20:18,618
I was simply taking back...
that which was stolen from us five years before.

888
01:20:18,701 --> 01:20:20,536
Namely the right...

889
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:25,958
the right to defend ourselves
against the wishes of an incapable parliament.

890
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:32,632
I used no force. I used no force.

891
01:20:33,883 --> 01:20:36,886
I was supported by Commissar Kahr.

892
01:20:36,969 --> 01:20:38,679
Why isn't he on trial?

893
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:46,270
If I'm guilty of anything...

894
01:20:46,354 --> 01:20:50,233
then I am guilty of fighting to defend
the rights of the German people.

895
01:20:52,818 --> 01:20:54,862
Fascinating, isn't he?

896
01:21:12,413 --> 01:21:14,465
Fritz, please!

897
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:18,010
What is it?

898
01:21:18,094 --> 01:21:20,137
- Please just...
- Sit down.

899
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:21,889
... open the door.

900
01:21:23,015 --> 01:21:24,725
What's wrong?

901
01:21:31,732 --> 01:21:34,944
Today I was absolutely convinced
that it would be over.

902
01:21:36,028 --> 01:21:39,323
That he would be exposed
as cold-blooded and psychotic.

903
01:21:42,994 --> 01:21:45,246
But they cheered him, Sophie.

904
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:47,373
Hitler stood up in a court of law

905
01:21:47,456 --> 01:21:52,044
and claimed that all he wants
is to give the nation back to its people

906
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,172
and the people believed him.

907
01:21:55,256 --> 01:21:57,300
Even the judge was impressed.

908
01:22:00,761 --> 01:22:02,805
He's figured us out.

909
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,933
- Figured who out?
- People.

910
01:22:06,017 --> 01:22:07,727
You've met him.

911
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:09,645
He's not human.

912
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:12,315
He's studied people
in order to appear human,

913
01:22:12,398 --> 01:22:16,360
but all he's discovered
is our fear and our hatred.

914
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:22,575
And now we're all running toward
a monster we should be running from.

915
01:22:22,658 --> 01:22:25,870
Extraordinary times
demand extraordinary measures.

916
01:22:28,289 --> 01:22:30,666
You said that once, remember?

917
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:34,670
When all those drunks in the beer halls
were throwing mugs at each other?

918
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:37,423
I told you nothing good
would come of it.

919
01:22:37,507 --> 01:22:39,383
That was then.

920
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:42,637
Coome inside now.
I'll fix you something to eat.

921
01:22:43,888 --> 01:22:45,932
Fritz?

922
01:22:51,771 --> 01:22:53,314
Thank you.

923
01:22:53,397 --> 01:22:54,607
For what?

924
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:02,823
- Stop the presses!
- Stop the presses!

925
01:23:02,907 --> 01:23:05,618
Stop the presses.
We've got a new front page.

926
01:23:05,701 --> 01:23:10,081
Listen... everybody.
We have a new front page.

927
01:23:11,165 --> 01:23:13,960
On the night of the putsch,
Commissar Von Kahr

928
01:23:14,043 --> 01:23:20,216
was promising an initiative that would have
turned this country around had he been heard.

929
01:23:20,299 --> 01:23:22,176
I know because I wrote it.

930
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:27,515
Tonight, we are the voice of sanity.

931
01:23:27,598 --> 01:23:29,308
Listen.

932
01:23:29,392 --> 01:23:33,312
"History has brought us to the edge of chaos
and we now have a choice.

933
01:23:33,396 --> 01:23:39,819
Either we can jump into the abyss or,
with courage and faith, leap to the other side."

934
01:23:39,902 --> 01:23:41,654
I demand freedom!

935
01:23:41,737 --> 01:23:45,032
"The abyss is Hitler's party
of National Socialism -

936
01:23:45,116 --> 01:23:47,243
a party of intolerance and hatred.

937
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:51,247
false imagery and false hope.
A pit of nonsense and outright lies."

938
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,207
They are the ones who deserve to be hung!

939
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:58,337
"He's an agitator who believes our fears
will drown out our reason.

940
01:23:59,714 --> 01:24:06,721
And the worst we can do - the absolute worst
- is to do nothing."

941
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:15,646
All right. Let's get to work...

942
01:24:27,575 --> 01:24:29,702
Traitor!

943
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:32,413
General Ludendorff...

944
