1
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,063
Make way.

2
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,531
So much for
the condemned man

3
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,966
Eating a hearty
breakfast, eh?

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,034
Pity that.

5
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,068
It's almost edible
for once.

6
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,103
Man: is he ready,
matthews?

7
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,938
I think he's just
taking a few

8
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,840
Quiet moments
to himself, sir.

9
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,175
His last chance,
so to speak.

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,424
Forgive me, mr. Bush.

11
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,192
Just a bad egg
from breakfast.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,761
There's nothing
worse.

13
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:03,829
Thank you for...

14
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,065
For agreeing to stand
there by my side.

15
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,334
I, uh...i...

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,235
I couldn't think...
of anyone...

17
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,037
Excuse me.

18
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,682
Man: present!...

19
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,427
I wish you luck,
captain.

20
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,235
Man: hello.

21
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,303
Hornblower:
i suppose you think

22
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,872
This is a bad time
to get married.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,906
Well, in my opinion, sir,

24
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,376
There's never a good time
to get married.

25
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,745
But we are at war.

26
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,182
You think i'm acting
in haste?

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,618
Well, you've acted
in haste before, sir.

28
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,787
It usually turns out
for the best.

29
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,358
So there's no doubting
the depth of her affection.

30
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,728
She'll be a loving wife
and a loyal one,

31
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,831
Though not perhaps what
some might think of as--

32
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,867
The wife
of a captain.

33
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,636
So there is still time
to reconsider.

34
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,943
I've given her
my word.

35
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,296
[Softly]
all right!

36
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,611
With this ring,
i thee wed,

37
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,315
With my body,
i thee worship,

38
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:09,154
And with all my worldly
goods, i thee endow.

39
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:13,459
Officiant: i pronounce that
they be man and wife together,

40
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,463
In the name of the father
and of the son

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,631
And of the holy ghost.

42
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,799
Amen.

43
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,668
Well, kiss her then.

44
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,520
Man: present!

45
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,557
Thank you,
william.

46
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,226
Guard of honor,

47
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,361
3 cheers for captain
and mrs. Hornblower.

48
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,863
Hip, hip!
Hooray!

49
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,131
Hip, hip!
Hooray!

50
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,233
Hip, hip!
Hooray!

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,834
And one for luck!
Hip, hip!

52
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,835
Hooray!

53
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,270
Store your
cutlasses, men.

54
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,039
Take up the traces.

55
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,750
Woman: you take care
in that thing!

56
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,719
Go carefully!

57
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,054
I'll see you
in a minute.

58
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,989
'Bye!

59
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,124
Men: away!

60
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,032
I never thought i
would be so happy.

61
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,910
Oh!

62
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,012
Oh, horrie!

63
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,787
Brake now, sir!
Beggin' your pardon,
brake!

64
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,330
Thank you then, men,
on behalf

65
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,498
Of mrs. Hornblower
and myself.

66
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,233
Hoorah!

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,534
Matthews.
Sir.

68
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,069
I hear they serve
a decent ale
in here.

69
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,305
Thank you, sir.

70
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,040
We'll drink to your
future happiness.

71
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,808
He was right there on
the admiral's bar.

72
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,543
Well, i never heard
of that one before.

73
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,384
I've dreamt of
this day, horatio,

74
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,452
Since i was just
a girl.

75
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,987
I've dreamt it would
be like this.

76
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,456
Yes, it's been...

77
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,058
It's been everything
i hoped for.

78
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,559
Mrs. Mason: so you're not
married, mr. Bush?

79
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,128
And i believe
even your mother

80
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,929
Is enjoying herself.

81
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,666
Our mother, horatio.

82
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,267
Yes.
Yes, of course.

83
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,569
Our.

84
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,837
Do you think
every day

85
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,140
Will be as
wonderful as this?

86
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,941
Now that we're
as one?

87
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,111
Only it could be so.

88
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,482
Whoa there.

89
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,856
Admiral pellew, sir.

90
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,024
At ease, men.

91
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,560
Easy.

92
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,828
Quite the celebrations,
i see.

93
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,797
Sorry, sir.
Don't be.

94
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,932
Presumably captain hornblower
is still standing?

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm sure he is, sir.
Good.

96
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,802
Well, perhaps you'd like
to interrupt the reverie

97
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,869
And tell him
i wish to see him.

98
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,104
Aye-Aye, sir.

99
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,542
Enter.

100
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,980
Ah!
Captain hornblower!

101
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,049
Well, well.

102
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,918
Many
congratulations.

103
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,086
Thank you, sir.

104
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,253
Is she pretty?

105
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,588
Yes, sir.

106
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,623
I believe she is
most handsome, sir.

107
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,025
You've lost weight,
man. Can she cook?

108
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,028
Yes, sir, but i'm afraid
my steward can't.

109
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,329
Yes.

110
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,832
Forgive me, sir,
but...might i assume

111
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,333
It was not my
wedding celebrations

112
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,835
That brought you here?

113
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,938
Your assumptions are
correct.

114
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,139
One of our ships
is missing.

115
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,208
The sloop
"grasshopper"

116
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,976
Was last seen
10 days ago

117
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:55,080
Patrolling this part
of the french coast.

118
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,315
"Grasshopper," sir?

119
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,916
That's captain
bracegirdle's ship.

120
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,018
Yes.

121
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,353
His last dispatch
referred to

122
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,622
Curiously intriguing
enemy activity.

123
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,325
"Curiously
intriguing."

124
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,926
You haven't changed
since our days together

125
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,528
On the "indy."
Mmm.

126
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,664
Since that last
dispatch, nothing.

127
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,433
Silence.

128
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,237
Find him,
hornblower.

129
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,439
And, uh...what if
the "grasshopper" has

130
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,573
Been captured, sir?

131
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,843
Or captain bracegirdle
is...dead?

132
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,512
You're a commander
now, sir.

133
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,113
You must trust
your intuition

134
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,782
As well as observe
and execute

135
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,950
Your orders.

136
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,453
I want to find out
what surprise boney

137
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,654
Is planning
for us.

138
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,890
[Knock on door]
enter!

139
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,058
Bush:
excuse me, sir,

140
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,459
But they're about
to cut the cake.

141
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,994
Captain hornblower's
presence is strongly

142
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,262
Requested by his
mother-In-Law.

143
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,296
Yes, indeed.

144
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,397
You sail on
the morning tide.

145
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,699
Mr. Bush,
you'll prepare

146
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:47,833
The "hotspur" for
sea.

147
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,368
Aye-Aye, sir.

148
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,036
You, you have
my permission

149
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,172
To sleep onshore.

150
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,973
But my duty is to
the "hotspur," sir.

151
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,742
Damn it, man, the "hotspur"
will have you soon enough.

152
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,377
Your wife will only have
you for the night.

153
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,179
You do as i say.

154
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,348
Aye-Aye, sir.

155
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,255
Use his sword, maria.

156
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,691
It's what the naval
brides in london do.

157
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,941
Oh, i just thought.

158
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,677
I trust he's given
that a thorough clean.

159
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,245
Well, he'll have done
his best, mum,

160
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,382
But french blood,
oh, is damnably sticky.

161
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,986
Long life and much
happiness to the wife

162
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,288
Of one of the most
promising officers

163
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,957
In the king's service.

164
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:45,958
Men: here, here!

165
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,126
Has the health
of the happy couple

166
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,627
Been drunk yet?
No, sir.

167
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,662
Well, then,
may i do so?

168
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,097
Ladies and gentlemen,
may i ask you

169
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,668
To stand and join me
on this happy occasion.

170
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,637
May they never
know sorrow.

171
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,474
May they only enjoy
health and prosperity.

172
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,742
May the wife
be comforted

173
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,577
In the knowledge that
the husband is

174
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,479
Doing his duty
for king and country.

175
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,718
And may the husband be
supported in his duty

176
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,219
By the loyalty
of the wife.

177
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,587
Ladies and gentlemen,

178
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,057
The bride and groom.

179
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,425
The bride and groom!

180
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,427
All: the bride and groom!

181
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,515
When you're on land,

182
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,384
Do you miss your ship?

183
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,620
I, uh...can't
deny it.

184
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,958
And when at sea...

185
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,393
Will you miss
your wife?

186
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,231
How could you ask?
Of course.

187
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,116
Everything ready,
mr. Prowse?

188
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,050
Aye-Aye, sir.

189
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,418
There will be nothing
for the captain

190
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,552
To complain about.

191
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,587
Mr. Orrock, send
the quarter boat

192
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,288
For the captain.
Aye-Aye, sir.

193
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,298
The wind is freshening
from the west.

194
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,701
You're dressed already.

195
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,670
I should have been up
to make your breakfast

196
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,038
And pack your clothes.

197
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,874
Now, my dear.

198
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,544
Your gloves, horrie.

199
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,779
Haven't packed
your gloves.

200
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,384
I know that
you have to go.

201
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:53,519
Say that you love me.

202
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,290
Say that you'll
always love me.

203
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,693
I do...and i will.

204
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,263
Good-Bye, my love.

205
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,576
Man: starboard ends
to the far sail!

206
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,011
Prowse: sir.

207
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,815
We'll weigh anchor,
mr. Prowse.

208
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,149
Aye-Aye, sir.

209
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,885
Hands to stations
for weigh anchor!

210
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,360
So, mr. Bush,
i trust you weren't up

211
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,861
All night getting
the ship ready.

212
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,529
Not all night,
sir, no.

213
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,298
Anything to report?

214
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,532
No, sir. Nothing.

215
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,968
I trust you weren't up
all night either, sir.

216
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,236
No, mr. Bush.

217
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,638
I slept exceptionally
well, thank you.

218
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,540
You'll take her out,
if you please.

219
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,641
Plot a course
for brest.

220
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,843
Aye-Aye, sir.

221
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,722
My glass, sir?

222
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,524
No, mr. Prowse.

223
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,825
I'll wait until
we're looking for

224
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,993
The "grasshopper."

225
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,936
Good morning, sir.

226
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,171
Matthews.

227
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,240
I hope the men enjoyed
themselves yesterday.

228
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,342
I'm sure they did, sir.
Thank you.

229
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,677
Although most of them
ended the day

230
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,478
As you began it, sir:
a might ill.

231
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,813
Morning, sir.
Styles.

232
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,048
I'd like some
coffee, please,

233
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,182
If you're up to it.

234
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,183
Matthews:
you may want to wait

235
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,584
Until you see what's
in your cabin, sir.

236
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,153
Only we had the delivery
this morning.

237
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,688
We didn't know
what to do with it,

238
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,156
So we put it in there.

239
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,657
It's a wedding
present, sir,

240
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,159
From admiral pellew.

241
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,394
It came with
this note, sir.

242
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,534
"Thy need is greater
than mine."

243
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,601
And it makes coffee?

244
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,309
James doughty, sir,
admiral's steward--

245
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,545
Until now that is--
At your service.

246
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,717
Styles, belay that order.

247
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,752
Doughty, i'd like
some coffee.

248
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,354
With pleasure, sir.

249
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,169
I know how to cook
a bit myself.

250
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,975
I was the captain's
last steward.

251
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,112
We're giving him
the beef in crust

252
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,080
With french beans
and spanish fritters.

253
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,349
French and spanish.

254
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,051
Mr. Hornblower
won't like that.

255
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,854
They're vegetable
styles, not navies.

256
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,255
You might want to
put a little bit

257
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,423
Of extra pepper
in that.

258
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,435
Is the beef not
to your liking, sir?

259
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,504
Yes, thank you.

260
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,939
Sir edward always
enjoyed my royal

261
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,208
Beef casserole
in dainty crust.

262
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,377
I have simple tastes.

263
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,213
There's not too much
pepper, is there?

264
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,889
I thought the wedding
most pleasant, sir.

265
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,525
I never thanked you
properly, william,

266
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,761
For the carriage
and the hands.

267
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,065
Mrs. Hornblower said
you made her very happy.

268
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,400
I believe it is you that
made her happy, sir.

269
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,035
No doubt
she considers herself

270
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,303
A very lucky woman.

271
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,040
[Clearing throat]
that may be, mr. Bush, but...

272
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,143
We now have more important
things concerning us,

273
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,213
Like finding out what happened
to the "grasshopper."

274
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,782
Captain bracegirdle...

275
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,551
What manner
of man is he?

276
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:52,191
He's wise, amusing...
and was once very kind

277
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,494
To a nervous,
young midshipman.

278
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,829
My apologies, sir.

279
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,963
Mr. Prowse's respects,

280
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,398
But he requests your
presence on deck.

281
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,066
Very well.

282
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,372
Doughty, i do not need
your assistance

283
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,507
Every time i stand up
or sit down.

284
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,175
I'm not an admiral.

285
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,844
No, sir. Of course.

286
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,761
Man, shouting:
oh, to be out

287
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,864
In the open air
again, eh?

288
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,176
Thank you, mr. Orrock.

289
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,944
How does it steer?

290
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,514
Prowse: holding
steady, sir, but...

291
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,116
Always a "but,"
mr. Prowse.

292
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,653
Ship boat!

293
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,255
Where away?

294
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,725
4 points off
the larboard bow!

295
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,796
Couldn't be the "grasshopper's"
people, sir.

296
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,130
Not this far north.

297
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,371
Well, whoever
they are, mr. Bush,

298
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,906
We must go to their aid.

299
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,974
Mr. Orrock!
Launch the quarter boat!

300
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,109
Aye-Aye, sir!

301
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,645
Mr. Prowse!
Take us to windward!

302
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:20,879
Get her under our lee!

303
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,114
Aye-Aye, sir!

304
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,888
Pull, men! Pull!

305
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,361
Close as you dare,
mr. Prowse!

306
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,929
Aye-Aye, sir!

307
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,706
We're coming!
Hold on!

308
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,578
Thank god, sirs!
We're sinking! Thank god!

309
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,812
Americans!

310
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,614
They're a long way
from home!

311
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:01,487
Here, sir!
Take hold!

312
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,262
This way, sir!

313
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,535
Come on, ma'am!

314
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,470
No, maguire!
You go first!

315
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,072
After you, ma'am.
I insist!

316
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,106
Man: quickly now!
Both of you!

317
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,341
Do as i say, maguire!

318
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,009
Come on, ma'am!

319
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,944
Take my hand!

320
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,554
She's gone!
She's gone over!

321
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,390
Where is she?

322
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,292
Matthews,
man, where is she?

323
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,527
Matthews: overboard!

324
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,845
[Coughing]
help!

325
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,985
Help!

326
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,656
It's all right, ma'am!
I've got you!

327
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,296
It's all right, sir.
Just grab hold of me, sir.

328
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,831
I'm tied to a rope, sir.

329
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,666
Well done, doughty.

330
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,046
You swim, doughty!

331
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,748
You cook,
and you swim!

332
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,349
What a useful man
you are!

333
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,984
Thank you, sir.

334
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,992
I thank you, sir.

335
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,794
My husband and i
will thank you.

336
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,296
Merci, monsieur.

337
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:55,868
He's a frog.

338
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,582
Man: no!
[Speaking french]

339
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,785
I'm not french!
My name is joseph billen.

340
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,386
I'm from switzerland!

341
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,088
This is my
american wife.

342
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,256
Bound for france,

343
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,092
Yet you claim
to be swiss.

344
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,660
Mr. Bush!

345
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,896
Woman: joseph's father
is dying, captain.

346
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,330
We were on our way
to switzerland,

347
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,465
So he could see me
before--

348
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,367
He wants to meet betsy.
He wants to see us.

349
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,501
It's his final dream.

350
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,770
And you would risk
this dream by leaving

351
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,039
Your ship and attempting
to row ashore

352
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,607
In a quarter boat
in a storm?

353
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,176
Betsy: i am
to blame, sir.

354
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,478
Our captain refused
to put in to brest.

355
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,913
I offered maguire
money.

356
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,914
And you took it?

357
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:42,948
It was more money

358
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,416
Than i could refuse,
sir.

359
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,018
And we'll offer you
the same amount, captain,

360
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,953
If you'll take us
ashore now.

361
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,955
Mr. And mrs. Billen
will occupy

362
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,190
Mr. Bush's quarters.

363
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,858
Aye-Aye, sir.

364
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,894
As for you, we've always
room for another hand.

365
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,262
I'm an american
citizen, sir.

366
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,564
Well, you're an able
seaman in the royal navy

367
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,299
Until you can prove it.

368
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,633
I won't take
your money, sir,

369
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,469
And until this storm
has abated,

370
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,237
You'll be going nowhere.

371
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,178
So we don't trust them
at all, sir?

372
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,115
We don't know enough
yet either way...

373
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,083
But let's be cautious
until we do.

374
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,253
No sign of
the "grasshopper," sir!

375
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,755
Though, i fear,
in this weather,

376
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,324
We'd not see her, even if
she were right before us!

377
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,892
If we can find
the ship's boat

378
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,427
In the middle of
the ocean, mr. Prowse,

379
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,062
We'll find
a sloop of war.

380
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,731
How is our french
friend, sir?

381
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,433
He's swiss,
mr. Orrock,

382
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:35,768
You'd do well to
remember that.

383
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,241
I've shown our guests
to the quarters,

384
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,244
But some of the men, sir,
they're asking

385
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,478
Who it is who's
come aboard.

386
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,080
What did you
tell them?

387
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,349
I said they were
american, sir,

388
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,318
And i told maguire and
doughty to say the same,

389
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,120
But i fear when
the rest of the men

390
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,089
Hear the gentleman's
accent, sir,

391
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:58,924
They may jump to
the wrong conclusion.

392
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,627
Indeed they might.

393
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,697
So, maguire, what
are you at heart then?

394
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,031
A paddy or a yank?

395
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,567
Me dad was a paddy
all his life.

396
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,868
But for me,
it's life, liberty,

397
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,704
And the pursuit
of happiness,

398
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,738
Which don't include
serving

399
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,506
In his majesty's
navy.

400
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,743
It's his majesty's navy that
saved your life, shipmate.

401
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,712
Don't you forget it.

402
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,148
Here comes the man who
saved the captain's life.

403
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,217
Anyone could have
done that.

404
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,251
He even needed a rope.

405
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,553
I wouldn't have needed
no bloody rope.

406
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,223
Nay, man.
You can't even swim.

407
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,458
Hero, my eye.

408
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,594
Look at him.

409
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,529
Mollycoddling
the bloody americans.

410
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,399
The americans are
our guests, styles.

411
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,334
I'm sure you would
be equally attentive,

412
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,203
Were you still
the captain's steward.

413
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:58,150
Enter.

414
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,589
Ahh! Madam billen.

415
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,890
I trust you are rested.

416
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,492
Yes, thank you,
captain hornblower.

417
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:09,261
Forgive me, madam,
but i think it might

418
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,296
Be best if both
you and your husband

419
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,798
Confined yourselves
to your cabin.

420
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,500
You mean
we are prisoners.

421
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,235
No, madam,
but we are at war,

422
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,503
And this is not
a pleasure craft.

423
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,506
I only wanted
to say thank you,

424
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,573
Captain hornblower.

425
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,211
Sir, i don't suppose it
is my place to say,

426
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,280
But you were looking for
a ship, were you not?

427
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,381
An english ship.

428
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,749
We are.
What of it?

429
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,818
Well, we saw a ship
in distress.

430
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,553
Too close to the rocks,
our captain said,

431
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:35,888
Indeed, he refused
to even consider

432
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,222
Landing us
in such waters.

433
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,458
When? When did
you see this?

434
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,626
Only yesterday.

435
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,594
It was further
north, sir.

436
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,030
They were sailing south.

437
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,198
You're looking
the wrong way.

438
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:50,269
You tell me this now.

439
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:52,738
Why now?
Forgive me for asking.

440
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,006
So you might
set us ashore,

441
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:55,474
Captain hornblower.

442
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,309
In france.

443
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,144
We do not wish to impose
upon you any longer.

444
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,181
Your husband sent you
to me, didn't he?

445
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,183
No, sir.

446
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,784
I do not think my
husband would thank me

447
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,519
For trading in this
fashion with you.

448
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:08,654
Because he's a frenchman?

449
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,428
You know little
of the seas,

450
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,597
So i'll forgive you.

451
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,032
But let me inform you.

452
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,568
Were you in
the british navy,

453
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:26,772
The punishment for striking
any superior is death.

454
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,540
I'd hate to think that i
had saved you for nothing.

455
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,014
Northwest, sir?

456
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,682
Yes, mr. Bush,
northwest.

457
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,086
Bush: sir, i don't
trust the lady.

458
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,554
I think it could
well be a trap.

459
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,256
I know, mr. Bush.

460
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:45,290
But she's little
to gain

461
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:46,592
And much to lose
by lying.

462
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,327
I fear, sir, that this
may take us back

463
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:49,395
Into the eye
of the storm.

464
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:53,298
Yes, mr. Prowse.

465
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:55,367
So...we'd be heading
into a trap

466
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,102
And a storm then,
gentlemen.

467
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,372
Rest assured that
captain bracegirdle

468
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,473
Would do the same
for us.

469
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,641
Aye-Aye, sir.

470
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:03,642
Aye-Aye, sir.

471
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,525
No sign of the
"grasshopper," sir.

472
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,960
If my calculations
are correct, mr. Bush,

473
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,929
Our guests sailed
past here yesterday.

474
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,731
I hope, sir, you are
right and i am wrong.

475
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,267
Mr. Prowse.
Sir?

476
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,401
We'll clear the headland
and look into

477
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,036
The next bay.
Aye-Aye, sir.

478
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,240
Mr. Orrock,
what do you see?

479
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,475
A top mast, sir!

480
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,543
Is it
the "grasshopper"?

481
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,544
Can you make her out?

482
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,280
I can, sir.
What, man?

483
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:42,981
She's run aground, sir.

484
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,692
No sign of shore
battery, sir?

485
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,727
No.

486
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,430
It's quiet.
Uncomfortably quiet.

487
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,233
Neither your trap
nor mr. Prowse's storm.

488
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:02,801
Although one
or other such thing

489
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,003
Befell
the "grasshopper."

490
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,105
Mr. Prowse.
Sir?

491
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,740
How far are we
from brest?

492
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:08,974
Oh, a day
at the most, sir.

493
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:11,210
We cannot assume
that bonaparte

494
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,479
Has all his troops
in brest alone.

495
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,614
Mr. Bush, ready
the quarter boat.

496
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:16,882
Aye-Aye, sir.

497
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,951
We'll search for what
survivors there may be.

498
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,258
Hornblower:
mr. Bush.

499
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,693
Matthews, styles,
you come with me.

500
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,895
Mr. Orrock, you stay here with
the crew and keep a lookout.

501
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:31,630
Aye-Aye, sir.
To me, marines!

502
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,199
Man: you heard
the officer.

503
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:44,376
Maguire.

504
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:46,845
You stay there, man.
You stay there.

505
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:13,172
Bush:
poor devils.

506
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,873
No wounds.

507
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,042
Seems the sea killed them,
not the french.

508
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,279
I'll wager
the french

509
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:21,947
Played their
part, sir.

510
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,052
Orrock: i can see
something up there!

511
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,220
Some smoke!

512
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,955
I'm sure you do, sir.

513
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,340
Orrock: sir!

514
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,576
A light along
the beach, sir!

515
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:53,479
A fire, sir!

516
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,795
No sign of the enemy,
mr. Bush.

517
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:11,497
I fear he may not be
far away, sir.

518
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:14,633
Indeed. Mr. Orrock,
matthews, you come with me.

519
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:15,868
Mr. Bush, keep watch.

520
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:16,902
Bush: aye-Aye, sir.

521
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,272
Styles.

522
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,188
I don't think the sea
killed this one.

523
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,826
Take cover!
Quickly, men!

524
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,897
Man: marines, take cover
behind that boat!

525
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,138
Return fire at will!

526
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,340
Return fire, styles.

527
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:55,474
What are we aiming
at, sir?

528
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:56,575
The enemy, man.

529
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,028
Matthews: another
dead one, sir?

530
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:17,296
Hornblower:
not quite, matthews.

531
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,299
Bracegirdle!
Bracegirdle!

532
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,867
Hornblower!

533
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,845
Damn! Damn!

534
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,588
Man: get down!

535
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,223
You should not have
come for me.

536
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,325
I fear some--

537
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,594
I fear it, too,
captain bracegirdle.

538
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,596
It's no good here, sir.
We're sitting ducks.

539
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,132
Orrock, matthews,
give us supporting fire.

540
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,667
I'll get captain bracegirdle
back to the boat.

541
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:59,738
Ready?

542
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:01,106
Now!

543
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,343
Orrock:
good luck, sir.

544
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,213
Stay back, sir!

545
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,021
Captain bracegirdle!

546
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,257
Captain bracegirdle!

547
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,892
Horatio!

548
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:22,361
They're moving
forward, styles.

549
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,529
We'll have
to lend a hand.

550
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,164
I'm with you, sir.

551
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:42,414
Good god!

552
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:45,217
...quarters...

553
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,720
Hard to starboard!

554
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,955
Roll out
the larboard guns!

555
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,627
We've got to
leave soon, sir,

556
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:56,895
Or we won't have
a boat to escape in.

557
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,230
You're right, mr. Bush.

558
00:29:58,298 --> 00:29:59,798
Marines! Make ready!

559
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,634
Where's maguire?

560
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,103
I don't know, sir.

561
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,505
Present! Fire!

562
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:07,840
Fire!

563
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:16,348
Now, men! Run!

564
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,186
Stop!

565
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:29,495
Man: watch out!

566
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,929
Get below...

567
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,264
Who's firing at us?

568
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,632
The frogs!
Who'd you bloody think?

569
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,267
Now get below! Reload!

570
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,935
They're throwing
their bloody guns

571
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:37,936
At us now, sir.

572
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,038
Come on, men.
With me!

573
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:46,945
Man: halt!

574
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,114
Attention!

575
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:53,619
Time to leave,
gentlemen!

576
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:54,553
Heave!

577
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,234
Wolfe: these damn french
have let them all sail away.

578
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,572
And what do i get?

579
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,608
I get you.

580
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:19,645
I know hornblower.

581
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,146
I used to serve him, too.

582
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,549
I was his coxswain,

583
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,484
And i wish he was stood
here before me now,

584
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:26,752
But as it is,
you'll have to do.

585
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:30,055
Have you anything
to say for yourself?

586
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,826
Plenty, sir.

587
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:34,760
Plenty.

588
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:54,179
Why would captain bracegirdle
risk it, sir?

589
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:57,016
Taking his ship in
so close?

590
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,351
As i remember him,
he was such a cautious man.

591
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,020
Hornblower: quite.

592
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,688
Which means
he must have had

593
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,189
A good reason.

594
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:05,858
The patient
is restored to us,

595
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,459
In body
if not yet in mind.

596
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:09,795
Bracegirdle: gentlemen...

597
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:14,767
Just like old times
on the "indy."

598
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,371
The 3 of us together.

599
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,473
Like old times.

600
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:25,377
Do you know where you are,
bracegirdle?

601
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:31,884
I'm on your ship,
horatio...

602
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,819
Because
i lost my own.

603
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,825
And why were you
so close to shore?

604
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:46,065
I saw...boats...

605
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,901
Guns mounted...

606
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,736
Rowing along
the coast.

607
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,240
There's something
about them.

608
00:32:55,308 --> 00:33:00,913
So then i kept watch
for days.

609
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,082
And then they...

610
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,683
Disappeared
into an inlet.

611
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:10,856
I don't remember.

612
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:12,858
This will restore his wits
quick enough, sir.

613
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,133
"Doughty's patent remedy"
they call it in the...

614
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,540
I'm still working on

615
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:29,708
Making the taste
of it better.

616
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:45,791
Enemy frigate, sir.

617
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,793
Her gunports are closed.

618
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,962
Captain bracegirdle
saw gunboats

619
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,463
Paddling to
an inlet somewhere.

620
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,632
Gunboats?

621
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,967
But no frigates.

622
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,835
Captain bracegirdle,
you're with us again.

623
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:59,238
It seems god had
second thoughts about me.

624
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:02,941
Gunboats to blast defenders
on the english beaches.

625
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,710
Now they have
a frigate, too. Why?

626
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,312
Mr. Prowse.

627
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,313
Prowse: aye, sir?

628
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:09,314
No closer
to the shore

629
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:10,549
Until we have
the weather.

630
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:11,817
We'll ride it out
from here...

631
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,686
And wait, and watch.

632
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:14,753
Prowse: aye-Aye, sir.

633
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,031
With all due respect,
mr. Etheridge,

634
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,500
And indeed,
to the diplomatic service,

635
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:31,003
The royal navy is at war.

636
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,672
No, sir.
England is at war.

637
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,341
The royal navy
has but one weapon

638
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:36,375
In her armory.

639
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:38,510
And you would have
this weapon sheathed?

640
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,346
For what?
A wild goose chase

641
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,414
Hunting a couple
lost at sea?

642
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:43,849
Good god,

643
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,851
I have entire ships
go missing.

644
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:46,852
Hundreds of men.

645
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,354
That letter bears
the authority

646
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,523
Not only of my master, sir,
but also of yours--

647
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,059
Their lordships
at the admiralty.

648
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:55,527
Or should we send
for more lights?

649
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,864
The better to read it.

650
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,866
What is so important
about this couple

651
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:01,934
That they must be found?

652
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:03,035
She is the daughter

653
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,370
Of a wealthy
american merchant

654
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:07,906
Who has the ear of his
ambassador to london.

655
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,708
The ambassador
has the ear

656
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,410
Of the diplomatic
service and--

657
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:12,711
Yes, yes, yes.

658
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:15,881
And the diplomatic service
has the ear of the admiralty.

659
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,549
Everyone's got
each other's ears.

660
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,385
I'm surprised
they're not all deaf by now.

661
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:20,386
The girl's father

662
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:22,554
Has grown concerned
for her safety

663
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:24,356
And he wants her home
for christmas.

664
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,892
Very touching.

665
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,993
And the boy?

666
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:31,864
He is--
He is her husband.

667
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:33,532
Is that all he is?

668
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,101
He is also a frenchman.

669
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:39,738
I regret
that more than that

670
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,340
I am not at liberty
to divulge.

671
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:45,577
Well, it would make
precious little difference.

672
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,079
The gales this side
of the channel

673
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,914
Are the worst
we've had in 5 years.

674
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:51,417
I'll send no ship out
if not for battle.

675
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:54,753
The gales will not last
forever, sir.

676
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,422
No, they won't.

677
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,091
And then i shall wait
for fair weather.

678
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,259
Good.

679
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,360
You do that.

680
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:05,431
This couple,

681
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,433
They're either dead
or in france.

682
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,434
Or if they're lucky,

683
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,935
If they're very,
very lucky,

684
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,036
They've already
been picked up by

685
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:12,037
One of our ships.

686
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:14,606
That would
be good for them,

687
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,108
But not so good
for the ship.

688
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,576
Why?

689
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,614
Why, sir?
Are they dangerous?

690
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:26,285
Yes, sir edward.

691
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,619
Yes, they are.

692
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,789
Blessings.

693
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:33,859
If there's one consolation
of this sorry situation,

694
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:35,127
Your cooking is superb.

695
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,795
Mon plaisir,
monsieur.

696
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:38,630
Madame.

697
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,631
It's nice
to have someone

698
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:41,300
Who appreciates it.

699
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:44,303
He's no bloody american.

700
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,138
I'm sure i don't know
what you mean, styles.

701
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,306
I heard his way
of talking.

702
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,640
He's a frog.

703
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,409
Keep it down, styles.
He's not french.

704
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:51,410
He's swiss.

705
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,312
Swiss?

706
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,480
I knew things weren't right.

707
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,015
A bad luck, bloody frog.

708
00:36:56,082 --> 00:36:57,449
I said
keep it down, man.

709
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,151
Strangers on board,
ill luck doth afford.

710
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,285
What?
I had this feeling

711
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:01,553
What with the storm
and all that's happened,

712
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,654
But i let it go

713
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,023
On account of them
being americans,

714
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,090
No danger to us.

715
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,025
But a frog's
a different matter.

716
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,493
There's as good
as bloody jonahs,

717
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,427
And they'll be
the death of us.

718
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,670
It was my fault,

719
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:18,937
There's no denying.

720
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,510
You did what
you thought was right.

721
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:28,347
And it was wrong.

722
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,516
My ship...

723
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,352
And half the crew

724
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,953
Splintered
on those rocks.

725
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:42,895
And what happened
to those who survived?

726
00:37:42,962 --> 00:37:44,129
What happened to you?

727
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:51,036
They did not blame me
for my actions.

728
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,971
They were loyal to me
to the last.

729
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:59,144
They managed
to get ashore.

730
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:06,552
And as those bastard
frogs came at us,

731
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:09,722
My men stood by me,

732
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,490
And my men died for me.

733
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,227
And in amongst their bodies,

734
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,829
I was left for dead.

735
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,501
I wish i were dead,
horatio.

736
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,007
I lost my ship
and all my men.

737
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,748
And even if
a court martial

738
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,750
Were to acquit me,

739
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,753
I'd never get
a command again.

740
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,054
You can't be sure of that.

741
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:43,188
Can i not?

742
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,860
If you'll excuse me.

743
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,194
If it helps you to know...

744
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:52,831
I believe
that i would have

745
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:54,600
Done the same.

746
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,236
Whatever the frogs
are up to in that inlet,

747
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:59,204
It is our duty
to find out.

748
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:09,248
The gamble you took...
i would've taken it, too.

749
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,634
All well?

750
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:29,735
Aye, sir. All well.

751
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,641
I wouldn't count on us
making it till morning.

752
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,143
What's got to you, man?

753
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:40,145
Nothing, sir.

754
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:42,247
It's just...

755
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:45,584
Got this feeling,
that's all.

756
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,088
There's nothing out there,
but a long, cold night.

757
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,495
Come.

758
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,101
I wish you would keep
to your quarters.

759
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,672
Woman: it is my husband
you fear wandering,

760
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,040
Is it not?

761
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:10,042
And he is fast asleep.

762
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,477
He has the right idea.

763
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:13,078
You wish we weren't
aboard your ship, sir?

764
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:16,215
It certainly doesn't help
my mission, madame.

765
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:18,684
That is all
you care about?

766
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,185
I fear my husband
would be the same

767
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:21,553
Were he at war.

768
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:27,593
Did he give you that?

769
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,429
As a token
of his love, yes.

770
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:32,097
Do you have a keepsake
from a sweetheart?

771
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:34,733
No, madam.

772
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:38,237
When we left, my...wife,

773
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:43,075
She--She gave me
some gloves.

774
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:44,176
Are you long married?

775
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:45,277
No.

776
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:46,311
Nor me.

777
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:52,051
Put us ashore, sir,
as soon as you can.

778
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:53,719
We are not a cargo
you wish to hold.

779
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:57,656
Please. Trust me.

780
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,436
Bloody hell.

781
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:11,737
Don't shoot!

782
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:12,738
It's me!

783
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:13,739
It's your old friend,
maguire!

784
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,909
It's maguire!

785
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,812
Over here!

786
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,313
Take this line!

787
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:27,820
All fast! Pull away!

788
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:29,588
Pull away, boys!

789
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,357
Men: heave!

790
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:33,425
Heave!

791
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:37,096
Heave!

792
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:38,263
We heard
you were dead, man.

793
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,498
I very nearly was, sir,

794
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,367
But it will take more
than a few frogs to hold me.

795
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:42,601
You were captured, then?

796
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:43,602
I was sir, yes.

797
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,270
Outnumbered i was, sir.

798
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:46,338
I tried to fight,

799
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:47,606
But it was
absolutely useless.

800
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:48,607
And then
a miraculous escape.

801
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,112
We're boarded!

802
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,446
Man: all aboard!

803
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:55,781
Do you believe me now, eh?

804
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,216
Come on!

805
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,308
Well done, soldier.

806
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,843
Let's find our man.

807
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,518
He'll be in the first
lieutenant's cabin.

808
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:36,989
Hornblower: wolfe?

809
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,123
Don't waste time here.

810
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:48,534
Drop your weapon,
wolfe.

811
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,235
Captain hornblower,

812
00:42:50,303 --> 00:42:51,503
You have something
belonging to france

813
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:53,138
And i'm here to collect it.

814
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:55,507
So you're still
risking your life

815
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:56,742
For bonaparte.

816
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,010
You know how it is.

817
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,979
He scratches my back,
i scratch his.

818
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:05,784
Die!

819
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,816
Styles, with me.

820
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,488
Put the weapon down,
wolfe!

821
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,824
Put the weapon down!

822
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,903
Stop there, maguire,
or i'll shoot.

823
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,472
I wish my guests to stay.

824
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,641
Ignore him, maguire.

825
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:04,410
He'd never shoot a man
in cold blood.

826
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:06,879
But i would, and gladly.

827
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:08,580
I will kill him, wolfe.

828
00:44:08,648 --> 00:44:10,249
I have cause enough.

829
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:12,985
Mr. Bush, relieve him
of his weapon.

830
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:14,453
He comes near me

831
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:15,587
And i shoot you,
hornblower.

832
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:18,557
So which is it to be,
me or you?

833
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:19,758
Or us both?

834
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:20,759
Kill him, mr. Bush,

835
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:23,262
And let him die
for france.

836
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:24,463
Can't.

837
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:28,434
The decent englishman.

838
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,202
If only you had
the guts to match.

839
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,037
Obey my orders, mr. Bush,
damn you!

840
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:43,248
All right, mr. Bush,
let us have it your way.

841
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:45,484
Let us surrender.

842
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,630
Hornblower:
wolfe's getting away!

843
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,666
Stop him!

844
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:03,802
I surrender, captain.

845
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,571
I am not swiss.
I am a frenchman.

846
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:08,140
I know that you are
french, monsieur.

847
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,743
Madam, might i see
that locket?

848
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:22,988
I thought i recognized
this crest.

849
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,790
A prominent family,
i believe.

850
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:27,359
The "b" does not stand
for "betsy" does it?

851
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:31,864
Does it?

852
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,771
Who do i have the pleasure
of addressing, sir?

853
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:43,375
This "b" is for...

854
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:46,512
Bonaparte.

855
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,881
I'm jerome lucien
alexandre bonaparte.

856
00:45:48,948 --> 00:45:50,449
I'm the brother
of napoleon.

857
00:45:55,455 --> 00:45:56,388
Lock him up.

858
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:57,690
Man: marines!

859
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:00,492
Lock them both up.

860
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:12,705
You have the brother

861
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:13,706
Of england's
archenemy aboard.

862
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:15,207
I'd say you have
good reason

863
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:16,875
To return to england.

864
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:18,610
Is that what you would do
if you were captain?

865
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,416
Something else
is happening here.

866
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:26,385
Ships cannons on land.

867
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,722
Gunboats, frigates,
and now wolfe.

868
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:30,723
Would you leave and let

869
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,458
All these questions
go unanswered?

870
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:33,559
We've been boarded once

871
00:46:33,626 --> 00:46:34,560
And we'll be
boarded again.

872
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:36,061
Bonaparte wants
his brother back.

873
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,064
Bonaparte wants the world.

874
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:43,068
He wouldn't waste
such time and effort on--

875
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,903
On family.

876
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,572
No, we are but a diversion.

877
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,441
I'm sure of it.

878
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:52,578
Well, if you're right,

879
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:55,014
Let me be the one
to go ashore.

880
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:58,751
This is still
my mission, horatio,

881
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,586
And if i am to face
a court martial

882
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:02,454
For the loss of my ship,

883
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:04,456
Let it not be in vain.

884
00:47:04,524 --> 00:47:07,393
Man: stand by
to leave ship!

885
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,094
Mr. Bush, a moment
if you please.

886
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:16,268
When wolfe
held his gun to me,

887
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:17,336
You should
have shot him.

888
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:18,303
Damn it, man,

889
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:19,304
He could have taken
the whole ship.

890
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:20,673
I couldn't do it.

891
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,974
Don't disobey me,
william.

892
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:24,943
Never again.

893
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:26,111
I command the "hotspur,"

894
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:28,714
And that is all
that matters to me.

895
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:31,650
Captain bracegirdle
has lost his ship

896
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,619
And he's a carcass
of a man.

897
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,988
I'd rather die
than share his fate.

898
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:42,194
Man: bonaparte's
brother, damn it,

899
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:43,796
On one of my ships.

900
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:44,830
Which one?

901
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:46,265
Which brother
or which ship?

902
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:47,266
Mr. Etheridge,

903
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:48,834
This is not a matter
for jest.

904
00:47:48,902 --> 00:47:54,306
Good god,
boney's brother.

905
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:55,808
I had a right to know.

906
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,776
And now you do.

907
00:47:57,844 --> 00:47:58,711
The ship is the "hotspur."

908
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:03,182
How do you know this?

909
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:08,053
We have contacts in france.

910
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:09,988
So tell me,
is the captain

911
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,457
Of the "hotspur"
a naval officer?

912
00:48:11,524 --> 00:48:12,958
Yes. He's one
of my best.

913
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:14,660
Good, so now
the weather is improved,

914
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,829
I trust he will deliver
his burden back to england

915
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:18,397
In, say, two days?

916
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:20,165
I'm sure the captain
will trust his intuition

917
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:23,335
And exercise
the proper judgement.

918
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,570
That is all.
I'll say good day, sir.

919
00:48:24,637 --> 00:48:25,571
The french know
we're here,

920
00:48:25,638 --> 00:48:27,673
So let's keep
this visit brief.

921
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,842
Matthews you will go
with captain bracegirdle

922
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:31,176
To the south
of the inlet.

923
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:32,678
Mr. Bush,
you will come with me

924
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:33,779
To the north.

925
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:34,780
Mr. Orrock.

926
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:35,781
Sir?

927
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:37,950
I shall leave you
in command.

928
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:39,251
If we are gone any longer
than two hours,

929
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,252
You know
what you must do.

930
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,021
Press sail to england, sir,

931
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:43,455
And deliver our guests
to the authorities.

932
00:48:43,523 --> 00:48:47,026
Good. Let's hope
we all sail with it.

933
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:47,960
Carry on.

934
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:02,675
Don't forget, captain,
we only have two hours.

935
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:04,076
I won't.

936
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:19,925
I ask you,

937
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:21,894
Going all that way
to face boney's army

938
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,829
When we've got his own
brother right here...

939
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:28,267
Styles.

940
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:29,668
You watch yourself.

941
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:33,939
Aye-Aye, sir.

942
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,253
Keep a sharp look out.

943
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:49,254
Any sign of the french,

944
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:50,255
And you return
to the ship.

945
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:51,357
Aye-Aye, sir.

946
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:08,107
Keep up, matthews.

947
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:10,275
It's but a stroll.

948
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:11,276
Begging your pardon, sir,

949
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:12,544
It's a bloody great cliff.

950
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,287
Prowse:
rather them than me.

951
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:30,129
Mr. Orrock, sir,

952
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:32,297
I was just wondering if...

953
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:35,801
Well, i had been making
our guests breakfast.

954
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,302
They're prisoners now.

955
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,972
No breakfasts.

956
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,640
They can go hungry.

957
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,242
Let the men
see them go hungry.

958
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,012
Do you have a problem,
mr. Prowse?

959
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,313
No, sir.

960
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:50,015
You're in command.

961
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:11,337
Another ship's cannon.

962
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,271
Come on.

963
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:26,018
I think we might be
outnumbered.

964
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,954
Come along.
Time's winged chariot.

965
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:36,695
 oh, jackie,
oh, we rescued her 

966
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:38,197
 and she don't need
her pony 

967
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:39,865
 but with her
on her.. 

968
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,267
 she's got a...

969
00:51:42,335 --> 00:51:43,268
Stop that at once.

970
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:45,204
It's just a little ditty, sir.

971
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:46,372
There are nothing
in the articles of war

972
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:47,706
Saying we can't make up
our own words,

973
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,308
Is there, sir?

974
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:22,741
I see no ship, sir.

975
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:23,909
Then they must be
further down

976
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,110
Where it opens out again.

977
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:27,546
But that must be
another mile, sir.

978
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:28,747
We might be able
to get there.

979
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,582
We'll never get back
in the time, sir.

980
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,084
I've come this far,
matthews.

981
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,086
I'm not giving up now,

982
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:37,256
But neither do i wish
to remain in france.

983
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,590
I think i'll boat across

984
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,426
To captain hornblower's side
at the inlet.

985
00:52:40,493 --> 00:52:41,593
Tell him
i'm right behind you.

986
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:42,594
Tell him
i need more time.

987
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:43,762
But, sir--

988
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,597
You wait there
for captain hornblower,

989
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:46,865
Send our boat
back for me.

990
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:48,300
If you're sure, sir.

991
00:52:48,368 --> 00:52:50,202
It's an order, matthews.

992
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:10,823
Pleasant as ever.

993
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,024
I knew he wasn't here

994
00:53:12,092 --> 00:53:14,159
To rescue
a missing frenchman,

995
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:16,795
However noble
that frenchman's birth.

996
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:25,738
Wolfe: you lazy dog!

997
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:40,979
We truly are surrounded.

998
00:55:00,633 --> 00:55:02,167
Bracegirdle: great god,
let this be it.

999
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:15,848
Damn.

1000
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:30,929
What are you doing here,
matthews?

1001
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:32,231
What's happened
to captain bracegirdle?

1002
00:55:32,298 --> 00:55:34,099
He said he needed
more time, sir.

1003
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:35,601
He said he won't be long.

1004
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:37,503
I sent the other boat
back to wait for him, sir.

1005
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,937
Very well.

1006
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:39,938
You'll have
to come with us.

1007
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:41,040
Aye-Aye, sir.

1008
00:56:01,327 --> 00:56:03,262
Have you good news
for me, soldier?

1009
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:07,132
How long have we left?

1010
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,133
Dead on, sir.

1011
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,803
Thought you might
want these, sir.

1012
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:11,970
Wind's getting up, sir.

1013
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:13,872
Prepare to make sail,
mr. Prowse.

1014
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,807
Aye-Aye, sir.

1015
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:18,477
Captain!
At the cliff top, sir!

1016
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,578
Glass.

1017
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:56,181
Let's close the distance
for them, mr. Prowse.

1018
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:57,182
Aye-Aye, sir.

1019
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,633
It's not a ship's cannon
this time, is it, sir?

1020
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,040
No, mr. Bush.

1021
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:22,041
I don't
believe it is.

1022
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:29,048
Row, damn you! Row!

1023
00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:31,850
Captain hornblower!

1024
00:57:31,918 --> 00:57:32,785
I know!

1025
00:57:32,852 --> 00:57:35,387
I can't make out
what he's saying.

1026
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:38,223
It's not the cannons!

1027
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,692
It's not the cannons!

1028
00:57:41,661 --> 00:57:42,995
The ship!

1029
00:57:56,776 --> 00:57:57,843
Not a chance.

1030
00:58:04,851 --> 00:58:05,751
Tres bien.

1031
00:58:09,856 --> 00:58:12,524
Now, let's see
if we can get the real prize.

1032
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:41,253
3 cheers for the captain!

1033
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:42,254
Hip hip!

1034
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:43,856
Resume your duty,
mr. Orrock.

1035
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:48,961
Throw the damn thing
overboard.

1036
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:26,532
Enter.

1037
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:28,834
Ah, mr. Bush.
We sail for england.

1038
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:30,202
Tell mr. Prowse
to plot a course.

1039
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,670
Aye-Aye, sir.

1040
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:33,172
Should i get doughty

1041
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:34,273
And, say,
look at your hand?

1042
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:40,512
Do you suppose
he has a potion for it?

1043
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,513
Do you suppose
he has a potion

1044
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:44,183
For captain bracegirdle?

1045
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,752
No, i wish to be
left alone for awhile.

1046
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,854
I wish to write my report.

1047
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:51,957
I trust you'll mention

1048
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:53,525
Your part
in the action, sir?

1049
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:55,160
I'm sorry, mr. Bush?

1050
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:56,495
The shells.

1051
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:59,031
Do you mean
the 5-Inch shell

1052
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:00,032
That was fired from shore

1053
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,200
Which failed to explode,
mr. Bush?

1054
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:02,601
That shell?

1055
01:00:02,669 --> 01:00:04,103
Well, that's hardly
a full account, sir.

1056
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,071
Was it not
a 5-Inch shell?

1057
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:07,306
Yes, it was.

1058
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:08,540
Was it not fired
from shore?

1059
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:09,541
Of course.

1060
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:10,542
Did it perhaps explode

1061
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,543
Without my noticing,
mr. Bush?

1062
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:12,544
The reason it
didn't explode, sir,

1063
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:13,545
Is because of
your bravery,

1064
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:14,546
Bravery which
should not

1065
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:15,714
Go unacknowledged.

1066
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:18,484
Don't presume to tell me
i was brave, mr. Bush.

1067
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:24,223
I thought i'd be
blown to bloody rags...

1068
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,360
Like my dear friend.

1069
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:29,561
Which makes
your heroism, sir,

1070
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:30,996
All the greater.

1071
01:00:35,669 --> 01:00:38,570
We are not actresses.

1072
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:40,406
We are
the king's officers,

1073
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:41,974
And we have
a duty to do.

1074
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:44,009
And we've not
a thought to spare

1075
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:45,010
For anything else.

1076
01:00:47,647 --> 01:00:48,580
Now, remember that,
mr. Bush.

1077
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:49,948
Yes, sir.

1078
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:54,653
Now...take us home.

1079
01:01:13,873 --> 01:01:15,007
Enter.

1080
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:18,777
Ah.

1081
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:19,878
Hornblower.

1082
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:22,314
My report, sir.

1083
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:26,618
I regret
to inform you that

1084
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:29,521
Captain bracegirdle was
killed in action, sir.

1085
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:30,622
Indeed.

1086
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,825
That is
to be regretted.

1087
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:36,829
He died in the line of
duty, sir,

1088
01:01:36,896 --> 01:01:38,897
And with honor.

1089
01:01:38,965 --> 01:01:40,566
He was endeavoring
to let us know

1090
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:44,036
What he had discovered
when his boat was...

1091
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:45,037
Well, destroyed.

1092
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,905
However,
you should have returned

1093
01:01:46,973 --> 01:01:47,906
When you discovered
the identity of

1094
01:01:47,974 --> 01:01:48,907
Your passengers.

1095
01:01:48,975 --> 01:01:51,477
Yes, sir.

1096
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:53,412
Something's happening
along that coast.

1097
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,182
An army led by
a tyrant apprentice.

1098
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,617
You remember
the renegade wolfe, sir.

1099
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:02,388
God. That damn man
is back to haunt us, is he?

1100
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:05,190
Yes, sir, and i'd like
to return to france

1101
01:02:05,258 --> 01:02:06,759
To find out exactly
what he's planning.

1102
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:08,060
Well, i'm afraid,
hornblower,

1103
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:10,562
It's not quite as
simple as that.

1104
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,332
The diplomatic service
has taken quite an interest

1105
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,800
In your antics.

1106
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:16,402
They knew i had
a bonaparte on board.

1107
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:17,670
Indeed they did.

1108
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:19,905
And their authority
knows no bounds.

1109
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:21,306
Their authority, in fact,

1110
01:02:21,374 --> 01:02:23,108
Has quarantined
your ship.

1111
01:02:23,176 --> 01:02:24,109
Quarantined?

1112
01:02:24,177 --> 01:02:25,611
Lest half of portsmouth

1113
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:27,413
Be privy to
matters of state,

1114
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,114
No one is allowed
off the "hotspur,"

1115
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:31,216
And no one is
allowed on.

1116
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:34,053
Sorry. It's not
my decision.

1117
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,654
Mr. Bush has already
been informed.

1118
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:37,222
And how long
will this last?

1119
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,924
Surely this quarantine
doesn't include me.

1120
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,194
What will i do?

1121
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:43,696
I'd make the most of
this sorry situation

1122
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:45,197
And go home
to your wife.

1123
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:46,699
Try and
remind yourself

1124
01:02:46,766 --> 01:02:48,133
What you're
fighting for.

1125
01:02:59,512 --> 01:03:01,947
You've been here 3 days,

1126
01:03:02,015 --> 01:03:03,382
Yet each morning
you seem

1127
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,483
Surprised to see me.

1128
01:03:04,551 --> 01:03:07,753
Pleasantly surprised,
my dear.

1129
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:15,160
And each morning,

1130
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:16,328
You go to the window

1131
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:17,429
And look out at
the harbor.

1132
01:03:17,497 --> 01:03:20,265
You're right,
of course.

1133
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,467
Oh, horrie.

1134
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:24,003
Can't you forget about
your ship for one day?

1135
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,138
No, maria, i don't
believe i can,

1136
01:03:26,206 --> 01:03:28,440
Not while my men are
still aboard her.

1137
01:03:28,508 --> 01:03:30,509
Do you think they'll be
let ashore before christmas?

1138
01:03:30,577 --> 01:03:31,443
I hope not.

1139
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:37,449
I think the "hotspur"
may set sail

1140
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:38,684
By the week's end.

1141
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:48,627
I know you want me here.

1142
01:03:52,098 --> 01:03:53,399
But right now, i...

1143
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:58,070
I wish i was at sea.

1144
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:00,105
It's where i'm needed.

1145
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:01,240
Try to understand.

1146
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,715
I found your gloves
whilst you were sleeping.

1147
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,054
They're in
a sorry state.

1148
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:16,555
It was nothing.

1149
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:20,793
Perhaps you might
tell me

1150
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,628
Some stories of
your life at sea.

1151
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:25,631
They're not stories,
maria,

1152
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:28,701
And i do not wish
to talk about it.

1153
01:04:28,768 --> 01:04:31,737
Then do not expect me
to understand.

1154
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:37,443
Strangers on board,
you'll look to the ford.

1155
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:38,644
Oh...

1156
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:40,045
But i was right
all along.

1157
01:04:40,113 --> 01:04:41,513
Right about what?

1158
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:43,148
Well, first,

1159
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:44,950
Our guests turned out
to be bonapartes.

1160
01:04:45,018 --> 01:04:46,318
Next,
captain bracegirdle

1161
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:47,820
Goes and gets himself
killed,

1162
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:49,321
Then we're left
out here to rot

1163
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:50,823
As if we've got the
plague. We're cursed.

1164
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,324
Oh, do shut up, styles.

1165
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:53,459
It's bad enough
you look like

1166
01:04:53,526 --> 01:04:54,526
A gypsy soothsayer

1167
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:55,828
Without babbling on
like one.

1168
01:04:55,895 --> 01:04:57,096
What do you care?

1169
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:58,030
Steady.

1170
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:02,267
You didn't even know
captain bracegirdle.

1171
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,070
You're just as much
a stranger on this ship

1172
01:05:05,138 --> 01:05:06,572
As--As our frogs.

1173
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:09,108
It's just a bad
turn of events, that's all.

1174
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:11,343
Bad? What, it's all
right for the captain?

1175
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:12,711
Having a grand old
time on shore.

1176
01:05:12,779 --> 01:05:14,613
This ship's gone
all to hell.

1177
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:16,882
I didn't catch
that, styles.

1178
01:05:18,351 --> 01:05:19,351
I think styles
was just saying

1179
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:20,352
How much he
loves serving in

1180
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,221
The "hotspur,"
mr. Bush.

1181
01:05:22,288 --> 01:05:23,322
Isn't that
right, styles?

1182
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:24,323
Yes, sir.
That's right, sir.

1183
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:26,925
Bush: matthews.

1184
01:05:26,993 --> 01:05:28,994
Be careful what you
let the men mumble.

1185
01:05:29,062 --> 01:05:31,063
Wouldn't want them
to be misunderstood.

1186
01:05:36,302 --> 01:05:38,671
I don't care much
for reading,

1187
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:40,673
But i'm told there's
mention of you in here.

1188
01:05:44,511 --> 01:05:45,878
I'm sure it's about
captain bracegirdle

1189
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:46,979
Rather than myself.

1190
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:50,115
Yes, i hear
he died a hero.

1191
01:05:50,183 --> 01:05:52,518
You men in uniform.

1192
01:05:52,585 --> 01:05:54,286
Could've been
you, horatio.

1193
01:05:56,723 --> 01:05:59,024
"Captain hornblower
reported the 'hotspur'

1194
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,959
"Was struck by
a 5-Inch shell,

1195
01:06:01,027 --> 01:06:02,795
"Which did considerable
damage aloft

1196
01:06:02,862 --> 01:06:05,731
But which, fortunately,
failed to explode."

1197
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:06,732
Oh, horrie.

1198
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,233
It was nothing.

1199
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:10,002
As clear as it is
written in black and white,

1200
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,170
It did not even explode.

1201
01:06:11,237 --> 01:06:12,171
You could have died.

1202
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:15,074
My friend bracegirdle
did exactly that,

1203
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:16,375
And i wish i were
back aboard my ship

1204
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:17,643
Ensuring he did not
die in vain.

1205
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,387
I'm sorry.

1206
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:33,125
Maria, please.
Please don't cry.

1207
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:40,299
Horatio.

1208
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:44,470
You think you're just
the "hotspur"'s captain.

1209
01:06:44,537 --> 01:06:47,439
You think only of
your 100 crew.

1210
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:49,808
But you're also
a husband now.

1211
01:06:50,944 --> 01:06:52,978
Is it too much
that you might

1212
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:54,079
Think of one wife?

1213
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:56,448
That you might
think of her as

1214
01:06:56,516 --> 01:06:57,783
Your duty, too?

1215
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:12,431
The fat arse of
the body politic

1216
01:07:12,499 --> 01:07:13,766
Finally stirs,

1217
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,334
And this is
what we get.

1218
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:16,902
Etheridge: it was
thought, initially,

1219
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:17,970
That bonaparte's
brother could be

1220
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,538
A tool for
propaganda,

1221
01:07:19,606 --> 01:07:21,306
But after
much debate,

1222
01:07:21,374 --> 01:07:22,708
It has been
agreed that

1223
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:24,576
This callow youth
means little to us

1224
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:25,711
After all,

1225
01:07:25,779 --> 01:07:27,479
At least
politically.

1226
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:28,881
Indeed,
he could prove

1227
01:07:28,948 --> 01:07:29,882
A severe
embarrassment

1228
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:30,983
To his majesty,
if he were to

1229
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:32,251
Set foot on
english soil.

1230
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:33,986
Mmm. From a military
standpoint, he knows nothing.

1231
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,487
He's been in america
for the last 3 years.

1232
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:36,855
He's no use to us.

1233
01:07:36,923 --> 01:07:38,157
Which is why
we have decided

1234
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:39,358
To take this
course of action.

1235
01:07:39,426 --> 01:07:42,094
So, captain hornblower's
to throw his fish

1236
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:43,629
Back into the sea.

1237
01:07:43,697 --> 01:07:45,364
Having endangered his ship,

1238
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:47,433
Having him aboard
for nothing.

1239
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,401
Etheridge: not for
nothing, sir edward.

1240
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:51,337
Not entirely.

1241
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:52,871
You will
deliver jerome

1242
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:54,173
Back to france,
and then you

1243
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,874
Will return
and rendezvous with

1244
01:07:55,942 --> 01:07:57,176
The american ship
"liberty,"

1245
01:07:57,243 --> 01:07:58,811
And reunite
father and daughter.

1246
01:07:58,878 --> 01:08:01,246
But why part the couple?

1247
01:08:01,314 --> 01:08:02,781
Pellew: it seems jerome

1248
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:04,350
Married somewhat in haste

1249
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:08,153
And against his brother's
express command.

1250
01:08:08,221 --> 01:08:09,855
And now boney
won't let him

1251
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,057
Set foot in france
unless he's alone

1252
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,659
And penitent.

1253
01:08:13,727 --> 01:08:15,494
Which is why
we found them

1254
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:16,762
Rowing ashore,

1255
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:17,963
Not because
their captain

1256
01:08:18,031 --> 01:08:19,198
Would not land them,
but because

1257
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:20,566
France would not
let him,

1258
01:08:20,633 --> 01:08:21,633
Not with her
on board.

1259
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:24,336
Your intelligence
surpasses your occupation,

1260
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,437
Captain hornblower.

1261
01:08:25,505 --> 01:08:26,972
You should be
in politics.

1262
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,807
Thank you, sir,
but i fear

1263
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:29,842
I would not have
the heart for it.

1264
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:32,978
I fear you underestimate
yourself, sir.

1265
01:08:33,046 --> 01:08:34,780
Now, good day, gentlemen.

1266
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:40,319
It seems
the diplomatic service

1267
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:41,553
Have made their orders
perfectly clear.

1268
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:42,988
Perfectly, sir.

1269
01:08:43,056 --> 01:08:44,757
I hope your admiral's
orders are equally clear.

1270
01:08:44,824 --> 01:08:47,359
Yes, sir. I shall
trust my intuition

1271
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:48,360
As well as observe

1272
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:49,294
And execute
my orders.

1273
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,099
Captain hornblower.

1274
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:55,200
Sir.

1275
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:56,335
You were very fortunate

1276
01:08:56,403 --> 01:08:58,003
The day captain bracegirdle
was lost

1277
01:08:58,071 --> 01:08:59,304
That the shell
did not explode

1278
01:08:59,372 --> 01:09:00,572
Aboard the "hotspur,"
were you not?

1279
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,474
Yes, sir.

1280
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:05,010
And i say,
it's unbelievable

1281
01:09:05,078 --> 01:09:09,181
What a hotbed of gossip
a fleet can be.

1282
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:12,084
The wildest tales
are circulating

1283
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:13,218
Regarding that shell.

1284
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:15,287
You cannot hold me

1285
01:09:15,355 --> 01:09:16,355
Responsible for
that, sir.

1286
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:18,123
No, indeed.

1287
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:20,492
May good fortune

1288
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,927
Always go with you,
hornblower.

1289
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,997
Thank you, sir.

1290
01:09:48,888 --> 01:09:49,822
Set a course,
mr. Prowse.

1291
01:09:49,889 --> 01:09:50,856
Take us back to

1292
01:09:50,924 --> 01:09:51,857
The "grasshopper's"
grave.

1293
01:09:51,925 --> 01:09:53,192
Aye-Aye, sir.

1294
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:54,793
We've been put off
long enough, mr. Bush.

1295
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,729
I hope the men are
ready to fight.

1296
01:09:56,796 --> 01:09:58,330
I fear the men wish
only to be rid of

1297
01:09:58,398 --> 01:09:59,932
The bonapartes, sir.

1298
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,134
May i ask
why we didn't

1299
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:04,103
Unload them while we
had the chance?

1300
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,904
No, mr. Bush.
You may not.

1301
01:10:05,972 --> 01:10:07,039
My apologies, sir.

1302
01:10:07,107 --> 01:10:08,474
Monsieur and madame
bonaparte

1303
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:09,508
Are asking for you.

1304
01:10:09,576 --> 01:10:10,509
Tell them that
i do not wish

1305
01:10:10,577 --> 01:10:11,844
To speak to them.

1306
01:10:11,911 --> 01:10:13,145
As you wish, sir.

1307
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:14,146
But...prepare them
a decent meal.

1308
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:18,050
Yes, mr. Orrock
had kept them on

1309
01:10:18,118 --> 01:10:19,051
Rations, sir,
in order that

1310
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:21,320
The men's morale
might improve.

1311
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:23,522
Morale will improve
in due course.

1312
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,157
Meanwhile, doughty,
a decent meal,

1313
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:26,725
If you please.

1314
01:10:26,793 --> 01:10:28,160
Why, aye, sir.

1315
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:29,661
Rest assured, mr. Bush,

1316
01:10:29,729 --> 01:10:31,363
It will be
their last together.

1317
01:10:35,135 --> 01:10:36,168
What's this?

1318
01:10:45,512 --> 01:10:46,478
And i thought
they were on

1319
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:47,513
Ship's biscuits
and water.

1320
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,049
Styles, let me pass.

1321
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:51,617
It is simply
a bowl of stew.

1322
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:54,386
No. It's a bowl of
our stew.

1323
01:10:56,489 --> 01:10:57,423
Don't be
an idiot, man.

1324
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,124
There's plenty
enough for everyone

1325
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:06,765
On second thought,

1326
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:07,900
You wouldn't catch
me eating that.

1327
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:09,902
I know what's in it.

1328
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:23,882
I reckon
the frogs deserved

1329
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,351
A bit of extra meat.

1330
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:29,555
You bloody simple-Minded
muttonhead.

1331
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:31,457
You wouldn't understand
the notion of

1332
01:11:31,524 --> 01:11:34,193
Taking some pride in
doing your duty.

1333
01:11:35,328 --> 01:11:37,563
Go mollycoddle
your foreign pets.

1334
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,898
The only thing that
makes this bloody life

1335
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:40,899
Bearable to me

1336
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:42,334
Is being
a decent steward!

1337
01:11:44,571 --> 01:11:46,472
The bonapartes are
jonah, doughty.

1338
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:47,906
You're serving
a bloody jonah!

1339
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:49,274
Superstitious
dumb nonsense.

1340
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:54,980
No good has come of
having them aboard!

1341
01:11:55,048 --> 01:11:57,449
Superstitious
dumb nonsense!

1342
01:11:59,853 --> 01:12:01,587
Belay there!
Doughty, styles!

1343
01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:27,312
I'm sorry to put you
out like this, sir.

1344
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,915
You struck
a superior officer.

1345
01:12:29,983 --> 01:12:30,916
Once we return
to england,

1346
01:12:30,984 --> 01:12:31,984
You will face
a court-Martial.

1347
01:12:32,052 --> 01:12:32,918
And i will hang, sir.

1348
01:12:32,986 --> 01:12:34,086
They will have
no choice.

1349
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,524
Your second shirt
needs a button, sir,

1350
01:12:38,591 --> 01:12:39,558
And a darning
of the cuff.

1351
01:12:39,626 --> 01:12:41,093
Why did you do it?

1352
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:42,528
I don't know, sir.

1353
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,765
Take him below.
Put him in irons.

1354
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,267
I don't wish
to look at him.

1355
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:54,340
Mr. Orrock
seems forgiving.

1356
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:55,341
He thinks that
doughty was

1357
01:12:55,408 --> 01:12:56,342
Simply trying to
defend himself.

1358
01:12:56,409 --> 01:12:57,643
Doughty was defending

1359
01:12:57,711 --> 01:13:00,779
My decision to feed
the guests.

1360
01:13:00,847 --> 01:13:01,780
But he'll hang
all the same,

1361
01:13:01,848 --> 01:13:03,048
No matter what i say.

1362
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:06,418
Our one aim is

1363
01:13:06,486 --> 01:13:08,320
To complete
our mission, mr. Bush,

1364
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:09,955
To discover exactly what

1365
01:13:10,023 --> 01:13:12,624
Boney's up to
along this coast.

1366
01:13:12,692 --> 01:13:14,793
Nothing must be allowed
to distract us from that.

1367
01:13:14,861 --> 01:13:15,994
Then we'd be
better off without

1368
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:16,962
Our guests on board,
sir.

1369
01:13:19,299 --> 01:13:22,201
Man: land ho!

1370
01:13:40,053 --> 01:13:41,120
Hop on leg.

1371
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:44,156
You alone.

1372
01:14:03,576 --> 01:14:04,576
Where are we?

1373
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:08,514
A little
south of brest.

1374
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:10,015
You are to be
returned to france.

1375
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:13,252
This is wonderful.
Why?

1376
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:14,453
My men will
row you ashore.

1377
01:14:14,521 --> 01:14:17,656
I'll help my wife.

1378
01:14:17,724 --> 01:14:19,158
Perhaps we can have
some assistance

1379
01:14:19,225 --> 01:14:21,560
With our possessions.
Thank you.

1380
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:23,429
You travel alone.

1381
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:26,398
I what?

1382
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:27,433
You depart the ship

1383
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,901
Alone, or not
at all.

1384
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:30,135
It's your choice.

1385
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:31,804
Rot in an english
prison or...

1386
01:14:38,378 --> 01:14:39,345
Or seize the chance

1387
01:14:39,412 --> 01:14:40,612
To change your
brother's mind.

1388
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,281
So you know.

1389
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:45,484
Why did you not
tell your wife that

1390
01:14:45,552 --> 01:14:46,485
Bonaparte does not

1391
01:14:46,553 --> 01:14:47,486
Accept this
marriage?

1392
01:14:47,554 --> 01:14:48,554
Because i love her,

1393
01:14:48,621 --> 01:14:50,823
And because he will
accept it.

1394
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,191
I will persuade him.

1395
01:14:52,258 --> 01:14:54,360
This is the only
chance you have.

1396
01:14:54,427 --> 01:14:57,262
No. I can't go
without her.

1397
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:58,297
It'll break her heart.

1398
01:14:58,365 --> 01:15:00,432
I don't doubt it.
Matthews.

1399
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,001
Get the boat ready.

1400
01:15:02,068 --> 01:15:03,869
Aye-Aye, sir.

1401
01:15:03,937 --> 01:15:05,738
I may be
a bonaparte, captain,

1402
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:08,273
But do not judge me
as my brother.

1403
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:09,441
I'm a man
in my own right,

1404
01:15:09,509 --> 01:15:10,576
Whatever my family name.

1405
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:13,078
It's not my place
to judge you,

1406
01:15:13,146 --> 01:15:14,346
Merely to follow
my orders.

1407
01:15:14,414 --> 01:15:16,482
What would
you do, captain?

1408
01:15:16,549 --> 01:15:17,983
Would you
abandon your wife,

1409
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:19,084
Leave her without
any notice?

1410
01:15:20,754 --> 01:15:21,954
Tell me.
I'd like to know.

1411
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:23,088
What would you do?

1412
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,560
My duty.

1413
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,266
My duty, then.

1414
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:27,786
Where is my husband?

1415
01:16:27,854 --> 01:16:30,155
Where is he?
My jerome?

1416
01:16:30,223 --> 01:16:31,724
And why are we
set free?

1417
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,727
He's not here.

1418
01:16:34,794 --> 01:16:35,728
He's gone home.

1419
01:16:35,795 --> 01:16:36,729
Home?

1420
01:16:36,796 --> 01:16:37,863
To france.

1421
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,899
He was permitted
to return,

1422
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,134
But only if alone.

1423
01:16:42,202 --> 01:16:44,603
He agreed with
those terms.

1424
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,438
You're lying.

1425
01:16:46,506 --> 01:16:47,906
What have you done?
If you've hurt him--

1426
01:16:47,974 --> 01:16:49,141
I've done nothing.

1427
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:52,111
Damn you.
Jerome! Jerome!

1428
01:16:52,178 --> 01:16:53,045
Calm yourself.

1429
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:55,414
He would not
leave me.

1430
01:16:55,482 --> 01:16:57,182
He would not.
He loves me.

1431
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,284
Are you so naive?

1432
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:02,354
Look, this is war.

1433
01:17:02,422 --> 01:17:04,723
Thousands and thousands
of men,

1434
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:05,858
Putting their lives
at risk.

1435
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:07,893
A tyrant
destroying europe.

1436
01:17:09,562 --> 01:17:10,763
Do you honestly think

1437
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,031
That what you feel
in your heart

1438
01:17:12,098 --> 01:17:12,965
Compares with that?

1439
01:17:15,168 --> 01:17:17,236
When we return
to england,

1440
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:19,104
In neutral waters,

1441
01:17:19,172 --> 01:17:21,540
You will be delivered
to the "liberty,"

1442
01:17:21,608 --> 01:17:24,843
Which will return you
to america.

1443
01:17:24,911 --> 01:17:26,879
I hope the french
kill you, sir.

1444
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:29,448
The odds are certainly
in their favor.

1445
01:17:30,684 --> 01:17:32,985
Perhaps tomorrow
they may succeed.

1446
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:48,667
No bonaparte on board?

1447
01:17:48,735 --> 01:17:50,803
My sore head has
all but mended,

1448
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:53,172
And there's a nice
pretty bit of snow.

1449
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:54,640
Things are looking up,
mr. Prowse.

1450
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,975
There's no pretty about
snow at sea, mr. Orrock.

1451
01:17:57,043 --> 01:17:58,544
We will take
advantage of

1452
01:17:58,611 --> 01:17:59,578
The mist,
mr. Prowse,

1453
01:17:59,646 --> 01:18:00,913
If not the snow.

1454
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,915
Mr. Bush and i are
to go ashore again,

1455
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:03,916
So again,
the ship is yours.

1456
01:18:03,983 --> 01:18:04,917
Aye-Aye, sir.

1457
01:18:04,984 --> 01:18:05,918
Best make haste, sir.

1458
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:07,453
No telling how long
this mist will hold.

1459
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,821
Rest assured,
mr. Prowse,

1460
01:18:08,888 --> 01:18:10,255
I have no intention
of leaving you

1461
01:18:10,323 --> 01:18:11,357
For any longer
than i need.

1462
01:18:17,163 --> 01:18:19,832
Come on! Come on, you lazy
little bastards!

1463
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:21,100
Allez! Allez!

1464
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:24,370
If that ship isn't ready
to sail by noon tomorrow,

1465
01:18:24,437 --> 01:18:25,838
I'll make you all swim!

1466
01:18:35,815 --> 01:18:37,483
No wonder you're
still in this war...

1467
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,484
Horatio:
so that's what

1468
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:40,219
Mr. Bracegirdle
must have seen.

1469
01:18:40,286 --> 01:18:42,287
Sir?

1470
01:18:42,355 --> 01:18:43,422
And that's
the reason for

1471
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,290
The cannons
in the farmhouse.

1472
01:18:45,358 --> 01:18:47,059
The frigates,
mr. Bush.

1473
01:18:47,127 --> 01:18:48,193
You see how high

1474
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:49,695
They ride
in the water

1475
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:51,563
They've had their
guns removed.

1476
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,473
How many men

1477
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:02,708
Will a 40-Gun
ship hold,

1478
01:19:02,776 --> 01:19:04,076
If it's stripped bare?

1479
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:07,813
1,000, maybe?
Packed tight.

1480
01:19:07,881 --> 01:19:10,516
3 ships, 3,000 troops.

1481
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,151
Well-Trained frenchmen
under orders of

1482
01:19:12,218 --> 01:19:14,486
The fervent
united irishmen.

1483
01:19:14,554 --> 01:19:17,122
Those frigates will not
be fighting, mr. Bush.

1484
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:19,024
They were
troop transports,

1485
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:20,025
And by the look
of things,

1486
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:21,827
Ready to set sail.

1487
01:19:21,895 --> 01:19:24,296
In brest,
200,000 frenchmen

1488
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:26,231
Wait to invade england,

1489
01:19:26,299 --> 01:19:28,267
And all our fleet
sit waiting.

1490
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:29,835
Leaving the back door
unguarded.

1491
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:33,906
The invasion of ireland,
mr. Bush.

1492
01:19:33,973 --> 01:19:35,908
And enough men to make
the troubles of '98

1493
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:37,042
Look like a tavern brawl.

1494
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:39,044
First they take ireland,
then they take england.

1495
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:40,346
We shall sail
the "hotspur,"

1496
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:42,381
In close enough
to smell them,

1497
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,782
Like a terrier
to a rat's hole.

1498
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:44,883
Bloody big rats, sir.

1499
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:47,086
Bloody fierce terrier.

1500
01:19:56,029 --> 01:19:57,229
You can hardly see
one end of the ship

1501
01:19:57,297 --> 01:19:58,397
From the other, sir.

1502
01:19:58,465 --> 01:19:59,565
Shall i take her
out to sea?

1503
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:01,467
No, mr. Prowse.
Quite the opposite.

1504
01:20:01,534 --> 01:20:02,534
We will enter the inlet.

1505
01:20:02,602 --> 01:20:04,870
Sir, there's rocks as
sharp as razors here,

1506
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:06,372
And it's as shallow
as a puddle.

1507
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:07,840
We'll be beached
like the grasshopper.

1508
01:20:07,907 --> 01:20:09,074
Not if we're careful.

1509
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:10,476
And lucky.

1510
01:20:10,543 --> 01:20:11,777
We'll need a good man
in the lead line.

1511
01:20:11,845 --> 01:20:13,078
Standing by, sir.

1512
01:20:14,981 --> 01:20:16,482
Horatio: very good,
mr. Orrock.

1513
01:20:16,549 --> 01:20:18,350
Matthews, cast loose
the guns

1514
01:20:18,418 --> 01:20:19,551
And keep
the men quiet,

1515
01:20:19,619 --> 01:20:20,753
Or they'll answer--

1516
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,021
Aye-Aye, sir.

1517
01:20:22,088 --> 01:20:23,022
Take us in under

1518
01:20:23,089 --> 01:20:24,056
Topsails alone,
mr. Prowse.

1519
01:20:24,124 --> 01:20:26,792
Aye-Aye, sir.
Pull up the mainsail!

1520
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:44,109
By the mark 5.

1521
01:20:44,177 --> 01:20:45,110
Quietly.

1522
01:20:45,178 --> 01:20:46,345
Sorry, sir.

1523
01:20:46,413 --> 01:20:47,379
By the mark 5, sir.

1524
01:20:47,447 --> 01:20:49,615
Steady as she goes,
mr. Prowse.

1525
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:50,816
Steady it is, sir.

1526
01:20:50,884 --> 01:20:52,151
Steady as she goes.

1527
01:20:58,725 --> 01:21:00,826
Prowse: there's the first one
attempting to leave.

1528
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:02,995
It'll be like shooting
fish in a barrel, sir.

1529
01:21:03,063 --> 01:21:04,563
We'll be the fish if
we don't find that

1530
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:05,597
Channel soon, sir.

1531
01:21:05,665 --> 01:21:07,900
Quite right,
mr. Prowse.

1532
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:09,601
Try her 2 points
to starboard.

1533
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:11,437
Aye-Aye, sir.
2 points to starboard.

1534
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:12,705
2 points to starboard.
Aye-Aye, sir.

1535
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:13,839
Mr. Matthews,
stand by with

1536
01:21:13,907 --> 01:21:14,807
Those larboard guns.

1537
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:15,741
Aye-Aye, sir.

1538
01:21:19,112 --> 01:21:22,147
And a quarter
less four.

1539
01:21:22,215 --> 01:21:23,682
A quarter less four.

1540
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:27,519
We're shoaling fast, sir.

1541
01:21:27,587 --> 01:21:28,954
Steady as she goes,
mr. Prowse.

1542
01:21:29,022 --> 01:21:30,122
Steady as she goes.

1543
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:31,056
Aye-Aye, sir.

1544
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:39,031
Deep 6.

1545
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,333
Deep 6.

1546
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:43,202
It's better, sir.

1547
01:21:46,072 --> 01:21:47,673
Horatio:
where would you say

1548
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:48,674
Their lights were?

1549
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:50,409
Lined up above the
mizzen tops, sir.

1550
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:53,946
Match them.
Hoist 3 the same,

1551
01:21:54,014 --> 01:21:55,080
But keep them
covered until

1552
01:21:55,148 --> 01:21:56,782
I give a signal.

1553
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,917
Horatio: i wish
to deceive them.

1554
01:21:58,985 --> 01:22:00,452
If we have
the same lights,

1555
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,154
They'll think we're
part of their fleet.

1556
01:22:02,222 --> 01:22:03,622
Very clever, sir.

1557
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:04,923
Thank you,
mr. Prowse.

1558
01:22:04,991 --> 01:22:05,924
A compliment
at last.

1559
01:22:05,992 --> 01:22:07,259
Listen.

1560
01:22:12,866 --> 01:22:14,633
Get those lights
ready, mr. Bush.

1561
01:22:28,882 --> 01:22:30,516
No bottom with this line.

1562
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:33,519
No bottom, mr. Bush.
Shhh.

1563
01:22:33,586 --> 01:22:35,020
It's not our only
concern, mr. Orrock.

1564
01:22:35,088 --> 01:22:36,021
I want you aloft.

1565
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:37,823
I want you
on those lights.

1566
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:46,498
No bottom, sir.

1567
01:22:46,566 --> 01:22:48,801
I heard. Full and by,
mr. Prowse.

1568
01:22:48,868 --> 01:22:50,235
Aye-Aye, sir.
Full and by.

1569
01:22:50,303 --> 01:22:51,603
Man: aye-Aye, sir.
Full and by it is.

1570
01:22:51,671 --> 01:22:52,705
How close shall i
take her, sir?

1571
01:22:52,772 --> 01:22:54,973
How close can you
get her, mr. Prowse?

1572
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:56,241
As close as you
like, sir.

1573
01:22:56,309 --> 01:22:57,276
Then make it so i can't

1574
01:22:57,344 --> 01:22:58,310
See the water
between us.

1575
01:22:58,378 --> 01:23:00,145
Aye-Aye, sir.

1576
01:23:10,623 --> 01:23:12,691
Stand by the guns.

1577
01:23:17,263 --> 01:23:18,297
Man: run out.

1578
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:24,903
Quietly!

1579
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:30,943
Lights on
the larboard bow.

1580
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,511
2 sets, sir.

1581
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,617
Mr. Bush.

1582
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:39,985
Let's confuse them.

1583
01:23:55,368 --> 01:23:56,301
Man: what the hell
is happening--

1584
01:23:56,369 --> 01:23:57,536
Fire!

1585
01:23:57,604 --> 01:23:58,771
God damn it--

1586
01:24:12,852 --> 01:24:14,820
Fire on that bloody ship,
or i'll fire on you!

1587
01:24:23,163 --> 01:24:26,231
Get a line on this.
Move yourself.

1588
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:30,235
They're still
coming, sir.

1589
01:24:31,371 --> 01:24:33,072
The grating's smashed
through, sir.

1590
01:24:33,139 --> 01:24:34,940
Get below, and
secure that cannon.

1591
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:36,775
Aye-Aye, sir.

1592
01:24:36,843 --> 01:24:38,143
Mr. Prowse.
Aye, sir.

1593
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:40,079
As close as we can
to the other ships.

1594
01:24:40,146 --> 01:24:41,680
Aye-Aye, sir.
Come to port.

1595
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:42,681
Man: aye-Aye, sir.

1596
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:47,853
Man: hold tight, man.
We'll have you out of there.

1597
01:24:55,962 --> 01:24:57,896
The other 2 frigates
are going about.

1598
01:24:57,964 --> 01:24:59,198
They've guessed
who we are.

1599
01:25:05,972 --> 01:25:06,839
Come on, man.

1600
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:12,277
We'll have to close
with them, sir.

1601
01:25:12,345 --> 01:25:13,412
If they reach
open sea,

1602
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,014
We'll have no hope.

1603
01:25:15,081 --> 01:25:16,849
No need, mr. Prowse.
Look.

1604
01:25:18,585 --> 01:25:20,586
Man: 2, 3...heave!

1605
01:25:20,653 --> 01:25:23,088
Come out, quick!
I can't!

1606
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:37,002
Prowse: listen.

1607
01:25:40,674 --> 01:25:41,607
They've hit bottom, sir.

1608
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:45,077
And each other.

1609
01:25:55,288 --> 01:25:56,155
Sir.

1610
01:25:59,459 --> 01:26:02,361
Ow! Uhh! Uhh...

1611
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:05,164
I've had my share of

1612
01:26:05,231 --> 01:26:06,165
Prisoners aboard
this ship,

1613
01:26:06,232 --> 01:26:08,634
So if you wish
to die a martyr...

1614
01:26:13,073 --> 01:26:14,173
I would.

1615
01:26:16,109 --> 01:26:17,509
And joyfully, hornblower,

1616
01:26:17,577 --> 01:26:20,679
But not by your
sorry hand.

1617
01:26:20,747 --> 01:26:22,481
That'd break my heart.

1618
01:26:22,549 --> 01:26:25,117
Your heart, wolfe?

1619
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:26,085
And where might
that be found?

1620
01:26:28,288 --> 01:26:32,358
I admire you, hornblower.
I really do.

1621
01:26:32,425 --> 01:26:35,394
But i loathe and despise

1622
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:37,963
Every bloody thing
that you represent.

1623
01:27:15,135 --> 01:27:16,001
Merry christmas, sir.

1624
01:27:18,638 --> 01:27:21,707
Yes, it is.
Thank you.

1625
01:27:21,775 --> 01:27:22,641
And the same to you,
mr. Bush.

1626
01:27:26,513 --> 01:27:29,114
Matthews asked me

1627
01:27:29,182 --> 01:27:30,516
Why he and styles

1628
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:32,418
Troubled to save doughty
from a 12-Pounder

1629
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:34,386
Dropping on his head,

1630
01:27:34,454 --> 01:27:35,721
When he'd have had
a cleaner, quicker death

1631
01:27:35,789 --> 01:27:37,890
Than hanging on
the end of the rope?

1632
01:27:37,957 --> 01:27:39,391
And what did you
tell him, william?

1633
01:27:39,459 --> 01:27:41,560
Honor, fellowship, duty.

1634
01:27:42,762 --> 01:27:43,896
And did he
understand?

1635
01:27:43,963 --> 01:27:44,830
Do you?

1636
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:50,969
Man: "liberty!" Ahoy there!

1637
01:27:58,611 --> 01:28:00,412
You marines, wait outside.

1638
01:28:07,887 --> 01:28:09,955
A good name
for a ship.

1639
01:28:10,023 --> 01:28:10,956
"Liberty."

1640
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:12,458
Sir?

1641
01:28:12,525 --> 01:28:15,694
Sailing for america.

1642
01:28:17,797 --> 01:28:19,932
She can't be more than
100 yards away.

1643
01:28:25,839 --> 01:28:27,673
I, uh, i can't remember

1644
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:29,341
Why i asked you
here, doughty.

1645
01:28:31,177 --> 01:28:32,578
It'll come to me,
i'm sure.

1646
01:28:34,781 --> 01:28:35,647
Enter.

1647
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:39,251
Her boat's ready
to take the lady, sir.

1648
01:28:40,587 --> 01:28:41,520
You asked
to be informed?

1649
01:28:41,588 --> 01:28:43,622
Oh, yes.
I'd forgotten.

1650
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:44,556
Thank you.

1651
01:28:54,734 --> 01:28:56,268
You're a good
steward, doughty.

1652
01:28:58,405 --> 01:28:59,338
You cook

1653
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:01,707
And you swim.

1654
01:29:07,247 --> 01:29:08,113
Good day to you.

1655
01:29:15,055 --> 01:29:16,555
Thank you, sir.

1656
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:26,965
You were damn heartless,
mr. Hornblower.

1657
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:28,300
When i met you,
i thought of you

1658
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:29,702
As a hero.

1659
01:29:29,769 --> 01:29:31,337
I was wrong to.

1660
01:29:31,404 --> 01:29:33,672
Madam, if your husband
loves you,

1661
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:34,740
He will follow you.

1662
01:29:34,808 --> 01:29:37,142
Eventually, he will.

1663
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:39,211
Don't talk to me of love.
You know nothing of it.

1664
01:29:41,081 --> 01:29:42,748
I pity your
poor wife, sir.

1665
01:29:42,816 --> 01:29:45,818
Come, come.

1666
01:29:45,885 --> 01:29:47,953
Man in water, sir.

1667
01:29:48,021 --> 01:29:48,954
Second man: put a bold
course for it.

1668
01:29:49,022 --> 01:29:49,888
I pity her, too.

1669
01:29:52,992 --> 01:29:54,727
But i am
the man she married.

1670
01:30:01,801 --> 01:30:02,668
It's doughty.

1671
01:30:06,272 --> 01:30:07,439
Damn it, he must have
gone through the window.

1672
01:30:07,507 --> 01:30:08,874
Hold your fire, man.
Hold your fire.

1673
01:30:08,942 --> 01:30:10,142
That's a neutral ship.

1674
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:15,180
I am a fool, mr. Bush.

1675
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,387
He's a fine man,
doughty,

1676
01:30:21,454 --> 01:30:23,522
And a good cook.

1677
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:26,025
Please accept him as
my apology for...

1678
01:30:28,828 --> 01:30:30,696
For being
so damned heartless.

1679
01:30:34,067 --> 01:30:36,035
I will, mr. Hornblower.

1680
01:30:50,717 --> 01:30:53,185
Etheridge: the husband will not
see the wife again.

1681
01:30:53,253 --> 01:30:56,555
Bonaparte's envoy is
heading to the vatican,

1682
01:30:56,623 --> 01:30:57,723
Demanding that
their marriage

1683
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:58,724
Be annulled.

1684
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:01,827
Those brutal french.

1685
01:31:01,895 --> 01:31:03,862
The girl's well rid
of him, hmm?

1686
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:04,897
Just as we are
well rid of

1687
01:31:04,964 --> 01:31:05,931
That criminal,
doughty.

1688
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:09,068
Pellew: seems to have
concluded for the best.

1689
01:31:09,135 --> 01:31:10,536
Etheridge: the diplomatic
service is thankful,

1690
01:31:10,603 --> 01:31:11,537
Captain hornblower.

1691
01:31:11,604 --> 01:31:13,439
Your work for us
has been exemplary.

1692
01:31:14,941 --> 01:31:18,377
Now, i'm sure you gentlemen
have much to discuss.

1693
01:31:20,347 --> 01:31:21,980
It's been a pleasure.

1694
01:31:22,048 --> 01:31:24,750
And both of you, sir edward,
captain hornblower,

1695
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:25,684
Good day to you.

1696
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:36,595
Hornblower?

1697
01:31:36,663 --> 01:31:38,330
Sir.

1698
01:31:38,398 --> 01:31:39,598
Mr. Etheridge
seems to think

1699
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,000
We have something
to discuss, sir.

1700
01:31:43,303 --> 01:31:44,937
I'm leaving.

1701
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:46,705
I'm hauling down
my flag.

1702
01:31:46,773 --> 01:31:47,706
Retiring, sir?

1703
01:31:47,774 --> 01:31:49,708
No, no,
not retirement.

1704
01:31:49,776 --> 01:31:52,878
Promotion. Yes.

1705
01:31:52,946 --> 01:31:54,013
But it means
leaving behind

1706
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,014
The ...
and all the men

1707
01:31:55,081 --> 01:31:56,015
Who've served me
so well.

1708
01:31:56,082 --> 01:31:58,650
Now, that is good
news, sir,

1709
01:31:58,718 --> 01:32:00,552
But i regret it
all the same.

1710
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:02,921
I'm beginning to
regret it myself.

1711
01:32:04,357 --> 01:32:07,493
Anyway, come on.
Let's be cheerful.

1712
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,094
Does this not mean
anything to you?

1713
01:32:09,162 --> 01:32:12,731
No, sir.
Only what i've said,

1714
01:32:12,799 --> 01:32:14,266
And that it has
been an honor

1715
01:32:14,334 --> 01:32:15,267
To serve under you.

1716
01:32:15,335 --> 01:32:16,669
Nothing else?

1717
01:32:16,736 --> 01:32:18,270
No, sir.

1718
01:32:18,338 --> 01:32:20,873
Do you not remember
the last privilege

1719
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:23,976
Granted a promoted
commander-In-Chief?

1720
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:26,979
No, sir.

1721
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:27,980
Oh, yes,

1722
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:30,683
It's beginning to
dawn on you. Good.

1723
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:31,917
I'm allowed
3 promotions.

1724
01:32:31,985 --> 01:32:33,185
Midshipman to
lieutenant,

1725
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:34,620
Lieutenant to
commander,

1726
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,422
Commander to
post captain.

1727
01:32:36,489 --> 01:32:39,525
My men have served me
most notably, sir.

1728
01:32:39,592 --> 01:32:42,361
Might i suggest--
No, no, hornblower.

1729
01:32:42,429 --> 01:32:44,596
No, no.
I mean you, damn it.

1730
01:32:44,664 --> 01:32:46,799
Yes,
i'm promoting you,

1731
01:32:46,866 --> 01:32:48,067
To post captain.

1732
01:32:48,134 --> 01:32:50,336
Well, i have
the good of

1733
01:32:50,403 --> 01:32:51,870
The service in mind.

1734
01:32:51,938 --> 01:32:54,673
You were the best choice
i could make.

1735
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:57,209
I know it's the damnedest
time to be a captain

1736
01:32:57,277 --> 01:32:58,477
In this sorry war,

1737
01:32:58,545 --> 01:33:01,547
But you see things, sir,
that other men do not.

1738
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:04,850
But one thing
you do not question

1739
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:06,952
Is your duty
to your king.

1740
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,956
I only hope that
one day, hornblower,

1741
01:33:11,024 --> 01:33:12,257
You'll fight for
more than england.

1742
01:33:14,527 --> 01:33:16,061
What is there
more than england?

1743
01:33:21,434 --> 01:33:25,237
To a happy and most
prosperous new year.

1744
01:33:29,676 --> 01:33:31,777
You must toast, horrie.

1745
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:35,781
Yes, of course.
Sorry.

1746
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:44,156
To, ah...
to our family.

1747
01:33:47,694 --> 01:33:51,230
I am aware that
i haven't been...

1748
01:33:53,466 --> 01:33:58,170
Well...this year,
i shall

1749
01:33:58,238 --> 01:33:59,938
Try to be
a better husband...

1750
01:34:01,608 --> 01:34:02,675
And a better son.

1751
01:34:02,742 --> 01:34:03,609
Hmm.

1752
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:08,614
You have been a hero.

1753
01:34:09,949 --> 01:34:11,216
And rewarded for it.

1754
01:34:11,284 --> 01:34:13,318
And it is i
who should apologize,

1755
01:34:13,386 --> 01:34:18,023
For always asking you
about your life at sea.

1756
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:20,225
I know why you
do not tell me.

1757
01:34:20,293 --> 01:34:21,794
You know it would
upset me.

1758
01:34:23,029 --> 01:34:27,032
At any rate, i keep
things from you, too.

1759
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:31,337
You do?

1760
01:34:32,672 --> 01:34:35,240
When i fear
for your life,

1761
01:34:35,308 --> 01:34:38,544
I'm not being
wholly selfish.

1762
01:34:38,611 --> 01:34:41,146
I'm not the only one
you would leave behind.

1763
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:46,819
Well, she doesn't mean me.
What would i care?

1764
01:35:02,769 --> 01:35:04,970
Oh, horrie.

1765
01:35:05,038 --> 01:35:07,406
You're going to be
a father.

1766
