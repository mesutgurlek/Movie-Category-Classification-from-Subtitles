1
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,004
Go away, we don't want beggars here.

2
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,714
I'm not a beggar, I'll pay...

3
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,634
for food and lodging for the night.

4
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,305
If you want to pay,
give me seeds or new tools...

5
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,349
give me a horse,
raise my sons from the dead...

6
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,101
or stop this stinking war.

7
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,936
Go away or we'll drive you away.

8
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,230
I'll work or write letters...

9
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,317
or tell you about
the places I've seen, anything.

10
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,777
I need only a little food.

11
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,864
Can't you see we are starving? Go away.

12
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,201
Live, die. What difference does it make?

13
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,912
Jesus has forsaken us. Go away.

14
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,230
Plague.

15
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,303
Where are the others?

16
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,848
I don't know, I came here alone.

17
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,284
Not a soul, Captain, except this bastard.

18
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,496
Where are your friends?

19
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,290
And where are your cattle?

20
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,212
Wake him up.

21
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,217
I don't know.

22
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,513
I came here alone this morning after food.

23
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,224
I've never seen this valley before.

24
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:31,144
That won't do. Speak fast.
I lost patience 12 years ago.

25
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,565
Two ears are better than 40, Captain.

26
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,191
You can't bargain with me.

27
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,320
I can crush you and your village
like a bedbug.

28
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,907
That's what I want to talk to you about.

29
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,288
Break open every house.

30
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,707
Gather all we can use in that barn...

31
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,876
nothing in your own saddlebags.

32
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,045
We'll round up the peasants...

33
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,381
and fire the village at leisure.

34
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,095
Korski, over there. You, come with me.

35
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,222
I don't like secrets.

36
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,394
You can come, too, Korski.

37
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,535
Well?

38
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,246
There's famine all over Germany...

39
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,916
plague, pestilence, even now...

40
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,502
and winter's coming.

41
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,089
In 10, 20 years,
have you seen a richer valley?

42
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,300
I don't answer uestions.

43
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,803
Take their grain and cattle,
and they starve this winter.

44
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,598
I'm tiring of you. Come to your point.

45
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,309
I'm there now, Captain.

46
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:57,814
Take all this food back to your army,
and down it goes into a thousand stomachs.

47
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,108
Why such waste?

48
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,238
Winter here, occupy the valley.

49
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,697
What?

50
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,282
Winter here.

51
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,910
Live while your army dies.

52
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,913
You'll never get another chance like this.

53
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,415
Is this scum asking us to desert?

54
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,044
Is that it?

55
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,672
A soldier has no future and no past...

56
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,591
and a full belly covers the present.

57
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,719
You talk too much, and not like a peasant.

58
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,722
What are you? A stinking priest?

59
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,726
I don't know which side you're on, Captain.

60
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,355
But I'll wager half your men don't care.

61
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,652
What of those who do care?

62
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,160
Get rid of them.

63
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,050
Good ideas are rare these days.

64
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,553
Very rare.

65
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,473
You are a priest on the run?

66
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,184
No, I was a teacher.

67
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,562
- What's your name?
- Vogel. Yours?

68
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,607
Captain. Where are you from?

69
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,902
From nowhere, everywhere, Captain.

70
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,364
Yes, I have almost forgotten...

71
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,909
where I was born, also.

72
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,165
You have fever?

73
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,960
No, it's nothing.

74
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,713
Didn't you say, "Get rid of them"?

75
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,008
Yes, but it was so sudden.

76
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,551
And clean.

77
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,471
One moment alive, one moment dead.

78
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,393
You philosophers are such hypocrites.

79
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,232
I only do what is necessary.

80
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,192
No more.

81
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:10,239
If to kill is necessary,
I do it without conscience.

82
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:15,619
Now, make peace
with whatever God you worship.

83
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,958
Peasants hate soldiers, Captain.
Soldiers hate peasants.

84
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,419
I'm not a soldier or a peasant.

85
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,257
I could speak to them
just as I can speak to you.

86
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,342
I can help.

87
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,304
You'll need help. I'll be very useful.

88
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,607
I'll give you two days to prove it.

89
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,407
No more looting, Captain?

90
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,159
No.

91
00:17:56,535 --> 00:18:00,080
We eat the place at leisure
and drink it dry by spring.

92
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,164
Spring?

93
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,792
We'll eat while the army starves.

94
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,920
By the Madonna,
I'd give my life for a winter of peace...

95
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,799
with good food, decent women,
and maybe no killing.

96
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,431
Where's Korski?

97
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,852
Where else would Korski be, but on watch?

98
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:26,231
We found the valley, other patrols could.
Ours, or enemy.

99
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,442
That's right, Captain.

100
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,068
What about our women?

101
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,779
Yes, I have a wife and family back there.

102
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,324
What about the army and the baggage train?

103
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,992
Listen to Hansen...

104
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,163
plenty of women
where there's plenty of food?

105
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,332
Has it ever been different?

106
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,126
And isn't one as good as another?

107
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,506
But we've been winning all year.

108
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,092
How much pay we got?
Not a god-rotting pfennig.

109
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,638
I say we stay. It's a good valley. A miracle.

110
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,973
I say it stinks of Satan.

111
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,767
You stink of Satan.

112
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,235
How else could it be like this?

113
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,574
Perhaps we've been led
into the Promised Land, Eskesen.

114
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,879
Then it's agreed?

115
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,381
- Yes.
- No.

116
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,591
I've got a woman back there.

117
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,808
First, I want to hear what Korski says.

118
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,855
Korski will know what's right.

119
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,490
Graf, take him to join Korski.

120
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,910
Yes, Captain. Come on.

121
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,204
Move.

122
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:27,311
Remember, be careful
as you circle and hide.

123
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:32,274
This ambush must be perfect,
and no killing.

124
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,277
But what about that, Captain?

125
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,487
It stays. Untouched.

126
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,200
But we burn all churches on raids.
That's your rule.

127
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,536
Yes, but this time, we must bend the rule.

128
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,040
Catholic or Protestant,
it would make no difference.

129
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:51,251
This time, we need the peasants to work.

130
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,713
That church must be an exception.
The exception.

131
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,840
But it stinks of Satan.

132
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,468
It's the breeding place of evil.

133
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,262
So it will burn.

134
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,891
Stop him.

135
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:14,358
Get away, or you'll join Shutz and Korski.

136
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,659
Lord Jesus, help me to strike down
Thine enemies.

137
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,329
Papist scum!

138
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,456
The church stays.

139
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,124
Anti-Christ.

140
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,335
Devil worshipper.

141
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,880
Ours is the true faith, by God,
you Protestant heretic.

142
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,423
Blasphemer!

143
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,843
Death to the anti-Christ!

144
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,940
Make your peace with your God.

145
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,025
Mercy, Captain.

146
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,112
Our first rule...

147
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,906
is no religious uarrels among ourselves.

148
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,618
He who breaks it is a dead man.

149
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,832
Let him also be an exception.
The exception.

150
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:16,712
Let the church stay, but let him
and the Protestants build another church.

151
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,591
Yes, give him uarter.

152
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,689
Let one man escape that rule...

153
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,233
and we'll all be dead by sundown.

154
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:42,446
You all swore holy oaths to fight as a unit...

155
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:46,241
and sell your skill to the winner,
whatever their religion.

156
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,330
Protestants may build if they wish
without hindrance.

157
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:55,584
Vornez, Geddes, Tub...

158
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,962
burn him along with the others.
We want no plague here.

159
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,556
- Go on. Run along.
- Yes, Inge.

160
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:06,154
Go to your homes. Go.

161
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:35,017
Vornez!

162
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,854
I said no killing.

163
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,950
Who will speak for all of you?

164
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,417
- Here, you.
- Fetch Gruber.

165
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,670
It should be Gruber.

166
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,553
Where is he?

167
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,096
Captain...

168
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,183
let him take me to Gruber.

169
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,603
I'll speak to him for you, if you wish.

170
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,982
And then you'll come back? Like a lamb.

171
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,819
Within the hour,
or you'll go after him, Hansen.

172
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,738
You and Pirelli.

173
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,741
You take him to Gruber.

174
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,622
You can all...

175
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,839
You can all go to your homes.

176
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,301
You are safe for the moment.

177
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,929
Why not kill us all now and be done with it?

178
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:57,266
- Butchers!
- You're young, so you're impatient.

179
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,810
Be patient, puppy. Wait your turn to die.

180
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,070
What is your name?

181
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,699
Erica Torfield.

182
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,452
Which is your husband?

183
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:29,923
Why trust him?

184
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,886
I trust no one.

185
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,442
My name is Vogel.

186
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,320
I bring a message from the Captain.

187
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,822
I persuaded them
to let me come alone with him.

188
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:56,533
- There's about 20 of them.
- That can wait.

189
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,538
Do you have pains in your throat,
in your chest?

190
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,832
Is it hard to swallow?

191
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,126
He has plague?

192
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:15,427
The Captain undertakes to protect
your village from all other soldiers...

193
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:19,515
on condition that he and his men
be well-billeted for the winter.

194
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:24,937
The power of Jesus Christ
and Our Lady of the Shrine protects us.

195
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,523
We don't need any soldiers here.

196
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,359
The Captain is a reasonable man.

197
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,571
If you accept, nothing will be looted.

198
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,449
Your women won't be tampered with.

199
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,494
No one will be hurt.

200
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,830
If not, your valley will die.

201
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,290
Enough talk.

202
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:48,919
If the Captain will keep discipline, I agree.

203
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,720
What has changed that we need soldiers?

204
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:02,140
The soldiers are here, Father.
That's what has changed.

205
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,894
Our Lady of the Shrine will rid us of them.

206
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,898
In good time, Father, in good time.

207
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,570
Is he unclean?

208
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,173
I have plague?

209
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,217
Do you think you'd be here,
or us watching if you had?

210
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,427
You're sure?

211
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,096
You have had a palsy. You're safe now.

212
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,683
Drink some more, it will help you get better.

213
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,521
I had terrible dreams.

214
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,857
You talked in your sleep.

215
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:56,111
You seemed to be talking
to Holy Father, to God.

216
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,241
I can't remember. I dreamed that I was dead.

217
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,328
You would have been
if it wasn't for my mother and Erica.

218
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:08,123
They brought you here.
We've looked after you for two days.

219
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,585
I feel born again. Thank you.

220
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,463
Your clothes are filthy.
We're going to wash them.

221
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,048
Why are you so kind to me?

222
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,967
Because we think you're worth caring about.

223
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,302
Thank you.

224
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,347
And the village?

225
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,682
All is peaceful?

226
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,767
No!

227
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,772
We're soldiers, by God. We take what
we want, and to hell with the rest.

228
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,066
That's what we've always done.

229
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,237
The next time you oppose me, Hansen...

230
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,115
I will slit your tongue.

231
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,503
The penalty for rape...

232
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:58,048
will be public castration.

233
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,009
And for looting?

234
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,013
What is your pleasure, Father?

235
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,849
Blinding.

236
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,186
How else do we protect our homes,
if not by fear?

237
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,314
Very well.

238
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,692
For Catholics, blinding.

239
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:18,986
For the rest, 100 lashes...

240
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,698
all provided my men
have women of their own.

241
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,369
There are two or three widows
who might be prepared to be visited...

242
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,495
Eight.

243
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:34,293
Or perhaps two dozen
will become widows by sundown.

244
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:36,670
Four, then.

245
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,131
Six, and they had better be worthy...

246
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,175
and the place worthy.

247
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,719
And you, Father...

248
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:48,515
you will give them
public blessing for their penance.

249
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,977
I obey God's orders, not your orders.

250
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,397
Of course, but why not sell them...

251
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,399
your holy indulgence...

252
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,694
a total remission for past and future sins...

253
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,488
which you could pay for?

254
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,870
Six. Widowed, married, or unmarried.

255
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,206
You have two days.

256
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,468
What are you doing here?

257
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,429
I was treating someone
who was sick, Father.

258
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,307
You said to treat all without favor.

259
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:35,479
I asked her to see him, Father.
It was just Christian charity.

260
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,024
Good night, Erica. Thank you.

261
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:56,250
So the philosopher is risen from the dead.

262
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,211
He was ready to die, he should have died.

263
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,255
Why wasn't I told that he was here?

264
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:04,132
Perhaps they didn't want my soup poisoned.

265
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:08,303
What are you, Lutheran Protestant,
Calvin Protestant...

266
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,432
blasphemous Anabaptist,
heathen Satan worshipper?

267
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,812
That's unimportant.
I have all those among my men and worse.

268
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:19,231
I even have Catholics, Father...

269
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:24,111
which brings me to the shrine near the pass.

270
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:28,282
Our Lady of the Shrine has guarded
the valley for centuries.

271
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:32,369
Many of my men think
that shrines are blasphemous idols...

272
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,080
that should be torn apart
and stamped into oblivion.

273
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,874
Touch the shrine...

274
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:40,669
and you will burn in hellfire for all eternity...

275
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,548
- and your entrails will be eaten with worms.
- The pox on hellfire!

276
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,134
That shrine is pointing at the village
like a finger.

277
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,344
Touch one stone...

278
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,847
and God will smite you.

279
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,975
But before that, we will rise up.

280
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,019
We will rise up...

281
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:00,522
and stamp you to oblivion.

282
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,031
How have you survived so long?

283
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:12,451
For almost six months of the year,
from the first snows...

284
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,745
the road is blocked, we are safe.

285
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:19,541
These mountains are cruel,
the country stripped bare.

286
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,294
Few come this way.

287
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,005
How he got in, only God knows.

288
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:29,551
So, where could the shrine be moved to?

289
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:35,390
Stay here. Vogel.

290
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,912
Here, beside the rock.

291
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,207
Good. Very good.

292
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,337
We keep our lookout up there.

293
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,340
A lookout is enough if your plan is to hide.

294
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:11,134
We fight for our valley.

295
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:21,728
Captain...

296
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,775
don't move the shrine. It saved the valley.

297
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,736
A shrine is still a shrine 30 paces off.

298
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,948
Other villages had mountains
and false trails and clever leaders...

299
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,408
but that didn't save them.

300
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,577
Other villages had shrines.

301
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,561
Hurry.

302
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,720
In your name...

303
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:41,058
Holy Mother, in your name.

304
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,902
I'm sick of this pig-swill.

305
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:55,906
By the blood of Christ, Korski'd never let
these stink-pest scum run over him.

306
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,199
Korski'd be king.

307
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,243
Not a weak-gutted lackey.

308
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:00,827
Korski's dead.

309
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,539
Yes, I'm sorry I let him die.

310
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,583
Sorry I sided with the Captain.

311
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,253
- I'm as good a soldier as him.
- You're wrong.

312
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,046
Korski was a turd.

313
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,965
Be patient.

314
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:16,093
This Captain's clever and strong.

315
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,470
The best I ever served with...

316
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,180
and we get the women tomorrow.

317
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:23,559
We'll get bags. The pox on this place.

318
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:28,730
There's good women in the camp, wine,
dice and good times, and loot to be had.

319
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:31,191
I've a kid back there. Who'll look after him?

320
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:32,734
He'll be there next spring.

321
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,862
If not, you can make another.

322
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:42,411
You know, they say that
the plague's taken 10,000 men already.

323
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,998
We're blessed with luck to be here.

324
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,918
I'm for staying a week.
Take what we want and the hell with it.

325
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,304
- Sorry, Father, I'm late.
- Next time you're late, no food.

326
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,763
Yes, Father.

327
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,016
Good.

328
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,689
They say you can read and write.

329
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,109
I studied at the university in Heidelberg.

330
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:17,362
Then I taught there. The town was sacked.

331
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:21,200
Your family were
burghers there? Shopkeepers?

332
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,952
No, at Magdeburg.

333
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:27,998
I envy you, seeing so many places
and knowing so much.

334
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,499
You needn't.

335
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:33,712
Before I was your age, I had seen two
brothers murdered, and one dead of plague.

336
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,465
Sit down.

337
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,931
It's years since I've seen bread so rich.

338
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:45,933
The harvest was good.

339
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,685
Our Lady is pleased for us to share it.

340
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:52,981
How do you earn your daily bread?

341
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:56,151
Work. Any form of work except soldiering.

342
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,403
I can paint a little...

343
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:02,157
I can teach writing, history, mathematics.

344
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,535
I can speak Spanish, Italian, French.

345
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:07,663
Father Sebastian teaches here.
The Holy Word.

346
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:10,374
We've no need for writing
or the other nonsense.

347
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,501
Works of the devil.

348
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,379
Why did you lead the soldiers here?

349
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,005
I didn't.

350
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,216
I was trying to get away...

351
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,844
from all soldiers.

352
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,264
Some men are good luck, some bad.

353
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,140
You are bad luck.

354
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:32,062
- Your soldiers will kill our valley.
- No. Not if everyone works.

355
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:34,565
Peasants, landowners, and soldiers.

356
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:37,150
You are a fool as well as bad luck.

357
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,783
Tonight, you are alive
enjoying the fat of the land.

358
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:46,785
Bless your luck.

359
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,371
Our Lady protects us, not luck.

360
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,879
Here, Vogel, eat.
Then tell us about the Holy City.

361
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,673
Father, Vogel was there when he was young.

362
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:03,677
Once, he saw a real pope
and the whole city's gold and the cathedral.

363
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,930
Your pardon, "Meister" Hoffman.

364
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:11,268
But, is it true about Inge?

365
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,395
Yes. Come, sit down.

366
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,939
Eat with us, share our joy.

367
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,902
Vogel is going to tell us about the Holy City.

368
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,030
But, it was always planned
that we would be married some day.

369
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:26,074
Eternal salvation is better
than earthly happiness, boy.

370
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:27,659
Sit down.

371
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,079
Salvation?

372
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,291
I'm to be one of the women for the soldiers.

373
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:39,087
If you were going to be a nun, to serve God,
then I could understand.

374
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,424
But this, it's not right.

375
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,927
It's whoring.

376
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,720
Has Satan put a spell on you?

377
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:49,389
You heard what Father Sebastian said:

378
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:53,435
"Their suffering would save the village
just as Christ's suffering saved the world."

379
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:55,270
Yes, I heard him.

380
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:58,565
But that doesn't make him right.
He's not right!

381
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,401
Get out of my house!

382
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,907
You offered her?

383
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,494
They are to get a holy indulgence.

384
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,788
Gruber is paying for it.

385
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,500
If he pays the church in land,
of course it is right.

386
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:21,964
What father would not want
eternal salvation for his daughter?

387
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,524
Captain, can I speak to you?

388
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,781
It's about Inge, Hoffman's daughter.

389
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,161
Refuse her, accept another in her place.

390
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:57,291
- You want to take away her salvation?
- No.

391
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:02,171
Gruber has agreed
that the shrine should be moved.

392
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,340
- What is your counsel?
- Don't touch it.

393
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:08,260
The priest doesn't agree.

394
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:12,890
Gruber is our only guarantee
of peace with the peasants.

395
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:17,060
They are all frightened of him,
all in debt to him.

396
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,064
What Gruber says must be done, is done.

397
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,737
No one can control this valley as he can.

398
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:30,866
No one is rich enough or shrewd enough...

399
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,660
or has his courage.

400
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:38,248
It is not wise to make an enemy of Gruber.

401
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,292
Or you.

402
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,046
Or Graf, Hansen, Hoffman,
the list is endless.

403
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:47,591
Gruber was right.
We need the counsel of clever men.

404
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:50,427
From tomorrow, you are appointed judge...

405
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,347
between soldier and peasant for all cases.

406
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,767
I'm the last person to do that.
I've no authority over anyone.

407
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,728
Gruber agrees
that you are the perfect political choice.

408
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,146
We will both back you.

409
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:04,399
I'll be hated by everybody
and blamed by both sides.

410
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:07,402
A few days ago, life was impossible.

411
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,155
Now you want it to be easy.

412
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:13,408
I want a rest. Time.

413
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,120
You're on borrowed time now, Judge.

414
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:22,876
So is the village, the whole valley.

415
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,963
It's all doomed.

416
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,009
And the girl?

417
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:32,761
She is trouble.

418
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:35,806
So are you.

419
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,815
The Captain wants you.

420
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:47,192
You'll protect me?

421
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:48,944
I could kill him easily.

422
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,572
But that would destroy our world.

423
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:54,575
Only he keeps them
from falling on us like wolves.

424
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:59,121
Then kill them all while they sleep.

425
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,623
We haven't the weapons.

426
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,543
There's too many, they're too clever.

427
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,795
Some patrol while others sleep.

428
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,174
Then put hemlock in their food.

429
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:12,676
Perhaps.

430
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,429
But not yet, not until the snows.

431
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:17,139
Why?

432
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,641
They found us, so others can.

433
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,810
We need them to protect us.

434
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,110
Open the door.

435
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:35,407
Open it.

436
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:58,430
She will not be one of the women
for the soldiers.

437
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,643
Of course. The others are for my men.

438
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:08,315
It is a pity that you are involved with her.

439
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:12,778
However, you are involved.

440
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,617
How do we decide this?

441
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:29,002
Dice. Fetch them, Erica.

442
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,927
If I win, you'll leave her alone
and protect her from your men.

443
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,887
- Agreed.
- Three throws.

444
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,265
Highest score.

445
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,852
If eual,
one more throw until there is a loser.

446
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:47,271
If you lose...

447
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,024
you accept that she is mine?

448
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:03,245
Agreed.

449
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,456
Seven.

450
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,143
Seven and nine are sixteen.

451
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:36,069
Ten and three are thirteen.

452
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,788
Sixteen and six make twenty-two.

453
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,017
What do the dice read, Erica?

454
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,196
Six and five.

455
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:51,687
Bar the door.

456
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:35,564
Father! Quickly!

457
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:40,611
What happened to your face?

458
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:44,072
There were some feathers flying last night,
little bird.

459
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:46,241
We get the women at sunset.

460
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:48,744
That'll put an end to the violence.

461
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,704
- Who's that?
- Pirelli.

462
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:54,208
He truly thinks
he's got the voice of an angel.

463
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:58,545
Father, the Captain's
moving the shrine! Quickly.

464
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,509
The Captain's moving the shrine.

465
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:07,638
That priest.

466
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,946
This way leads out of the valley.
No one is to leave.

467
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:07,698
I'm going to the shrine.

468
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:10,659
You're going back to the village,
black beetle.

469
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:14,788
Leave it.

470
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:19,001
Stop, in God's name.

471
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:30,179
Run.

472
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:32,598
Stop him.

473
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,687
The next time,
your head leaves your shoulders.

474
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:41,648
- I'll get them.
- Leave them. They're only fools.

475
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,026
Take this man to the Captain.

476
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:47,029
Martyrdom is not as useful
as you think, Father.

477
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:49,281
Christ saved the world by suffering.

478
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:51,033
And was it necessary?

479
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:52,451
You blaspheme.

480
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:55,704
No. The politicians put him to death.

481
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:59,041
How many men do you think
should die for the shrine?

482
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:01,585
We're not concerned for the shrine,
for its own sake...

483
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:04,922
but because it's a symbol of faith.

484
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:07,382
Beg God's forgiveness.

485
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:10,260
Does 30 paces make such a difference
to a whole faith?

486
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,054
Yes. And you were warned.

487
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:14,223
We have not harmed the shrine.

488
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,226
It is exact, stone by stone.

489
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,228
You were warned. Confess your sins.

490
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:22,105
Prepare for hellfire and God's wrath.

491
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:24,107
And the devil's.

492
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,736
Any shrine in this world
is a shrine to the devil.

493
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:33,700
Priests are better on their knees,
in the god-poxed holy dirt.

494
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,286
Idol worshipper.

495
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,623
He's a priest. So he worships nothing.

496
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,459
Can I slit his throat now?

497
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:46,547
Captain, uick.

498
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,590
They're moving the shrine.

499
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,409
Better cut around them. Too many to stop.

500
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,748
We'll talk. We did what was necessary,
and peasants understand necessity.

501
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:26,587
Get ready.
Kill Pirelli, Hansen, and Vornez first...

502
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,881
and watch out for that devil's whelp, Julio.

503
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:31,633
We can cut around and get the horses.

504
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,261
No time. We have the advantage.

505
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:36,930
You talk. I'll see that he doesn't.

506
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:38,307
No.

507
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:40,726
Father...

508
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:45,772
you will talk on my behalf...

509
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:50,485
or make your peace with your God
for you and them.

510
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:56,491
There will be no uarter,
not for man, woman, nor child.

511
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:02,039
And you will be castrated
before I hack off your feet.

512
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:48,544
Did they touch the shrine, Father?

513
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:52,714
Don't be afraid, Father. We are soldiers
of Christ. We will protect you.

514
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,469
Did they touch the shrine?

515
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:01,807
Yes!

516
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:05,227
Our Lady has been taken to another place.

517
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:08,188
You're all going to die...

518
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,525
and Satan walks the earth.

519
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,035
The shrine has not been harmed.

520
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:29,084
Listen, give thanks to Our Lady.

521
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,004
She protected us again.

522
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,887
Our Lady has protected
our valley for centuries.

523
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,722
We all know that.

524
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:45,267
But that didn't prevent you
from digging up the track...

525
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:49,438
nor planting forests,
nor visiting her shrine by a hundred paths...

526
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,065
nor hiding when soldiers came...

527
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:54,651
nor concealing your fowl,
and cattle, and horses...

528
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:57,112
nor keeping lookouts at the pass.

529
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,531
I am a Catholic, too.

530
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,951
I had a dream last night.

531
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:07,831
I dreamed...

532
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:12,085
that I was near the shrine...

533
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,216
and a regiment of soldiers
came riding up under a full moon.

534
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:21,595
There was a sprinkling of snow
on the ground.

535
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:25,015
They were huge and evil...

536
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:28,477
and they looked towards the shrine.

537
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:31,104
But as they looked...

538
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:34,441
the shrine vanished.

539
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:38,487
So the soldiers went their way
back to Rheinfelden...

540
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:40,322
and never came back.

541
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:44,952
By hiding herself,
Our Lady had hidden the village.

542
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,918
I am glad the Captain has moved
Our Lady of the Shrine.

543
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:55,587
Isn't that what the dream said to do?

544
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:59,132
You wouldn't defy a dream, would you?

545
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:06,473
You're lying.

546
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:09,935
He never had a dream.

547
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,188
Go to the shrine. See for yourselves.

548
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,862
Is he telling the truth, Father,
about the dream?

549
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,122
I don't know.

550
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,291
Do we go to the shrine?

551
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:39,173
Do we go to the shrine, Father?

552
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,802
Where is there to go?

553
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:01,403
Pirelli, lead the way.

554
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:15,626
You are not to be one of the women
for my men.

555
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:19,505
- She's the one I want.
- You can't have her.

556
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,461
You wanted to see me?

557
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,464
Did you really dream that dream?

558
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:08,053
What's real, and what isn't?

559
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:12,641
Once, I thought I knew.

560
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:16,395
Now I know I don't.

561
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:20,232
The true church is real.
God is real, and Satan is real.

562
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:25,696
That we're all going to die soon
and face judgment is real.

563
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:30,492
Before God, did you tell the truth?

564
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:32,953
Before God, what is the truth?

565
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,706
That millions are dead and more will die...

566
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:38,709
because the Pope wars
on the Catholic Emperor...

567
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:43,338
who wars on the Catholic King of France,
who wars on the Catholic King of Spain...

568
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:45,507
who wars on Catholic Germany...

569
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:48,051
all helped by Protestants.

570
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:52,055
Helped by a hundred other princes,
kings, and bishops...

571
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,017
all for their own rotten purposes.

572
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:59,021
Nothing is simple.
Nothing except faith in God.

573
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:02,941
You ask uestions only God can answer.

574
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:05,527
God is an excuse that's used too often.

575
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:07,112
You blaspheme.

576
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:09,948
Life exists because of a divine pattern.

577
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,535
You must have faith and believe...

578
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:16,622
or you will cast your immortal soul
into the pit.

579
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:18,916
Look at your own soul, priest.

580
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:23,086
I do. And I look to those in the valley.

581
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,130
All of them.

582
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:27,758
I am the shepherd of this flock.

583
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:32,054
Since you came here,
Satan has walked aboard.

584
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:34,389
I feel it.

585
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:39,228
But soon, Our Lady will give me a sign...

586
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,772
and then I will know what to do.

587
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:18,308
Very pretty.

588
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:34,950
That's mine.

589
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:03,103
This valley is so peaceful.

590
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:07,065
It would be easy to become possessed by it.

591
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:12,321
Does it make you feel
in the presence of God, Captain?

592
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:16,158
Don't talk to me of God.

593
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,994
We killed God at Magdeburg.

594
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:21,872
We laid that city flat...

595
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,458
butchered men, women, and children...

596
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,336
20,000, 30,000.

597
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:30,005
And then we burned the lot.

598
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,509
- Why?
- Vengeance.

599
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:38,180
You know,
that was vengeance for one of our cities...

600
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:40,432
which was vengeance
for one of their towns...

601
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:43,477
for one of our villages,
for one of their hamlets...

602
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,063
which was probably destroyed
in the first place...

603
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:49,149
to give some fat little princeling...

604
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,485
a better view of the Rhine.

605
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:54,821
Magdeburg is that simple.

606
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:59,159
My family were there.

607
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:01,912
My father, mother...

608
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:05,749
my wife, and my son.

609
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:11,171
Then they have been dead for 12 long years.

610
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:16,927
We all have things we would like to forget.

611
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,556
Magdeburg is mine.

612
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,477
What is yours, Vogel?

613
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:31,358
Gruber.

614
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:35,195
Good.

615
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:38,115
He'll wish he stayed in the mountains.

616
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:41,952
Captain, the shrine is settled.

617
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:45,205
The women, well, that's settled.

618
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:48,876
Leave the valley in peace for a while.

619
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,962
If I do that, he'll gain the initiative.

620
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,131
Does that matter?

621
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:58,760
It matters very much,
because then he will kill us.

622
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,101
Captain, I've been to the road.

623
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,353
There are fresh tracks, many horses.

624
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:09,771
I know.

625
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:13,609
Tomorrow, we search
the village very thoroughly...

626
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,819
for secret hoards of food.

627
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:19,406
Soldiers. They do nothing but loot,
and are never satisfied.

628
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:21,992
Gold, silver, and jewelry, you keep.

629
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:26,038
But the food we put in a common store
and guard it.

630
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:29,917
If the food is to be in one store,
better the soldiers are, too.

631
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:33,462
- I'll find a big enough house.
- Better leave them where they are.

632
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:35,839
Then any trouble will be small.

633
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,842
Yes, very wise.

634
01:03:19,383 --> 01:03:20,384
So.
