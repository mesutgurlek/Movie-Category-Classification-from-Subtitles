Director: SAMMO HUNG

12
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,857
Well we've lost this goddamn war,
but it isn't over.

13
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,530
During the last two years of the war,

14
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,929
we'd transported a large
shipment of sammo 26 bombs

15
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,671
to a secret military arsenal in Vietnam.

16
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,639
Before we pulled out,
we tried to destroy that arsenal,

17
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,276
but sadly we failed.

18
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:03,705
In other words, 2 million pounds of
explosives could fall into the wrong hands.

19
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:09,086
If that arsenal is found,
you can imagine the consequences.

20
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,420
There's no way the US can send troops
or bombers in,

21
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,459
but that arsenal has simply got to be
destroyed whatever the cost is.

22
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,097
And we need your help. Understand?

23
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,736
Yes sir, we understand.

24
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,105
I've already chosen from among our troops

25
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,608
12 Chinese Americans for an assault force.

26
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,270
And this file here contains your orders.

27
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,914
But as far as the
U.S. Defense Department is concerned,

28
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,507
it simply does not exist,
only the name of your mission...

29
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,882
"Eastern Condors".

30
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,906
Go!

31
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:51,990
All the information you requested
on the Asian prisoners is here.

32
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,592
All of them have had connections
with Vietnam in the past.

33
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,596
It's in the files.

34
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,863
Anyway, take your pick.

35
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,293
But are you sure you only need 10?

36
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,802
Why not take 100 if that's not enough?
It's no problem.

37
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,905
I can always arrest more.

38
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,817
Joey Chu, alias "Turbo",
jailed for fraud for 15 years.

39
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,190
Benny and Danny Wong,
jailed for 20 years for assault and battery.

40
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:31,391
Jeff Ling, alias "Sunny".
15 years for armed robbery.

41
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:36,167
Ricky Lo, alias "Mouse".
20 years for manslaughter.

42
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,963
Steven Yau, alias "Fingers",
petty theft jailed for 20 years.

43
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,906
Jack Wang, alias "Filter",
life sentence for murder.

44
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:51,445
Alex Yuen and Frank Chau,
convicted on 8 counts of grand theft auto,

45
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,879
both serving 15 years.

46
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,290
Shawn Su,
convicted for killing a federal officer,

47
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,584
sentenced to 30 years.

48
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,354
You men have been chosen for a mission.

49
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,724
If you accept
you'll all receive special training.

50
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,401
After training you'll be
joining a up with a covert unit.

51
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,667
Throughout the duration of this mission

52
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,272
you will still be considered convicts.

53
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,505
But upon its successful completion
you'll all receive full pardons.

54
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,741
In addition,
you'll each be paid $200,000 US.

55
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,504
Any questions?

56
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,580
No sir!

57
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,147
I think they're staring at me Mouse.

58
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,852
Bet you can't make them blink.

59
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,825
They didn't even flinch!
Bet they're stoned.

60
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,964
Mouse, how are you going to
spend your 200,000 bucks?

61
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,999
Half's going to my daughter,
the other to my wife.

62
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,303
You never told me you were married.

63
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:55,637
You never asked, and where I'm from
it's a lot safer to keep your mouth shut.

64
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,816
Hell of a policy. I couldn't do it.

65
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,480
Benny,
what're you gonna do with all your money?

66
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,814
What's it to you?
It's none of your damn business.

67
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:05,915
Ease up bro.

68
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:06,820
Well it ain't!

69
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,757
Ok Ok Ok, sorry for asking.

70
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,697
What about you, Sunny?

71
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,025
I... I'm go...

72
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,201
gonna g go...

73
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,903
Don't worry, tell me later.

74
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,231
Shawn, I know in the past we...

75
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,371
Forget about it. It's the past.

76
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:30,348
Ten 'hut'! Move out!

77
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,690
Colonel, this is one hell of a mission
you're taking on here.

78
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,795
Well war is hell, sir.

79
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:55,306
Take my advice. Your objective here
is to divert the enemy's attention,

80
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,370
so our commandos can get their job done.

81
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,374
There's no need for heroics, understand?

82
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,739
What those men are facing is real.

83
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,741
That's right. But this isn't battle.

84
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,021
That war is long over, you know.

85
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,151
This is a one off. We're correcting
a mistake made years ago.

86
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,324
Listen, just do the job
and don't get killed. Right?

87
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,261
Right.

88
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,625
Colonel, do me a favour.

89
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,532
This is my brother. When we withdrew
from that ammunition dump,

90
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,972
he was wounded and had to stay
behind in a nearby Nai village.

91
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,445
When you're there if you get a chance,
try and get him out.

92
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,217
Ok I'll do my best sir.

93
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,387
Good luck.

94
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,756
Thank you, sir.

95
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,123
How many?

96
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,863
Just six. And they're drunk.

97
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,696
We'd better hurry, more will be coming.

98
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,561
You know what to do.

99
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,133
Hey boys! Any of you looking for
some good company for the night?

100
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,433
Not all at once.

101
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,806
Come on!

102
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,486
I can't stand this! Where are we going?
Why won't they tell us?

103
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,226
Hey bro, calm down!
Why's it matter anyway?

104
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,057
Why's it matter? I wanna be ready!

105
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,100
If it's cold then I'll need an overcoat
but if it's hot, I'll just go naked.

106
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,599
Who cares, we're gonna die anyway.

107
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,174
You wanna die?
I'll throw you out right now!

108
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,672
Benny, take it easy!

109
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,199
Shit!

110
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,107
Calm down!

111
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,844
Shawn, I've been thinking.

112
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,108
You know, I think he's got a point.

113
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,746
It doesn't matter.

114
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,489
I'd rather die fighting than locked up.

115
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,957
Maybe for you. They sent you away
for 30 years for what you did,

116
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,960
my sentence was only 8. How's that fair!?

117
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,957
Hey man you got what was coming to you,

118
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,364
Shawn got a bad rap.

119
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,796
That's what they all say.

120
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,097
Just telling you what I heard.

121
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,699
After this mission's over,
we all get a second chance

122
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,637
a fresh start.

123
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,771
Hey guys we've been heading south
southeast.

124
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,541
If the air speed is 400 knots,
it means that in a couple of hours,

125
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,641
we'll be somewhere over Vietnam.

126
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,277
Bullshit!
They wouldn't be taking us to Vietnam.

127
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,856
What's that? You calling him a liar?
You watch your mouth!

128
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,525
Benny, take it easy!
Come on, sit. Relax!

129
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,857
You guys need to calm down.

130
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,224
Yeah right, these guy are all animals,
aren't you?

131
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,126
Hey Forget it.

132
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,170
Why'd you get everyone nervous by
saying we're going to Vietnam?

133
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,741
'Cause according to calculations
it's where we're going.

134
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,451
At ease.

135
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,917
Alright sit down, just relax.

136
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,488
We'll be over the drop zone in 2 hours.

137
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,364
- Tell them to get ready.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,507
Now listen up! To avoid detection,
we're at high altitude.

139
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,907
Open your chute too soon and
you'll miss the target zone.

140
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:16,186
Once you're out of the plane,
count to 20 and then pull the rip cord.

141
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,216
Pull the cords by ourselves sir?

142
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,257
But sir, we didn't cover that in training sir.

143
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,519
Nothing to it. Count to 20,
then pull the thing.

144
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,998
What if the chute doesn't open?

145
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,428
Kiss your ass goodbye.

146
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,927
You'll never have to worry about
another thing,

147
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,095
who knows I might not be far behind you,

148
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,398
we all might be there soon enough.

149
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,438
Any more questions?

150
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,308
Yeah how...

151
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,008
how can... we...

152
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,043
Spit it out!

153
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,947
I guess it's out of the fry pan
and into the fire.

154
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,446
Count to 20 before you pull it

155
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,285
Go!

156
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,595
Count to 20 before you pull it!

157
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:04,065
O... k... kay!

158
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,203
Go!

159
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,829
Go!

160
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,443
Damn it!

161
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,736
Sir!

162
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,506
Sir, orders just arrived,
the mission's cancelled!

163
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,174
What?

164
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,182
There's been an explosion on
Colonel Yang's plane.

165
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,456
No one survived,
the orders say we must return.

166
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,284
How about the ones who already jumped?

167
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,651
But sir, this is an order.

168
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,692
Report Lieutenant Colonel Lam
has already jumped!

169
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,254
Sir!

170
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,415
They're landing behind the trees

171
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,359
Go!

172
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,869
Sir! Sir!

173
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,416
Sir! We're Cambodian underground,
sent to meet you.

174
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,617
Where are the others?

175
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,845
Behind the trees.

176
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,946
Alright good, help me with this.

177
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:36,886
Hey I'm here!

178
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,324
Shh, keep quiet!

179
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,233
Everyone okay? We all here?

180
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,132
123456, yes sir!

181
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,829
Idiot, we're missing one.

182
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:50,874
Sunny's not here!

183
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,338
Search the area!

184
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,067
Right!

185
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,374
Sunny!

186
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:57,880
Sunny!

187
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,248
Sunny!

188
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,050
Sunny!

189
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,788
He's over here!

190
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,051
Sunny!

191
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,365
S...

192
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,027
sixteen.

193
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,368
Sunny!

194
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,806
Sunny! Sunny!

195
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,167
He's dead

196
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,604
The order to abort came right
before I jumped,

197
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,537
we're on our own now.

198
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,475
Alright, then we're on our own.

199
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,850
Shawn, should I tell the others?

200
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,683
No. They're scared enough as it is.

201
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,384
If we tell them, it'll just make things worse.

202
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,667
This is your first check point,

203
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,832
from there go east you'll hit a river. From...

204
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,810
No. The plan's been changed.
We're going to the Nai village.

205
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,173
Nai village?

206
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,076
I wasn't informed. Are you sure?

207
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,307
It was last minute.

208
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,511
Oh man, that really stinks.

209
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,051
Something wrong?

210
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,059
No sir, don't let me stop you.

211
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,165
Smell bad? I told you it was her.

212
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,499
That ain't no kinda woman

213
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,496
I mean it sure looks like a woman,

214
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,895
but it smells like some sort of rotten thing.

215
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,873
You'd have to be pretty damn desperate.
I wouldn't go near that!

216
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,369
I would.

217
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,369
I'm not kidding, it's awful!

218
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,344
I'm going to take a shit!

219
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,211
Now!

220
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,944
There's a unit in that village and
a camp a few miles away.

221
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,188
They get wind of you and
you ain't never coming back.

222
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,954
If you'd told us we could
have prepared the way,

223
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,151
evened the odds.

224
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,160
VC!

225
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,663
Where's Fingers?

226
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,178
Can you see them yet?

227
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,912
Ssh!

228
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,356
What?

229
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:53,753
Be quiet!

230
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,127
I ain't scared of those dudes!

231
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,893
Forget it you idiots!
We'll get you next time!

232
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,233
Don't just sit there, fix it!

233
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,533
Stupid piece of shit broke down again!

234
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,643
What the hell happened?
Get down there and figure it out!

235
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,541
Well see you! Goddamn!

236
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:15,811
So what is it?

237
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,377
Start the engine, come on!
It's just an old piece of crap!

238
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,651
This happens every time you're driving!
Son of a bitch!

239
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:26,689
Damn!

240
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,897
It's a pack of American cigarettes!

241
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,364
That's weird.

242
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,063
Forget about it.

243
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,338
Over there!

244
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,206
Take them!

245
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,142
In the water!

246
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,022
No no don't shoot!

247
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:50,229
Fingers!

248
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,717
We'll rest here.

249
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,059
Don't you worry, Fingers. You'll be okay.

250
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,942
You'll be fine.
We'll get you out of here alright.

251
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,911
Listen to me, you'll be okay.

252
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,947
You just hang in there, alright?

253
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,766
I'm sorry!

254
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,595
I'm sorry!

255
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,599
He's dead.

256
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:19,450
Fingers had no business being here.
He wasn't a soldier.

257
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,034
Benny, don't!
Be quiet!

258
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Two of us are dead,
I don't want to be the next one!

259
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,167
Colonel, I've had it!

260
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,410
It was a damn sight safer
back in my prison cell!

261
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:43,780
Screw your mission!

262
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:44,873
Benny!

263
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,813
Piss off!

264
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,150
Benny, come back!

265
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,415
Be careful man
he might shoot you in the back!

266
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,084
Leave if you want to. I won't stop you.

267
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,923
Bro!

268
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,195
Well then I'm getting out of here too!

269
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,427
Benny, we're in the middle of Vietnam
for god's sake!

270
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,331
We don't even know where we are!

271
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,235
What if we're captured by the Vietnamese?

272
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,397
Or fall into a trap or something?

273
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,371
We're better off if we stick together,

274
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,544
you know look out for each other. Right?

275
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:15,970
Come on!

276
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,513
You gonna just up leave you friends
in the shit? What about me?

277
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,782
Fine. I'll go back.

278
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,344
But this is for you, not for them.

279
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,820
You're going back there? Wait for me!

280
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,122
There it is.

281
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,040
The rest of you stay here.

282
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,869
We'll rendezvous at the west hill in 2 hours.

283
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,107
If we're not there then you're on your own.

284
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:53,940
See you soon.

285
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,124
If they get in trouble,
do we go down to help them?

286
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,095
Alright, gather round!
Give me some room here kids.

287
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,333
Come on out of the way! Stand back!

288
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,132
Okay who wants quality goods
direct from the west

289
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,835
and all at reasonable prices just for you!

290
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,247
Look Weasel! Here.

291
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,216
This is gold. Where'd you get it?

292
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,856
I got it from my uncle.

293
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,324
He said that if you'd take our whole family
to Hong Kong,

294
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,655
then he'll give you a great big case full of it.

295
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,363
But he'll only deal with you.

296
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,157
Right. Tell him to come meet me
at the committee house.

297
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,094
Okay.

298
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:52,961
Here, for you.

299
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,064
Thank you.

300
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:13,756
Here

301
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:14,914
Don't worry mister, we'll take care of him.

302
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,323
You okay pal?

303
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:22,029
Looks like I saved your neck again!
How about a reward?

304
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,801
Ring a ring of the roses,
pocket full of posies,

305
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:32,500
a... tishoo a... tishoo, we all fall down!

306
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,041
Save me the idiot act.

307
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,277
Now come on
where'd you hide the treasure?

308
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,040
Once we're rich
we can fly right out of here!

309
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:52,329
Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly just like a bird!

310
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,395
Yeah that's right, wherever you like.

311
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,224
But it takes money.
Now tell me where is it?

312
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,397
- It... It's...
- Go on!

313
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,526
Right here!

314
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,535
Wait!

315
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,999
What can I do for you today?

316
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,343
Let's drink.

317
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,169
It's not my birthday.

318
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,771
Smartass.

319
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,476
You see this shit? The stuff's contaminated.

320
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,812
I took one sip and shit for a week!

321
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,817
Impossible!

322
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,987
We'll see how impossible it is!

323
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:25,356
Now drink! Finish the bottle or I finish you!

324
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:31,168
No problem. To your health, and mine.

325
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,243
Brother!

326
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,059
Now asshole,
I don't really want to have to shoot you,

327
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,391
but if I see you again I will! Beat it!

328
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:07,862
Where'd he go?

329
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,848
It's alright! Please, your brother sent us.

330
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,295
Right, I know who you are!

331
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:38,698
You're the chief and vice
chief, and piglet.

332
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,304
I know, why don't we all
play cops and robbers?

333
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,439
You're the cops, I'm the robber,
you catch me!

334
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,416
Sir, you're coming with us! Let's go!

335
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,747
Soldiers!

336
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,894
Sir? You peeing?

337
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,563
Of course I am!
What's it look like I'm doing?

338
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,568
It's just... you don't need to pee here.

339
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,332
Use the crazy guy's can.

340
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,882
I need to use your can.

341
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,963
Sir! Guess what sir?

342
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,635
The are three Americans here.

343
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,604
Yeah where?

344
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,637
They're in there.

345
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,916
There's one in there, and 2 in there.

346
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,826
You idiot!

347
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,335
But they're here! I can prove it!

348
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,402
Move!

349
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,598
Hey sir, just look!

350
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,765
Where're you going? They're right here!

351
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,012
Wait! They're here, the Americans!

352
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,447
It's Americans...

353
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,457
Colonel, this guy is crazy.

354
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,786
Let's get him up.

355
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,058
Uncle! Uncle! Hi!

356
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,917
Hey take it easy! And don't forget
there are soldiers out there.

357
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,977
They're gonna hear if you shoot me.

358
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,347
We wont' shoot you.
We don't want any trouble.

359
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,752
We're here for Mr. Yang.

360
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,461
What? You wanna take my uncle?

361
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,985
But he's lost his marbles!

362
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,322
He won't tell you anything,
you're wasting your time mister.

363
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,198
What won't he tell us?

364
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,096
Oh about where he hid the tre... nothing!

365
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,566
You got three seconds
to put your gun down.

366
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,464
I don't give a damn if those soldiers hear us.

367
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,309
You can all go to hell!

368
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,468
You win.

369
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,984
Let's go!

370
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,412
Put that thing away it's dangerous!

371
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:45,816
You have my uncle, don't you?

372
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,619
And I'm not much of a threat.

373
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:52,860
Well now!

374
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,601
Move!

375
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,744
Hold it!

376
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,278
Just what are you doing on an oxcart,
Weasel?

377
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,352
Oh I'm going to get married

378
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,892
in my fiancé's village.

379
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,493
Here, you wanna meet her?

380
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,191
That's her father and her brother.

381
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,524
Hi there!

382
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,427
Here, for you.

383
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,793
Thanks. Okay.

384
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,901
See you!

385
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,536
Help me!

386
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,448
Get them...

387
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,218
Stop! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

388
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,049
Move!

389
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,169
They're gonna tear us apart!

390
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,866
Now look, this is between you and them.

391
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,170
Let me go and surrender. Well?

392
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,343
Come on!

393
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,820
Stop shooting! It's Weasel!

394
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,425
Those guys are animals!

395
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,558
Give me a gun! I'm a real good shot.
Come on!

396
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,493
Thanks a lot.

397
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,359
Colonel, let me try to lure them away.

398
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,969
You'll have a better chance.

399
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,700
You'd never make it.

400
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,344
Don't! Listen, that's not a bad plan.

401
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,710
You all run, I'll help my uncle.

402
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,744
Keep quiet!

403
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,218
Not next to my ear! Get the cannon!

404
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,189
Yes sir!

405
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,491
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

406
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:45,961
We're dead, we're dead!

407
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,732
We're outnumbered
and they've got a cannon!

408
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,771
Come on, I'm sorry!
I know I've been bad but not this bad!

409
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,109
Fire!

410
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:12,494
You brought backup? My wheels!

411
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:26,432
Spread out!

412
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,209
Are you ok?

413
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,473
What are you doing? I told you to stay put!

414
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,918
See what did I say?
We should have left them!

415
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,816
Alright! Cool it!

416
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,155
You'd better get going.
More soldiers are coming.

417
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,186
Good thinking. Lets move out!

418
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,418
Move out!

419
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,588
Right!
Let's go!

420
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,102
Come on you're slowing us down!

421
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,529
Come on!

422
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,607
He's doing his best.

423
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,266
What!

424
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,332
Shouting at him is not going to help.

425
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,310
Here's fine.

426
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,413
Colonel, he's hit bad.

427
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,815
We'll have to remove the bullet.

428
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,555
You've done enough damage!

429
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,854
Uncle, I'm here.

430
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,893
Who the hell are you?

431
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,257
Who the hell am I?

432
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,163
You wanna know who I am?

433
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,204
I'm the one who just got you out of there!

434
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,135
I just saved you ass,
that's who the hell I am!

435
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,605
Because of you I'm homeless!
And I almost got killed this morning!

436
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,580
Do you think I like running around
getting shot at all day?

437
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,616
I used to be a quiet businessman,
but you've just turned me into a bandit!

438
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,155
You've screwed my life!

439
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,823
My uncle and I used to make a good living,

440
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,186
but thanks to you we're now both fugitives!

441
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,821
And you have the nerve to ask who I am?

442
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:58,627
Here, sir.

443
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,733
Deng, I don't know you that well.

444
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:09,975
But I have to say you got a terrific figure
from what I can see.

445
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,084
You're very kind... and such a pretty face.

446
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,723
I wouldn't want to have to ruin it.
You get my drift?

447
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,732
That's one mean ass chick.
She'll come around.

448
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,831
You mean it? 200,000 if I help you?

449
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,239
That's right. Not a bad deal if you trust me.

450
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,313
I don't, but then I don't know you.

451
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,175
Are you with us?

452
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,849
I don't have a choice. Can't go home,
but my uncle...

453
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:48,984
You just get us out of here.

454
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,787
Don't worry about your uncle
we're gonna take care of him.

455
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,417
Well I'm your man.
I know the place like the back of my...

456
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,297
More of them are coming!

457
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,330
Give me your knives!

458
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,236
- Look after him!
- Right!

459
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,681
No thanks. You keep it.

460
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,319
Over there! Move out!

461
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,255
Sir!

462
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,210
Alright men! Spread out!

463
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:25,773
You okay?

464
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,187
It's me!

465
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,944
Come on quit spying!

466
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,289
Observing, not spying!

467
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,883
You know you've really
got to lighten up on people.

468
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,589
You know your problem?
You're always complaining!

469
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,723
Whenever I try or do something,

470
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,400
you always have to find
something wrong with it!

471
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,931
Can't you just get off my case?!

472
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,734
Quiet! You're too loud!

473
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,566
What's it to you?
I'll holler as loud as I like!

474
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,908
Go ahead ignore me!

475
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,035
You never even listened to
what I say anyway.

476
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,045
I'm surprised you haven't killed each other,
all you do is argue.

477
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,578
Keep out of this!
Unless you wanna sit out there!

478
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,482
Sorry, whatever you say sir.

479
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,919
Are you making fun of me?

480
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,219
Benny, calm down will you?
Keep observing. Go on!

481
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,089
Observing? I'm spying!

482
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,452
Mouse, quit moving!

483
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,088
You're letting water in.

484
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,831
Why don't you go have a rest?

485
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,026
I'm alright, Deng.

486
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,935
Why don't you girls just find a husband
and settle down?

487
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,174
Why are you risking your lives like this?

488
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,604
We're fighting for our freedom.

489
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,769
Don't waste your breath.

490
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,804
He doesn't know what a guerilla is.

491
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,173
Sure I do. From what I've heard,

492
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,310
guerillas are wanderers, badly prepared,
and badly organized.

493
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:31,650
Don't!

494
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:32,414
I'm serious!

495
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,957
That's what they say. I believe them.

496
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,992
I was just kidding with you!

497
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,221
Great!

498
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,693
Lets hope that next year
we can have another party.

499
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,495
Don't tempt fate, okay?

500
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,397
Goddamn it! 2 days!

501
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,631
When's it gonna stop raining?

502
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,239
We don't deserve this shit.

503
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,111
Deserve has got nothing to do with it.

504
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:56,412
Here.

505
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,512
Look I gotta come clean,
there's something you should know.

506
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:02,582
The mission that we're on...

507
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,310
Listen it don't matter.

508
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,149
Whatever happens we know you're doing it
for our own good.

509
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,448
We trust your judgment.

510
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,718
It's just all this damn rain.
It's starting to get us down.

511
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,072
Can't sleep?

512
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,375
I couldn't help thinking,

513
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,508
somehow this is no place
for a young woman.

514
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,749
You need the protection of a man
who'll look after you.

515
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,123
But look no further, I'm right here.

516
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,097
Listen if I did need a man,
it wouldn't be you that's for sure.

517
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,133
Now take a hike, you get me?

518
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:51,927
Wait!

519
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,502
But you can do something for me.

520
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,798
Take over the watch, I'm tired.

521
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,344
One of these days you'll
come back and beg me!

522
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,449
Who's there?

523
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,682
Stop or I'll shoot!

524
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,251
Don't shoot, it's just me. I need a pee.

525
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,959
Take a leak somewhere else!
That's disgusting!

526
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,995
Yeah or what?
I bet I can hit you from here.

527
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:25,400
There's so much rain,

528
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,868
you wouldn't be able to tell the difference
between water and piss.

529
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,336
Hey either you stop or I'll shoot you!

530
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,202
Think you got the guts? Here!

531
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:47,789
We're under attack!

532
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,426
We're under attack!

533
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,252
Get down!

534
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,920
Shoot at something!

535
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:02,261
Look out! What the hell is that?

536
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,005
They're right here!

537
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,507
Don't shoot!
Drop your weapons!

538
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:15,978
Go!

539
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:21,351
Keep moving!

540
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:22,892
Move!
