Ahhh!

21
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,660
Ahhh!

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,700
Ahh--Ahhh!

23
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,620
Ahh!

24
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,750
Stop crying!

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,230
You're making Dieter here
a little nervous.

26
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,790
Ahh! Ahhh!

27
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,230
I need that.

28
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,940
Okay, okay...

29
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,440
Thanks.

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,170
Ah, Zigaretten.

31
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,340
I hope you choke on it.

32
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,690
Lemon powder.

33
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,040
Meine Frau.

34
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,210
Du sprichst Deutsch?

35
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,220
Yeah.

36
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,580
Hmm.

37
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,610
Bitte--

38
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,480
Hier.

39
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,620
Danke.

40
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,250
You must be living right, Deac.

41
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,330
Halt! Halt!

42
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,160
Come on!

43
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,500
Come on, this way!

44
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,640
Deacon.

45
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,370
Out!

46
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,930
Heraus! Jetzt!

47
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,940
No, don't shoot!

48
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,640
Nein shooten!
Nein shooten!

49
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,690
Shoot him!

50
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,750
Shoot him!

51
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,310
Shoot him.

52
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,920
I surrender.

53
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,990
What are you waiting for?

54
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,090
Shut up!

55
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,100
Give me the gun!

56
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,100
No!

57
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,660
Hey, hey!

58
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,100
Why didn't you take that shot?

59
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,200
Do you know what you just did?

60
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,210
Shh!

61
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,180
Deac.

62
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,740
Come on.

63
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,450
Get down, get down low.

64
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,310
Oh!

65
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,120
What happened back there, Deac?

66
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,160
He had a Kraut in his sights
and he froze.

67
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,300
He's one of ours.

68
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,310
Yeah.

69
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,410
Get down!

70
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,310
Boy, am I glad to see you fellas.

71
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,750
Gould, I've been hit.

72
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,650
What in the Sam Hill
happened back there?

73
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,180
I'm Steven Gould.

74
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,090
This is Shirl Kendrick, 285th.

75
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,600
Gordon Gunderson,
Nathan Greer, 101st.

76
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,790
Kendrick, hold still.

77
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,800
It's just a graze,
I can fix you un right here.

78
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
We gotta get out of here

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,330
and find shelter
before it turns dark.

80
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,200
Due respect, Sarge,
but I didn't come to

81
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,800
the war to hide out.

82
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,900
Nobody asked you, Kendrick.

83
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,740
Look, we're behind
the enemy lines.

84
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,840
In a couple of days,

85
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,110
the bombers are gonna
drive these bastards

86
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,910
back to Berlin.

87
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,940
For now,
they're shooting prisoners,

88
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,180
and we got one Kraut rifle

89
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,020
with, what?

90
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,110
Sheesh.

91
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,350
Four rounds left in it.

92
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,950
Hell, I just wanna shoot me
some more Krauts.

93
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,830
We gotta get out of here.

94
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,190
Deacon, you gotta go point.

95
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,060
This way. Move it.

96
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,400
I don't see any weapons.

97
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,030
An ambulance.

98
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,230
They mowed down
a damn ambulance.

99
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,780
Deac...

100
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,250
Deac...

101
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,980
Why don't you, uh, head up
the hill and keep watch.

102
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,050
I'm gonna see if we can find
some stuff we can use,

103
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,180
and then we'll get out of here.

104
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,890
All right?

105
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,890
I hate robbing the dead.

106
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,200
They're already been robbed.

107
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,640
Just grab whatever we can use.

108
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,680
Deac.

109
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,620
Put this on.

110
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,330
Put it on.

111
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,200
I need you at the road
checking stuff out.

112
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,430
Go on, get.

113
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,540
Damn.

114
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,980
What?

115
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,990
I found some K-rations.

116
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,680
And?

117
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,550
Some dummy took
all the cigarettes out.

118
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,400
How long has Deacon been gone?

119
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,870
Almost an hour.

120
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,540
That's a nice watch, Gould.

121
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,640
He's not gonna miss it, trust me.

122
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,780
If I catch a bullet,

123
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,880
you gonna take my personals too?

124
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,190
You don't have anything I want,
Kendrick.

125
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,880
Except maybe your flashlight.

126
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,690
Funny.

127
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,690
Hey, Sarge,

128
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,130
what's the deal with Deacon?

129
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,030
He seems a little...jumpy.

130
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,060
Deacon's fine.

131
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,540
He's just a little on edge.

132
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,440
He seems like a nice enough
fella and all, just...

133
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,940
He's shell-shocked.

134
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,240
I've seen it a million times.

135
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,080
Don't worry about it.

136
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,310
Yeah, it's just a little
frightening.

137
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,110
We only have one weapon,
and he's holding it.

138
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,120
Yeah, we do have one weapon.

139
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,280
How did we get that weapon,
Gould?

140
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,250
Deacon saved my ass

141
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,260
more times that I care
to think about.

142
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,960
He's fine.

143
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,720
What'd ya find, Deac?

144
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,650
Home, sweet home.

145
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,310
Yeah, this will work

146
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,080
to hold up in for a couple of days.

147
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,450
Deac, I want you on first watch.

148
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,480
Let's see if we can get a fire going

149
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,490
in this thing.

150
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,960
Gould, you got any matches?

151
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,150
No.

152
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,630
I found the latrine.

153
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,030
Like I said--
home, sweet home.

154
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,490
Great, this thing's safe.

155
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,010
Hey, Gunderson.

156
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,020
What's the deal

157
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,020
with you and Deacon?

158
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,490
You guys separated at birth?

159
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,820
Cousins?

160
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,380
Deacon's the squarest guy
I know.

161
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,090
He's from some little
backwards town in Arizona.

162
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,960
Doesn't drink,

163
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,970
doesn't smoke.

164
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,520
He doesn't even like cofee.

165
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,870
That's why they call him
The Deacon.

166
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,470
My boys back
in the neighborhood--

167
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,100
if they knew my best buddy

168
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,440
was a good church boy like him,

169
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,780
they'd laugh their butts off.

170
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,320
I'll tel you something else
about Deacon--

171
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,450
he's the best shot
I've ever seen.

172
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,460
Where are you from, Sarge?

173
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,760
Chicago, south side.

174
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
Is that right?

175
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,200
How about you?

176
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,220
Louisiana.

177
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,000
Small town.

178
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,430
Really small.

179
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,070
How about you, Gould?

180
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,840
Where are you from?

181
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,210
New York.

182
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,180
What part of New York?

183
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,010
Brooklyn.

184
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,810
Heights.

185
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,150
I like Brooklyn.

186
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,450
Good jazz clubs.

187
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,020
Yeah, you want good jazz,
you gotta go to the Village.

188
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,120
You want great jazz,
you go to New Orleans.

189
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,530
That's a good place.

190
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,020
Father in Heaven,

191
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,560
forgive me for

192
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,190
the things I've done.

193
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,200
I just need--

194
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,500
Stop.

195
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,140
This is your card.

196
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,980
That's a pretty good trick,
Kendrick.

197
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,010
Got a jeep coming!

198
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,550
Keep going.

199
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,360
Keep going, keep going...

200
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,730
They're stopping.

201
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,830
Gunderson!

202
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,070
Hallo!

203
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,140
Jemand zu Hause?

204
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,550
Ach!

205
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,730
Ohh!

206
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,910
I-- I don't know.

207
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,040
Deac, what'd you get?

208
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,440
I couldn't hear 'eh very good.

209
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,450
Something about the
Meuse River

210
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,310
and the plane crashin'.

211
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,610
Shh.

212
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,880
Bloody, come on!

213
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,890
Stand back!

214
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,900
I think he's a Kraut.

215
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,060
Not a step closer!

216
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,060
Don't shoot him.

217
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,060
I've got a gun.

218
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,070
He's a Brit.

219
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,290
Kendrick, go help him down.

220
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,560
Stand back!

221
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,690
Go.

222
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,900
All right now,
just calm down.

223
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,910
No!

224
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,460
Here we go.
Come on.

225
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,430
Get back!

226
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,970
Whoa!

227
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,980
Hey, take it easy.

228
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,980
Drop it!

229
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,980
You drop it!

230
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,110
Keep it down!

231
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,120
We're Americans.

232
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,120
Prove it!

233
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,350
What?

234
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,150
Who was the third president
of the United States?

235
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,160
Just put the gun down.

236
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,660
Thomas Jefferson.

237
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,520
Who was the fourth?

238
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,250
Madison.
What's with this guy?

239
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,420
What's the capital of Vermont?

240
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,660
Hartford-- I--

241
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,820
Sarge!

242
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,090
Give me a break!
Nobody knows that.

243
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,120
You tell me!

244
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,970
Haven't the foggiest.

245
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,870
Sorry, boys.

246
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,210
Where's your command post?

247
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,580
Used to be that way.

248
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,880
Sorry for the trouble.

249
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,650
Thank you.

250
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,120
Montpelier.

251
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,320
About how far back?

252
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,800
About 10 to 15 miles.

253
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,490
Soldier, who are you?

254
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,130
Flight Sergeant,
Oberon Winley,

255
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,140
Royal Air Force.

256
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,730
Oberon...

257
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,710
Winley.

258
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,770
Look, I am in possession
of some crucial intelligence.

259
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,870
I need to get to
the nearest command center.

260
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,970
Buddy, you must have smashed

261
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,710
your head on a tree
coming down or something.

262
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,950
Or a bloody field phone at least.

263
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,820
There are no field phones,
and you will keep it down.

264
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,190
Can we shoot him now, Sarge?

265
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,620
Shut up!

266
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,120
Winley,
where do you think you're going?

267
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,130
I was intended to fly
back to Manhay.

268
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,360
Really?

269
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,560
Well, we've had a bit
of bad luck around here.

270
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,400
A Panzer division went
on a spoiling expedition,

271
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,840
and we are now
behind the enemy lines.

272
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,740
This isn't some little
spoiling expedition.

273
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,900
This is a major
German offensive.

274
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,810
After the Germans attacked,

275
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,280
we were ordered to fly

276
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,680
an emergency photo
re-con mission

277
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,740
to collect electronic
intelligence.

278
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,150
We were flying

279
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,090
under some--
some cloud cover and...

280
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,150
snapped some
rather revealing photos.

281
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,560
But by the time we realized
what we had,

282
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,230
a German fighter
had shot us down.

283
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,430
So you need to get
to intelligence?

284
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,870
Yes.

285
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,030
And it's damn critical

286
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,670
that I get there
as soon as possible.

287
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,130
They've punched through...

288
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,910
all along here...

289
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,040
right where we're thinnest.

290
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,640
Why would they do that?

291
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,650
If they punch through here,

292
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,980
they're exposing their flank.

293
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,850
That's right.

294
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,860
Unless, of course,

295
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,620
they hurry and make it
to the Meuse River

296
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,820
and cross over.

297
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,800
I don't get it.

298
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,360
Well, if they cross the Meuse,

299
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,370
then they can turn

300
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,030
and take Leige.

301
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,130
I went through there
on my way in.

302
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,640
It's got one of
the biggest ammo dumps

303
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,140
I've ever seen there.

304
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,570
It's one of the largest
in Europe.

305
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,130
And if the Krauts take Leige,
they take the ammo dump.

306
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,410
Or we have to destroy it.

307
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,210
Either way, it's a straight shot

308
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,340
for them to take back Antwerp.

309
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,510
What is this?
This ain't German.

310
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,040
Thank you.

311
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,560
I have got to get these

312
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,360
to there

313
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,020
before the Germans cross
the Meuse River.

314
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,430
It's over 20 miles.

315
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,770
As a crow flies, yes.

316
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,960
Thank you.

317
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,130
And we're supposed to outrun
an entire Panzer division,

318
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,270
on foot?

319
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,300
You know,
we could follow this rail line

320
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,210
along here

321
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,510
and then cut up through here

322
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,850
and shortcut them.

323
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,020
Could save a lot of troops.

324
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,390
Hey...

325
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,630
Where'd you learn
to speak German?

326
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,660
What?

327
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,830
Your German--
where'd you pick it up?

328
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,100
Oh, in Berlin.

329
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
What were you doing there?

330
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,810
Going to school or something?

331
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,080
No, I was a missionary.

332
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,580
That must have been neat.

333
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,780
Hanging out with a bunch
of Krauts talking about God.

334
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,720
How is Adolf?

335
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,730
I loved it.

336
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,990
It was the best time of my life.

337
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,540
Hey, Deac.

338
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,550
Deac!

339
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,610
You wanna see
a good magic trick?

340
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,720
I need a smoke.

341
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,460
Hi.

342
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,360
So, Winley...

343
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,230
where'd you say
you were from, exactly?

344
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,900
What is it, Kendrick?

345
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,240
You want one of my fags,
is that what it is?

346
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,970
Well, uh...

347
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,980
That's...

348
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,000
Hmm.

349
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,540
Forget I asked.

350
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,610
No problem.

351
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,210
How long has it been

352
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,280
since you and Deacon have slept?

353
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,090
Me--two days.

354
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,030
Him--three or four.

355
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,290
The longer he goes

356
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,300
without sleep...

357
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,170
the more he's gonna lose it.

358
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,830
Thank you.

359
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,980
What is he doing?

360
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,990
He's making sure

361
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,650
all's clear.

362
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,700
Okay, let's go.

363
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,030
Move it.

364
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,460
All right, look,

365
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,670
we've gone about 12 miles.

366
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,670
We've gotta stop.

367
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,200
We gotta get some shut-eye.

368
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,640
All right?

369
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,110
We're gonna get moving
in a hour.

370
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,130
I'm gonna take first watch.

371
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,310
No, I got it, Sarge.

372
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,440
No, you don't.

373
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,250
You gotta get down there
and get some sleep.

374
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,450
All right?
Go. Move it.

375
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,750
Careful.

376
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,920
Hey, Kendrick,

377
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,590
that was, uh,
nice work really.

378
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,620
Thanks, Sarge.

379
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,070
Yes, thank you for protecting us
from the birdies.

380
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,470
Very decent of you.

381
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,210
"Very decent of you."

382
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,990
I fell asleep.

383
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,100
Well, you're not the only one.

384
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,370
What about you?

385
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,110
No.

386
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,060
You sure you don't want
some coffee?

387
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,820
You sure you don't want
some hot lemonade?

388
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,100
What the hell are we
doing here, Deac?

389
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,870
This is crazy.

390
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,250
Yeah, you got that right.

391
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,050
I should be home right now.

392
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,610
Should be home playing
with my nephews,

393
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,110
flirting with the girl
at my dad's store...

394
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,490
What's her name?

395
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,860
I forgot her name.

396
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,390
And you--
you should be doing...

397
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,170
whatever you do.

398
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,080
I should be helping my wife
get ready for the baby.

399
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,510
You didn't tell me
you were having a baby.

400
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,150
I got the letter on Thursday.

401
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,560
She says she knows
it's gonna be a girl.

402
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,930
Huh.

403
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,260
She must be due
pretty soon then, huh?

404
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,530
Yeah, January 18th.

405
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,360
That's my birthday.

406
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,340
I know.

407
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,770
Huh.

408
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,830
Hmm.

409
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,610
Thusday--that was
the day we hit Essendor.

410
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,780
You'll be all right, Deac.

411
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,090
We just gotta get
Winley to Manhay...

412
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,120
win the war, and go home.

413
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,680
Hey, Deac.

414
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,980
I got some
lemonade packets.

415
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,750
I'll trade you
for a couple of butts.

416
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,920
Kendrick, give it a rest.

417
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,120
Nobody has any smokes,
especially not him.

418
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,220
I just need a smoke.

419
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,290
I gotta figure out
where the hell we are.

420
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,340
So, Gould...

421
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,640
what's your secret?

422
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,740
My what?

423
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,610
You know, your big secret

424
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,980
you don't tell the other chaps
around the campfire.

425
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,420
I mean, we've all got them.

426
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,950
I'm sure Kendrick here
has 10 or 20.

427
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,020
Yeah, I don't have one of those.

428
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,260
Rubbish.

429
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,290
Look, even if I did...

430
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,930
why would I tell you?

431
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,200
You don't have to tell me,
of course.

432
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,230
It's-- It's just that

433
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,500
we're on this perilous
mission together.

434
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,840
And I've found that

435
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,540
when man can share
anything with each other,

436
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,270
anything,

437
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,610
well, it creates a certain...

438
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,010
Esprit de Corps, you follow?

439
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,520
Forget it.

440
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,420
Righty-o.
You can play as you want.

441
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,830
I never kissed my wife
'til the day we were married.

442
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,890
All right, Deacon.

443
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,160
You see,
I feel close already.

444
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,030
When I was 15,

445
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,130
I showed up at school

446
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,230
with a shiner and a bloody lip.

447
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,510
I told the guys I got it
plying stick ball,

448
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,710
but I actually got it

449
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,440
'cause I got beat up
by Alice Palisky.

450
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,080
Alice Palisky.
Good.

451
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,380
All right, all right, I got one.

452
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,360
One time when I was, uh,
in high school,

453
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,450
I was working
on my dad's truck.

454
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,520
And I had one
of them vacuum tubes--

455
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,650
you know what I'm talking about.

456
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,220
And, uh,
I figured out that if I held it

457
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,790
just so and sucked--

458
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,260
I could give myself hickeys.

459
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,500
So I had them
all over my neck.

460
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,100
And I told my buddies that,

461
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,700
uh, that I had a girl
from out of town.

462
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,010
But, truth be known,

463
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,510
I never kissed
a girl before, ever.

464
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,450
I'm sorry.

465
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,450
What's so funny?

466
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,150
Sorry, everyone.

467
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,390
It's just, well, hickeys, huh?

468
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,790
Guess we found
a new nickname for Kendrick.

469
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,830
Let's go.

470
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,660
We're making good time,

471
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,070
but we gotta keep moving.

472
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,570
So, Winsley,
what's your secret, huh?

473
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,160
Good grief,
you think I'd tell you chaps?

474
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,570
I've just barely met you.

475
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,160
Is all Brits
as charming as Winsley?

476
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,220
I don't know.

477
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,370
What the hell is he doing?

478
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,510
No...

479
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,780
Deac!

480
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,980
No!

481
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,990
Deac!

482
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,760
No! No! No!
Don't kill me!

483
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,760
No, no!

484
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,820
Cover his mouth.

485
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,920
Come on, right here.

486
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,200
Deac, Deacon, Deacon, shh.

487
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,200
It's okay.

488
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,860
Be quiet.

489
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,000
Can you do something for him?

490
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,200
He needs a warm place to sleep.

491
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,670
Yeah, we don't really
have that, do we, Gould?

492
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,870
What can you do for him here?

493
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,880
Deacon!

494
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,380
Deacon!

495
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,610
Deacon, listen to me!

496
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,410
Do not get us killed!

497
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,350
Look at me! Look at me!

498
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,250
Open your eyes.
Look at me.

499
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,260
Relax.

500
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,590
Breathe.

501
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,390
I'm going to take my hand
away from your mouth.

502
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,490
Don not scream, okay?

503
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,090
Okay. Shh.

504
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,730
Did you see 'em?

505
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,900
Tell me you saw 'em.

506
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,410
It's okay, Deacon.
It's okay, Deacon.

507
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,660
Talk to me.

508
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,930
All right.

509
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,370
Last Thursday,

510
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,170
we ran into some Krauts
in a little town

511
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,140
in the Elsenborn Ridge.

512
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,200
They were pulling out,

513
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,900
but this one little bastard

514
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,810
was holed-up inside a church.

515
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,250
I sent Deacon to take him out.

516
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,880
It was dark in there.

517
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,850
Somebody took a shot at him.

518
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,690
So he threw in a grebade,
sprayed the room.

519
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,160
Went up and took the guy out.

520
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,720
In the room...

521
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:35,360
was two women and six kids.

522
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,710
It was a mess.

523
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,270
When it was over,

524
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,180
Deac just...

525
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,480
flipped out.

526
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,350
Our C.O. gave me a jeep

527
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,790
to have him checked out
at St. Vith.

528
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,380
We got captured about an hour

529
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,550
before you guys run
into them at Malmedy.

530
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,930
You don't mention this to him.

531
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,200
Do you understand me, Gould?

532
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,570
All right, what do we do?

533
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,110
We keep him talking.

534
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,950
We don't let him
go off by himself.

535
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,250
And please, put that rifle
in somebody else's hands.

536
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,780
Yeah.

537
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,090
47, 48, 49, 50, 51...

538
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,290
C'mon. Damn.

539
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,080
What is that?
Some kind of code?

540
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,100
No, it's the way I write.

541
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,980
I hope somebody
can translate that.

542
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,610
Of course. I can.

543
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,350
Are you trying to tell me
you're the only person

544
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,380
that knows what that says?

545
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,520
That more or less sums it up.

546
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,360
So us not letting you die
would be pretty important?

547
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,100
Yes.

548
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,130
Great.

549
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,300
Kendrick.

550
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,710
You got watch.

551
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,770
Gonna give you a gun.

552
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,330
I'm gonna scout a bit.

553
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,310
I'll be right back.

554
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,360
That is sick.

555
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,510
Yes, I'm sure you prefer
to use your fingers.

556
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,250
That's much better, Hickey.

557
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,050
Very distinguished.

558
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,180
That's better
than carrying it around

559
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,520
in your pocket all day.

560
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,600
That good reading?

561
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:31,840
Do you believe in a life
after this one?

562
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,370
Not a chance in hell.

563
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,220
When we first got there,

564
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,550
I was working on this kid.

565
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,790
He was shot up pretty bad.

566
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,960
He kept saying, "Please, God."

567
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,730
"Please, God," over and over...

568
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,400
like it meant something.

569
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,800
He was so sincere about it,

570
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,140
I thought it might work.

571
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,610
Then two minutes later
he was dead.

572
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,780
There wasn't a thing
I could do about it.

573
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,120
When I looked into his eyes...

574
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,180
there wasn't nothing there.

575
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,850
Nothing.

576
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,130
That's when I realized that...

577
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,530
this is it.

578
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,500
It's funny.

579
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,870
What can possibly be funny
about that?

580
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,880
No, I don't mean funny funny.

581
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:44,980
It's just that, uh...

582
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,360
We were just outside
Sainte-Mere-Englise.

583
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:53,690
We were getting pounded
pretty hard.

584
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,630
And I was holding this--

585
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,400
this kid on my lap, and...

586
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,000
he was shot up pretty good.

587
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,140
And I remember him praying.

588
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,640
And I was praying too.

589
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
Then all of a sudden, he--

590
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,290
he was gone.

591
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,490
And that was--
that was it, really.

592
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,160
That was the first time that I--

593
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,570
that I really watched somebody die.

594
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,630
But right then,
I knew that he was--

595
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,980
he was in a better place than that.

596
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,780
How convenient for you.

597
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,780
Convenient?

598
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,340
Yeah, that's
what I was just thinking

599
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,290
about what you said.

600
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,320
Funny, huh?

601
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,740
Where you from?

602
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,740
Arizona.

603
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,080
I know, Arizona.

604
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,670
Where in Arizona?

605
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,240
Snowflake.

606
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,910
Snowflake--
I never heard of it.

607
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,790
What do you do
in Snowflake for fun?

608
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,730
Hunting.

609
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,890
What do you hunt?

610
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,560
Whatever's in season.

611
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,560
So you like to shoot things?

612
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,600
Forget I asked.

613
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,770
So why do you like
the Krauts so much?

614
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,550
'Cause I know 'em.

615
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,550
I know that most of 'em
are just like you and me.

616
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,610
They just wear
a different uniform.

617
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,950
So Adolf Hitler is
a pretty nice fella?

618
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,150
Once you get to know him--

619
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,060
it's just a different uniform?

620
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,490
That's not what I said.

621
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,330
And those guys at
Malmedy--they're just like us,

622
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,920
except they got
different helmets on?

623
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,870
If it makes it easier
for you to hate 'em,

624
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,030
then go right ahead.

625
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,870
You know what,
if it weren't for them,

626
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,900
I'd be finishing up med school
and putting a cast

627
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,810
on Billy's leg 'cause he broke
it on his bicycle.

628
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,810
But instead,

629
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,140
I'm taking lead

630
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,650
out of his 17-year-old
brother's gut,

631
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,170
'cause he wanted
to serve his country,

632
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,410
and he lied about his age.

633
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,380
And now he's spitting up blood,

634
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,150
lying in the dirt,

635
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,120
and asking God
to come and save him.

636
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,590
It's more than a different unifom.

637
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,420
Are they crossed by yet?

638
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,760
They must be stalled
somewhere in here.

639
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,270
Yeah, this weather can't be
helping them much.

640
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,740
How far is it to Manhay?

641
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,430
About 15 kilometers.

642
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,070
All right.

643
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,240
This weather keeps up,
we should be able to beat 'em.

644
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,480
Get there by dark.
All right.

645
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,010
Let's move out.
Come on.

646
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,750
Ahhhh!

647
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,690
Kendrick!

648
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,030
Kendrick!

649
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,030
Kendrick!

650
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,530
Okay, buddy? Okay?

651
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,010
Kendrick, can you hear me?

652
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,410
We can't do this here!

653
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,440
We gotta get out of this.

654
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,570
If we stop now,
there's no way

655
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,780
we're going
to make it in time.

656
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,720
If we can't move,
they can't move.

657
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,520
And we can't move!

658
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,680
Get him out of here.

659
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,780
Come on.

660
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,550
We're going, we're going.

661
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:50,580
Careful, careful.

662
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,450
Stand right there.

663
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:23,890
Do not move.

664
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,290
No, no.

665
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,320
You can't sit down.

666
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,960
You've gotta keep moving.
Get up.

667
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,130
Get up.
Keep moving.

668
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:38,410
I'm gonna check it out.
Winley.

669
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,640
Give me your gun.

670
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,640
Just stand there,

671
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,910
keep your eyes open.

672
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,880
I'll go with ya.

673
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,110
I got it, Deac.

674
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,420
But, Sarge, I can--

675
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,920
Corporal!

676
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,450
Don't worry about it.

677
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,330
Just open the door.

678
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,260
It's okay, okay.
It's okay.

679
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,460
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay.

680
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,470
I'm American.

681
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,000
Put the knife down!

682
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,370
Put it down!
I don't want--

683
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,370
Put it down!

684
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:22,140
It's okay.

685
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,270
It's okay, look,
I'm putting the gun down.

686
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,410
Okay?

687
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:28,040
Put the knife down.

688
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,990
I'm an American, okay?

689
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,220
It's okay,

690
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,810
it's okay.

691
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,950
Okay, put it down.

692
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,930
American.

693
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,770
American.

694
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,100
Yeah.

695
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,610
It's okay, fellas.

696
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,510
It's okay, uh...

697
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,570
This is, uh,
this is Madam Thearey.

698
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,600
Catherine.

699
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,410
Catherine, Catherine.

700
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,380
Uh, and this is Sophie.

701
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,110
Bon jour.

702
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,020
Bon jour.

703
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,960
Ah, yeah, yeah, we're all--
we're all Americans.

704
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,590
Uh, except for him.

705
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,320
He's, uh, he's British.
He's from, you know, England.

706
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,860
Bien.

707
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,910
Merci.

708
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,420
Merci.

709
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,610
Merci, Catherine.

710
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,050
What did she just say?

711
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:16,490
Goodbye...

712
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,520
in French.

713
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:12,410
Gunderson.

714
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,380
It's 15:00 hours.

715
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,940
We did everything we could,
Winley.

716
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,680
We certainly did.

717
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,750
Still...

718
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:54,350
here I sit
all nice and comfy, while...

719
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,960
You boys have been super.

720
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,770
But I'm figuring
I best get on with it.

721
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,930
Look, if I start now,

722
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,840
I can probably get there
before morning.

723
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah.

724
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,270
You could try.

725
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,150
I just don't know
what your frozen dead body

726
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,710
is gonna do for anybody.

727
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,690
You can give these

728
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,250
to Kendrick if you want.

729
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,030
Cheerio.

730
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,590
Winley.

731
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:45,440
You let him go.

732
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,940
He's not our prisoner, Gould.

733
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,740
He's gonna die out there.

734
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,770
Yes, he is.

735
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,740
Catherine.

736
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,140
Bon jour.

737
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,800
Bread.

738
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Thank you.

739
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,810
Winley?

740
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,910
Oh, Winley?

741
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

742
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:34,920
Deac?

743
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,620
We got company.

744
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,930
Oh, Sophie!

745
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,590
Catherine...

746
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,660
No!

747
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,060
No!

748
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,930
No, no!

749
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,270
No!

750
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,330
Hands off!

751
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,840
Hands off!

752
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,180
You gotta take him, Deac.

753
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,690
Deac!

754
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,520
Deac, get the Luger!

755
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,390
We gotta catch him!

756
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,510
Damn!

757
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,880
You gotta be kidding me.

758
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:23,250
Did you get him?

759
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,430
We lost him.

760
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,660
What happened to "dead eye"?

761
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,640
I don't know.
I just couldn't hit him.

762
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:28,660
Couldn't or wouldn't?

763
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,830
Hey, I did not miss
on purpose!

764
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:30,840
That's a lie!

765
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,430
That's enough!

766
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,500
If Deacon says he just missed him,
he just missed him.

767
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,510
We've got other things

768
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,010
to worry about right now.

769
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,480
Look what I found!

770
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,280
I heard gunshots,

771
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,410
so I started
back through the woods,

772
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,420
and I found
this little bugger...

773
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,650
kneeling down, praying
his little Gerry head off.

774
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:51,960
I say we shoot him right now!

775
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,050
Shut up, Kendrick!

776
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,120
I'm with Kendrick.
Let's shoot him.

777
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,390
With his own gun!

778
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:56,400
We don't shoot prisoners, people.

779
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:57,400
Yeah, but he does.

780
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,400
Shoot him!

781
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:59,830
Shut up, Kendrick!

782
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,860
What's wrong with you?
Shoot him!

783
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,200
Winley, put the gun down!

784
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,610
You will obey my orders!

785
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,800
Rudy?

786
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:18,990
What's going on?

787
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:22,850
Deacon!

788
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:27,760
This is Rudolph Gertz
from Berlin.

789
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:33,460
When I was on my mission,
I taught his family, and I c--

790
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:40,670
I never miss.

791
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,870
Gundy, I didn't hit him...

792
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,710
but I never miss.

793
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,630
Sergeant.

794
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:10,900
Hmm.

795
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,140
Did you give my cigarettes to, uh...

796
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,520
Thanks.

797
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,780
No problem.

798
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,920
So, Winley,
why did you come back?

799
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,830
I heard gunshots,

800
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,670
and I realized I was probably
going to die out there.

801
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,400
I'm not proud of it.

802
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,470
You made a choice.

803
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:51,340
You're still alive.
That's good for you.

804
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,320
Yes, that's true.

805
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:57,180
It's midnight.

806
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,450
Gould, you're up.

807
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:05,090
I see our prisoners-of-war's
having fun.

808
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:12,100
What'd he say name was?

809
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,730
Adolf.

810
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,040
He gives me the creeps.

811
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,800
It's Rudolph.

812
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:26,480
Whatever.

813
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,510
Hey, Winley,
I'll make you a deal.

814
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,550
You pick a card, any card,

815
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:37,320
the put it back in the deck.

816
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,920
If I can find your card
in this deck,

817
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:44,400
you give me one of them smokes.

818
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,160
What do you say?

819
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,700
Deal.

820
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,020
Okay.

821
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,880
Got it?

822
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,590
Okay, now,
you just tell me when to stop.

823
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:20,760
Stop.

824
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,070
This is your card.

825
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,180
Nope.

826
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,680
Sorry, Hickey.

827
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,480
This is your card.

828
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,760
The French lady is coming.

829
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,600
Bon jour, Catherine.

830
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,160
Bon jour.

831
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,300
Thank you.

832
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,510
Thank you all.

833
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:06,380
Allez.

834
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,380
Joyeux Noel.

835
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,510
Merci.

836
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,640
Merci.

837
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,100
Frhliche Weihnacht.

838
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,500
Frhliche...

839
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,770
Deacon!

840
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,800
Where is he?

841
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,140
Where's the Kraut, Deacon?

842
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,120
You let him go.
You let him go!

843
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:49,080
No, no, Deacon!

844
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,140
Off, off!

845
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,520
Let's go, right now!

846
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:55,120
Hey, who had watch, Gould?

847
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,250
Who had watch?!

848
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:58,320
I did.

849
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,920
But I fell asleep.

850
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,900
Then Deacon
didn't let anybody go.

851
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,920
Yes, I did.

852
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:08,400
What?

853
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,410
Come on,
what'd you wanna do, Gundy?

854
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,530
Take him with us?

855
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,140
No, I wanted to shoot him,
remember?!

856
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,580
What where you thinking?

857
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:22,210
I made a trade.

858
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,220
Rudy told me that the weather's

859
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,120
pretty much shut down
all movement on either side.

860
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,380
And that Manhay is in the middle

861
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,750
of some of the heaviest
fighting right now,

862
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:29,990
so we wouldn't be able to get

863
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,220
Winley through anyway.

864
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,560
But he also said
that an unknown number

865
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,060
of Germans are making a push toward

866
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,690
this little town, Longin.

867
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,030
That's less
than six kilometers away.

868
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,160
Right.

869
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,070
Those are our nearest boys.

870
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,100
I think we can make it
through to them.

871
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,200
Yeah, sure.

872
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,180
Through a fully armed Kraut division.

873
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:51,770
We sneak through.

874
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,190
I like it.

875
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,280
I don't love it, but I like it.

876
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,420
And with our full arsenal of
two pistols and a bolt-action.

877
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,050
Kendrick...

878
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,220
you check the back of that rig?

879
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,260
It's not much,
but we gotta make it count.

880
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,540
It's outta gas.
The tank's empty.

881
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,540
All right.

882
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:22,030
Run it as far as you can
on fumes and then ditch it.

883
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,770
Take some grenades.

884
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,920
What kind of name is Oberon?

885
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,990
It's from Shakespeare.

886
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,260
You ever heard of him?

887
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,890
Yeah.

888
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,300
What kind of a name is Shirl?

889
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:51,070
It's short for Shirley.

890
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:53,100
Shirley.

891
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,870
Yes, Shirley.

892
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,900
Don't get me wrong--

893
01:04:57,950 --> 01:04:59,470
I love the name Shirley.

894
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,750
In fact, it's my mother's name.

895
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,220
You trying to get us killed?

896
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,250
Is that what you think?

897
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:11,320
Marching through enemy lines--

898
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,620
there's no danger there.

899
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,330
Yeah, well, it seems like
the right thing to do.

900
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,920
We die trying.

901
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:19,160
Yeah, maybe.

902
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,430
Of course, if someone killed

903
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,830
a bunch of innocent
women and children

904
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:24,430
this might be a real great way
to make up for it, right?

905
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,140
Is that what your
little Bible tells you?

906
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,270
Huh?

907
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:30,470
Is this your penance?

908
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,680
You know what?

909
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:37,420
Here.

910
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:38,610
What?

911
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:41,450
Take it.
I can get another one.

912
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:43,520
I don't want your book.

913
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,490
Really?

914
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,000
'Cause with all your questions,
you seem awful curious.

915
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,900
Get back in formation.

916
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,610
Let's take 'em.

917
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:10,850
Or not.

918
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:12,250
We lay low,

919
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,350
keep moving.

920
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,590
That's good thinking, Kendrick.

921
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,350
What are we,
about a mile from Longin?

922
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:21,260
Sounds about right.

923
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,660
All right, sun's starting
to peek through.

924
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,130
Let's go, boys.

925
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,650
How you doing?

926
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,480
All right.

927
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:47,090
You know, this really is
beautiful country.

928
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,290
Yeah, I knew you liked her.

929
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,920
I think I want to learn French.

930
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,570
Gunderson!

931
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,100
No!

932
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:15,110
Stay with me, Gundy.

933
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:16,710
Gundy!

934
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,880
Gundy, I'm comin'.

935
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,660
Breathe, breathe!

936
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:25,660
No...

937
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:26,660
Help him!

938
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,660
He's dead.

939
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,660
No, he's not.

940
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,470
Deac--

941
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,900
He can't...

942
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:38,130
Look...he's gone.

943
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,870
Come on, we've gotta go.

944
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,810
We've gotta go--now.

945
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,040
All right, come on.

946
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,510
Come on.

947
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,520
Come on.

948
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,160
C'mon, Winsley, let's go.

949
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,130
I can't.

950
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:19,840
Kendrick, go see if we're
still being followed.

951
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,850
Go to hell, Gould.

952
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,850
Now!

953
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,080
You go!

954
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,880
Or you too worried
about saving your own skin?

955
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,910
I'll go.

956
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,620
No, you're not going anywhere.

957
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:28,850
Deacon!

958
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:30,360
Deac!

959
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,510
They're still all over the place.

960
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:56,750
What do we do now?

961
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,010
We're gonna get shot out here.

962
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,210
We need to find a place
I can work on him.

963
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,350
Can he move?

964
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,380
Yes.
Yes, I can move.

965
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,950
All right, follow me.

966
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,460
Deacon.

967
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,470
Huh?

968
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,400
I need your help.

969
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,630
Put your fingers in here--

970
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:19,900
when I open the wound,

971
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,140
push the muscle aside.

972
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,800
Don't scream.

973
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,210
Okay.

974
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,110
It's all right.

975
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,380
Doing all right, doing good.

976
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,450
Open it a little further.

977
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:31,450
I'm trying.

978
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,080
I got it.

979
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,950
Come on. Almost done.

980
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:38,720
I got it.

981
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,490
Ugh. That's it.

982
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:42,090
All right, I got it.
You're gonna be fine.

983
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,430
Hold still, hold still.

984
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,760
Hang in there, Winley.

985
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,790
You're not gonna bleed to death.

986
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,930
We'll take you to an aid station.

987
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:50,000
Shhh!

988
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,440
Krauts.

989
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,130
Let's go!

990
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,130
Here.

991
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,260
Heads up!

992
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,790
Come on! Move!

993
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,900
Come on!

994
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:26,130
Triples on the right flank!

995
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,180
I've got it!

996
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:07,040
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

997
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,450
Kesndrick, get Winley outta here!

998
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,390
Yeah, go!

999
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,220
All right, ready?

1000
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,980
Move, move!

1001
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:29,170
Grenade! Move, move, move!

1002
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,180
C'mon!

1003
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,550
Come on.

1004
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:45,080
I got him.

1005
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,860
Stay with me, stay with me.

1006
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,030
We're gonna make it.

1007
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,400
We're gonna make it.

1008
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,240
Shhh...

1009
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,880
Get out. Go.

1010
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,910
Fire in the hole.

1011
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,870
Come on, Hickey. Hang on.

1012
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:43,640
Gould will be here in a second.

1013
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,650
Just hang on.

1014
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,940
Help...

1015
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,680
Just hang on, hang on!

1016
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:27,820
I'm sorry.

1017
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,350
Go!

1018
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,680
Where are they?

1019
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,150
Right there.

1020
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:05,890
Winley!

1021
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,640
Winley!

1022
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:25,010
Where is he?

1023
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,250
There.

1024
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,340
Winley! Winley!

1025
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:31,370
Winley!

1026
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,680
Winley! Come on.

1027
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:39,090
Winley. Winley, hang on.

1028
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,060
Winley, come on.

1029
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,460
Say something!

1030
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,730
Right here.

1031
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:57,370
I can't swim.

1032
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,970
Is that your big secret?

1033
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:02,780
Where's Kendrick?

1034
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,510
Kendrick's dead.

1035
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:00,940
We gotta get these clothes off of him.

1036
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,580
So what now?

1037
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,310
I don't know.

1038
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:11,680
How's your German?

1039
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:31,530
All right.

1040
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:34,010
The German line's about
a half mile up that way.

1041
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,530
This road will take us
straight through the clearing.

1042
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,710
Our boys are dug in on the other side.

1043
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:40,870
We ready?

1044
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,540
We get Winley through...

1045
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,820
save some lives.

1046
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:49,920
That's the idea.

1047
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,930
I hid.

1048
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,920
I didn't sign up.

1049
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,630
I tried to dodge the draft.

1050
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:02,070
But my father came and found me.

1051
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,370
Is that your big secret?

1052
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:09,210
Huh.

1053
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,400
Did you get that, Winley?

1054
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:34,470
Gould, cover up those weapons.

1055
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:39,160
All right, Winley.
Look sick.

1056
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:31,060
Hang on.

1057
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:35,920
Go! Go! Go!

1058
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:44,100
What's going on?

1059
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,300
I can't tell.

1060
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:48,670
I think they're trying to make a push.

1061
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,280
There's a jeep coming
from right over there.

1062
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,550
Better get the Sarge on the radio.

1063
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:59,180
Let me see.

1064
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,990
Foxtrot 2-9er calling Foxtrot 0-2.

1065
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:07,790
We got a jeep coming
from out of nowhere. Over.

1066
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:09,520
Out.

1067
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,900
That's one of our jeeps.

1068
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:14,530
But that's a Gerry flag on the hood.

1069
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,660
What are they trying to do?

1070
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,670
I don't know what you
got in mind, Gerry.

1071
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:20,500
But it ain't gonna happen.

1072
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:21,700
The flag! Now!

1073
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,110
Get it!

1074
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:28,110
Hang on a second!

1075
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,180
American!

1076
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:33,350
What is it?

1077
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,080
We got two Krauts coming in,
right there.

1078
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,740
You okay?

1079
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,420
They're shooting at each other.

1080
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,450
You know what,
I think the boys are ours.

1081
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,660
Let's give them some cover fire.

1082
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,990
Cover fire!

1083
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:17,500
Into the trees, on me.

1084
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,310
I'm out! I'm out!

1085
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:30,640
You take Winley and go,
and I'll cover you.

1086
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:33,640
No, I'm not going to leave you!

1087
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,650
You go now!

1088
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,670
No!

1089
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,180
I'll be right behind you.

1090
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:52,870
You saved my life.

1091
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:56,400
Be at peace, Deacon.
