'Cause I thought it was
a Colombian nickname.

482
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,020
No, I know. I'm kidding.
No, it's Arabic for "thankful."

483
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,770
Kim is American for "white lady."

484
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,322
(LAUGHS) Actually, "Kim"
means "who" in Turkish.

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,220
"Who's that white lady?"

491
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,180
You sit next to the only two women
in a country the size of Texas

that remind a man
that you're really only okay looking.

Well, she said you were an asshole,
but that's really above and beyond.

A lot of women find me very charming, Kim.

Mr. Ahmadzai,

603
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,380
I am a person of,

604
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,700
of no consequence.

605
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,060
Well, you soon might be

person in Afghanistan.

Mr. Ahmadzai,

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,220
I run a small department
inside the Interior Ministry.

609

What possible interest
could I be to the Americans?

- Kim Baker.
- KIM: Mmm-hmm.

615
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,220
When the Taliban was in power,

616
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,940
they enforced their version of sharia.

617
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,051
One of their edicts was a rule that all
men must shave the hair of their pubis.

618
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,900
They would walk the streets
carrying a small wooden rod,

619
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,660
a dowel,

620
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,020
which they would roll
along the front of a man's trousers.

621
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,364
If a man's pubic hair was long enough
to curl around the dowel,

622
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,723
they would beat him.

623
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,961
Now, I ask you,

624
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,380
do I look like a man to walk the streets

625
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,131
carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?

626
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,890
No, sir, you do not.

627
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,245
I returned to this country to save it.

628
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,580
I am a friend of America.

629

you, so people can understand that.

- Mount up!
- Jesus, Stern!

798
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,780
General, excuse me.
Hey. General, do you have a minute?

799
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,281
- Not now, Baker.
- It's just...

800
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,566
The Taliban haven't been
destroying the well here.

801
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,220
The women of the village
are destroying it.

802
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,970
Or so they tell me.

803
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,500
We dug that well several times
for the women

804
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,284
so they don't have to walk to the river.

805
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,100
But they want to walk to the river.

806
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,740
It's their only chance to be social

807
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,127
and gossip and, you know, hang out.

808
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,900
I think that they have a bunch
of old Soviet landmines,

809
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,163
and they just prop one up
and throw rocks at it.

810
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,607
Kim, did you ever feel like
you're manning that tollgate

811
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,564
and the engineer's yelling,
"I got pig iron, I got pig iron"?

812
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,220
No. I don't know what that means.
But it's very folksy.

813
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,500
Also, the women, obviously,
they don't want the men

814
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,140
to know about this, so they are hoping

815
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,820
that you would just refuse
to repair the well this time.

816
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,921
Well, they're in luck.

817
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,407
That's exactly what
I told the mullah, so...

818
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,605
Well done, Baker.

819
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,891
Hooyah, General.

820
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,500
Marines say "Oorah."

821
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,780
The Navy says "Hooyah."

822
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,882
- Don't mix those two up.
- Got it.

823
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,689

What the dick?

835
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,060
Why did Fahim tell me
I could dress like this?

836
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,660
Well, he didn't want you
to have to go buy something.

837

Oh, my God. I only washed
the front of my hair.

SHAKIRA: Here. You know what?

I'm going to let you have one of these.

It went all the way into his hair.

(TANYA LAUGHS)
We all have some reason for being here.

What's your reason?

Come on.

00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,005
I was at the gym after work
one night. Stationary bike.

857
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,300
Okay? The same bike every day.

858
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,060
And I notice this

859
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,810
indentation in the carpet,
it's, like, a foot in front of my bike.

860
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,928
And I realize that it's from
where my bike used to be.

861
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,527
I have done thousands
of miles on this bike

862
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,580
and I have gone backwards.

863
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,900
I have literally gone backwards.

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,206
I just

865
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,900
wanted to blow everything up.
I just wanted out of my job,

writing news scripts for
dumb pretty people to read.

867

I wanted... (LAUGHS)

868
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,260
...out of having to decide whether

869
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,603
I should just marry
my mildly depressive boyfriend.

- (LAUGHS) Let's go. Bullshit.

924

You know, Kim, the reason
that your village well story got traction is

925
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,766
because it wasn't a bang-bang,
it was about women's rights.

926

It was a brilliant piece, that.

No, too dangerous.

931

No way. It's a wee bit
fluid down there these days,

security-wise.

933

Yeah, it might
be a bit much for you, eh, Nic?

You're a bit late to the whole

936
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,740
What about the woman thing
where the sharia law is back?

937
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,460
And there was a firebombing
there the other day.

938
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,580
Yeah, I think it's worth the risk.

939
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,380
Iain, that's easy for you to say, mate,

photos of the fucking garden.

I know you've been specially trained

to protect New Zealand from,
what, fucking dolphins?

943

But I'm not exactly
a war zone virgin, you know?

944
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,620
I was kidnapped by the AIG
when they were still called that.

945
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,165
Why dolphins?

946
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,340
What do dolphins got to do
with New Zealand?

947
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,380
Nothing to do with it. I'm just...

948
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,620
White pointers and sharks,

949
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,767
but the dolphins never hurt anyone.

950
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,260
I know they've not hurt anyone, mate.
I'm just making the point...

951
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,580
I'm not gonna protect my country

952
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,420
from an animal that hasn't hurt anyone.

953
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,726
Oh, Jesus Christ.

954
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,700
Dolphins? What a joke.

That's just wrong,

I'm just saying,

1484
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,180
as journalists, we have
an obligation to this story.

1485
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,820
And Afghanistan should be
on our air more, period.

1486
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,580
With the resources we have over there,

1487
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,140
Afghanistan should
definitely be on our air more.

1488
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,370
But the problem is,
as much as everyone loves the troops,

1489
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,860
they don't actually want to watch
them on the news anymore.

They just don't.

So I can't give Afghanistan more air.

The whole point of kidnapping
is to get money, right?

01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,460
Because I think
there's plenty of good work

1746
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,980
to be done in the real world,

1747
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,128
and the Kabubble is well-established.

1748
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,820
Is this about me going
to Badakhshan without you?

1749
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,460
'Cause you would have done
exactly the same thing.

1750
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,767
- And, hey, what, I forgive you!
- (KIM SCOFFS)

1751
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,204
This is not about you.

1752
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,940
It's not about Badakhshan, or Glasgow,

1753
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,963
or the cottage with the chickens.

1754
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,206
What chickens?

1755
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,129
It's okay. I know you're not gonna come.

1756
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,363
I just have to get out of here
before it's too late.

1757
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,365
What do you mean?

1758
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,602
I started to feel like this was normal.

1759
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,523
You know it's not, right?

1760
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,490
Come to New York and get it.

1761
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,604
Remember, you're like a six in Manhattan.

1762

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1763
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,205
How's your baby?

1764
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,200
Which one?

1765
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,723
- You have two?
- Yes.

1766
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,723
- Irish twins.
- (LAUGHS)

1767
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,260
No, they are very good.

1768
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,125
The younger one, the boy,
he's very strong.

1769
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,520
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1770
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,860
I bet the girl is strong, too.

1771
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,325
She's stronger.

1772
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,330
So, um,

1773
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,321
those men in the hospital, the addicts...

1774
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,060
Any of them ever get better?

1775
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,845
Have a happy ending?

1776
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,444
In my culture, we would hug. (CHUCKLES)

Hey.

COUGHLIN: You know, I miss it. The Stan.

1780
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,420
KIM: Yeah, I miss it, too.

1781
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,602
Actually, I tried to go back

1782
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,290
but even the Army wouldn't take me.

1783
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,980
I mean, the Army!
I mean, that's just hurtful.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1785
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:54,020
Well, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

1786
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,940
So if there's anything
that you want to say to me,

1787
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,041
that's why I'm here.

1788
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,050
That's why I came here.

1789

Ma'am,

1790
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,807
I lost my legs because of an IED,
not because of you.

1791
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,220
I appreciate that,
but if I hadn't quoted you,

1792
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,641
- you wouldn't have been transferred.
- (LAUGHS)

1793
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,500
No, really, you can say
whatever you want to me.

1794
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,620
That's why I'm here.

1795
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,020
Okay, well, then let's say you're right.

1796
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,201
It's still not 'cause of you, ma'am.

1797
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,820
Some 12-year-old haji
had to plant that bomb.

1798
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,700
And, hell, you know,
if Bin Laden's parents

1799
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,060
hadn't have gotten divorced,

1800
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:31,084
maybe none of us would've been
in the Stan to begin with.

1801
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,540
And the Taliban, they wouldn't
have even been there for UBL

1802
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,260
if Brezhnev hadn't have gone
and fouled up Afghanistan

in the first place.

Okay, I deserve that.

01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,100
good or bad.

1812
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,340
If you didn't learn that in Afghanistan,
you were not paying attention.

1813
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,660
So, you're not gonna yell at me?

1814

way too much credit.

you move the fuck forward.

yet another benchmark for preparedness.

How do you think that will
affect our draw down in the region?

There needs to be a revision to the

Nope. Just sit up, smile.
