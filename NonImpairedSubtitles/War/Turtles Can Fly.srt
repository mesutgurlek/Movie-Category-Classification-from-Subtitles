Kurdistan, Iraq - Turkish border

2
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,279
A fewweeks before the US-Iraq war.

00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:27,806

5
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:19,604
Pashow, tell my dad
to turn the antenna to the right!

6
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,243
Esmaeel, to the right, the right!

7
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:27,000
Your son says to the right.

8
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:31,642
Pashow, tell my dad
to turn it to the left!

9
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,005
Ali, to the left, to the left!

10
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,236
It has noises.

11
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,285
There"s no image.

12
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:41,520
Look what Saddam has done to us!

13
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:44,918
We have no water, no electricity,
and no schools.

14
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:50,036
They have deprived us from the sky.

15
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:54,917
They don"t let our TVs work to see
when the war will start.

16
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:12,842
Is it you Satellite?

17
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,765
Hey, is it you Satellite?

18
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:17,962
Yes, what is it?

19
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,358
I need some rope.

20
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,199
Come back tomorrow!

21
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:25,484
- I need it now.
- I said tomorrow!

22
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,678
I said I need it now.

23
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:33,558
All right, fine!

24
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:36,840
Howmuch do you want?

25
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:40,716
3 meters! I said 3 meters.

26
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,843
Pashow!

27
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:45,762
Satellite, come here for a minute!

28
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:52,321
My name is Soran.
Everyone calls me Satellite.

29
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:53,761
Sit down!

30
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:59,804
I knowthis girl.
She is from Halabcheh.

31
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,764
Halabcheh?! Howdo you know?

32
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:05,840
I know! Her parents were killed.
They came to the village yesterday.

33
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:09,477
They want to go to the border
with the rest ofthe refugees.

34
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:13,162
She has a brother who went
on the mines. He lost his arms.

35
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:16,797
He hit Abdolrahman with his head.

36
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:21,483
His nose started to bleed.
He hit him like this.

37
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:25,083
- Don"t tell anyone!
- Okay.

38
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,040
Why didn"t you give me the rope?

39
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:36,804
Only 2 or 3 meters was left.
L"II give you more later.

40
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:40,243
- Howmuch shall I pay?
- No! Don"t even mention the money.

41
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:42,796
- But I have to pay.
- No! See you later!

42
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,195
Thank you!

43
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:48,199
Come to me if you need anything!

44
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,924
Hey, what are you doing?

45
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,927
Why aren"t you turning
the antenna? Turn it!

46
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,558
Esmaeel, l"m tired.

47
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,241
You can"t get pictures
with this antenna.

48
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:03,479
I swearyou won"t ever get pictures
in this village with this antenna.

49
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:06,639
I said you should buy a satellite.
A satellite!

50
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:13,005
The village governor says
the satellite is prohibited.

51
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:18,002
Don"t say that! The sexy and dance
channels are prohibited, not the news.

52
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:21,557
I installed satellites
for all the villages around here.

53
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,160
Do you know"Sargolli" village?

54
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,399
Withjust 20 families,
they bought a satellite!

55
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:29,001
- They did?
- Yes!

56
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,562
How strange!

57
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:34,037
You are 70 families here,
why don"t you buy one?

58
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,323
It"s bad foryour reputation!

59
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:39,604
But we are only 30 families. Just 30!

60
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,480
What about the houses on that side?

61
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:45,162
Nowthey are in Turkey.

62
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:49,161
They have separated us. They won"t
let them pay forthe satellite.

63
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:53,002
Your wife was from that side.

64
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,565
Nowyou"re strangers?

65
00:05:56,727 --> 00:06:01,164
They have separated us.

66
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:22,725
Not long nowbefore USA comes!

67
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:24,522
What"s USA?

68
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,482
USA means America.

69
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,605
Have you seen the movie Titanic?

70
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:35,604
Titanic, Washington, San Francisco,
Bruce Lee, Zinedine Zidane.

71
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,083
Zeinedin Zeidan is not American.

72
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,397
He is not American.

73
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,196
He"s French and a Muslim.
I knowhim well.

74
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,000
- Hello!
- Hello!

75
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,204
- Where is this car going?
- It"s going to Arbil.

76
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:08,758
Let"s go!

77
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:18,918
Are you an Iranian Kurd?

78
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:22,363
Yes! I am an Iranian Kurd,
and a doctor.

79
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,242
Why have you come to Iraq
in this chaos?

80
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:28,604
This is the fourth time l"ve come.

81
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,998
I come, I go. I come, I go.

82
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,204
L"m looking for an orphan.

83
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:40,042
I think he"s from Arbil.
He"s driven me nuts.

84
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:46,565
I don"t knowwhere to find him.

85
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:51,836
I knowhim.
I know as well too doctor.

86
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:53,885
What?

87
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,880
Howdo you knowme?

88
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:01,043
We were sitting in the same car
a fewmonths ago.

89
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:07,920
You were going to Solaymaneyeh
from Kirkuk, looking forthe orphan.

90
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:11,157
Exactly!

91
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,082
Howdo you knowhim?

92
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,519
You"re looking forthe boy,
who makes predications, right?

93
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,646
Yes, do you have news ofhim?

94
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,843
I do and I don"t,"I don"t know."

95
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,966
- What does "I don"t know" mean?
- It"s chaos everywhere.

96
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,116
"I don"t know" means I have no idea.

97
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,120
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No, I knowhim.

98
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,960
Don"t listen to this boy!
It"s all lies.

99
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,559
That boy is very important.
He makes predictions.

100
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,957
These days money is in the news.

101
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,561
My God!
Have you come from Iran forthat?

102
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:55,764
What are you saying?

103
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:59,238
War! The world is at war.
Everybody"s after news.

104
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,035
The boy is lying!

105
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:05,644
Buy a satellite to get the news.

106
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:08,002
A satellite? What for?

107
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:12,366
It"s all lies. They lie
and fill their pockets.

108
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,400
Stop!

109
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:17,961
Stop!

110
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,800
Pashow, who gave them permission
to come here?

111
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:22,683
I don"t know.

112
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,680
Tell them to go to Karim"s land!
Hurry up!

113
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:29,442
- Shouldn"t I come with you?
- Hurry!

114
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,885
Hurry up!

115
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,686
Wait here!

116
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,521
Hello!

117
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,166
Hello!

118
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:35,161
L"ve come with them from "Kanibo"
to buy a satellite dish.

119
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,557
It"s too expensive.
You can"t buy one.

120
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:38,842
Howmuch is it?

121
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:44,165
2000, 2500 Dinars.
Maybe I can give you some discount.

122
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:49,486
- Don"t you have any cheaper ones?
- It"s war; it"s the end ofthe world.

123
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,239
If you don"t have money,
don"t buy it.

124
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,599
I have a fewradios.
Can we exchange?

125
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,325
Radios?

126
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,884
Radios have no value any more.

127
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:03,561
Only cash for satellites.

128
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:06,840
Can we can give you some radios
and pay halfin cash?

129
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:07,564
What?

130
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,002
Half ofit in radios
and half ofit in cash.

131
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,727
Okay, howmany radios
do you have?

132
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,115
15.

133
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,598
- Howmuch cash?
- 500.

134
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:18,439
Put those on the table!

135
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,598
Okay take the dish!

136
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,121
"Hello Mr.!"

137
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:20,839
"How are you?"

138
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:29,039
Hello, satellite!
Have you seen these mines?

139
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,356
Who found them?

140
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:33,041
The armless boy
who hit Abdol Rahman in the face.

141
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,562
Didn"t I tell you to work
on Karim"s land?

142
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:39,845
The boy didn"t let us go there.
He told us to work on this field.

143
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,998
It"s full of mines.

144
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,204
I don"t knowhowhe found out.
It"s unbelievable!

145
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:46,766
All ofthis is my work.

146
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:49,566
I did the work of 3 days in one day.

147
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:52,396
I told you only
to collect American mines.

148
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,718
He said there is no difference
between Italian and American mines.

149
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:58,606
He said anybody
who says the opposite is a liar.

150
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,957
Liar? He called me a liar?
Where is he?

151
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:04,317
He is there!

152
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:05,237
Where?

153
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,079
There! Up there!

154
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:09,843
Hey, you! Come down!

155
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,402
Hey, come down!
Why don"t you come down?

156
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,324
This place is full of mines.

157
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,120
Did you call me a liar?

158
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:25,359
Howdare you talk like that?

159
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,006
Come down here if you"re a man!

160
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,886
Nobody has ever called me a liar.

161
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:34,885
Look at that filth!
The armless boy calls me a liar.

162
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:37,435
Do you understand?

163
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:42,557
L"m talking to you.

164
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,564
You are the liar.

165
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,682
Can"t you hear me? Are you deaf?

166
00:13:55,207 --> 00:14:00,327
If you call me a liar again,
l"II give you a good beating!

167
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,677
I knowyou well.
I won"t say anything...

168
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,078
because of your sister.

169
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:09,883
Do you get it?

170
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:16,283
Don"t go, Hengov!

171
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,567
- Are you talking to me?
- I knowyou well.

172
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:23,198
- I said are you talking to me?
- Yes, to you!

173
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,806
Satellite!

174
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,566
What happened, Satellite?

175
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,244
Blood! Blood!
Move out ofthe way!

176
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:45,924
Did youjust hit me?
Come back!

177
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:49,318
Look at him! He doesn"t dare stop.

178
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,800
L"II forgive you foryour sister.
It better be your last time.

179
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,882
Stop if you dare!

180
00:14:56,047 --> 00:15:01,485
L"II cut offboth your legs too.

181
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:07,883
Bring it! Bring it!

182
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,163
"Come on! Come on!"

183
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,319
This way!

184
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,967
Esmaeel, l"ve brought you
my antenna.

185
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:20,199
You won"t find another one like this
anywhere else in the world.

186
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,722
Don"t lie so much!

187
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:26,086
Didn"t we buy it together in Arbil?

188
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,161
Bring it!

189
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,484
Be careful with it!

190
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,726
Be careful! Watch your hands!

191
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:12,757
Go down by the count of 3!
"One, two, three!"

192
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,798
Shirkooh, you go down too!

193
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:26,847
Satellite!
What does "Come on" mean?

194
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:30,517
"Come on!" means go down.
Hurry up!

195
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,121
- Hello!
- Hello!

We"ve come to see war news.

197
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:41,559
What do the foreign channels say?

198
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:46,125
There"s no news, nothing.
Go back to your homes!

199
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,678
There"s no need for all of you
to come here.

200
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:51,758
Go back to yourtents!

201
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,283

202
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:59,001

205
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:08,280
You don"t have to worry
while l"m here.

206
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,322
Hello! Who are they?

207
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:42,241
They are the elders ofthe village
and the governor is here.

208
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:47,116
They want to see the news.

209
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,885
Don"t showthe prohibited channels!

210
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:56,485
Okay! Who told you to touch it?
Go to the mosque!

211
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:59,845
- What for?
- Bring the mosque microphone.

212
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,044
- What ifthe governor doesn"t accept?
- The governor is here himself.

213
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,599
Hurry up!

214
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,285
Okay! I have to go now.

215
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:30,564
Where to?

216
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:36,885
Tell us what it"s saying!
We don"t understand.

217
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:41,524
My job was to install the dish,
which I did.

218
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,042
I have to go now. I did my job.

219
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,437
L"m responsible
forthe village children.

220
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,359
I have to make
income forthem.

221
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,200
L"II give you money.
L"II give you accommodation.

222
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:54,120
- Accommodation? You won"t.
- I will.

223
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,720
No, you won"t.

224
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:58,685
Last time you promised
but you didn"t.

225
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,917
I will. Come and sit down!

226
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,806
We will help you.

227
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:19,880
I told you not to show
the prohibited channels. Change it!

228
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:23,882
Don"t hit me! L"m looking for
a news channel.

229
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,480
Change it! Change it!

230
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,717
It"s prohibited!

231
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:45,598
Here is Mr. Bush, Esmaeel!
The world is in his hands!

232
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:47,920
I know! I know!

233
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,125
The world is in his hands.

234
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:54,880
What is this Bush saying?

235
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,679
Let the teacher come and tell you.
It"s not my job.

236
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:06,363
- He doesn"t know anything!
- The teacher doesn"t know anything?

237
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:13,365
I sawhim write 28 letters in English
to Mr. Bush with my own eyes.

238
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,355
Try to understand!

239
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:20,603
Try your best! Tell us
what they are saying.

240
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:27,076
He says it will rain tomorrow.

241
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:30,038
What has it got to do with rain?

242
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:37,560
He keeps saying
it will rain tomorrow!

243
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:38,682
What"s the relationship?

244
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:42,044
- I think it"s a code!
- What code?

245
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:45,485
Here Satellite!
The mosque microphone!

246
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:47,444
Go! L"II come in a minute.

247
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:57,325
Here is Saddam! L"m done here.
You understand Arabic.

248
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:02,522
Where are you going?
We need you.

249
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,281
All the village children are waiting
for me. I have to go.

250
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:10,362
Come back forthe news tonight!
I want to know about the war.

251
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,358
All right! We"II see.

252
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,401
Riga?

253
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:40,604
Agrin, where"s Riga?

254
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:46,198
- I don"t know.
- What do you mean you don"t know?

255
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,881
What"s this child doing here?

256
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:30,159
- Whose child are you?
- Why are you crying?

257
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:34,007
What"s your name?

258
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:41,680
I think it"s the brother
ofthe girl from Halabcheh.

259
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,000
Don"t cry! Don"t cry!

260
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:52,078
Look! I scared him. He"s gone.

261
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,999
- Howmany is this?
- Leave him alone! He can"t see.

262
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:03,845
Look what l"m doing
with the Turk soldier.

263
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,922
Hey, Effendi!

264
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:16,836
Hey Mr.! Are you fine?

265
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:19,965
Do you want us to start a war?

266
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:36,602
Hey, let"s go before he kills us.

267
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,840
We didn"t want to harm your brother.

268
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:56,165
He was standing at the border
and he was crying.

269
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,156
He could"ve got killed.

270
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:05,445
Lfit weren"t for Satellite
your brother would be dead.

271
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:15,765
My bike!

272
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,557
What are you doing here?
Where"s my bike?

273
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:36,556
I sawyour bike here.
I waited foryou but you didn"t come.

274
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:40,640
Then Esmaeel came
and asked where you were.

275
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:44,277
I told him I didn"t know.
He wanted to take your bike with him.

276
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:48,440
I told him not to.
He said he would. I said no.

277
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:52,043
Again he said he would.
I told him I won"t let him.

278
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:56,359
He slapped me on both cheeks,
like this and took the bike.

279
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,319
Why did you let him?

280
00:24:58,487 --> 00:25:02,685
He said Satellite must come
and translate the news for us.

281
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:05,645
Howdare he take my chastity?

282
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:07,560
Pashow, go with him!

283
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:12,323
Tell him I can"t translate
during the day,

284
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,526
maybe a little at night.

285
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,406
L"II go from this village.

286
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:20,127
Tell him all the villages
in the region want me.

287
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:24,917
Lfhe doesn"t bring my bike back,
l"II leave this village with the dish.

288
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:29,479
Lfthey don"t return the bike,
l"II leave now. Go, tell him!

289
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:41,275
Bring it up! Watch the mud!
Followme!

290
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:43,722
Esmaeel sent his regards.

291
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:47,721
He said don"t leave. He said
whatever Satellite says is fine.

292
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:51,764
Where are the kids?

293
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,885
They are collecting mines
with the armless boy.

294
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:56,366
With him?

295
00:25:56,527 --> 00:26:00,236
Those who work for me
aren"t allowed to work with him.

296
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:04,366
I won"t buy mines today, understand?

297
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:08,760
Those who want to work with me
must come to the shell field tomorrow.

298
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:13,079
Goodbye foreverto those
who don"t work with me!

299
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,726
Why are you crying again?

300
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:20,202
I went afteryour bike with them.

301
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:27,284
Esmaeel called me
and slapped me again twice, like this.

302
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:32,363
I asked why he hit me. He said
it was my ration fortomorrow!

303
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,962
Come on! Bring me down!

304
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,878
Go to your home kids!

305
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:46,756
We"II go to the shell field tomorrow!

306
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:11,365
Come and sit here!

307
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,640
Watch your child!

308
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:40,877
I will only give 10 Dinars to those
who want to work today.

309
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:22,599
Daddy!

310
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:41,682
Daddy!

311
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,358
Mummy!

312
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,846
Satellite!

313
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,005
Yes! What is it?

314
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:39,201
The armless boy said something will
happen to those working in that truck.

315
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:41,562
- Who said this?
- The armless boy.

316
00:30:41,727 --> 00:30:43,399
- Which truck?
- That one!

317
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:46,441
I swear I heard it with my own ears.

318
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:51,601
He left with his brother and sister.

319
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,486
Kids, Kids, listen to me!

320
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,957
Those working in that truck,
evacuate the place immediately.

321
00:31:10,127 --> 00:31:12,197
Quickly! Something may explode!

322
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:15,838
Satellite!
Not all ofthem are our boys.

323
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:20,159
It"s doesn"t matter. Everyone get
off! Aren"t you getting off?

324
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:22,887
My kids get off now! Hurry up!

325
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,885
Hold my bike!

326
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,795
Hey you! Wait!

327
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:57,636
Hey! Don"t you know someone
like yourself who has no arms?

328
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:01,044
And who can tell the future?

329
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:08,038
You don"t? You knowit"s you.
I won"t tell anyone.

330
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:13,641
Make some predications for us!

331
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,846
Slowly, slowly!

332
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:01,596
Listen! Use this mask
when you see white smoke.

333
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:04,486
Don"t use it for black smoke!

334
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:08,526
It"s only for smoke smelling of
garlic and grass.

335
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:13,159
There is a mask for every family.

336
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:19,482
Those who don"t have masks
must go under water or in the river...

337
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,566
...during a chemical attack.

338
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:25,480
If you don"t find water,
go to high places.

339
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:28,639
Look at this boy
to learn howto use it!

340
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,562
Listen, war doesn"t warn ofits
coming.

341
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:37,243
Bombardment could start any time.

342
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:41,646
Put the mask on like this

343
00:33:44,847 --> 00:33:46,758
and pull it down overyourface.

344
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:57,361
Come! Don"t you want a mask?

345
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:59,438
Shirkooh, come here!

346
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,559
Yes, Satellite! At your service!

347
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:06,524
Give this mask to that girl!

348
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:10,761
Tell her l"II find a smaller mask
for her brother.

349
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,161
Hello!

350
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:21,766
Satellite has sent this mask foryou.

351
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:25,044
He said he would find one
foryour brother.

352
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,163
Out ofthe way!

353
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:29,364
Sorry! It"s Satellite"s orders!

354
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:32,996
Goodbye!

355
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:38,476
He said he will definitely find one
foryour brothertoo.

356
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:46,842
This way! This way! That"s fine!

357
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:49,966
Nowgo down!

358
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,445
This is the house I promised you.

359
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:09,886
Today we have many customers.
OK, relax!

360
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:14,122
I am talking to the refugee children,
not the village children.

361
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:18,599
Today you will clear
Aziz"s field from mines.

362
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:22,243
Wait there
until my representative arrives!

363
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:25,440
- Where are you going?
- To Aziz"s field!

364
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,844
- OK!
- OK!

365
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:31,245
You can go
and gatherthe mines there.

366
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:35,195
If anybody makes trouble,
l"II deal with him.

367
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:38,518
L"II count to three.
"One! Two!" Go!

368
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:42,357
Get out! Get out!

369
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:54,005
Now, you come with me
to see the Mr.

370
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:57,240
Wait here! L"II go and bargain.

371
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:03,638
L"II try to sell the mines
at the best price. Let"s go!

372
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,603
"Hello, Mr.! How are you?"

373
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,716
Why don"t you speak properly?

374
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:26,798
What was that, Ahmad?

375
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,919
There"s money in "Hello" these days.

376
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,123
Lfl don"t say hello,
no one answers back.

377
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,686
Do you see these boys?

378
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,403
They don"t knowyou"re Kurd.
They think you"re a foreigner.

379
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,046
The Americans are coming.

380
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:42,437
Learn 2 "OKs" and all will be fine.

381
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:48,362
"OK, Mr.! Howmuch mine?"

382
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:50,199
Howmuch forthe mines today?

383
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,922
- Howmany have you got?
- 96.

384
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:58,002
You used to bring 10 or 15.
What"s happened?

385
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:00,643
Don"t think about that!
Howmuch?

386
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,363
22 Dinars and not a Fals more.

387
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:07,478
What? 22 Dinars?
Are you pulling my leg?

388
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:09,365
You paid more before.

389
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:15,515
You think I don"t knowthat you sell
them to UN for 2200 Dinars each?

390
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:18,842
I even knowhowmuch they get for it.

391
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:22,283
Even their dogs make 50 times more
than our children do!

392
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:25,678
And they give them
a can of food to eat as well!

393
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:28,646
You can help our kids as a Kurd.

394
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,959
Are you kidding me?
I don"t care if you sell or not.

395
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:36,437
Go and sell them to the Mr. Yourself.

396
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:38,758
Give me a higher price, OK!

397
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:44,479
OK! L"II try. Nowgo!

398
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:48,761
"Thank you very much Mr.!!"

399
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,281
Come down! Come down!

400
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:56,715
OK! OK! I arranged everything.

401
00:38:56,887 --> 00:39:00,402
It was hard work fixing things up.

402
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,483
What would you do without me?!

403
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:07,156
These people have come
afterthe children.

404
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:09,283
- Where are they?
- They"re waiting.

405
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:13,884
Hey, Satellite! What about our lands?
We"ve been waiting since morning.

406
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:16,322
Wait a minute!

407
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:22,318
I talked to him until he agreed.

408
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:25,843
Go back to your homes now!
Get your mines!

409
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:30,797
Then go to the Mr. With Pashow,
the guy who has a pony-tail!

410
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:35,802
When you get there, give him
the mines and get your money.

411
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:38,636
What about my land?

412
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,676
Howmany children do you want?

413
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:44,920
Send them all! It"s ten days
since the last mine collection.

414
00:39:45,247 --> 00:39:46,760
OK! OK!

415
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,918
You and you!

416
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:49,803
Me?

417
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:58,999
Take care of yourselves!

418
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,523
Half ofthem don"t have hands!

419
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:10,919
So what? They are not afraid of mines.
They are our best.

420
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:15,957
- Howmany do you want Karim?
- 50.

421
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:18,683
L"II send you 5.

422
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,076
You, you, you...

423
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:35,439
Satellite! The girl from Halabcheh!

424
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,038
Pashow, look afterthe children!
L"II be back soon.

425
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,765
Out ofthe way!

426
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,158
My cap! My cap!

427
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:26,277
Thank you!

428
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:28,358
L"m at your service.

429
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:33,920
Agrin today is a strange day for me.

430
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:35,566
Howdo you knowmy name?

431
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,605
That is beside the point.
Anyhow, today is important.

432
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:39,756
Why?

433
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:42,236
Why? Do you see this bike?

434
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:46,286
This is the first time I am carrying
water on it. And it"sjust foryou.

435
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:51,521
All the villages around here
take their brides home on this bike.

436
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,765
L"II take it myself.

437
00:41:57,927 --> 00:42:00,680
Don"t say that! I am at your service.

438
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:28,081
Any news of your brother?
Does he have any predictions for us?

439
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:29,202
No!

440
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,515
Nothing at all?

441
00:42:32,687 --> 00:42:36,236
- My brother doesn"t do it anymore.
- Why?

442
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:40,241
He made predictions twice
and it brought us bad luck twice.

443
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:44,400
What happened?
Don"t you want to tell me?

444
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:49,436
- Give it to me! L"II take it.
- I am at your service. Please!

445
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:53,080
- Is this a spring as well?
- Yes!

446
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:56,683
- Why don"t they take waterfrom here?
- L"m the only one who does.

447
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,166
Why?

448
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:03,276
The villagers say the water is impure.

449
00:43:03,607 --> 00:43:04,676
Why?

450
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:08,595
Last year, three children came here

451
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:11,804
to look for red fish
and never came up.

452
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,605
I think they drowned.

453
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:17,842
I swear I dived to the bottom.

454
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:21,477
I sawmany fish,

455
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:23,638
but no children.

456
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:25,725
- Is it very deep?
- Yes.

457
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:27,721
Are there red fish in it?

458
00:43:27,887 --> 00:43:30,355
Yes, I sawthem myself.

459
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,995
- Did you really see them?
- Don"t you believe me?

460
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:39,715
- Can you go to the bottom?
- Yes, l"II do it now.

461
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:58,436
Lfl ask you something
will you get upset?

462
00:43:58,607 --> 00:43:59,801
No!

463
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:04,196
As you"re from Halabcheh,
do you know someone like yourself

464
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,961
who doesn"t have anyone
in this world, like you or I?

465
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:11,599
It"s okay if she has two brothers!

466
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,284
Have you lost anyone?

467
00:44:14,447 --> 00:44:17,359
No, I haven"t lost anyone.
I have another point.

468
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:22,715
I have been looking for a girl
like you, foryears.

469
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,720
Where are you going?

470
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:29,920
Didn"t you want me to catch you fish?

471
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:32,603
L"II go now. Look!

472
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:17,365
Wait! Wait!

473
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:23,478
L"II catch red fish foryou!

474
00:45:34,887 --> 00:45:36,718
Are you awake?

475
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:48,643
I knowwhy you can"t sleep.

476
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:57,682
When are we leaving here?

477
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:02,001
Don"t you want to tell me?

478
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:07,683
Put the child in the middle
maybe we can sleep.

479
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:11,761
You won"t be able to sleep
unless you learn to like the child.

480
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:15,442
Howmany times do I have to tell you
he"s not my child.

481
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:20,677
Don"t say it isn"t!
You say such things...

482
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:23,202
The rope around his foot
opens mysteriously

483
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:24,800
and he walks in his sleep.

484
00:46:47,127 --> 00:46:52,645
Hengov, I have a toothache.

485
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:57,686
Are you still in pain? Is it bad?

486
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:01,398
Yes, it is painful.

487
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:32,526
Put some kerosene on it!

488
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:31,246
Don"t pull my hair!

489
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,557
I said let go of my hair.

490
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:38,561
Hey, why are you hitting the child?

491
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,920
Agrin, where did you take him?

492
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:48,686
I don"t know.

493
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:51,839
Howcome?
Why is his nose bleeding?

494
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:58,037
I don"t know. I can"t take care of
a bastard all night long!

495
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:02,879
What was that?
You said bastard again?

496
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:07,320
Lfhe is not a bastard,
then what is he?

497
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:11,765
Isn"t he the child ofthose who killed
ourfamily and did this to me?

498
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:15,359
Nowhe"s my child?

499
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:19,080
Come into my arms!

500
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:23,279
Don"t cry! Don"t cry!

501
00:52:25,447 --> 00:52:29,565
Cover him! Put the blanket on him!

502
00:52:31,127 --> 00:52:34,119
- Where are you taking him?
- None of your business!

503
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:17,958
Wait! Wait!

504
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:21,115
Where is this boy going?

505
00:53:21,647 --> 00:53:23,444
Come down! It is a good opportunity
to help him.

506
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:24,677
What about me?

507
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:27,281
Wait here until I come back!

508
00:54:50,847 --> 00:54:52,724
Agrin!

509
00:55:09,247 --> 00:55:10,600
Enough.

510
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:12,120
Leave her alone!

511
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:56,444
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

512
00:56:56,607 --> 00:56:59,485
The boy has made
an important prediction.

513
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:14,399
Out ofthe way.

514
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:18,045
Hello!

515
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:19,481
Attention! Attention!

516
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:20,716
Important notice

517
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:23,685
for the villagers of "Kanibo"!
For the refugees who live around here.

518
00:57:23,847 --> 00:57:26,600
<i>Everyone must climb the hill!</i>

519
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,166
The war will begin in a fewhours.

520
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:31,046
The war between
Iraq and America will start.

521
00:57:31,207 --> 00:57:32,276
Are you serious?

522
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:34,438
Yes! There will be war.
Save yourselves!

523
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:38,124
They didn"t say anything
on the news.

524
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:40,164
The satellite
will announce it now!

525
00:57:42,247 --> 00:57:44,556
<i>Climb the hill!</i>

526
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,764
<i>Stand as still as trees!</i>

527
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:27,641
What are you doing here?

528
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:29,525
Why aren"t you on the hill?

529
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:31,757
Like the others?

530
00:58:34,727 --> 00:58:38,845
I want to put my turtles in the water.

531
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:45,600
I hope this prediction is not a lie.

532
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:50,125
All the people are on the hill.
If you"ve lied, l"II lose face.

533
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:53,996
I told them it was true
and the war"s about to start.

534
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,722
I said the USA planes are coming.

535
00:58:57,087 --> 00:59:01,877
I lied that I had heard the news
on the satellite this morning.

536
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:13,001
I hope it is not ajoke.

537
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:44,400
I hear something.

538
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:46,958
I swear I do.

539
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,962
- It"s the sound ofit!
- What noise?

540
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:52,917
The noise of American passports!

541
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,638
Where are you?

542
00:59:57,967 --> 00:59:59,446
Only this much left to America!

543
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:13,684
Let"s go!

544
01:00:25,807 --> 01:00:27,718
Over here it"s written:

545
01:00:28,127 --> 01:00:31,358
"It"s the end ofinjustice,
misfortune and hardship."

546
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:36,757
"We are your best friends
and brothers."

547
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:41,443
"Those against us are our enemies."

548
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,916
"We will make this country a
paradise."

549
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:46,920
"We are here to take away
your sorrows."

550
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:53,322
"We are the best in the world."

551
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:58,558
We can only rent 2 weapons
for 3 months with these mines.

552
01:00:58,727 --> 01:01:03,642
Get the hill behind the school
and Rahman"s roof ready.

553
01:01:03,887 --> 01:01:07,846
OK! Go and get them!
It"s a bad situation!

554
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,158
Come on kids!

555
01:02:11,247 --> 01:02:13,556
- Hello!
- Hello! Welcome!

556
01:02:13,727 --> 01:02:17,197
- How are you Abdol Salam?
- Welcome Satellite! Long time no see!

557
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:22,487
L"ve come to take two weapons
for "Kanibo". The Russian PKC type!

558
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:26,158
They are expensive.
The price has gone up.

559
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,397
They"re 3500, 3600 Dinars.

560
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:34,164
I don"t want to buy it;
I want to rent it for 3 months.

561
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:40,917
For rent? Forthree months
it"II be 600, 650 Dinars.

562
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:44,685
L"ve got 500, 600 Dinars
worth of mines.

563
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:45,723
OK!

564
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,486
Put them overthere!

565
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,559
Come here! Turn around!

566
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:57,242
I picked these mines myself.

567
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:08,643
- Do you have any small masks?
- L"II bring some soon.

568
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,603
These are American mines. First class.

569
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:18,120
Give him the weapons!

570
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,802
These are good weapons.

571
01:03:25,647 --> 01:03:27,797
Don"t ruin them!

572
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,397
Pashowput these in the bag!

573
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:37,159
These bullets aren"t enough.

574
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,283
L"II give you more
when you need some.

575
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:47,518
Howmuch is this necklace?

576
01:03:48,687 --> 01:03:49,836
5 Dinars!

577
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:02,001
It"s "International"!

578
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:08,683
Satellite,
what does "International" mean?

579
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:12,965
This is no time for questions.
Go!

580
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:18,280
Goodbye till next time!

581
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:41,639
L"m fed up. When will we leave?

582
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:45,720
We will leave soon.

583
01:04:49,527 --> 01:04:50,437
Be patient!

584
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:53,360
I can"t stand anymore.

585
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:57,315
What are we doing here?
Why aren"t we leaving?

586
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:01,318
I had a dream.

587
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:04,957
We"II go in 2 or 3 days,
when the child is cured.

588
01:05:05,927 --> 01:05:08,600
We"II go together.

589
01:05:09,847 --> 01:05:11,519
We won"t leave together.

590
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:15,202
If you"re trying to cure the child,
I won"t come.

591
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:17,484
If you don"t come, l"II go alone.

592
01:05:17,807 --> 01:05:21,766
The child understands everything.
Loweryour voice!

593
01:05:21,927 --> 01:05:23,963
Howmany times must I tell you?

594
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:27,324
Everyone"s leaving. Only we"re left.

595
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:31,197
Uncle Hengov, will you remove this?

596
01:05:31,367 --> 01:05:33,835
Of course!

597
01:05:35,407 --> 01:05:36,920
Come closer!

598
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,477
Does it hurt?

599
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:51,119
Remove it!

600
01:05:51,727 --> 01:05:56,039
Let me see! Look,
it is not bleeding now!

601
01:05:56,527 --> 01:05:58,643
- What is this?
- Throwit away!

602
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:04,998
If you don"t come, l"II go alone.

603
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:08,523
You say you want to go everyday.
Why don"t you leave then?

604
01:06:08,687 --> 01:06:11,884
Leave if you want to!

605
01:06:12,047 --> 01:06:15,357
Howcan I go alone?
Howwould you manage with the child?

606
01:06:15,527 --> 01:06:17,802
Let"s leave.

607
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:22,479
If we don"t leave this child now,
we will never be able to do that.

608
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:23,564
Let"s go!

609
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:27,006
Someone will find him

610
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,285
and take care ofhim.

611
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:35,607
We"II all go together.

612
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:51,995
We won"t go with him.

613
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:55,724
What will we tell people
when he grows up?

614
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,481
Shall we say we found him
in the streets?

615
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,081
What will we tell him
when he grows up?

616
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,205
Hengov, let"s go!
Somebody will take him!

617
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:12,240
L"m leaving.

618
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:20,885
Mummy!

619
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:25,724
Where are you?

620
01:10:24,127 --> 01:10:27,164
Hurry! Hurry up! Quick!

621
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:35,116
Didn"t I say no one is allowed
to have weapons in the school?

622
01:10:36,007 --> 01:10:37,838
Teacher, how are you today?

623
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,237
Do you think this is a good place
for shooting?

624
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:41,920
The white flag is enough.

625
01:10:42,327 --> 01:10:44,522
This is the best place for weapons.

626
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:47,885
The best place.

627
01:10:48,847 --> 01:10:50,280
Oh, brother!

628
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,883
Hey, work hard!
Hey you, work harder!

629
01:10:56,127 --> 01:11:01,759
All you do is go to villages
and mess them up.

630
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:04,361
You"II make trouble
forthe kids someday.

631
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:08,885
What? Me? Did I mess them up?

632
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,365
Do I make trouble forthe children?

633
01:11:12,527 --> 01:11:15,758
Lfit hadn"t been for me,
they would have beenjobless.

634
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:19,921
Can"t you hearthe explosions?
War is coming closerto us.

635
01:11:20,087 --> 01:11:25,207
It"s war, teacher!
We have to get weapons ready.

636
01:11:26,527 --> 01:11:32,079
Hey, why aren"t you listening?

640
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:42,163
They have to learn howto use masks.

641
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:45,442

648
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:05,525

650
01:12:15,527 --> 01:12:17,916
- Who?
- The brother ofthe armless boy.

651
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:22,123

Someone go and find the brother!

653
01:13:01,327 --> 01:13:05,206
He hasn"t walked on a mine!
Who said that?

654
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:10,755
Stay where you are!
Don"t move!

655
01:13:11,727 --> 01:13:15,402
- Howlong has he been there?
- Since morning, Satellite.

656
01:13:16,407 --> 01:13:18,284
Don"t move! Don"t move!

657
01:13:18,447 --> 01:13:22,076
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes! If you move you"II die.

658
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:24,636
Please don"t move!

659
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:28,044
- What?
- There are mines all around you.

660
01:13:28,327 --> 01:13:31,125
What? I shouldn"t move?

661
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:34,165
Are there mines here?

662
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:38,079
- Has anybody gone to get his brother?
- Yes!

663
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:43,042
Don"t move! L"II come overto you.

668
01:14:00,487 --> 01:14:04,685
- Satellite, please don"t go there!

669
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:09,682
Don"t move! L"m coming.

670
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:14,484
Bring the bike!

671
01:14:32,487 --> 01:14:33,237
Don"t go further!

672
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:39,362
I want the bike.

673
01:14:41,087 --> 01:14:42,406
Honk.

674
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,876
Ok! L"II do it foryou.

675
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:46,876
Bring the bike!

676
01:14:51,607 --> 01:14:53,438
L"ve brought it. Don"t move!

677
01:15:01,327 --> 01:15:04,683
- Why don"t you honk?
- Wait! Wait!

678
01:15:06,927 --> 01:15:10,840
- I want the bike.
- OK! L"II give it to you.

679
01:15:12,127 --> 01:15:16,086
L"II give it to you.

680
01:15:21,127 --> 01:15:22,640
Satellite, Please don"t go there!

681
01:15:24,527 --> 01:15:26,916
I had a nightmare last night.

682
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:28,920
Don"t go!

683
01:15:29,927 --> 01:15:32,236
Satellite, for God"s sake!

684
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,477
Don"t cry!

685
01:15:34,887 --> 01:15:36,559
I beg you to let me

686
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:39,605
or Pashowgo there.

687
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:44,682
What? Look at my leg! Do you want me
to lose the other one too?

688
01:15:46,247 --> 01:15:49,398
Satellite is a good person.
Let us go there!

689
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:52,800
- Everyone clap for Pashow!
- No need forthat!

690
01:15:55,047 --> 01:15:57,163
Let his brother go there!

691
01:15:57,487 --> 01:16:00,081
Enough! Don"t talk!

692
01:16:00,727 --> 01:16:03,366
Here"s your bike!

693
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:07,039
L"ve brought red fish, foryou.

694
01:16:08,127 --> 01:16:12,439
Don"t move!

695
01:16:12,607 --> 01:16:15,519
Stay where you are!

696
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,804
There are some mines overthere!

697
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:29,076
If you don"t come forward
l"II give this to you.

698
01:16:31,847 --> 01:16:34,361
Wait, don"t come forward,
l"II give it to you.

699
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:39,477
Don"t touch it! It"s a mine.

700
01:16:49,847 --> 01:16:53,806
Bring him inside! Bring him!

701
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:02,760
Don"t cry! Don"t cry!

702
01:17:03,447 --> 01:17:07,281
Howmany times must I tell you
not to play with such things?

703
01:17:07,447 --> 01:17:08,516
Put him there.

704
01:17:10,407 --> 01:17:13,444
Esmaeel, slower! Slowly!

705
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:38,524
Don"t worry! It"s nothing!
It will be fine!

706
01:17:39,887 --> 01:17:41,240
My leg!

707
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:51,405
L"II bring a doctorforyou tonight.

708
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:56,438
You kept saying USA, USA
until you fell on a USA mine.

709
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:05,761
L"II go fetch the doctor.

710
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:16,839
Do you need anything, Satellite?

711
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:24,478
No, Thanks! Don"t stay here!
All of you leave!

712
01:18:28,367 --> 01:18:30,927
I said leave.

713
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:52,081
- Where"s Pashow?
- He went with Esmaeel.

714
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:59,566
Satellite, Esmaeel sent this foryou.

715
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:03,481
How"s your leg?

716
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:06,919
What"s up with the child?
Don"t touch it! It hurts.

717
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:10,638
Thank God he is fine!

718
01:19:10,807 --> 01:19:12,604
I returned him healthy and well.

719
01:19:13,127 --> 01:19:16,164
- Did you see his sister?
- No.

720
01:19:16,647 --> 01:19:19,559
But the armless boy
sent a message foryou.

721
01:19:20,407 --> 01:19:21,920
What did he say?

722
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:25,316
Move away!

723
01:19:27,607 --> 01:19:32,806
He said everything would come
to an end tomorrowmorning.

724
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,043
What?

725
01:19:34,207 --> 01:19:35,879
Everything will end by tomorrow.

726
01:19:36,807 --> 01:19:38,240
The war would end?

727
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:42,559
I don"t know.
Everything ends tomorrow!

728
01:19:50,127 --> 01:19:52,243
Go and tell Esmaeel

729
01:19:52,407 --> 01:19:56,878
to inform the people
that the war will end tomorrow!

730
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:57,638
OK!

731
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:01,518
Tell me what to say again!

732
01:20:01,687 --> 01:20:04,121
Go and tell Esmaeel to tell the people

733
01:20:04,287 --> 01:20:07,962
on the mosque microphone
that the war will end tomorrow.

734
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,877
Open the door!

735
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:40,477
What is it? It"s midnight.

736
01:21:41,127 --> 01:21:42,845
- Saddam has fallen.
- What?

737
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:46,557
I sawit myself.
There are lots of Americans here.

738
01:21:46,727 --> 01:21:48,558
The refugees are coming back
to the city.

739
01:21:48,727 --> 01:21:50,285
Howdid you find out?

740
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:54,838
I sawit myself.
All the children are on the hill.

741
01:21:55,007 --> 01:21:56,645
Why have they gone up there?

742
01:21:56,847 --> 01:22:01,159
When the Americans got here,
they went to Esmaeel.

743
01:22:01,727 --> 01:22:04,685
They took his dish
and carried it to the hill.

744
01:22:04,847 --> 01:22:06,644
The children are watching
the prohibited channels

745
01:22:06,807 --> 01:22:08,525
with the American soldiers.

746
01:22:09,407 --> 01:22:12,444
They are watching
the prohibited channels?

747
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,279
Where is Shirkooh?

748
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:18,246
He"s going to the city
with his uncle.

749
01:22:19,007 --> 01:22:22,124
Satellite,
can we please go to the city?

750
01:22:22,367 --> 01:22:26,326
They say it is the end ofthe world.
The city is chaos.

751
01:22:27,007 --> 01:22:29,157
Please, let"s go!

752
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:32,325
Everywhere is a mess.

753
01:22:34,447 --> 01:22:37,120
- Where were you?
- Shirkooh has come.

754
01:22:37,407 --> 01:22:40,956
- Satellite! Are you better?
- What is this?

755
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:45,126
This is Saddam"s arm.
It"s foryou!

756
01:22:45,287 --> 01:22:48,836
They say it"s very important.
I sold all my mines to get it.

757
01:22:51,687 --> 01:22:53,723
The Americans said
it"s very expensive.

758
01:22:53,967 --> 01:22:57,676
- Howdid you learn their language?
- You taught me!

759
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:03,358
The Americans said not to collect
American mines any more.

760
01:23:03,607 --> 01:23:05,802
Not any more.

761
01:23:06,327 --> 01:23:08,636
They will pay us money to collect
these.

762
01:23:10,207 --> 01:23:13,563
They will pay dollars. Dollars!

763
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:19,803
I have brought you something else.

764
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:24,116
Hownice

765
01:23:24,887 --> 01:23:27,526
and interesting!!

766
01:23:29,847 --> 01:23:32,919
- Well, what"s going on?
- I am coming.

767
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:38,238
Guess what I have foryou?

768
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:41,606
What?

769
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,365
A fewred fish.

770
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:52,915
What is this?
Where did you get it?

771
01:23:53,407 --> 01:23:54,920
It"s foreign.

772
01:23:55,087 --> 01:23:58,159
My uncle bought it
from the Americans.

773
01:23:58,407 --> 01:24:01,956
- Let me see.
- This is the red fish you wanted.

774
01:24:04,767 --> 01:24:06,962
- Where did you bring it from?
- It"s nice...

775
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:09,402
It is first class American!

776
01:24:09,687 --> 01:24:11,803
Please,
don"t go into the water anymore!

777
01:24:12,087 --> 01:24:14,442
American...

778
01:24:15,127 --> 01:24:16,765
Are you making fun of me?

779
01:24:17,047 --> 01:24:20,756
I have to go now.
My uncle is waiting for me.

780
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:23,522
Coming Uncle!

781
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:28,438
- Where are you going?
- To the town.

782
01:24:29,087 --> 01:24:30,486
Take care!

783
01:24:35,447 --> 01:24:36,675
Come back soon!

784
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:41,438
I am looking for a newjob.
I want to make some money!

785
01:24:41,727 --> 01:24:43,240
Goodbye!

786
01:24:43,567 --> 01:24:45,637
Why is the color like this?

787
01:24:45,967 --> 01:24:49,243
Don"t look at them fortoo long!
Sleep!

788
01:24:49,727 --> 01:24:52,719
- Why are they this color?
- Goodbye!

789
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:06,559
Shirkooh!

790
01:26:33,047 --> 01:26:35,720
Satellite said to come to the spring.

791
01:26:35,887 --> 01:26:39,357
He has seen something strange.

792
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:43,407
Agrin!

793
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:49,358
Agrin!

794
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:07,838
Here, Satellite!
The armless boy gave this to you.

795
01:30:08,007 --> 01:30:12,797
He said in 275 days something else
will happen in the area.

796
01:30:32,607 --> 01:30:35,917
Look! Didn"t you want to see
