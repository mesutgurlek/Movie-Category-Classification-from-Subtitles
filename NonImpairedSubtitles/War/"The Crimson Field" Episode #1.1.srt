1
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:02,231
Miss, you one of them volunteer
nurses? Could you soothe my brow?

2
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:03,863
I'm feeling a bit feverish.

3
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:05,677
You look fine to me.

4
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:07,598
Back in line, you.

5
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:13,193
Oh, are you one of us?
I didn't see you on the boat.

6
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:15,073
I didn't feel very well.

7
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:18,313
Oh, quite a few girls didn't.
I'm Flora, by the way.

8
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:19,913
Katherine.

9
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,513
Can you believe we're finally here?

10
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,593
Everyone at home is thrilled,

11
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:27,593
even though they wept buckets
when I left.

12
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:30,873
Did your family weep buckets
when they said goodbye?

13
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:32,354
Yes. Buckets.

14
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,914
The others went in here.

15
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:46,153
Hello again.
Where are the others going?

16
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:47,513
Shouldn't we be following?

17
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:49,793
They were led off,
I was told to wait and not move.

18
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,433
Finally. The stragglers.

19
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:54,273
What do you think this is, a Sunday
afternoon stroll in England?

20
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:55,354
Follow me.

21
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,913
Keep your papers with
you at all times.

22
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,713
Do not put down your luggage.

23
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:07,034
Do not let go of anything you value,
you'll never see it again.

24
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:09,714
Your transport.

25
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:12,433
But where are we going?

26
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:15,193
Hospital 25A.
Not far from the Front.

27
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:17,194
I hope you like it lively.

28
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:57,821
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

29
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:26,873
I'll write to his mother.

30
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,034
Yes, Matron.

31
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:32,633
End bed, please.

32
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:36,034
Can you change his dressings? Matron.

33
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:44,873
You... get my boots.
I want my boots.

34
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,274
Why do you want your boots,
Private Molloy?

35
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:52,633
I'm leaving here.
I can't walk out on my bare feet.

36
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:54,633
I need my boots.
Will you fetch my boots?

37
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,234
I'll bring them in a little while.

38
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,593
He won't see out the day.

39
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,513
I'd like it if he could
have as much peace as possible.

40
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:06,834
I'll go to him next.

41
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:13,713
I need an experienced nurse
to special Molloy.

42
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:15,113
There's other men needing that.

43
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:18,953
Men who joined up for noble reasons, not because
they thought they could escape the law.

44
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:21,073
All men deserve the same
when they're dying,

45
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,833
no matter what they're
said to have done.

46
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:25,033
I'm not sure who we can spare.
Help is coming.

47
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:28,913
Help?
Girls, with a few months' training?

48
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:32,514
Our nurses feel
the insult most keenly.

49
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:42,073
Did you know that military
nurses are forbidden to marry?

50
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,953
Isn't that just awful?
It's like being a nun!

51
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:49,634
Do either of you two have chaps or
fiances in khaki?

52
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,193
You're very daring.

53
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,673
Might I have one? Flora.

54
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:59,193
All the actresses do it. There are
photographs in my magazine.

55
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:00,554
You're not an actress.

56
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:04,074
Just... It gives an impression.

57
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,273
The Voluntary Aid Detachment.

58
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:24,353
I think it's a splendid idea.

59
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:27,313
Impressionable young women, newly
arrived in a strange place,

60
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:30,233
getting lost, having to ask the
dashing captain where everything is.

61
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:31,393
I'll be sure to tell them.

62
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:34,074
You're not dashing. I'm dashing.

63
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:37,154
You're in mate.

64
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,234
I want a full report!

65
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:01,154
Thank you.

66
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:22,754
Not till it's been checked, sir.

67
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:29,673
One Royal No.10 portable typewriter
with five ribbons.

68
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:33,953
Counted and checked by me, Captain
Gillan. Me, the Quartermaster, sir.

69
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:36,074
And I will get to you in
good time, sir.

70
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,634
Here at last.

71
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:48,353
Sister Quayle.

72
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,714
Let's get you settled. Follow me.

73
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,394
I imagine it's a little
different from what you're used to.

74
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,034
I love camping.

75
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:23,513
Do you know what we'll be doing
first, Sister?

76
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:27,033
It's just, I'm ever so much
better at some things than others.

77
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,113
Let's hope they're the right things.

78
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:33,513
Sister, where are
the... erm... conveniences?

79
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:36,233
There are chamber pots under
the beds.

80
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:38,233
Please hurry and change.

81
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,754
Matron is expecting to see
you in uniform.

82
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:08,154
Thanks.

83
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,234
Permission to run, Matron? Granted.

84
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:32,754
Bastard! Bastard.

85
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,353
I'm so sorry, Matron.

86
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:38,914
Get him off me!

87
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:43,314
Get off of him!

88
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:48,993
Don't you stick that bastard
thing in me, you bitch.

89
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,633
Ah, you bitch!

90
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:56,673
Bitch! You whore! You bitch!

91
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:57,994
I'll kill her.

92
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,753
See to the Padre, Nurse.

93
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,394
Hot sweet tea and a quiet place to
sit down. Yes, Matron.

94
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:13,593
Take Molloy back to his bed,
please, Corporal.

95
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,193
Get him ready for examination.

96
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:17,034
Bitch. Bitch...

97
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:22,633
Was it the noise?

98
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:25,153
Do you want to come with me?

99
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:27,314
Come on. Come on.

100
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,314
Yes?

101
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,754
Ah. Do come in, Prentiss.

102
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,113
Why does it help?

103
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:20,994
I don't know. But it does.

104
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:24,913
I'll put him on the list.

105
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:28,073
I think that's the right thing
to do, Colonel.

106
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,473
Have you shown the young
ladies the ropes yet?

107
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,073
Not yet.

108
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,833
I expect them to be welcomed.

109
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,433
It's difficult for my nurses.
Civilian girls, on the wards.

110
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:39,793
It's extra pairs of hands and feet
and God knows we need them.

111
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:42,633
And I don't want any
silliness from your nurses,

112
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,353
giving the volunteers a bad time.

113
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:48,074
We're the friendly face of the Army.
Of course, Colonel.

114
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:54,554
Matron.

115
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:13,154
Why did you attack the Padre?
He was trying to help.

116
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,433
Bastard was making me
ready for the box.

117
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,233
You keep him away from me.

118
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:24,634
I don't want no cross on my head,
I'm not dying.

119
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:32,073
I can special him, Matron.
Sit with him. He doesn't bother me.

120
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:35,753
It's a nurse's job, Corporal,
and you have other work to do.

121
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,673
Matron... Suit yourself.

122
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:39,553
..the volunteers are waiting.

123
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:43,033
The youngest was immediately
overfamiliar with the patients.

124
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,953
Shall we go together?

125
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,554
If you think I can be useful.

126
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:50,674
Margaret...

127
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,994
The promotion was
just as much of a shock for me.

128
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:03,794
It was right it was you,
and I couldn't be more proud.

129
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,433
My protegee.

130
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:12,273
And I know you will
rise to the challenge.

131
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,113
Give us all
confidence in your leadership,

132
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:18,034
and show these girls
what's expected.

133
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,634
At ease, Prentiss.

134
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:52,433
Blighty ticket.

135
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:56,074
I don't know how long they'll give
you, but I'm sending you home.

136
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,594
Oh, there... There, there.

137
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:16,313
What is that?

138
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:19,513
It's a cake, Matron. A fruit cake.

139
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:24,873
Mrs Bartlett, she's our cook, she
made it. She makes wonderful cakes.

140
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:26,714
Would you care for a piece?

141
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:29,794
Put it down.

142
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:40,673
Flora Marshall.

143
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:41,953
Yes, Matron.

144
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,033
Rosalie Berwick. Yes, Matron.

145
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:46,713
Katherine Trevelyan.

146
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:50,033
Matron. There are supposed to be
four of you. Where is Joan Livesey?

147
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,673
There was only three of us
at the meeting point, Matron.

148
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:56,033
So, Miss Livesey will arrive
if and when she feels like it.

149
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,153
Marshall, how old are you?

150
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,713
Oh, I'm nearly 24, Matron.
No, you're not.

151
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,633
I am. I just look very
young for my age. I always have.

152
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,954
Even when I was a baby
I looked young for my age.

153
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:10,993
You're wearing scent.

154
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,794
I'm not, Matron.
It's just rose-water.

155
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:20,873
Were you not taught the rules
concerning conduct and deportment?

156
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:23,473
Yes, Matron, of course. But you
don't think they apply to you?

157
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,233
No, Matron, of course they do.

158
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:27,193
I'm speaking to Marshall.

159
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,794
Of course they do, Matron.

160
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,914
Wash it off, please.

161
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:50,194
The soap is there for a reason.

162
00:14:55,434 --> 00:15:01,714
It looks ever so... drying, Matron,
and I'm rather prone to rashes.

163
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:08,354
The rules are clear.

164
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:13,273
No scent,
powder or paint is to be worn.

165
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:16,273
No fancy stockings, boots,
shoes, belts. No trivialities.

166
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:20,153
Nothing that might invite, provoke
or inflame masculine attention.

167
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:22,673
But perhaps, Marshall,
you ARE a trivial young lady

168
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,913
and masculine attention is what
you're hoping for?

169
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:27,074
It was only a splash of
rose-water, Matron.

170
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:34,393
Matron, we all understand the rules,
and will abide by them utterly.

171
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:36,953
Nursing the men to the very
best of our ability

172
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,354
is what we're ready to do.

173
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,594
I'll be the judge of that.

174
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:52,754
That one's going to be trouble.

175
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:58,913
A well-made bed is essential to
a well-run hospital.

176
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:02,114
Sister Quayle is showing exactly
how it should be done.

177
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:11,234
And now you. You have two minutes.

178
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,274
I'm more than happy
to deal with this.

179
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:32,594
As I said, I'll be the judge.

180
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,874
Come on, girls.

181
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:52,074
Go on, Ginger, that's it!

182
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:56,873
Five, four...
Straight on to the quilt!

183
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:59,713
That's it. Tuck it all under!
..three, two...

184
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,713
Come on, quickly. Go on! ..one.
That's it now.

185
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:02,994
Time's up.

186
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,713
Your uniform is incorrect, Marshall.
Good God.

187
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:22,913
Berwick and Trevelyan,

188
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:25,593
you will make every bed
in the next three tents,

189
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:28,113
I will be checking every
single one of them.

190
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,633
Marshall, you can't make beds.

191
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:33,713
It's not my best thing, Matron -
but I'm ever so good at bandaging.

192
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:35,074
Look...

193
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,313
Lady Cavistock herself commended
my bandaging.

194
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:42,674
And my dressings and fomentations.
If you could just read...

195
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:52,073
And who is Lady Cavistock
that she is such an expert?

196
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:54,393
Oh, she runs the
Women's Guild in Worthing.

197
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:56,433
And who did you
practise your bandaging on?

198
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,993
The Scouts. Well, anyone who'd
let me. Even Daddy occasionally.

199
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:03,753
I'm really very good. I excel.

200
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:08,073
Lady Cavistock says so.
Please read her commendation.

201
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:09,714
With me, Marshall.

202
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,274
On with your work.

203
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,433
Sir, might I have a moment?

204
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:25,953
Ah, Sister Quayle, I was
intending to speak to you.

205
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:29,033
I know you would
have expected to be Matron.

206
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:32,193
You know how much I value
your experience on the wards,

207
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,114
and I wanted you to stay where
you're doing so much good.

208
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:41,593
Colonel,
thank you for the compliment,

209
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:43,994
and for clearing that up for me.

210
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:49,194
Any decision of yours has
my full support.

211
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:16,274
Boiled, dried, rolled.

212
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,234
Since you excel
in bandages and dressings.

213
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:35,594
Colonel Purbright is here.
Oh, Christ.

214
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:42,834
Sir.

215
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:49,233
All ready then. As you see.
Well, don't let them languish.

216
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:51,873
If they can walk and shoot,
then back up they go.

217
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,353
Matron Carter. How are you
settling in to the new job?

218
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,553
Very well, thank you, sir.

219
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:58,113
I thought you would have
chosen the other one.

220
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,033
What the bloody hell is that smell?

221
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,353
Oh, um, Sloan's Liniment.
I have a cold.

222
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,794
Well, don't give it to me.

223
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:28,473
Do you get called anything for short?

224
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:29,953
Kate? Katy?

225
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,593
Nope.

226
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:34,153
Well, then, Katherine.

227
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:37,153
I feel I must speak to you
about something rather important.

228
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,794
Might you turn around, please?

229
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:46,274
The rules are there for a reason.

230
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,073
We've all come here to do our duty,
and that's not to question

231
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:53,873
and be difficult, but rather to do
what's required of us.

232
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,513
They don't want us here.

233
00:20:55,514 --> 00:21:00,113
We're being tested. Just as Britain
is being tested, and...

234
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:02,193
you really are being
rather selfish.

235
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,873
Muttering under your breath
when Matron's speaking to you,

236
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:09,794
being defiant and impertinent -
well, it reflects on all of us.

237
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:16,394
Not only Flora and myself,
but on every volunteer.

238
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:21,193
You wouldn't want to give us all
a bad name, would you?

239
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:22,674
God forbid.

240
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:25,394
I knew you'd see sense.

241
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:30,193
So best foot forward, and let's put
this behind us and be friends.

242
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:33,313
I didn't come here to make friends.
Especially not with a hypocrite.

243
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:34,793
I'm not a hypocrite.

244
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,633
What are you? 30?
The embarrassing unmarried daughter.

245
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:42,713
A drain, a weight to be endured.
Getting in the way, gathering dust.

246
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:45,233
But thank Christ for the war.

247
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:46,953
At last, function.

248
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,553
Purpose. Meaning.

249
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:51,114
You didn't volunteer out of duty.

250
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:55,154
You volunteered to escape.

251
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:38,914
Got a spare one, Nurse? I'm gasping.

252
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:25,993
It's a very sad thing

253
00:23:25,994 --> 00:23:28,353
when a man's heart beats with such
ardour for a machine.

254
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:31,473
You're jealous
because you haven't got one.

255
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:34,434
Yes, because what I've always
dreamed of is a typewriter.

256
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:39,313
Were any of them pretty?
The volunteers. Come on!

257
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:41,994
Tell me, what were they like?
I didn't notice.

258
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:47,193
I despair of you, Tom.
You're a bitter disappointment to me.

259
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:50,033
Oh, and speaking of bitter
disappointment, despair

260
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:52,913
and other malaise - brass hat alert.

261
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:56,353
That lickspittle Purbright demands
our presence tout-bloody-suite.

262
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:58,834
I'm busy. Exactly.

263
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:03,873
Let him stew in his minor
public school juice.

264
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:08,114
We are surgeons, and
no-one clicks their fingers at us.

265
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:17,073
This is ridiculous. How can
all these men have venereal disease?

266
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:18,553
Can you be sure?

267
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:19,833
Yes, we're sure.

268
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,793
Well, symptoms
are being manufactured.

269
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,953
Chancres are being simulated,
Needle dipped in paraffin wax

270
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:28,113
applied to the old chap to
create a blister.

271
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:30,833
General's Office has even
heard of condensed milk being used

272
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:32,354
to simulate discharge.

273
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:35,754
I'm sorry, do you find that amusing?

274
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:39,953
Shocking waste of supplies, sir.

275
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:42,313
My staff know the difference
between condensed milk

276
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,953
and a genuine
presentation of syphilis.

277
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:47,433
They can't all have the bloody pox!

278
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:50,313
What do you do with those cases
that aren't genuine?

279
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,713
Well, they go back up the line.

280
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:53,553
Right.
In future they'll be reported.

281
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:56,113
And those men that HAVE got
themselves riddled will be put on

282
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:58,833
half pay, and their families
informed as to the reason why.

283
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,954
All but the Colonel
and Matron are dismissed.

284
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:06,794
I want to review your Blighty cases.

285
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:56,793
You're not permitted
to be on the wards.

286
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:59,034
But there's... toes...

287
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:19,873
Don't run in uniform. She'll
have your guts. What's in there?

288
00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:24,033
Toes. Three toes.
They fell out of a bandage.

289
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:26,593
What you going to do with them?
Dunk 'em in your tea?

290
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:29,153
No, I'm going to
ask Matron what to do with them.

291
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,194
No, you're not. Come with me.

292
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:36,153
The majority are amputees.
Thank you, I can read.

293
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:38,073
A burst eardrum?

294
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,153
It's affecting the man's balance.

295
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:42,993
Right, we'll keep him here
for a week then send him back up.

296
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:45,313
With respect, sir,
a week isn't enough.

297
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:49,553
What about this man? Prentiss.
No details of any injury.

298
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:54,313
All his limbs are intact.
And HIS eardrums are A-1.

299
00:26:54,314 --> 00:26:58,073
Why are you sending him home?
Neurological damage. Nerves.

300
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,673
Sudden noise, sudden movement,

301
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:03,913
any disturbance triggers
paroxysms, seizures...

302
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,233
An hysteric. No, he...
So what is wrong with him?

303
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:10,354
I don't know.
And I don't know how to treat him.

304
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:14,273
It says here that you've found
that music helps.

305
00:27:14,274 --> 00:27:16,713
Yes. I don't know why, but it does.

306
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:19,033
I have some recordings
for my gramophone

307
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:21,833
and quite by chance,
Matron and I discovered that

308
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,713
if Prentiss listened to them,
something was released,

309
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:27,634
he was able to weep
and so avoided seizure and fitting.

310
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:33,593
So let me be clear about this.

311
00:27:33,594 --> 00:27:36,873
He's young, fit, no physical
injury, there's no medical reasons

312
00:27:36,874 --> 00:27:41,073
FOR these fits, and he cries
when he hears music.

313
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:43,473
Sounds to me
like he's putting it on,

314
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:45,874
sounds to me like funkiness.
Not at all.

315
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:49,314
Well, let's put it to him.
Run along and fetch him here.

316
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:00,953
When I want Matron's opinions,
I'll ask for them.

317
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,514
See you put a leash on her.

318
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,594
Corporal Prentiss,
could you come with me, please?

319
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:19,514
Enjoy the game.

320
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,233
On your way home then, Prentiss.

321
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,594
Sir.

322
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:33,394
Neurological damage.

323
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,154
Sir.

324
00:28:39,314 --> 00:28:41,474
Hold your hands out for me,
there's a good chap.

325
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:52,474
Walk a straight line for me.

326
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:08,954
Look at that.

327
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,793
Neuve Chapelle. Lose many chums?

328
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,953
Sir.

329
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,473
Tough times for everyone.

330
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:18,674
Sir.

331
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:27,474
Are you lead-swinging, Prentiss?

332
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:31,313
No, sir. Are you a coward?

333
00:29:31,314 --> 00:29:32,553
No, sir.

334
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,473
Are you aware of the penalty
FOR cowardice?

335
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:37,114
Yes, sir.
Are you a homosexual, Prentiss?

336
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,353
No, sir.

337
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:41,713
So if you're not a lead-swinger,
and you're not a coward

338
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:44,834
and you're not a homosexual,
you must be a soldier.

339
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,153
Sir.

340
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,514
Good man, Prentiss. Right answer.

341
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,073
Sir...

342
00:29:58,074 --> 00:30:01,593
You may go back up the line
and rejoin your regiment.

343
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:02,954
Dismissed.

344
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,754
Get another bar for that medal, eh?

345
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,274
Make your country proud.

346
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:30,233
He needs a rest. He's had a rest.

347
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:34,473
Do you think the enemy are sending
their men home because they're tired?

348
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:37,634
We MUST have men at the Front
or we will lose.

349
00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:41,754
It's that simple.

350
00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:47,634
The bits go in here.

351
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:50,233
Bits?

352
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:54,593
Big bits - legs, arms. Small bits -
hands, feet, fingers, toes,

353
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:58,713
ears sometimes. There's always bits,
and they all go in here.

354
00:30:58,714 --> 00:31:01,513
But whose ARE they?

355
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:05,314
Well, aren't we going to say
anything? A prayer, or...?

356
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:09,153
They're rotten.
Neither use nor ornament.

357
00:31:09,154 --> 00:31:12,673
Chuck them in, and get back to what
you're doing. Sharpish.

358
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:14,034
Go on.

359
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:30,994
There. Now you know what to do.

360
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,034
Isn't what you expected, is it?

361
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:43,353
You'll get used to it.

362
00:31:43,354 --> 00:31:44,873
What if I don't?

363
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:46,233
Then you don't.

364
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:48,874
But no-one's got the time
to nanny you through it.

365
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:07,353
You disobeyed an order.

366
00:32:07,354 --> 00:32:09,913
You were told to make
the beds in the new ward tents.

367
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:11,314
I needed some fresh air.

368
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,953
You disobeyed an order.

369
00:32:16,954 --> 00:32:20,834
For a moment, yes. But the soldier
asked me for a cigarette.

370
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,313
You should have
asked an orderly to help him

371
00:32:24,314 --> 00:32:26,553
and returned immediately to
the task you were given.

372
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:28,713
I thought it more important
to help the soldier.

373
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,473
You thought that was
more important than my order?

374
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:33,233
Yes, Matron, I did.

375
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:35,954
Then you will be reprimanded
in the strongest possible terms.

376
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:42,233
For helping a man to
smoke a cigarette?

377
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,433
He asked me for help,
was I supposed to walk away?

378
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:46,673
Why are you here, Miss Trevelyan?

379
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,753
You seem incapable of respecting
the most simple of necessary rules.

380
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:53,234
Was it necessary to be quite so
vindictive towards Miss Marshall?

381
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:59,633
To humiliate her so publicly?
Is that in the rules?

382
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:02,434
Or was it more about proving
a point to Sister Quayle?

383
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:18,553
Your marching orders, Miss Trevelyan.
I have no use for you.

384
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:20,833
The convoy leaves
with the Blighty cases at 8:00,

385
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,634
you will leave with them. Now,
get out of my sight. With pleasure.

386
00:34:18,314 --> 00:34:20,713
Ask one of the nurses to direct
you to the sluice room,

387
00:34:20,714 --> 00:34:24,233
tell them you are on my orders
and are to scour every single bedpan

388
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:26,234
till they gleam. Yes, Matron.

389
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:40,513
I'll be back as soon as I can.
You'll keep checking him regularly.

390
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,473
I don't want him
in any pain at the end.

391
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:43,634
Yes, Matron.

392
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:05,394
Sister? I'm hemming!

393
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:10,953
Nurse! We have a haemorrhage
over here.

394
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:13,834
Very slowly, we don't want him
bleeding out.

395
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:44,314
Got another one for Blighty.

396
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,874
That's it. Off you go.

397
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:54,274
Lucky bastards.

398
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,793
Haemorrhage.
You're needed in theatre, sir.

399
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:27,194
With me, Sister. Matter of urgency.

400
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:32,754
The Blighty convoy is
about to leave.

401
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:40,714
I want you to find Corporal
Prentiss, and give him that.

402
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,993
I thought it had been
rescinded, sir.

403
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,914
This is my bloody hospital.

404
00:36:48,754 --> 00:36:52,594
I want Prentiss on that convoy.
So hurry, please. Of course, sir.

405
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:25,153
Rosalie?

406
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:28,793
Rosalie, I'm about to leave,
but I have to say something first.

407
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:31,114
Oh! Sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

408
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:39,113
You try and get away,

409
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:40,873
you breathe one word...

410
00:37:40,874 --> 00:37:43,353
I'll cut your whore's throat.

411
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:47,714
I've done it before. And I'll do it
again like it's nothing.

412
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:54,634
Nothing like a gusher to brighten up
a dull afternoon, eh, lads?

413
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:05,233
Shit.

414
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:06,674
What do you want?

415
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:13,553
You're going to keep me alive.

416
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:14,834
Molloy?

417
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:24,954
Molloy?

418
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:36,433
Molloy? Is that you?

419
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:42,233
They're looking for you. They're
the ones that can help you. I can't.

420
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:44,993
No, they'll tell him where I am.

421
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:46,274
Who?

422
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:49,713
He wants me.

423
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:54,473
That's why I need you -
to help me hold on.

424
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:57,073
He's coming for me.
All the things I've done,

425
00:38:57,074 --> 00:38:58,874
he's coming.

426
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:03,714
There's something coming out
of my mouth.

427
00:39:06,114 --> 00:39:07,274
Wipe it.

428
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:17,194
Show me.

429
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:21,313
You bitch.
You said you would keep me alive!

430
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:23,753
No, I didn't. I didn't. No, I...

431
00:39:23,754 --> 00:39:26,633
They can, they can.
You said that, but I can't.

432
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:29,753
I'll take you with me.
You're a lying bitch.

433
00:39:29,754 --> 00:39:31,474
I've got nothing else to lose!

434
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:35,794
Well, go on, then - stop
talking about it and do it.

435
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:43,514
I've got nothing left to lose
either, so really, go ahead.

436
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:47,994
What are you waiting for?

437
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,913
No. No...

438
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:55,873
You should be begging for your life.
Come on, beg.

439
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:58,474
Beg. Beg for your life!
I'm not begging you for anything.

440
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:33,674
I'm dying.

441
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:43,834
I won't leave you.

442
00:40:46,954 --> 00:40:48,794
I'll stay with you.

443
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,474
Come on, let's get you into bed.

444
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,713
Blighty convoy just left, Matron.

445
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:38,154
Thank you.

446
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:14,833
The convoy's left,
why aren't you on it? Ssh.

447
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,313
Who's that?

448
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:19,554
No-one to be scared of. Sssh...

449
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:26,473
From the mouth.

450
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:28,034
Two minutes.

451
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:15,674
When I killed her...

452
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:20,674
..it weren't deliberate.

453
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:27,554
Will you tell her?

454
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:31,594
You tell her I didn't mean it.

455
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:38,394
You tell her I'm sorry.

456
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,394
Of course I will.

457
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:28,114
No harm done.

458
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:42,113
In his paybook you will find an
address for his mother in Aberdeen.

459
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:46,673
As you were the special,
you will write to Mrs Molloy.

460
00:44:46,674 --> 00:44:50,034
You will say that her son
died peacefully and without pain.

461
00:44:52,794 --> 00:44:55,273
You always tell the families that
the death was peaceful

462
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:57,434
and without pain,
even when it is not.

463
00:44:58,314 --> 00:45:00,873
Is that rule
reasonable enough for you?

464
00:45:00,874 --> 00:45:01,994
Yes, Matron.

465
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:10,513
What was the matter with him?

466
00:45:10,514 --> 00:45:14,154
Gas gangrene. Liver and lungs.

467
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:18,914
How he had the strength to lift
himself out of his bed is beyond me.

468
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:24,674
You disobeyed another order.

469
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:33,194
I thought this was more important...
Matron.

470
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:38,033
He will need laying out.

471
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,113
I've been trained in how to do that.

472
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:42,994
I'll send someone to make sure
you do it properly.

473
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:49,154
You also never talk about
a dying man's last words.

474
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:52,194
No matter what they confess to.

475
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:57,314
It won't go any further.

476
00:46:00,754 --> 00:46:05,914
Probationary period, Trevelyan.
I will not be so lenient again.

477
00:46:07,794 --> 00:46:09,274
Matron.

478
00:46:20,994 --> 00:46:23,313
Strip the linen. Yes, Matron.

479
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:26,473
Private Molloy's body
is in the new ward tent.

480
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:29,634
Corporal Foley, you will assist the
volunteer in laying him out.

481
00:46:31,674 --> 00:46:32,954
He had these.

482
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,994
It could all have been
very different.

483
00:46:59,074 --> 00:47:00,514
Thank you, Matron.

484
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:14,673
Your uniform is incorrect.

485
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:16,634
Sorry, Matron.

486
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:02,634
Are you waiting for me, sir?

487
00:49:04,314 --> 00:49:06,713
I think it's you that's
been waiting for me.

488
00:49:06,714 --> 00:49:11,194
I can't apologise enough
for being late. Joan... Livesey.

489
00:49:34,314 --> 00:49:36,474
How's the first day been then,
Volunteer?

490
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:43,993
My esteemed colleague was lying.
He said none of you were pretty.

491
00:49:43,994 --> 00:49:45,514
He must be blind.

492
00:49:48,954 --> 00:49:51,114
Shy. How sweet.

493
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:56,953
I apologise for my friend,
he er... he thinks he's dashing.

494
00:49:56,954 --> 00:49:58,713
Leave her alone, Miles.

495
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:01,033
Do you know what
they call the VADs?

496
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:05,034
The Very Adorable Darlings. And
I think that suits you perfectly.

497
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:10,513
My father gave me
a piece of advice about women,

498
00:50:10,514 --> 00:50:11,833
shall I tell you what it is?

499
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,393
He said, never marry a woman who
holds your look for too long,

500
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:16,273
she's bound to be trouble.

501
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:18,713
And you take your father's
advice for everything, do you?

502
00:50:18,714 --> 00:50:21,674
Well, usually,
but not in matters of the heart.

503
00:50:22,634 --> 00:50:23,953
Of course you do.

504
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,394
You're the sort that does
exactly as he's told.

505
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,714
She will be eating out of my hand
within the week.

506
00:50:39,594 --> 00:50:41,953
Sister Quayle? No running!

507
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:43,313
Oh. Sorry.

508
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:47,194
Sister Quayle? I was wondering
if I could have my cake?

509
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:51,114
I shared it out among the men.

510
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:56,233
I thought that was what
you intended. I am sorry.

511
00:50:56,234 --> 00:51:00,913
No, please - I'm glad you did that.
It's much better.

512
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:02,873
Did they like it?

513
00:51:02,874 --> 00:51:05,073
They enjoyed it very much.

514
00:51:05,074 --> 00:51:09,593
Oh, good. I shall tell Mrs Bartlett.
She'll be so pleased.

515
00:51:09,594 --> 00:51:11,953
Thank you, Sister. Goodnight.

516
00:51:11,954 --> 00:51:13,993
Don't forget to say your prayers.

517
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:16,234
Oh, of course. I always do.

518
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:48,393
I realised I'd missed the lorry

519
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:50,833
so thought I'd get here
under me own steam.

520
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:54,273
Bought the bike in Boulogne.
Got the coat, goggles, everything

521
00:51:54,274 --> 00:51:56,393
for an absolute song.

522
00:51:56,394 --> 00:51:58,633
You can buy anything in Boulogne.

523
00:51:58,634 --> 00:52:00,793
I could have turned up
in full evening wear with two

524
00:52:00,794 --> 00:52:04,073
Pekingese dogs if I'd have wanted
to. Margaret, this is Joan Livesey.

525
00:52:04,074 --> 00:52:05,953
The missing volunteer.

526
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:07,633
No, a civilian Sister. A reservist.

527
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:10,433
From the Royal Infirmary, Liverpool.
How do you do?

528
00:52:10,434 --> 00:52:12,273
A Sister? We thought...

529
00:52:12,274 --> 00:52:14,633
We were sent four names,
so naturally we assumed...

530
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:16,633
I completely understand,
wires get crossed.

531
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:20,393
You've been billeted with the volunteers, but
you will have your own private quarters.

532
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:22,713
You wouldn't mind showing the way,
would you?

533
00:52:22,714 --> 00:52:24,993
Don't trouble yourselves.
I can find my way.

534
00:52:24,994 --> 00:52:27,073
If I get lost, I'll ask someone.

535
00:52:27,074 --> 00:52:28,354
Goodnight.

536
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:36,354
A proper, qualified,
highly-qualified civilian nurse.

537
00:52:38,274 --> 00:52:40,194
I may have a brandy to celebrate.

538
00:52:42,234 --> 00:52:44,874
She's rather young
to have made Sister.

539
00:52:56,314 --> 00:52:57,714
Is she all right parked there?

540
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:04,313
Can you point me in the general
direction of the sleeping quarters?

541
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,634
Follow the signs.

542
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:08,354
Thank you.

543
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:20,113
I would never dream of cutting
my hair, but I do think yours

544
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,194
looks smashing. Well, thank you.

545
00:53:24,274 --> 00:53:26,993
This is Joan. That's Katherine.
Hello.

546
00:53:26,994 --> 00:53:29,593
It's Kitty.
I get called Kitty for short.

547
00:53:29,594 --> 00:53:31,313
Are you married?

548
00:53:31,314 --> 00:53:33,473
Flora! That's far too personal!

549
00:53:33,474 --> 00:53:38,113
We're off duty! And civilian nurses
can get married. So, are you?

550
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,953
Or engaged? Is there a Mr Joan?

551
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:44,273
When would I have time for a man?
Well, never mind.

552
00:53:44,274 --> 00:53:48,234
You have a motorcycle. And I'd
absolutely die to ride a motorcycle.

553
00:53:49,754 --> 00:53:51,953
Maybe I'll teach you.

554
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:54,514
Oh, I'd love that!

555
00:53:56,794 --> 00:53:59,153
That's the boys leaving!
We should wave them goodbye.

556
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,633
You're in your nightclothes!

557
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:03,274
They're going to the Front.

558
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:14,674
What I said was unforgivably cruel.

559
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:18,874
I'm sure we'll all get used
to each other.

560
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:23,074
Come and see this!
You have to see this!

561
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:25,754
Right marker!

562
00:54:27,394 --> 00:54:29,194
Get a move on, you lot!

563
00:54:33,794 --> 00:54:37,633
Squad will move to the
right in fours.

564
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:40,154
Form... fours!

565
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:43,633
Right.

566
00:54:43,634 --> 00:54:46,314
By the left. Quick march!

567
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:11,314
Left, right,
left, right, left, right...

568
00:55:13,994 --> 00:55:16,713
What I wouldn't give
to be you, lads!

569
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:19,313
Give the Hun hell from me!

570
00:55:19,314 --> 00:55:21,954
For King and country,
give 'em hell, lads.

571
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:42,234
Left, right,
left, right, left, right...

572
00:55:55,754 --> 00:55:59,394
Good luck, boys. Good luck!

573
00:56:15,634 --> 00:56:17,354
Stay alive for me.

574
00:56:18,634 --> 00:56:20,034
Stay alive.

575
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:24,994
Stay alive.

576
00:56:26,154 --> 00:56:27,353
Where's my husband?

577
00:56:27,354 --> 00:56:28,993
I didn't think you'd be
so close to the sea.

578
00:56:28,994 --> 00:56:30,273
You shouldn't have come.

579
00:56:30,274 --> 00:56:32,393
I'm not prepared for this.

580
00:56:32,394 --> 00:56:34,753
No woman is a blank sheet of paper,
we all have histories.

581
00:56:34,754 --> 00:56:37,313
And I will not give up
until I see a smile.

582
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:38,953
I really believe
I was meant for this.

583
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:41,713
I've got grit!
Where? In your shoe?

584
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:43,553
Are you going to put them all
in the laundry,

585
00:56:43,554 --> 00:56:46,154
out of sight, out of mind?
It's just bloody-minded.

586
00:56:46,342 --> 00:57:16,720
