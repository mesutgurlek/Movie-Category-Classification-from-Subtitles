1
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,850
LO N G LIVE DEATH!

2
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:14,014
After capturing and disarming
the Red Army today...

3
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,386
official troops reached
their final obje ctiv e.

4
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,685
The war is ov er.

5
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,958
Traitors will be
relentlessly hunted down.

6
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:29,364
If ne cessary,
we will kill half the country.

7
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,198
Long liv e Death!

8
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,873
Papa, I don't want them
to kill you!

9
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,999
You'll die, too?

10
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,046
- Yes.
- What'll I do?

11
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,047
You'll be grown up by then.

12
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,514
I don't understand.

13
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,814
We must all die.

14
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,098
- When we die, is it fore v er?
- Yes.

15
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,471
But what about heav en?

16
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,134
That'll come later.

17
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,181
- I'll bring you flowers.
- When?

18
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,885
When you die.

19
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,724
I'll bring you poppies.

20
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,227
- Don't think about that.
- Why not?

21
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,354
Be caus e...

22
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,964
All right.

23
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,935
Will we meet in heav en?

24
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,697
Yes.

25
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,897
That's good.

26
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,741
- Who inv ented it?
- What?

27
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,937
H eav en.

28
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,274
Nobody.

29
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,782
And the rest?

30
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,011
What "rest"?

31
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,012
Death.

32
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,214
Nobody.

33
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,960
Then when you die,
your belly'll be my drum.

34
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,433
Don't say that.

35
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,868
Is it a sin?

36
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,130
No.

37
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,448
My son, when you feel
the prickings of the flesh...

38
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,214
put on a hairshirt
and say an "Our Father."

39
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,862
8 x 3 is 24, 8 x 4 is 32,
8 x 5 = 40...

40
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,011
A package came for you.

41
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,102
For me?

42
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,220
Pri-son.

43
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,199
Remember your papa.

44
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,486
U ncle, I need your advice.

45
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,748
My husband's
be come a renegade,

46
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:36,795
endangering his family's future
with his awful progressiv e ideas.

47
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,422
I think it's my duty to turn
him in to the authorities...

48
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,830
so he'll be
arrested right away.

49
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,699
...arrested right away...
arrested right away...

50
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,045
Fando,
that's my Dr. Plumb pipe.

51
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,383
Yes, Dr. Plumb.
It's the only pipe I smoke.

52
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,356
Can I s ee it?

53
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,325
You can.

54
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,759
It's hot!

55
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,395
There.

56
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,275
You're under arrest
for military re volt.

57
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,152
If he knew
who turned him in!

58
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,731
Smash the bastard's
brains out!

59
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,479
The prison dire ctor
informs you

60
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,981
your husband is under
"spe cial surv eillance."

61
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,382
For plotting against
the established order...

62
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,923
he's to be "punished"
and placed in solitary.

63
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,374
Who did the y take?
Where's Papa?

64
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,787
The window!
The neighbors'll s ee us!

65
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,026
Where's Papa?
Is he dead?

66
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,959
Is he aliv e?

67
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,498
H is political ideas
hav e ruined your future and his.

68
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,910
Forget your father.

69
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,276
H e was a Red...

70
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,309
and an atheist.

71
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,796
- Didn't atheists kill Jesus?
- Yes.

72
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:26,095
- Don't Reds burn churches?
- Yes.

73
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,804
- I'll be atheist when I'm big.
- No!

74
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,879
- I'll be a Red.
- No!

75
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,345
You're a good boy.

76
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,528
The y take away his red flag.

77
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,003
H e can't walk good 'caus e
my theater's made of wood.

78
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,108
The y put Papa in jail.

79
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,420
The y lock the door.

80
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,183
Papa asks to s ee me,

81
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,384
but the judges say
he doesn't des erv e to.

82
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,190
So Mama goes
to s ee him in prison.

83
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,855
She puts on her shawl.

84
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,160
She goes slow

85
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,828
'caus e she's afraid
of dogs and vultures.

86
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,732
She reaches the prison.

87
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,306
She s ees Papa.

88
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:50,370
She tells him to suffer
'caus e he's been such a coward.

89
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,383
The judges come
and take Papa out of jail...

90
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,049
but he's brav e
and keeps his pipe.

91
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,093
With a big knife
the y cut off his head.

92
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,972
Come on,
time to go to sleep.

93
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,875
Are you coming?

94
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,069
Let's go, son.

95
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,677
Why the muzzles?

96
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,078
To keep them
from eating the grapes.

97
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,767
Down with muzzles!

98
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,159
Down with muzzles!

99
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,499
Assassins! Assassins!

100
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,351
All towns hav e fallen,
the war's ov er.

101
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,514
Our greatest fas cist victory!

102
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,092
Last week...

103
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,821
our troops hit

104
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,830
the capital
from the right, left and center.

105
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,901
Fighting was desperate
and raged on...

106
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,801
till the heights at each end
of the front were occupied.

107
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:44,397
Enemy loss es...

108
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,000
were disastrous.

109
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,774
Constant bombing
threw the enemy in disorder...

110
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,874
cutting off all retreat.

111
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,919
A total Red defeat
was imminent.

112
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,079
Our heroic tanks and trucks...

113
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:04,287
rushed into the fallen capital
as the y did into all the Red cities.

114
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,488
The chief
of state de clared:

115
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:11,092
The bastard reign of liberal
and socialist whoring...

116
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,831
is dead, killed
by our v aliant army.

117
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,965
The Nation has slain
the anarchist dragon...

118
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,773
who now lies biting the dust.

119
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,075
Bless ed by the Holy Church,

120
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,742
the army has the reins
of power fore v er.

121
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,785
Air raids soon de cimated
the republican air corps.

122
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,331
H ere a Red pilot
parachutes from his plane...

123
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:48,098
the last one shot down

124
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,537
before the war's end.

125
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,911
Is the sky-man an angel?

126
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,314
Not so loud!

127
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,129
Don't you lov e me?

128
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,966
Oh, y es, you're
the most beautiful mama...

129
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,065
of all the world's
towns and provinces.

130
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,235
Prettier
than the church's Virgin.

131
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,266
Get up! After your bath
we're going to the cemetery.

132
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,304
Stop it!

133
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,650
I'm hot, I'm hot.

134
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,853
Be quiet!

135
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,262
Come on, Theresa.

136
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,877
Ready!

137
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,775
Let the exe cution of thes e Reds
be an example. Long liv e death!

138
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:46,126
Fire!
I'm sav ed! I'm not dead! Sav ed!

139
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,219
It's the poet.

140
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,265
The faggot.

141
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,165
A faggot.
Finish him off up the ass.

142
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,999
Left face!

143
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,043
Shoulder arms!

144
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,112
Forward march!

145
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,194
The y'v e killed
Frederico Garcia Lorca.

146
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,945
We must trust God
and respe ct H is wishes.

147
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,810
Yesterday you saw how H e punished
thos e who burn churches.

148
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,165
And the poem
for your mama?

149
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,837
Mama is
the prettiest flower.

150
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,207
Good. Then what?

151
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,839
...prettiest flower.
And I lov e her more each hour.

152
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,007
Does it rhyme?

153
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,744
It's too prosaic.

154
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:01,719
God s ees us and is always
watching ov er us.

155
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,158
E v en when we're
on the toilet?

156
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,360
Arms like a cross
and 2 dictionaries!

157
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,126
Get your cripple goin'!

158
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,259
Get him out there!

159
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,269
Go!

160
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,965
Look at him go,
he's a champion!

161
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,071
Mine'll piss in
your champion's e y e!

162
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,246
My turtle's got no cock
and no balls either!

163
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,011
If your grand'ma
heard ya!

164
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,117
Holy Mos es!

165
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,085
Let's go!
The y'll beat us up!

166
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,936
Go on! Kill 'im!

167
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,874
Knock his teeth out!

168
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,840
Bastard!

169
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,380
Red!
Son of a Red! Red!

170
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,916
Red! Red!
Son of a Red!

171
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,297
Come, Fando.

172
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,027
U s e the hall.
Don't be afraid of the dark.

173
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:08,910
Go on.

174
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,252
You said
a bad word today?

175
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,757
Who squealed?

176
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,326
I know what you said.

177
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,918
Giv e me your finger.

178
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,894
That'll teach you
not to say that.

179
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,993
This kid's
a little girl.

180
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,369
Wears his spigot
on the right, not left.

181
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,874
You can s ee
his pa wasn't a Christian.

182
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,237
My pa made me walk alone...

183
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,276
in the dark...

184
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:43,012
with a torch. Awful shadows
danced on the walls.

185
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,417
I wasn't afraid.

186
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,891
You're just a wet hen,
a coward.

187
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,829
H igh time you looked
after yours elf.

188
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,832
Afraid of the dark.

189
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,693
H is spigot on the right.

190
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,863
I'm not a chicken.
You'll s ee!

191
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,750
Fando, get down.
You'll kill yours elf.

192
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,053
Fando,
you'll kill yours elf!

193
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,487
Gran'pa is v ery sick.

194
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,464
You must be brav e.

195
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,111
Peace on this hous e
and family. Amen.

196
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,951
The Lord forgiv es you
all sins committed...

197
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,756
by s cent...

198
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,125
by the ears...

199
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,760
the heart...

200
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,130
and all adv ances.

201
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,746
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost, so be it.

202
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,030
Come, holy saints and angels...

203
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,660
Take his soul
and pres ent it to the Most H igh.

204
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,261
May Christ who called you
now re ceiv e you

205
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,706
and the angels lead you
to Abraham's bosom.

206
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,109
Take his soul
and pres ent it to the Most H igh.

207
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,134
Come kiss your gran'pa
who's just died.

208
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,740
By this holy agony
and in H is sweet mercy,

209
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,948
may the Lord pardon you all sins
committed with your e y es.

210
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:15,772
Pleas e, Lord, hav e mercy
on our departed grandfather.

211
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,746
Don't punish him
for his deeds...

212
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,317
for he meant
to do Your will.

213
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:25,149
As true faith bound him
to the Belie v ers here...

214
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,247
now may Your mercy place him
in the choir of angels on high.

215
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,261
Don't stand there, come in.

216
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,639
Ask for mercy.

217
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:51,777
Pray with me.
May God keep granpa's soul...

218
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,009
and not punish him
for his deeds.

219
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,484
We must make a sacrifice
so he can go to heav en today.

220
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,136
Beat me!

221
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,070
Faster!

222
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,272
Harder!

223
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,902
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna hurt you.

224
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,999
You're my only friend.

225
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,004
You're not like Aunt Clara.

226
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,124
H it him once!

227
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,474
3 times.

228
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,974
The other hand.

229
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,172
All right.

230
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,416
3 times real hard.

231
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,024
Harder.

232
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,156
That's enough.

233
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,125
It's not your turn.

234
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,330
Once.

235
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,397
- Once, but hurt him!
- Damn!

236
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,277
Your turn now.
H urry up!

237
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,144
Go on, a hard one.

238
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,274
Good! Not bad.
The little ol' priest...

239
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,976
oughta bless your whip.

240
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:13,208
Cut his nuts off!
Put 'em in his mouth, dirty priest.

241
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,806
Cut off his balls!

242
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,976
Cram 'em in his trap!

243
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,950
Oh, my balls!

244
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,894
How tasty the y are!

245
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:31,195
Thank You, Lord,
for this divine dish.

246
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,704
God, You gav e them to me
and took them away.

247
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,142
Bless ed be Your holy name.

248
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:06,647
Light trav els at 186,390 mps...

249
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,954
less than 1 s e cond
to go around the equator.

250
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:16,225
Most stars' light
takes y ears to reach us.

251
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,768
The North Star
takes about 40 y ears.

252
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,305
With a huge teles cope,
the y calculated the distance...

253
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:27,240
to a star millions
of miles away.

254
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:30,779
This star's light takes
10 thousand y ears to arriv e.

255
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,941
We s ee it now as it was
10 thousand y ears ago.

256
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:38,020
Its light existed
before the pyramids.

257
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,214
For centuries
and centuries...

258
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,356
Into the clos et
with the rats!

259
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,757
The maquisards again!

260
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,490
It's the terrorists!

261
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:56,963
It's the Reds!

262
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,333
Why don't you e v er talk
to me about Papa?

263
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,906
Why should I
make you suffer?

264
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,180
Why talk about
your Papa?

265
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,250
Why tell you
he was a traitor?

266
00:59:55,925 --> 01:00:00,021
Thrown into prison, that he e v en
tried to commit suicide?

267
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,873
I sacrificed my whole life for you
and this is the thanks I get.

268
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,242
You must belie v e me.

269
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,444
Your father is dead.

270
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:25,980
Where're you going?

271
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,750
Come here!

272
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:28,380
Fando!

273
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,715
Go on,

274
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:32,913
kill him!

275
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,035
What're you doing here?

276
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:33,039
Maybe my father's here.

277
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,467
H is name's Tosan.

278
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,913
Sure, sure,

279
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:40,482
I remember him.

280
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,016
So you're his son?

281
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,114
Where is he now?

282
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,320
Better ask the court.

283
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,167
H e tried to commit suicide.

284
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,027
We're inv estigating
your father.

285
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:50,169
When we learn something,
we'll notify your mother.

286
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:11,674
What's he got?

287
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,079
Lung trouble,
as if the air here stifles him.

288
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,981
My poor baby.

289
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,678
Madame,
your son has TB.

290
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,312
H e must be s ent
to the clinic boat.

291
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,237
Burn his theater.
It's contaminated.

292
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:32,810
I'm sick, maybe I'll die.
I'v e got to find Papa.

293
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:48,253
I got Pa's Dr. Plumb
and some shag.

294
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:52,357
I put some orange peel
in the pouch y esterday.

295
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:56,370
Today the tobacco
feels fresh.

296
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:59,669
Since the pipe's s easoned,
when it goes out...

297
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:02,209
it giv es off
a nice smell.

298
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,836
It's Papa's
Dr. Plumb pipe.

299
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:08,849
Maybe it was on his table
when he tried to commit suicide.

300
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,262
The treatment
began 6 months ago.

301
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,596
There's no
improv ement at all.

302
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,671
The cavity is wors e.
We'll hav e to operate.

303
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:52,259
Tomorrow you'll be
operated on at the hospital.

304
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,992
Did you turn him in?

305
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:30,064
Not so loud.
People can hear us.

306
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,655
You turned Papa in?

307
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,167
I only told the truth.

308
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:37,397
If he'd confess ed,
the y'd hav e gone easier on him.

309
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,699
Thanks to my testimony...

310
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,938
and my submissiv e attitude...

311
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,709
the y were more
indulgent with him...

312
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:54,621
but he insulted me
and said I'd betray ed him.

313
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,714
All my life he repaid
my goodness with e vil.

314
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,591
Colonel...

315
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,926
my husband's been corrupted
by progressiv e ideas.

316
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,601
H e's an enemy
of the nation.

317
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,710
As a soldier and a man
your duty is...

318
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,979
to pre v ent him
from further endangering...

319
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:58,882
his wife,
children and country.

320
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,113
Arrest him.

321
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,800
- Did you help him in prison?
- I couldn't.

322
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,876
I suffered
more than him.

323
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:27,875
Why do we always talk
about the past?

324
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,042
We can't do anything
to change it.

325
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:35,383
I wish
you'd stop worrying...

326
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,985
and forget
the unhappy past.

327
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,857
Why was he
in a mad cell?

328
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,260
How'd you know that?

329
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:47,934
H e didn't go mad in prison.
H e always was.

330
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:51,028
If not, how could he hav e
committed all thos e sins?

331
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:57,334
May God keep me from speaking
ill of my belov ed husband.

332
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,004
H e tried
to commit suicide.

333
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,843
I should'v e been the one.

334
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,247
I could'v e
gone crazy with pain...

335
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:06,844
but I had to stay sane
to look after you...

336
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,980
and get you
out of this mess.

337
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,682
I'v e failed.

338
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:16,023
A lifetime of sacrifice
for nothing!

339
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:20,259
I had to turn him in
for your good...

340
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:23,803
Your own good.

341
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,609
But now he's dead.

342
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,678
No, he's not dead.

343
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,303
I hav e proof for you.

344
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:38,879
The pipe your father
always smoked.

345
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,021
It was in his jacket
pocket the day...

346
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:47,751
he was exe cuted.

347
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,597
H ere's where
the bullet hit it.

348
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,064
It's proof
he's really dead.

349
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:04,879
That, Fando...

350
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,608
is my Dr. Plumb pipe.

351
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,308
Dr. Plumb?

352
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,683
Yes, Dr. Plumb.
It's the only pipe I smoke.

353
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,145
You'v e already
grown up, son.

354
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,849
Cut off
your father's balls.

355
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,987
Fando! Fando!

356
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,993
Your father's es caped
into the maquis.

357
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:55,995
Come on,
we'll look for him.

358
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:55,111
Traitors will be
relentlessly hunted down.

359
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:59,853
If ne cessary,
we will kill half the country.

360
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:02,020
Long liv e Death!
