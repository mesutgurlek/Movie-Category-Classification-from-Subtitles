Oh, a mother had three sons

11
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,565
There was a war

12
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:56,930
The mother doesn't have three sons

13

September, 12. I killed a crow.
The weather is nice.

14
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:30,764
Niki.

15
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,324
You've missed your aim, Ivan.

16
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:51,689
There exist gases that amuse a human soul.

17
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:51,721
Where is the enemy?

18
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,802
- Everything rushed and
buzzed along Ukrainian paths.

19
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:08,843
Give back, foe, our Ukrainian boots!

20
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:50,170
- For three hundred years I was
tortured by the damned Katsap.

21
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:56,610
Is it about me?

22
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:17,809
Arrived at the post,
at "Volynskyi".

23
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:38,365
- I can't go further, comrades. Here is a slope.
The breaks broke.

24
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,482
You drive? - No.

25
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:54,042
You drive? - No.

26
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,803
You drive?

27
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:16,566
- Calm down, lads,
we'll fix the breaks by ourselves.

28
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,928
- By the name of the Ukrainian
People's Republic, lay down the weapons!

29
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:51,569
By the name of the Ukrainian nation?

30
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,484
Who said that?

31
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:47,405
How to steer the train?

32
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,889
Move, Havrylo!

33
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:40,522
Hey, move, Havrylo!

34
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:57,879
Hey, move, move up, Havrylo!

35
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:23,846
Turn the piston!

36
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:59,600
I will become an engine operator.

37
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,563
Who?

38
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,963
Who?

39
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:07,643
Who?

40
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:19,408
Who?

41
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:03,239
- Demobilized soldier from the Arsenal,
I have an honour to come back.

42
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,688
Ukrainian?

43
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:22,883
Deserter?

44
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:49,970
Go back, Timish, to the barracks.

45
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,280
The time will come and revolution
committee will call you.

46
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:09,726
Let us pray to God for our God-saved free
mother-Ukraine...

47
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:40,925
Orthodox people!

48
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,808
Gymnasia pupils!

49
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:56,128
Students!

50
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:01,003
Teachers!

51
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:05,039
Teachers!

52
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,480
Co-operators!

53
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,603
Actors!

54
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:39,810
Long live!

55
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,365
Let, let it be!

56
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,604
Let! Let! Let it be!

57
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,929
For three hundred years we were...

58
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,087
The Christ will rise from the dead!

59
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:36,681
The Christ has risen from the dead!

60
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:01,648
Do you know who Bohdan Khmelnytskyi was?

61
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:11,763
One of the Khokhol's generals.

62
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:42,284
Soldiers! The Central Council calls upon you!

63
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:57,848
- I wonder, can we kill bourgeois
and officers on a street if we meet them?

64
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:01,561
And you are Ukrainian?

65
00:40:08,691 --> 00:40:10,283
Yes, a worker.

66
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:19,570
Yes, a worker.

67
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:16,410
- We have the congress here as good people do
- the first Pan-Ukrainian one.

68
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:55,361
- This is that Ukrainian presidium,
which the teacher told us about.

69
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,964
- The representative of the Bolsheviks
is taking the floor.

70
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:42,887
- We, workers, we support Ukraine too,
but we demand factories, land...

71
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:48,284
The Soviet power!

72
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:24,316
Let us see how you will commit
the self-justice

73
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:27,882
over unarmed representatives
of workers and peasants!

74
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:13,449
- Well, good, you say that the
power is Ukrainian, than whom land belongs?

75
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:33,959
And land belongs to lords or peasants?

76
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:43,563
- The floor is taken by general
ataman Symon Petliura.

77
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:46,526
- Gentlemen, we have received the
greeting from the Black Sea Fleet.

78
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:22,041
Do not lie to our brothers and sons,
because they'll see soon your

79
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:27,205
reality and you will be cursed
by all Ukraine's sons.

80
00:48:40,771 --> 00:48:46,001
Do not rely on the Black Sea Fleet,

81
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:50,926
because we will be the first ones who will aim
twenty-inch guns at you.

82
00:49:02,851 --> 00:49:06,161
Gentlemen, this is mistake...
I'm voting, gentlemen.

83
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:13,879
Who is for to considerthis a mistake?

84
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:06,047
Who is against?

85
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:11,970
Dreadnought Maria!

86
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:20,725
Three apostles!

87
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,249
Donbas! Poltava!

88
00:50:36,211 --> 00:50:37,326
Bohunians!

89
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:42,645
Taraschanians!

90
00:50:47,051 --> 00:50:48,803
Arsenal was listening.

91
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:20,409
Strike.

92
00:54:46,371 --> 00:54:49,647
The proletariat is cancelling trains.

93
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:13,848
Arsenal.

94
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:32,570
Well, lads, let us start working!

95
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,485
Come on!

96
01:02:11,211 --> 01:02:13,202
It seems they are shooting already.

97
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:54,766
I bow low...

98
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:09,807
I bow down to the raw earth for you...

99
01:05:35,011 --> 01:05:36,888
And what is the address?

100
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:04,208
Whom should the letter be addressed to?

101
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:41,727
He bowed down to the raw earth for you...

102
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:51,617
And asked everybody
of you whether one can kill

103
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:55,683
bourgeoises and officers
outdoors if one meets them.

104
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:06,203
Yes you can!

105
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:00,887
Bakhmach and Nizhyn are flooded with blood.

106
01:09:11,531 --> 01:09:16,286
Hey you, my brothers, comrades in arms...

107
01:09:26,011 --> 01:09:30,880
Served for four years and was in four wars...

108
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:39,407
And one year as a civil, brothers...

109
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:51,405
Petliura wounded me by a bullet,
and I feel my heroic death.

110
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:12,863
Bury me at home for a half an hour.
I have not seen it for nine years.

111
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:15,884
Hurry up, brothers, Arsenal is dying.

112
01:11:36,531 --> 01:11:39,682
Hey, you, our battle horses!

113
01:11:46,331 --> 01:11:49,129
Hurry up to bury our friend...

114
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:06,161
The dead fighter of the revolution!

115
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:18,725
We hear...

116
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:30,251
We hear, our masters!

117
01:12:34,731 --> 01:12:37,450
We are rushing on our 24 legs!

118
01:14:31,531 --> 01:14:35,968
- Take, mother, we have no time to explain.
Our life and death are revolutionary.

119
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:59,769
Armoured vehicle "Vilna Ukraina"
("Free Ukraine").

120
01:15:58,371 --> 01:16:02,046
You toppled over our "Free Ukraine".

121
01:16:11,211 --> 01:16:16,649
- Stand with your face to the wall
so I could kill you in your back.

122
01:18:06,411 --> 01:18:09,244
Can you if I look into your eyes?

123
01:18:18,211 --> 01:18:20,771
And why can I?

124
01:19:05,851 --> 01:19:08,206
Seventy second hour.

125
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:27,361
What weather will we have tomorrow?

126
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:36,946
We stopped...
I think that tomorrow we will be done.

127
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,842
We stopped...
We moved and then stopped.

128
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:20,484
Shells!

129
01:23:52,171 --> 01:23:54,526
Where is the father?

130
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:58,050
Where is the husband?

131
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:04,084
Where is the son?

132
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:25,449
- Where is metalworker?
- We do not have one.

133
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:34,563
- Where is the smith?
- We do not have one.

134
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:24,322
Freeze! Name yourself!

135
01:26:38,691 --> 01:26:41,489
A Ukrainian worker. Shoot at me!

136
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:06,681
- Down! Down...
You are wearing an armour, or what?

137
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:51,710
The film was restored
on the "MOSFILM" studio in 1972

138
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:55,665
Music, conductor - V. Ovchinnikov

139
01:27:55,951 --> 01:27:59,739
The End
