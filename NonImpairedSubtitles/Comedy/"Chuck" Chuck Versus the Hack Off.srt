1
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:02,170
<i>Hi I'm Chuck.</i>

2
00:00:02,195 --> 00:00:03,495
<i>Here are a few things that
you might need to know.</i>

3
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:06,038
<i>You need to learn there are
repercussions for your actions.</i>

4
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:07,540
<i>So, you're under arrest.</i>

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,659
- For what?
- Attempted homicide.

6
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,046
John Casey, you're
under arrest for murder.

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,027
How are you holding up?

8
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,363
Well, the government
I proudly served for 20 years

9
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,565
has locked me up with
the scum of the earth.

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,599
I'm great.

11
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,070
Hold out your hand.

12
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:43,709
What is that?

13
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:44,744
We have a plan

14
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,912
to get you out of here.
- Just take it, okay?

15
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,814
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

16
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,249
to shrink blueprints
down to this size?

17
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,817
The guy at Kinkos
thought I was crazy.

18
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,653
Put that away. I am not
breaking out of prison.

19
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,755
Casey, there is a very strong
case against you.

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,758
Escape might be your only option
to get your life back.

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,093
If I break out of prison,
I'm a fugitive.

22
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,629
<i>I don't run from the law.
I am the law!</i>

23
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,499
Now, Decker has me in here
for a reason.

24
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,467
I'm gonna sit tight,
keep my head down,

25
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,336
you figure out
what his angle is, okay?

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,337
Fine.

27
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,772
You gonna be
okay in here?

28
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,942
Yeah... if that one
doesn't drive me insane.

29
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,478
Okay, I admit it,

30
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,114
I tried to poison you
to keep you subordinate.

31
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,349
What is the big deal?

32
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,350
I could have died.

33
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,584
But you didn't!

34
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,852
All right, look,

35
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,639
recently I put some people
that I care about through a...

36
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,358
through some rough times.

37
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,260
That's the thing:
true friendship is,

38
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,928
uh, it's confusing, isn't it?

39
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:41,400
Mm. Look, guys, please, just,
ah, tell me what I have to do

40
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,818
to get out of this place.

41
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,805
It's so simple.
Okay, Jeff has agreed

42
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,306
to drop all charges
under one condition.

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,541
Okay.

44
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,610
You promise not to poison
him anymore.

45
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,629
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I can't promise that.

46
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,715
Wake up, man! You are gonna get
yourself killed in this...!

47
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,117
You know what? It doesn't
matter. I don't care, all right?

48
00:01:58,135 --> 00:01:59,451
Good luck in prison.
You know what?

49
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,221
No, good luck to you both
finding a better Indian guy

50
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,223
in your life
or at the Buy More!

51
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,975
I will see you both in hell!

52
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,827
Which is just what I call
"visiting hours."

53
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,180
John, let's go back inside,
bench press some poundage.

54
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,631
I'm gonna look
like a Hindu Michelangelo

55
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,400
by the time I get out of here.

56
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,684
Why, you...
John, move!

57
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,905
I told him I was in here
for parking tickets.

58
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,641
It takes every fiber of my body
not to drop that barbell

59
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,876
right on his throat.

60
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,512
Visiting hours are now over.

61
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,214
I gotta get back in there.

62
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,184
Check into Decker,
but be careful.

63
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,153
He's capable of anything.

64
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:44,830
Thank you.

65
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,432
I can't help feeling
like Casey going

66
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,850
to prison
is all my fault.

67
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,435
What? Why would
you say that?

68
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,637
'Cause I'm the genius who
started the private spy company

69
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,305
and convinced you both
to work with me.

70
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,473
Chuck, that's not true.

71
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,308
Decker wanted Casey in jail
no matter what.

72
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,177
I mean, whether we worked
for ourselves or the CIA,

73
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,511
it doesn't really matter.

74
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,047
And I'm not just saying that
to make you feel better.

75
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,251
Well, maybe a little.

76
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,952
Thank you.

77
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:07,920
Chuck, you've got...

78
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,721
Sarah, you got a...

79
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,055
Oh, no.

80
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,601
Sorry for the theatrics
getting you here.

81
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,804
Sometimes it's
just more fun

82
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,574
to knock somebody out
and toss them in a van.

83
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,725
Why'd you bring us here?

84
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,228
I need you to do a job for me.

85
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,746
You throw our partner
in jail

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,614
and now you want
a favor from us?

87
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,417
In exchange, I will make all
of his charges disappear.

88
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,555
Think of Mr. Casey as a
giant slab of leverage.

89
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,940
We all know that stubborn
bastard will rot in prison

90
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,392
unless I say otherwise.

91
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,094
You have the entire CIA
under your thumb. Why us?

92
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,896
This mission involves some

93
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:53,132
extremely dangerous
technological terrorism.

94
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,467
Sure, I have agents
who can write code,

95
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,120
but none who can do
it as well as you can

96
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,905
and handle themselves
in the field.

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,174
There's no room for error here.

98
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,609
We need you.

99
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,251
Okay, we're listening.

100
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,921
We've been tracking a computer
supervirus named the "Omen."

101
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:18,724
Tech has only able to uncover
bits and pieces,

102
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,861
but they assured me they've
never seen anything like it:

103
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,263
metamorphic code capable
of erasing

104
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,965
100 zettabytes of data
per second.

105
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,868
What does any of that mean?

106
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,770
It means that this virus could
essentially wipe out

107
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,640
every database in the world in,
oh, five seconds.

108
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,509
And just as we were
zeroing in on its origin,

109
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,846
all signs of it disappeared.
That's why I need you.

110
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,117
Locate the Omen, bring it back
to me, Mr. Casey goes free.

111
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,887
And what if we say no?

112
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,922
I have men on the inside

113
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,291
who can make your friend's life
a living hell.

114
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,360
Though, to be honest,

115
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,695
I imagine hell will have no
trouble finding him in there.

116
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,302
No fights.
Keep your nose clean.

117
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:10,509
Harder than I thought.

118
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,327
What do you think
you're doing, inmate?!

119
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,399
Sorry if I got too physical.

120
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,000
It's the uniform.

121
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:37,403
Don't apologize.
I actually enjoyed it.

122
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,905
Thought you would.

123
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,275
Look, I'm glad you came
to see me.

124
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,860
I have something
to discuss with you.

125
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,562
Uh-uh! I'm all for business,

126
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,280
but first,
wouldn't you like

127
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:53,185
to take advantage of your
state-given right?

128
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,039
What right is that?

129
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:00,059
A conjugal visit.

130
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,965
I would very much like
to take advantage of that right.

131
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,200
I thought you might.

132
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,975

00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,772
Maybe next time.

142
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,243
What's on your mind?

143
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:11,345
Listen, Bartowski and Walker
are damn good spies,

144
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,614
but I don't like that
they're down a man,

145
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,315
especially if Decker is up
to something.

146
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,251
So you want me my team
to track them?

147
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,886
Make sure they're safe?

148
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,454
Not your team, you.

149
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,723
I figured you could take
my place.

150
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:27,010
Right, I'm gonna take orders
from Ward and June Cleaver.

151
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:30,180
It was just a suggestion.

152
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,382
Well, stop making suggestions.

153
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,434
Okay. I'm done.

154
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,996
It is hard to say no to you.

155
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,581
I know.

156
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:49,447
I hate this.

157
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,315
I mean, do you remember
why we started

158
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,616
Carmichael Industries
to begin with?

159
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:54,768
Corporate discount on the
pinball machine, right?

160
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,954
Ha. We did it to gain
independence.

161
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,739
And where are we now?
Beholden to Decker,

162
00:07:58,773 --> 00:07:59,874
the exact type of person

163
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,375
we said we'd never deal
with again.

164
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,443
Stop it.

165
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,328
You know we're doing
this to find Casey.

166
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,463
I know, I know.

167
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:10,284
All right, let's find us
a virus, shall we?

168
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:13,154
Uh, what is happening?

169
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,723
Is that,
is that chardonnay?

170
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,425
I haven't seen this
in a long time.

171
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,727
We used to call this routine
"The Routine."

172
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,362
That's very creative.

173
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:22,646
Yeah.

174
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,682
Yeah, Chuck has
quite a reputation

175
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,067
as a hacker,
you know?

176
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:28,135
They used to call him
"The Piranha."

177
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,437
<i>Swordfish, right?</i>

178
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,322
The movie is based on him.
He doesn't like

179
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:33,841
to talk about it 'cause he doesn't
think it was a A-plus film.

180
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,242
Why? I thought
it was pretty good.

181
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,344
Yeah, it's okay, but it had
a lot of plot holes

182
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,512
and those hacker scenes
were just, like...

183
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:43,667
Someone coded the name
into the Telix-script!

184
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:46,370
A little inside joke for anyone
running viral countermeasures.

185
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:52,126
When The Piranha got really
into a coding session,

186
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,660
he could get a bit giddy.

187
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:55,162
Yeah, it's kind of cute.

188
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,364
Yeah, it's also super nerdy.

189
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,499
It's definitely that, too.

190
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:02,269
Got it!
The name was encrypted.

191
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:04,805
So I ran an elliptic curve
algorithm to find the key.

192
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,557
And of course after that,
it was cake.

193
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:12,113
Well, hello, Colin Davis--
the man behind the Omen virus.

194
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:14,081
Coming your way
in three, two, one.

195
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:17,451
Guy was a head programmer
at The Collective;

196
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:19,686
a rogue group of technological
terrorists who sold viruses

197
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,038
to the highest bidder.

198
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:23,407
Three months ago, he disappeared
with the key to the virus.

199
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,426
Drop off the grid
crazy-guy style. I like that.

200
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,128
Well, Mr. Colin Davis,
let's see

201
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:29,880
if you left us any clues
as to where you went.

202
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:32,716
Mm-hmm. Shoot. I promised Jeff
that I was gonna help him

203
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,301
with this whole Lester thing.

204
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:36,220
All right, guys,
you'll be okay here.

205
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,805
Oh, make sure
that he eats.

206
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,089
When he gets all plugged in,

207
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,391
he goes overboard
with the chardonnay.

208
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:41,408
Calls it his

209
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:42,209
"thinking juice."

210
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,516
Ah?
Ah.

211
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,987
Thanks, buddy!
Love you!

212
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:01,428
How's the brain, Mr. Grimes?

213
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:04,832
It's, uh, it's
okay, Thanks.

214
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:09,203
Casey sent me to help
with this Decker situation.

215
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,106
So, if you'll be so kind
as to take me to the newlyweds.

216
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,176
I can't, I can't bring
guests down to Castle.

217
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,794
Are you really gonna
make me use this?

218
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,797
You'd shoot me?

219
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,649
I'd beat you over
the head with it.

220
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:25,586
Well, this is Davis's
last known location.

221
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,104
He must have brought
the virus here.

222
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:29,824
Some kind of encampment
behind this barrier.

223
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:31,826
It looks like some sort
of separatist compound.

224
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,228
There could be a militia
training back there.

225
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:35,980
Mm, Casey would have
loved this mission.

226
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:37,431
And you're aware
that you're going

227
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,950
to get yourselves killed
without Casey?

228
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:42,936
I decided to let her in after
we had an adult conversation.

229
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:46,940
What are you doing here,
Verbanski?

230
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,943
Ease up, I'm not here to steal
any of your "precious secrets."

231
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:52,613
I'm here because I'm going
on this mission with you.

232
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:53,848
Oh, is that right?

233
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:57,117
Look, we both want
Casey out of jail.

234
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:59,453
You want
your partner back and I...

235
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:02,723
I-I hate to see the competition
struggle like this.

236
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:05,893
As far as I can tell, you need
a sniper on this mission.

237
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,294
I've done some
pretty amazing

238
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,064
<i>sniper work
on Call of Duty.</i>

239
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:12,182
I believe I've made my point.

240
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,140
Well, the sniper rifles are
behind you in the armory.

241
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:22,643
I'll bring my own.

242
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:32,653
Things can get really
nasty really fast,

243
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,855
if you're not running
with the crowd in here.

244
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,624
Is that a fact?

245
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:38,192
You know, you look like
you can use some friends.

246
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:40,661
And we could use some muscle
like you in the yard.

247
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:43,597
I'll expect your
answer tonight.

248
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:49,353
Dude, this place is no joke.

249
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,639
Especially for a guy
with unpaid parking tickets.

250
00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:52,606
What do you want?

251
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,393
<i>Look, I've seen Caged Heat.</i>

252
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,011
I know how
to survive in prison.

253
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,446
You gotta be
the shot-caller,

254
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:00,948
and I think I've figured out
a way to do that.

255
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:04,068
<i>You know, Caged Heat was
a women's prison movie.</i>

256
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:06,620
Well, the lessons remain
the same, John.

257
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:10,357
Hey, homes.

258
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,992
Got that 12-gauge
you wanted, man.

259
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:13,627
Word.

260
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:15,663
Drop it in my cell.
Done.

261
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:35,516
All right.
Easier than I thought.

262
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,774
That sounds like some kind
of military drill.

263
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:45,943
I'll look for cover.
Get ready for action.

264
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:06,380
Okay, this is definitely
not a militia...

265
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:09,116
Sarah, Sarah, I think
we walked into a cult.

266
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,952
Way ahead of you.
Strip. Now.

267
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,471
What-What-What-What?
What are you doing?

268
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:15,139
What are you doing?
Joining a cult.

269
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:16,724
Strip. Come on.

270
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:29,537
Now keep a close eye.
I really have

271
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,871
no place
to hide a gun.

272
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,189
Not too close
an eye, though.

273
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,408
I'm serious, for real,
no looking, thank you.

274
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:36,310
Calm down.
No one's looking at anything.

275
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,913
Not much to look at, anyway.

276
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,164
That is not fair.

277
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,866
I have nothing
to be ashamed of.

278
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:45,152
Children...

279
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,254
are you lost?

280
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,757
Can I help the new arrivals
find their way?

281
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:54,195
Uh, we were told to come
here to seek enlightenment.

282
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:56,630
Then enlightenment
you shall find.

283
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,883
Please... help yourself
to some robes.

284
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,035
Welcome...

285
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:04,371
to the Church of
the Eternal Wind.

286
00:14:04,406 --> 00:14:06,474
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

287
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:08,109
We'll just...

288
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,046
We have uninvited guests.

289
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,581
Find out who they are.

290
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:20,721
We have a situation.

291
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,506
It's a little...
little chilly under here.

292
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,840
These are very
short robes, huh?

293
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,242
Well, the church believes
that the spirit

294
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,560
enters from underneath.

295
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,428
Well, that's a totally
natural entry point.

296
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:46,715
Uh, that's
an interesting pendant.

297
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:49,651
I imagine it has some kind
of significance for you?

298
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:51,269
All members of the church
wear a pendant

299
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,887
to remind them of
their past lives.

300
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:55,490
I worked on Wall Street,
lived the fast life.

301
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,859
Till I came here.

302
00:14:57,894 --> 00:14:59,561
Not looking for
a life story here.

303
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:01,563
Figure out where Davis is,
locate the virus.

304
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,732
My patience is wearing thin.

305
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,735
You know, my wife and I
were looking for an escape

306
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:07,919
from our everyday chaos,

307
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,038
and then our friend
Colin Davis recommended we come

308
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:11,506
and check out
your church here.

309
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,291
Oh, Colin-- what
a caring man.

310
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,743
Now we call him Moon Meadow.

311
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:16,094
That's his wind name.

312
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,848
Uh, do you know where we could
find Moon Meadow?

313
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:20,849
We'd love to see him.

314
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:22,250
Mm.

315
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:25,354
I believe he's leading a
drum circle, in the garden.

316
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,689
It's mostly free-form,
experimental drumming.

317
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:29,775
There'll definitely be
some jamming as well.

318
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,393
Sounds like fun.

319
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:32,644
Yeah! Let's go
check it out. Okay.

320
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,935
Hey. How you
holding up, man?

321
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:42,204
I didn't think it would

322
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:43,605
be this hard without
Lester around.

323
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,774
I'm starting to forget him.

324
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:47,976
I can't even picture what
Lester looks like anymore.

325
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,111
Close your eyes.

326
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:55,317
Imagine David Beckham.

327
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:57,786
Lester's a shorter,
feminine version of his wife.

328
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,021
Right.
I can see him now.

329
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:02,157
Yeah.

330
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:05,477
Look, when I went through
my dark period,

331
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:06,895
I alienated
a lot of friends.

332
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,030
But thankfully, for me,
I was able to realize

333
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:10,682
what I was about to lose,
before it was too late.

334
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,651
We just have to make
sure he knows

335
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:13,835
what's slipping
away here.

336
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,437
I totally get it.

337
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:16,738
This reminds me of the time

338
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:18,073
my dad tried to win back my mom

339
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,974
when he heard she was having sex
with Uncle Steve.

340
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,043
They ended up
as a threesome.

341
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:23,879
I had a messed-up
childhood.

342
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:25,480
Yeah, you did.

343
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:26,982
But, you know what?

344
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:29,451
It actually gives me
a great idea

345
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:30,919
how to handle Lester.

346
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:34,222
It's not a threesome.

347
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:36,291
These people dropped everything
and came here.

348
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,043
- Can you imagine?
- Yeah, it's crazy.

349
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,212
I mean, I don't know what
I'd do if I left the spy life.

350
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,763
Sometimes I'm so
caught up in it,

351
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:43,432
I can't think of a
world outside of it.

352
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,133
Well, you're really good
at computers, Chuck.

353
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,384
I mean, you love them.

354
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:48,720
Yeah... maybe.

355
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,643
I got eyes on Davis.

356
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:56,194
I'm in position

357
00:16:56,229 --> 00:17:00,565
to shoot any and all
of these filthy hippies.

358
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:03,017
It's almost like
Casey never left.

359
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,119
Okay, stay focused.

360
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,537
This is over as soon
as we find the virus.

361
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:06,588
So let's just
get in and get out.

362
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:19,901
I found
their clothes.

363
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,837
And these were
with them.

364
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,277
Chuck, Casey needs us.

365
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:48,897
Wrap up the Phish concert,
make a move.

366
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:58,423
All right!

367
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:03,011

368

All right.

370
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:09,801
So, uh, you worked
in tech, huh?

371
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,636
Oh... a lifetime ago.

374

You know, I used to work
in computers, as well.

375
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,429
You mind if I take
a look at that?

00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:13,921
a chip and
a distribution device--

475
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:16,123
it's like a modded
USB drive.

476
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:17,958
You insert the chip
into the device,

477
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:21,528
and the virus
can be uploaded...

478
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,464
to any system.

479
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:26,633
I'm hoping you didn't
swallow the device, as well.

480
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:29,937
No, it's still locked up
at The Collective,

481
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:31,905
my former employer.

482
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,440
Right. Right,
right, right.

483
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:36,093
Uh, so-so what you're saying
then is we just need to

484
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:38,512
sneak past a few hackers
and get the device back?

485
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,247
No, it's not that easy.

486
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:42,316
There are some
extremely dangerous people

487
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,284
selling these viruses.

488
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,420
Can you help us get in?

489
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:48,639
Best I can do is access
the schematics of the building,

490
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,090
show you where they're
storing the device.

491
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,959
Okay, great.
That's a great start.

492
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,944
Thank you.
I'll go grab a computer.

493
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,700
Listen, is there anything
I can get you while I'm up?

494
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:00,701
Our kitchen's fully stocked.

495
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:02,286
Sandwich? Nachos?

496
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,937
We have some of those
gourmet jellybeans.

497
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:05,973
You have the kind that tastes
like buttered popcorn?

498
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:09,043
I think I can make that happen.

499
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:13,547
A snack?

500
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:14,715
Casey's in lockdown,

501
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:17,167
and this jerk
wants jellybeans?

502
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:20,838
We should just cut him open
and get that chip out right now.

503
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,858
You know, I know that we're not
partners or friends

504
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,894
or anything like that,
but are you okay?

505
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:28,679
You seem to be on
edge ever since

506
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,130
we started the mission.
I'm fine.

507
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,066
Really? 'Cause we can
talk about it if you want.

508
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,067
No, no, no, no.

509
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,668
We-We don't talk, okay?

510
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:35,869
I'm-I'm just off.

511
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,671
Stop trying to be
my shrink.

512
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,690
Okay.

513
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:47,915
Is it, um... about Casey?

514
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:53,287
I just noticed that you have
some emotions for him.

515
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:57,091
Can we stop with this garbage
and just get to work?

516
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,759
You know, you can still
have feelings for somebody

517
00:25:58,793 --> 00:25:59,893
and still be a good spy.

518
00:25:59,928 --> 00:26:01,895
Oh, and be like you
and Mr. Hospitality?

519
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,397
That's my fate?

520
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,381
No.

521
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,433
No, no, no.

522
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:16,226
So I've been noticing
Lester popping up online

523
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:17,811
about the same
time every day.

524
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:19,446
Fancy prison.

525
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:20,981
Yeah, right.

526
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,216
So, look, we
initiate a chat,

527
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,552
and then we begin Operation:
Scare Lester Straight.

528
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:26,820
Ready?

529
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:35,929
Hello, friends.

530
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:38,532
Guess you couldn't
live without me, huh?

531
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:41,168
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
to tell you this,

532
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:42,569
but, uh, we've been
interviewing people

533
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:44,371
to fill your spot
at the Buy More.

534
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:46,673
Oh, come on. Right.

535
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,709
What, are you gonna
just-just replace me?

536
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:50,594
Actually, he just
showed up.

537
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,100
Who is this fool?

538
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,853
This is our new Nerd Herder,
Vali Chandrasekaren.

539
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:02,422
Oh, come on!

540
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:03,824
That is a pretty stupid name.

541
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:05,359
Where are you from,
Mr. Fake Name?

542
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:06,760
Look at my face.

543
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:09,263
You can't tell I'm from
Montreal, like all true Hinjews?

544
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:10,531
Oh, no, you did not.

545
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:12,232
I did. And I am.

546
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:13,567
Listen, I just wanted
to say thanks

547
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:15,269
for giving up your spot
at the Buy More.

548
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:16,570
Some great people here.

549
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:19,289
I'm excited to start
getting to know everybody.

550
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,258
Lester, you should hear
this guy's singing voice.

551
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,376
Like an angel.

552
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,443
Come on.

553
00:27:23,478 --> 00:27:24,511
It really is though.

554
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:26,547
♪ O Canada ♪

555
00:27:36,224 --> 00:27:37,758
That's just a little bit,
you know.

556
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,459
My word.

557
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:41,295
You know, many people say
it's the type of voice

558
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:44,798
that would go perfectly
with a-- I don't know-- keytar.

559
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:49,469
May I have a moment alone
with Jeffrey, please?

560
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:51,822
Of course.
Sure, sure.

561
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:57,444
Well done, well done.

562
00:27:57,462 --> 00:27:58,879
Yeah, yeah, perfect.
You nailed it.

563
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,581
Your voice-- wow, you
really underplayed it.

564
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:01,948
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah.

565
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:03,500
You earned this.

566
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,786
Okay, this one's just Wi-Fi.

567
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,821
You know, the Indian Modeling
Agency, they said that

568
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:11,358
you'd give me one of the good
ones if I helped you out, so...

569
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,463
You know this comes
out of my salary.

570
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:19,149
Don't care one bit.

571
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:20,984
Jackpot!

572
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:24,838
Who's the new guy?

573
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,106
Don't worry about it.

574
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,141
I'll find out myself.

575
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,615
You know, it is amazing.

576
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:37,784
They're like little
popcorn pills, you know?

577
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:38,952
Whoa, whoa!

578
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:40,721
What are you doing?
He agreed to help us.

579
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:43,056
I just wanted to extend
our full hospitality

580
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,958
to our guest, make sure
he's perfectly comfortable

581
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:46,493
while we wait

582
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:47,861
patiently for the chip.

583
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,396
I was just telling
your partner...

584
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,398
He's not my
partner. Go on.

585
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:54,234
The Collective has
an unbreakable security system.

586
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:56,520
But it does have one weakness.

587
00:28:56,554 --> 00:28:58,338
It can be
manipulated

588
00:28:58,356 --> 00:28:59,890
from the inside.

589
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,079
Man, these jellybeans
taste... funny.

590
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:09,583
Just speeding up
the process a little bit.

591
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:31,171
You've got something
on your shirt.

592
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:34,007
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

593
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,344
Keep it in the can.
Keep it in the trash can.

594
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:42,699
What do you think?

595
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,866
Do I look like a hacker?

596
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:45,101
Is the beanie overkill?

597
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:46,202
You look perfect.

598
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:49,239
Okay, I found a duct opening

599
00:29:49,273 --> 00:29:51,274
on the east corner,
just below the roof.

600
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:52,675
Okay, we have our entry.

601
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,711
At exactly 2200 hours,
we'll be in the server room,

602
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:56,412
waiting for you to override
the security system.

603
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:57,780
Got it.

604
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:58,781
Be careful, babe.

605
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:00,016
You, too.

606
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,963
I'm here for a job.

607
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:24,407
You realize what happens
if you don't get the job?

608
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:28,144
I do.

609
00:30:50,634 --> 00:30:52,935
Welcome to The
Collective,

610
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:55,038
the very best of
the very best.

611
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,290
You said you
want a job.

612
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:58,658
Let's prove it.

613
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,077
Sit.

614
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,879
Okay.

615
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:03,913
Hi.

616
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,951
Freddie is my
best programmer.

617
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,420
If you can
prove your skills

618
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:11,954
up against him,

619
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:13,990
then you have the job.

620
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:15,675
But if you fail...

621
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:21,464
...you might not be
so fortunate.

622
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:25,184
So, a good old-fashioned
hack off, huh?

623
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,154
Great. Perfect.

624
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,472
I'm just gonna take a moment to

625
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,274
get prepared,
if you don't-don't mind.

626
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:37,030
Boom.

627
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:38,948
Oh, once you've had Rombauer,

628
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,701
you just can't go back
to any other Chardonnay.

629
00:31:41,752 --> 00:31:42,835
Who are you?

630
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,520
I've been out of the
game for a little while,

631
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,789
but they used to call me
The Piranha.

632
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,841
There's no way.

633
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:54,547
Let's do this, huh?

634
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,147
Okay,

635
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,815
the first person
that hacks

636
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,734
into Federal Reserve
and transfers

637
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:17,553
one penny into
secure account wins.

638
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:18,871
Are we clear?

639
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,524
Begin!

As soon as Lester saw
the other better Lester,

722
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:25,185
he changed his tune.
That's fantastic!

723
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,787
He said he wouldn't
poison me anymore,

724
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:28,856
so I dropped the charges.

Mm, man,

Mm, I don't know.

There's someone who hasn't
forgiven your dickish behavior.

730
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:41,201

You should probably
make yourself scarce.

739
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:14,535
So, I've been, uh,

740
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:18,172

You know, maybe you're right;
I'm, I'm great with computers.

743
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:28,415
I mean, maybe Carmichael
Industries isn't a spy firm.

744
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,684
Maybe it's a tech company.

What are you planning
on doing with it?

756
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:32,312

The real question is,

757
00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:34,114
what do you plan
to do with it, Chuck?

758
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:36,884
What are you
talking about?

759
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:41,855
I got some good footage of you
and your team in possession

760

virus in the world.

Smile.

762
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:53,634
Don't worry, we'll release
the virus,

00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:54,968
but you'll get the blame.

You know,
now that I think of it,

769
00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:06,280
it was pretty irresponsible
to release Casey

into the hands
of his criminal colleagues.

771

It's just a shame that Casey had
to be the first to die.

your guilt.

00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:15,576
We could've been something.

803
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:18,879
Still can be.

804
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:23,416
Perhaps someday.

805
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:35,395
Surveillance changes
shifts in two minutes.

806
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,331
So we gotta get into
the heating duct

807
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:38,632
before they realize
that you're gone.

808
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,567
You're gonna break me
out of here alone?

809
00:41:40,602 --> 00:41:45,572
No. I found someone who cares
about you as much as I do.

810
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:57,017
Prisoner transfer
from CB-11, section 38.

811
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:58,418
Copy that.

812
00:41:58,453 --> 00:42:00,587
I missed you, big guy.

813
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,461
♪ ♪

814
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:13,033
What plan was Decker
talking about?

815
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,668
Why would he want
to frame you?

816
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:15,702
I don't know,

817
00:42:15,737 --> 00:42:17,271
but I intend
to find out.

818
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:19,706
If he was telling the truth,

819
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:22,376
then we're already
in deeper than we know.

820
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,381
Sarah, I was wrong about
quitting the spy life.

821
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:29,116
Because right now,

822
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,286
we've got to be the best
spies we've ever been, okay?
