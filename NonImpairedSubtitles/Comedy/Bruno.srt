SiliconChip

1
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,964
What's up?
I am Bruno.

2
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:03,049
I am in the coldest city in Austria,
the Vienna ...

3
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,062
without hesitation for this ...
all customs.

4
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,537
I am the host of Funky time the largest Fashion show,
ever made in any German speaking city.

5
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:15,293
With the exception of Germany itself.

6
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,357
To Funky time are tense.

7
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:28,366
In fact the Austrians who love fashion,
live according to the pros and cons of my list.

8
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:32,004
Autism such as chlamydia.

9
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:37,512
Autism-Why is this interpretation?
-Why have fun.

10
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,500
Applause ...

11
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:45,282
The Funky time has taken all the interviews with
European fashion designers ..

12
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:49,596
You can go to the camera and saying,
"You see the Funky time with Bruno."

13
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:54,734
Do you see broadcast Funky time with Bruno,
and is really very nice show.

14
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,294
Do like to say a black ...
you know as Africans.

15
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:00,701
Aah so-little ...
Yes-yes ...

16
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:07,922
Do you see broadcast Funky time with Bruno,
fuck yes man, welcome to the jungle.

17
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:11,947
It would be super if you
Maybe just to show naked or something?

18
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,638
No I will not.

19
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:17,561
What tha'leges to show your hair over the balls?

20
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:18,706
Not ...

21
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:24,571
I am the most cheerful man in town.
From the fashionable streets of Milan

22
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:28,164
only for girls from Germany ...
my hair dark.

23
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:36,829
The Modeling for many it seems easy,
but is not the most difficult job in the world end?

24
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:38,643
It is very difficult.

25
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:40,616
We need to stand on heels all day,

26
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,568
and to monitor all ...
You must be sure that your walking is very good.

27
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:50,665
Yes it is really very difficult to remember,
Hello when to bring your right foot and then left ...

28
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,754
and then again right, then left again ...
- Yes.

29
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,008
And especially the shift is very frightening.

30
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:06,407
Being a presenter of Funky time,
Bruno brings to always sit in the front row.

31
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,419
Put a few pounds?

32
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,826
Stis pasarelas the dialect,
call ... "wear black".

33
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:19,336
Throw your shoulders back.
Fashion show this is not something else ...

34
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,422
My personal assistant to the Koukos is my rock.

35
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,029
It is he who makes me glow.

36
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,285
-It is too those glasses?
- I draw.

37
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:32,566
It is like saying ...
"Hey Look at these are my glasses ..."

38
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,683
All to look like my glasses.

39
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,516
I have a second assistant.

40
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,396
But do not shout the name.

41
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,442
The Bruno is not a true love,
in life.

42
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,315
But only 7 minutes with MILLI,
MILLI of vanilla ...

43
00:03:52,428 --> 00:03:59,591
But for the last 9 years I was in love
Flying with a carer, the Diesel.

44
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,974
It looks like the people of pasarelas, you know ...

45
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,273
Belongs to normal,
boring person in the house.

46
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:39,582
-How much you want to put?
- Fill the glasses ...

47
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:44,586
In September 2009,
I went to fashion week in Milan.

48
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,961
To turn the new round of Funky time.

49
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,513
Bruno found the edge of the hottest shows
which has no.

50
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:53,520
Stis LaPranta.

51
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:59,968
So I wore good jewelry,
and a suit made of material Velcot.

52
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:18,053
This is a unique piece of Frederick Vaoun.

53
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:22,865
Looking to find myself,
Can I have one?

54
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:24,892
It is unique,
no other.

55
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:34,474
-Well now, listen ...
- To go out now.

56
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,755
Pull me out of it.

57
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:25,131
The Bruno failed.

58
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:33,006
For the second time this century,
people chased the most courageous man.

59
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,009
Why was only brave enough,
to try something new.

60
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:41,076
They turned their backs on Bruno.

61
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,182
The first drop ...

62
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:03,570
Fired from the Funky time.

63
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:12,878
Realized that night that fashion,
was superficial and empty.

64
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:18,110
I decided instead to go to Los Angeles,

65
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:19,698
become a celebrity.

66
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:27,327
It will become the most famous Souperstar,
after Hitler.

67
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,024
- Not me ...
- Why not?

68
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:38,885
- I am very sorry
- I gotta go.

69
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,059
Okay ... I love you.

70
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:43,573
Diesel I love you.

71
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,457
Will you come with me.

72
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,047
Who are you?

73
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:08,655
I am Loutz.
The assistant to your assistant.

74
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:10,921
Let me go with you in Los Angeles.

75
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,927
I will help you become famous.

76
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:18,437
And why should I need help?
You don't have the appropriate qualifications.

77
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:22,981
Why I think you're wonderful.

78
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,145
Will I wake up to you jerking off
over me?

79
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,875
I promise,
I will not wake you up.

80
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:38,649
Arriving in L.A I had to escape that waited
hidden paparazzi.

81
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:50,091
My plan was to become the biggest gay movie star,
since Schwarzenegger.

82
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:58,192
So I went to my first appointment,
with a Hollywood Agent.

83
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:03,145
I am Bruno, was born in Gklagkonfol,
I am 19 years old and ...

84
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:06,581
of course you know to be the presenter
the Funky time.

85
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:07,469
Ok.

86
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:12,552
I understand that I had a look at the script of a
Jerry Maguire show ...

87
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,754
and I wouldn't mind hearing you try that out.

88
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:24,821
- The sherry comes ...
-No. start with Hello ...

89
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:30,413
Hello .. hello
I am looking for my wife.

90
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,629
Shut up woman!
That was improvisation.

91
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,145
I couldn't hear your voice your
or laugh about it with you.

92
00:09:57,887 --> 00:09:59,983
Let's stop.
Wait ...

93
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,641
Let me stop you for two minutes.

94
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:02,639
Stop right there.

95
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:10,067
Nowhere in the script it say,
he pauses for an inordinate period of time.

96
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:18,965
I want to be a Star in a huge
Hollywood movie.

97
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:22,120
-Can you make that happen?
-No.

98
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,109
I definitely can't.

99
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:27,475
But he did get me a starring role
in a top TV show.

100
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:31,246
As an extra!

101
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:44,816
Ladies and Gentlemen jury,
It gives me no pleasure at all...

102
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,741
to speak to you this afternoon

103
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,177
The defense, as you know ...

104
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,469
out the sentence.

105
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:55,583
For more than 12 years ...

106
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:04,815
Cut!

107
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,960
Ladies and Gentlemen jury,
I'm afraid it gives me no pleasure to speak to you this afternoon...

108
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:26,478
As you know, the defendent...
has served out the penalty for more than
12 years

109
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:31,767
And ... I personally have known him most of that time.

For me I was very pained to learn ...

111
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:38,240
his personal debts compelled him to accept bribes.

112
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,797
Cut!!

113
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,219
As you know, the defendent...

114
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:54,117
has served out the penalty for more than
12 years and

115
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:58,787
I personally have known him most of that time.

116
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:03,299
-For me I was very pained to learn ...
-Bruno: Cut. I am not feeling this one..

117
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:04,306
Bruno: Can we go again?

118
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:09,331
Bruno has no idea what happened.

119
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:10,748
We are in L.A

120
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:11,788
Why no, no other
can not you find a show?

121
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,794
Yes I get from the interview
Stars of the world's largest.

122
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,885
We need to look good for the show.

123
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,614
You were actually my 2nd choice.

124
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:31,427
I wanted to go to the same salon that waxed 
Salma Hayaks inner thighs..

125
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:35,821
but the group does,
is closed for the next 4 days.

126
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:44,045
-And they're exhausted after her.
-They're exhaused after Salma Hayak??

127
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:46,371
She must have a lot of hair.

128
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:49,757
They say that after removing her hair
they could make a mattress.

129
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,119
Speaking of rectums let's wax.

130
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,939
There's not much.

131
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:02,072
Phone ...

132
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:04,552
- Hello?
-How are you doing man?

133
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:09,564
Oh hey-How are you?
-I just got off the phone a network agreed to a screening.

134
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,549
Oh great... it is very good news this.

135
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:13,559
In two days.

136
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,139
They got to pay for it.

137
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:17,428
I think you just scraped my anus.

138
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,497
I did ...
In cleaning.

139
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,007
"The issue is to clean and my balls.
- What?

140
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,779
I was talking to lady.. im in the salon. Yes?

141
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:31,218
-She's just waxing my anus.
-Is there a way we can get togther?

142
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,101
-Yes of course.
OK-we call on Brenda.

143
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,522
You can get your finger,
out of my anus?

144
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,249
Okay ... I think we're finished.
Once again you can get the finger,

145
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,856
from my ass ...
the guy just said on the phone.

146
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:49,031
Not talking to you, but the woman here.

147
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,213
Who has the audio!

148
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:55,450
I want to hear the recording.
I want to ... I want to hear what this idiot said.

149
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,461
Put it to play.

150
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,934
Closed the Paula Abdul
almost immediately!

151
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:07,380
What's crazy!

152
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,825
But where is the furniture?

153
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:10,707
Have taken.

154
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,618
I told them to get on today
to do the interview.

155
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:19,388
No furniture will sit the Paula;

156
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,841
Trying to destroy?

157
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,702
Wait.

158
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:31,985
Do you want mexicans want to get more money?

159
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:37,601
Hey-how are you doing?

160
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,499
-I am Bruno.
-Nice to meet you.

161
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,389
I am glad to have you here.
Come and sit in our wonderful seats.

162
00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:48,211
This our mexican chair people ...

163
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,435
You can sit on that one.

164
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:02,119
So tell me about your humanitarian work.

165
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:04,865
How important is it for you,
to help other people?

166
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:09,035
To help other people,
it is vital to my life.

167
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,333
It is like the air I breathe ...

168
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:13,766
and the water I drink.

169
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,967
It is very important to me.
You give love to people, and get love back.

170
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:24,059
and this fills my life.

171
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:26,735
Well, rather hungry,
so let's eat something ...

172
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:29,808
Oh My God ...

173
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:34,633
It is very bad for me.
Thousand sorry this is long.

174
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:35,721
We leave.

175
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,051
Come back ...
Please come back.

176
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:49,211
Yes yes I understand but ...

177
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,847
The Agenda of Paula spread.
We put on a blacklist.

178
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:06,085
What would you say to Puffy Father...

179
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,406
He won't come.

180
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,603
Stevie Wonderbar?
-No.

181
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,218
-In Will Smith?
-No.

182
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:20,535
-Adolf Hitler (Bratt Pitt);
-No.

183
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,628
How to do the show without famous?

184
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:32,363
Do not worry ... we have 24 hours
the show will be.

185
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:43,889
I think that the group will monitor
will be interested to have an example that will happen.

186
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:47,747
Basically I have some thoughts already.

187
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:48,881
-Very well.
-Yes.

188
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:51,874
Our priority now is to see
a new show.

189
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:55,004
A show with Celebrities,
by Bruno.

190
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:58,013
Hi-I am The Lloyd Robinson.
Lloyd-... I am a Denny Bond.

191
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:58,746
-Bye.
-Bye.

192
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,101
It is very important what extent will pass,
because if the show has high ratings,

193
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,123
it certainly would be very interesting,
so richte a glance.

194
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,839
Who is ready to show,
many famous? ...

195
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:31,761
I am.
Why is the first list celebrities, raised everywhere.

196
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:47,560
-How are you?
-Fine ... Thanks for the invitation.

197
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:50,379
This is a part of the show called,
"Future children".

198
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,823
Some pregnant-looking photos, is perfect.
-OK.

199
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:58,213
OK this Brittney's sister...
but I do not remember what's her name?

200
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,235
-Jamie Lynn.
James-Lin Spears...

201
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,905
-It she also famous?
-No.

202
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:09,091
OK let's see what she's got in her stomach.

203
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:11,964
OK ... maybe carrying a child?

204
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:13,781
Yes for sure.

205
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,515
He has his hands and say it belongs
First the list ...

206
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,505
News flash ...
baby belonging to the C list.

207
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:21,377
-I am right?
- Worse I think like D.

208
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,497
Do you think the child is retarded?

209
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,092
Yes. The hands look wayy too big and the ears have not been developed.

210
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:27,897
I understand that it is not properly developed yet.

211
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,632
Yes-so we keep it or abort it?

212
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:30,769
Abort it.

213
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:37,386
Now ... my exclusive interview
with Harrison Ford ...

214
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:42,648
are only moments away ...
but first! some more dancing with.. Bruno!!

215
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:59,501
That's right it's time we've all been waiting for.
The one and only exclusive interview.

216
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:07,991
Meet Harrison Ford.
-Harrison!!
-Fuck off..

217
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:10,522
What is this?

218
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,080
It is my own.

219
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:39,636
This idea was Lloyd.

220
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,033
This last ...
was ...

221
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:47,657
If you describe this show,
with one sentence...

222
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:49,335
Does anyone have one sentence?

223
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:52,548
Is that the worst I have ever seen me.

224
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,697
It is always so wonderful to have
one against it.

225
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,759
And be nice had fun.

226
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,512
What kind of thought this would bring?

227
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:01,979
I had small.
than two years.

228
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:06,763
-I wanted to burn my eyes out with hot pokers.
- They are borrowed from me.

229
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:10,213
-Can I go there and live show?
No-you can ...

230
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,025
-I want to distract attention.
Kiss me!
-No.

231
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:16,157
A reasonable person would think
A show like this,

232
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,069
unless it has historical or cultural ethos.

233
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,674
Oh God.

234
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:31,484
The presenter is a ridiculous idiot.

235
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:34,581
Is this idiot... ridiculous?

236
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:38,750
I would say.

237
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,438
Oh I go?

238
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,445
I ve put all my money
on it.

239
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:49,973
It was worse than Cancer.

240
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,877
I do not want.

241
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,510
We know that you still
like me.

242
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,495
I am a nothing.
Better go back to Austria.

243
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:06,832
No ... you are wonderful.

244
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:10,289
The only way this guy to be famous,
is to shoot a porn movie.

245
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:16,311
Loutz a good listen.
We go to a porn movie.

246
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:22,160
I am with Ron Paul,
member of Congress.

247
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:25,600
Who was president in Canada
2008.

248
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:29,354
So tell me,
Who would you prefer

249
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:32,848
Do not know why it is very conventional.

250
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:39,975
Wait a minute Mr Bruno,
a lamp burned.

251
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,283
Want to relax a little
in the other room to fix it?

252
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:44,263
Sure.

253
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,929
-Would you like some champagne?
-No I do not want something now.

254
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:58,145
Not pagothiki but I know a place
to put.

255
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:03,396
You were beautiful inside.
You have shown many times on TV?

256
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:07,410
And yes, not as necessary;
as I did last year.

257
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:12,764
-Would you like maybe a few strawberries ...
-I 'm okay.

258
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,742
We lit a candle,
if you do not mind.

259
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:19,327
Do we relax a little.

260
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:23,018
I have been told that nobody ever looks
by Julio Iglesias?

261
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:26,865
Of course not.
You are more cute.

262
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,408
I was a dancer.

263
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,560
Get out of here ...

264
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,316
This was, is over.

265
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:06,103
The guy is a queer! and took off his clothes,
and we can not continue!

266
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,472
This queer is crazy.
He took his clothes.

267
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:15,058
Neither the RouPol can look like.
How to become a World famous?

268
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:19,673
I decided to consult the most
wise man is.

269
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,144
I want to speak with MILLI,
from groups of MILLI vanilla.

270
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:30,470
It is in Heaven?
And if you live in is part of VIP;

271
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:37,022
He says that we are in a part
green trees and flowers.

272
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:40,594
Can I ask him if he
any advice for me?

273
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:50,331
He says that this has put a target,
Charity or something like that,

274
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:53,654
involving many other people,
be successful.

275
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:56,135
This is a perfect idea.
Because if I do that, then ...

276
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:59,159
for sure will become a World famous.

277
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,424
For sure.

278
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,037
Why is one that will have
very happy.

279
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:06,576
-I can kiss you now?
-Of course.

280
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:24,272
Well, good luck with your life. 

281
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:28,956
Thanks to my MILLI now is obvious ...

282
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:34,148
The Charity was the best,
to become famous.

283
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,469
And so the Bruno had to find,
a great tragedy, to correct.

284
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:44,846
I do not want something that much effort,
but something that will stand out if you understand.

285
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:47,155
Something to put in the First List.

286
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:50,390
Is there anything you like, or believe in it?

287
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:52,066
I am in a different.

288
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:54,907
Yes, the global temperature is getting worse.

289
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:59,246
This would be important to address.

290
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:03,309
We can do something special,
to do so.

291
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:08,949
This will help our future ...
and why is so important to address.

292
00:26:10,063 --> 00:26:12,706
We suggest something else as to say
Africa?

293
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:17,294
-OK.
Say Something-like animals to extinction?

294
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:19,576
Not.

295
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,114
We find it important
so do not take the animals to extinction.

296
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:39,188
What is the best kind of charity,
someone to participate this time?

297
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:55,754
Is there somewhere in the world,
something that has not tried to correct a celebrity ...

298
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:00,794
What is the newer ..
something that has not been done?

299
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:07,073
I was going to become famouse by solving a world problem.

300
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,150
The Klounei had made Darfur ...

301
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:11,936
The Stink took Amazon ...

302
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,138
And Bruno's got AIDS.

303
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:18,733
Fortunately there was still one shit hole left to fix ...

304
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:21,091
The Middle Earth.(Middle East)

305
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:27,486
My plan was to bring both sides,
to sign a peace treaty.

306
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:30,309
And so to become famous Bruno.

307
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,647
I love your hat.

308
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,116
Why are you so against Hamas?

309
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:08,168
I say not another,
you the real enemy?

310
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,558
Rather I believe that the confusing Hamas
with Homos...

311
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:15,124
So you say that a relationship exists
between Hamas and Homos?

312
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:19,265
How is the Hamas as a chef?

313
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:24,339
We have created the food and
God we follow?

314
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,343
The Homos has nothing to do with Hamas.

315
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:28,727
It kind of food right?

316
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:30,548
We need it and they need it.

317
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:33,694
It is for vegetarian ...
is beans.

318
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,600
You do not agree with that?

319
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:40,223
Both agree that the Chomos
is hygiene.

320
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:42,413
Then we progress.

321
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,064
Let us find a solution right?

322
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:48,330
Why not be here forever.

323
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:55,876
You Palestinians agree to give back
Pyramids to the Israelis?

324
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,980
Referred to Egypt
not in Palestine.

325
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:01,460
I do not care what.
Give them back.

326
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:06,163
This all has to do to win
something for your people,

327
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:09,462
either because they believe, or because you have convinced ...

328
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,010
If I can't get these queens to sign this peace deal
soon,

329
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:18,934
I will not become famous.

330
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:23,450
So I decided to think alone
journey outside the box.

331
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:28,971
A friend of mine told a song that will help
to bring peace.

332
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:31,806
And I know that will happen.

333
00:29:32,745 --> 00:29:34,510
"I pray to the sun ...

334
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:39,242
a hope that will bring you two closer.

335
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:45,510
If it was time the world over,

336
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:49,192
You two prepare to Be Friends,

337
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,725
The creation of love is sending me ...

338
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:59,419
do not shoot each other,
We are all Christians.

339
00:30:34,352 --> 00:30:35,416
I was out of options.

340
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:39,832
The song didn't work,
And I didn't have enough ectasy for everyone.

341
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:41,822
I was ready to quit,

342
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:45,215
but I remembered some things that you
should be said.

343
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:47,785
For years people were abducted.

344
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:51,361
and this news came out around the world.

345
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:52,918
-Around the world?
-Yes.

346
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:55,908
So the whole world will be assumed that
They are hostages.

347
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:04,668
I will become famous,
by getting kidnapped!

348
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:12,000
I am going to say something that is gonna get u so angry ...

349
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,284
that if you got a gun on you,
you will pull it out and shoot me in the head.

350
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:22,770
-You ready?
-Yes.
-Your hair.. is sun-damaged.

351
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,780
Let me be frank with you,
I want to become famous.

352
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:30,994
And I want the best in the business
to kidnap me... Al kaida is so 2001.

353
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,478
I do not like.

354
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,708
Can I give you some advice?

355
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,575
Lose the beards.

356
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:45,700
Cause your King Osama,
looks like a dirty wizard or ...

357
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:47,226
a homeless Santa Claus.

358
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,589
Get out ... Get out now.

359
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,209
It was encouraged,
to leave the Middle East.

360
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,706
But Bruno had a new plan.

361
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:13,720
While going back home,
I will stop in Africa for some shopping.

362
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:16,849
Loutz get them.

363
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:24,168
Loutz come ... and others.

364
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,852
... Loutz there.

365
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,114
Watch ...

366
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,052
The Madonna has a ...

367
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:42,720
The Brantzelina have a ...

368
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,240
And now Bruno has!

369
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:52,407
That is 5 pounds of black gold.

370
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,036
Call in all the magazines.

371
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,437
We organize the best photograph
who has never seen the world.

372
00:32:57,668 --> 00:33:00,085
It makes me famous.
Understand?

373
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,053
Yes I understand.

374
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,438
Little my little African,
will put me on the cover of all magazines.

375
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,086
And so I hired the best photographer,

376
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,410
to capture the hottest baby photoshoot ever.

377
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:20,291
We will do something for the religion,
where my baby will be on a cross,

378
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,034
it represents Christ,
even if the baby is black.

379
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,545
-It 's very first?
-It is the first.

380
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:28,204
-As of Madonna's Video.
-Yes we wear around a sentonaki ...

381
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:33,749
So look for two babies to be
croucafix the next baby.

382
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:38,399
Are you ready to accept your baby,
be strung up to the crucifix?

383
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,920
Well I have no problem with her up on the crucifix.

384
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,651
Is your child comfortable with bees, wasps, hornets?

385
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,345
George is cool with anything.

386
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:50,756
Is he comfortable with dead or dying animals?

387
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,548
Yes.

388
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:14,886
-She ok with extremely rapid acceleration?
-Yes.

389
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:19,729
Okay ... does she always have to be in a car-seat or can 
she just freestyle it?

390
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,948
Sure, freestyle it put her in a car-seat whatever.

391
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,868
- It seems more beautiful than rigged.
-Yes of course, of course.

392
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:28,248
We're traveling fast but we will not kill it.

393
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:29,300
Yes of course, of course.

394
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:32,836
Is your baby comfortable with extremely heavy
machinery?

395
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,764
Yes shes's fine she's been around that.

396
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,509
It she ok to operate some?

397
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:38,381
Yes.

398
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:39,310
Great.

399
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:42,535
Finally, your child likes bees?

400
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:44,412
-Yes.
-Great.

401
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:45,564
Like?

402
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:46,433
Loves it.

403
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:53,191
-How much she weight?
-She's about 30 pounds.

404
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:56,141
-30 pounds?? ...
Yes-to some.

405
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,536
Can Olivia to lose 10 pounds
let's say next week?

406
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:01,448
Next week ...
7 days? ...

407
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:05,824
Yes ... I can do whatever I could.

408
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:11,148
Could we undergo liposuction?

409
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:16,495
If that was a last resort,
then yes ... do what you must do.

410
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:23,172
Fantastic ...
We have chosen your baby to be dressed as Nazi officer,

411
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:29,311
and pushing a cart with a another baby as a jew,
into an oven.

412
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,326
Into an oven?

413
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:33,081
Congratulations.
How do you feel?

414
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,850
Great if she got the job?

415
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:35,907
-Yes.
-Perfect.

416
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:06,226
I spoke to a presenter a Talk show,
in Dallas.

417
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,790
Fantastic.

418
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,749
OJ will appear on television.

419
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,484
Loutz not with you ever so happy again.

420
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:20,158
Thank you.

421
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:39,638
Welcome back.
Today sees the Richard Bay.

422
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,051
The next guest is a single parent.

423
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,035
Please welcome Bruno.

424
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:56,295
Where are you from?

425
00:36:56,353 --> 00:36:58,823
-I am from Austria.
-Austria and ...

426
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:02,398
what you think of Americans?
You see it enough here.

427
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,673
I want to say that I love American people,
and I love Afro-American people.

428
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,456
-Are you a single parent.
-Yes.

429
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:16,438
Most people believe,
that a child should have two parents.

430
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:22,288
It is very difficult
bringing up a child without another parent.

431
00:37:22,294 --> 00:37:23,066
Am I right?

432
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:27,755
I hope I don't grow old alone.
Am I right?

433
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:31,647
I hope I find Mr. Right.
Am I right?

434
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:42,019
U just jealous because u know i can get any guy here!

435
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:55,186
Can we see your son?

436
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,933
Yes of course.

437
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:12,906
Where is your baby from?
Is he from Austria?

438
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:16,621
I was in the Middle East,
solving a huge crisis.

439
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:23,506
And turning back to America,
I visited a country called Africa ...

440
00:38:23,616 --> 00:38:26,712
-Right?
-Africa is a continent not a country get it right.

441
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:30,502
-Well it is full of Afro-Americans.
-It is full of Africans!!

442
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:34,374
-Is filled with people from Africa.
-This is a racist thing to call them,

443
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,732
Afro-Americans is correct.

444
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,959
Okay and how did you get your son?

445
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:44,927
I swapped him.

446
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,999
Swapped him for what?

447
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:49,914
They swapped the baby for what?

448
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:50,901
For an ipod.

449
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,837
What?

450
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,363
It wasn't just any ipod
It was a limited edition - red ipod in good condition.

451
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:03,991
Wait a minute.
You are the father of the baby now,

452
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:07,756
- And wear a shirt that says what?
- GAYBY.

453
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:09,976
Is not the name of
is not it?

454
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,502
No I gave him a traditional African name.

455
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,608
-So what is the name of the baby?
- O J

456
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,580
I think that the use the baby as an accessory.

457
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,222
I think that because he's a black baby..

458
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,523
It's like having a dog and
going for a walk in the park,

459
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:33,712
to pick up girls
or anything else. What did you think?

460
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,999
I gotta be honest..
He's a real dick magnet.

461
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,230
Bring along your photos
you have taken with the child, because ...

462
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,716
I want to prove that you love the child.

463
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,562
Let's see the next picture.

464
00:40:04,146 --> 00:40:06,208
We have another picture or was it?

465
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:10,612
What happens here?

466
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:15,666
If I am having fun.
I want little OJ have fun with me.

467
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:24,841
Just afraid of the truth.

468
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,543
I don't see how you can walk out of here;

469
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,735
with this baby in your hands.

470
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:37,098
Without someone to stop and
to take your baby from your possession.

471
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:40,444
Okay as you know there is a finale,
in this show ...

472
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:44,033
Please welcome the
Santana Megkans by the child protection agency.

473
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:57,535
What is the legal opinion of the State,
designed to ensure,

474
00:40:57,912 --> 00:40:59,729
children and their welfare

475
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:01,906
This child is here illegally.

476
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:03,102
No it is not.

477
00:41:03,181 --> 00:41:04,234
I made deal with the mother.

478
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,870
And at this time will take the child,
under our protection.

479
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,709
Give the baby back.
Give the baby.

480
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:13,130
Is this your child?
He is beautiful.

481
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,667
This was my child before they took him.

482
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:30,519
I am very sorry ...
God... what's he about 2?
-He's about 6.. or coulda been 10.

483
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,547
What is all this?

484
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,915
Commiting Carbocide.

485
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,276
You have so much to live for.

486
00:43:05,187 --> 00:43:08,672
I am so tired,
I can not walk backwards.

487
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:14,439
Loutz You are so strong.
And you are as comfortable as a Mexican.

488
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:16,186
You light both Mr Bruno.

489
00:43:16,686 --> 00:43:18,619
As one of feathers.

490
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:22,484
You know, I am good to you,
only because I like you.

491
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:25,730
Mr Bruno, your brush is pushing into my back.

492
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:29,650
That's no brush.

493
00:43:33,924 --> 00:43:35,156
Morning Cowboy.

494
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:36,900
What is your name?

495
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,458
No, no, no.

496
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:44,536
Where is the key?

497
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:46,398
Call for help.

498
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,531
Hello I shouted to the state
room.

499
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:01,527
And to confirm that the toilet
is impeccable.

500
00:44:03,272 --> 00:44:06,145
You can look for the key?
It is there.

501
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:07,017
No, I can not do that.

502
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,991
Brian Yes I need you up here immediately.

503
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:13,238
These are two men engaged in handcuffs
on the bed.

504
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:16,861
And than I saw you wearing one in his mouth
a vibrator.

505
00:44:17,732 --> 00:44:21,080
Sit in a little hotel,
I go there and find the key,

506
00:44:21,517 --> 00:44:22,743
Why not stand up
from the bed.

507
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:31,217
If you do not find the key
We can not stand up ...

508
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:34,932
If you look over there ...

509
00:44:37,902 --> 00:44:41,825
I should have taken Master's degrees
to take pipe.

510
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,828
But tha'prepe.
You n'allaxeis channel because ...

511
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:52,746
I made a mistake and put in the film,
"Mr.Magorium 's wonder emporium";

512
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:57,669
-That is sad.
-You must however be charged the self,

513
00:44:58,098 --> 00:44:58,870
I have not changed.

514
00:44:59,423 --> 00:45:01,109
Not that I fear will not do that.

515
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:03,214
If you ...
What is your name?

516
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,770
You like Latin porn.

517
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,651
Sorry, you can unlock,
please?

518
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,476
What happens here?

519
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:43,683
Like what seems right?

520
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,821
This was the best day
of my life.

521
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:55,475
... It was super fantastic.

522
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,454
At last we are together.

523
00:45:57,764 --> 00:45:59,505
You crazy Loutz?

524
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,667
Last night I was wearing
"carbohydrate goggles".

525
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,245
I had no idea, I did not know
what I was doing.

526
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,015
It was built with
potato shell Ragin 'Cajun.

527
00:46:12,907 --> 00:46:13,379
I am Bruno.

528
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,359
I don't go for average men.

529
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,846
Nobody s'good enough for me ...

530
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,952
And I know that I love you.

531
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:30,533
Accept me please
or die alone.

532
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:39,006
No.

533
00:46:47,328 --> 00:46:48,956
You can go Loutz?

534
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:56,836
You can view or another.
You skint.

535
00:46:58,218 --> 00:46:59,746
After all else in need Loutz.

536
00:47:01,164 --> 00:47:03,604
The coax and myself.

537
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,343
I am Bruno.

538
00:47:15,697 --> 00:47:20,010
This happened at the low point.
The Bruno hit bottom.

539
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,719
The Loutz left ...

540
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:40,558
I was ready to abandon the dream
of celebrities ...

541
00:47:41,627 --> 00:47:43,386
And then I came.

542
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:49,531
All the big stars of earth,

543
00:47:49,851 --> 00:47:53,767
Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kevin Speisy the ...

544
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:56,501
All of them had a common point.

545
00:47:57,395 --> 00:47:58,984
Were all heterosexual.

546
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:06,698
To be famous, you must quit
men.

547
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:11,126
We need to find something similar to the poutsolatreia.

548
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:16,630
He n'allaxo time.

549
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:19,328
I decided to go straight to the track.

550
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:24,881
If you become a heterosexual,
I can still play clarinet?

551
00:48:26,026 --> 00:48:31,192
If no one reminds you conduct
you had ...

552
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,716
if you put your lips to it.

553
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,898
If not to remind, you will say,
play clarinet with the whole you are.

554
00:48:38,272 --> 00:48:44,390
If, however, reminds the would you say Just leave it,
Give and let us keep a friend,

555
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:49,755
until you are ready your mind,
to catch you again without you to remind.

556
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,891
What if I put something similar?

557
00:48:55,488 --> 00:48:59,875
I would not have done this or why,
it reminds you to your previous lifestyle.

558
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,915
-So you will not put any instrument up your ass?
-Absolutely not.

559
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:06,542
-You know why?
-Why?

560
00:49:06,997 --> 00:49:09,130
Because that would harm my body.

561
00:49:12,323 --> 00:49:14,396
That would be bad.

562
00:49:14,472 --> 00:49:17,710
Is there any kind of gay music that I shouldn't listen to?

563
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,966
Sinead o Connor, The Indigo girls ...

564
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,767
The Village people.

565
00:49:24,922 --> 00:49:27,082
So we manage to become straight.

566
00:49:28,017 --> 00:49:30,544
Some new hobbies that will have to build?

567
00:49:30,907 --> 00:49:31,745
Do you like hiking?

568
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,114
Or lifting weights?

569
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,048
There is nothing better than working out
and lifting weights,

570
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:42,652
and to build muscle around other
men who are not Gay.

571
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,538
I am totally in irrisistable to Gay guys.

572
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,375
They see me and they want to fuck me.

573
00:49:55,606 --> 00:49:58,129
-OK.
- So, how do I protect myself from those guys?

574
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:02,046
If you they get close to you... hit them and leave the sitauation.

575
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,427
How do you spot a homosexual?

576
00:50:04,613 --> 00:50:09,683
Very difficult, because most don't dress that
different from me or you.

577
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:12,941
-I understand.
-It's kind of like ...

578
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:18,911
Terrorists.
If a terrorist is dressed as a police man,

579
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:20,247
How would you know that's him?

580
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:22,376
Tell me obvious things that I should look for.

581
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:31,264
SO someone approaches you on the street,
is being very very nice to you,

582
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:34,934
-you know that they are homosexual?
-Most likely.

583
00:50:35,555 --> 00:50:39,893
How should I protect myself from being
attacked by homosexuals?

584
00:50:40,843 --> 00:50:43,991
They probably would attack you from behind.

585
00:50:45,386 --> 00:50:50,353
And if I am homosexual and run
to kiss you?

586
00:50:51,142 --> 00:50:53,372
Changes fists.

587
00:50:54,109 --> 00:50:56,773
Let us say that Gay has to
fallen to the ground ...

588
00:50:56,984 --> 00:51:00,319
You know if is the homsexual is
like this?

589
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:08,258
Kick with the foot, and hit with the
turning elbow.

590
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,144
How protected by a dildo?

591
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,271
Let's say that I try ...

592
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:16,227
Like this.

593
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:17,157
Understand?

594
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:23,251
It is difficult to defend a black dildo?

595
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:28,287
Not the same ... It is easy with the other
to defend themselves.

596
00:51:28,654 --> 00:51:29,768
So attacking ...

597
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:36,881
It uses the knees
and elbow ...

598
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:40,303
How defense against a man
Two dildos?

599
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:56,930
And if you run with the dick out?

600
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:12,870
Thank you.
It was fantastic.

601
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:17,979
-Very useful.
-It was very different from the usual I have done.

602
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:21,434
So you were not ever Gay;

603
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:25,805
It is ironic, because you have amazing blowjob lips.

604
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,853
These lips were made to praise jesus.
605
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,654
They were made for something else your just not using it properly.

606
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:41,340
There are activities which have to introduce
surrounded by straight guys?

607
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:57,964
-Hurry, come here.
-What?

608
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,536
Hurry ...
Make the bed.

609
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,938
-Could intermediates to put ...
-Make the bed.

610
00:53:04,084 --> 00:53:08,259
-You can hang a sheet over there?
-You will need it. Down ...

611
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:11,235
-What?
-I said get down ... and do push ups.

612
00:53:11,703 --> 00:53:14,409
Here is the point of not spending.

613
00:53:27,593 --> 00:53:30,544
Meanwhile who is the costume you>
Go put on your uniform.

614
00:53:30,795 --> 00:53:31,781
Do it.

615
00:53:32,678 --> 00:53:34,102
Oh God.

616
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:36,804
What is it with the scarf?

617
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:39,878
This put-in to ...
Sit-in to recommend someone.

618
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:42,947
What are you doing?

619
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:44,931
Stand-soldier attention.
-Do.

620
00:53:49,022 --> 00:53:49,785
Hold still soldier.

621
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:52,384
This is not part of the mission ...
We need to remove it.

622
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:58,516
This outfit is boring by itself
and try to give a sparkle to accessories.

623
00:53:58,965 --> 00:54:00,460
Do you have an attitude soldier?

624
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:08,996
Down-Soldier.
-Do.

625
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:11,554
What kind of area is that once a soldier?

626
00:54:12,018 --> 00:54:14,022
-What is this?
- D & G

627
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,081
-What is D &G;
-Excuse me; DOLCE & GABBANA.

628
00:55:03,629 --> 00:55:05,797
Say with your right hand.

629
00:55:06,248 --> 00:55:07,715
We do it right.

630
00:55:11,426 --> 00:55:13,136
Can I tell you the person who changed my life?

631
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:17,647
Actually his name is Jesus.

632
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:20,048
Jesus is in this room,
right now.

633
00:55:20,419 --> 00:55:21,791
He never leaves us... He never forsakes us ...

634
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,039
-He's here ...
-Amazing.

635
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:25,732
You absolutely right,
it's amazing.

636
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:29,732
You want to be famous?
You want to become famous Bruno?

637
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:31,937
You Will prepare the way
for many other young people

638
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:35,812
worldwide,
to leave the homosexual lifestyle.

639
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:37,306
And to make a change in their lives.

640
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:39,511
And to say that after the Bruno can
then I can too.

641
00:55:40,188 --> 00:55:43,396
They'll say?
How did Bruno change? ... And you'll say because of Jesus.

642
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:46,496
He changed me.
He wants to get closer to your heart now.

643
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:48,302
Are you ready for this change?

644
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:50,270
Are you hitting on me?

645
00:55:52,043 --> 00:55:52,859
No, I'm not.

646
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:57,766
Because that was really hot.. that whole speech.

647
00:55:59,872 --> 00:56:05,392
Are there are any outdoor activities
I should do if I want to become straight?

648
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:06,676
Absolutely.

649
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:08,739
-Hi.
-Hi.

650
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:20,014
You ever been hunting?

651
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,190
I never killed an animal,
Although I did once suffocate a hampster.

652
00:56:29,862 --> 00:56:32,976
Prefer the vagina or ....

653
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,169
-I prefer the vagina.
-Me too.

654
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:38,460
Many women with a vagina.

655
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,089
Yes ...

656
00:56:40,238 --> 00:56:41,001
My favorite.

657
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,607
We were just talking about vaginas...

658
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:47,192
About what?

659
00:56:47,522 --> 00:56:49,584
Vagina ...
You know a woman who has a vagina ...

660
00:56:54,268 --> 00:56:56,685
-I like what you wear.
A-Yes ...

661
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,131
-Really?
-Fantasy.

662
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:00,362
Very nice fabric.

663
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:02,995
It is my favorite.

664
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:23,739
Look at the 4 of us ...
We are so like the Sex and the City girls.

665
00:57:27,714 --> 00:57:29,450
Which one are you Donny?

666
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,001
I aint any one of them.
I'm Donny.

667
00:57:33,515 --> 00:57:35,550
That is such a Samantha thing to say..

668
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:43,226
I've never been out of the city before.

669
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:46,159
You haven't? How's that feel?

670
00:57:46,954 --> 00:57:48,706
I feel a little vulnerable.

671
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:55,016
You know I am 19 years old,
perfect body ...

672
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:59,373
I do not want to wake up tomorrow
morning and discover,

673
00:57:59,485 --> 00:58:01,764
That I'm torn in my asshole.

674
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,855
You probably aint the only one...

675
00:58:10,581 --> 00:58:12,603
There are so many stars in the sky.

676
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:19,151
Makes you think of all the hot
guys in the world.

677
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:02,071
Mike?

678
00:59:04,598 --> 00:59:07,341
-Yes.
It's me Bruno.

679
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:13,793
-I think that Donny is a homosexual.
-What?

680
00:59:14,627 --> 00:59:18,313
I think that we will be together more secure,
if we sleep together tonight.

681
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,166
I don't give a damn.
Go to your tent and me alone.

682
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:23,633
Okay well.

683
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,822
Sweet dreams.

684
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,258
Can I come in?

685
00:59:41,259 --> 00:59:43,624
This bear ate all my clothes but left condoms.

686
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:48,027
Get the fuck out of here.

687
00:59:57,553 --> 01:00:02,209
The Reverend Pitzei found me too much a handful,
and put me in touch with somone he knows.

688
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,022
You look in decent in that.

689
01:00:06,457 --> 01:00:08,584
Like a straight guy.. How's that?


690
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:12,451
Women are good for us.

691
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,948
They're good even though..

692
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:20,202
they appear to us to be terribly conventional.

693
01:00:21,341 --> 01:00:24,676
We find that somewhat.. uhh irritatating...

694
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:28,600
That they complain so much.

695
01:00:29,577 --> 01:00:30,424
Right.

696
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,510
But we need them ...

697
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:38,381
We need a lot of things,
which is at first glance,

698
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:41,419
are annoying and irritating.

699
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:45,643
and women often don't stick to the point..

700
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:50,010
They often talk about one issue,
and then another and another ...

701
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:52,455
and they never get back to the first point..

702
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,761
Maybe ever...

703
01:00:55,774 --> 01:01:00,654
I am repelled by the idea of making the sex
with a woman.

704
01:01:01,704 --> 01:01:09,959
The important thing is to be around women,
somewhat that you find tolerable,

705
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:10,897
or interesting ...

706
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:14,138
Give them a chance to seduce you.

707
01:01:17,202 --> 01:01:18,626
PARTY
"SWINGERS PARTY"

708
01:01:20,586 --> 01:01:21,949
How did you get into it?

709
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:30,788
Our first party, all night,
happened to our honeymoon.

710
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:34,372
And what is your favorite position?

711
01:01:35,434 --> 01:01:38,043
I would say missionary or
reverse cowgirl.

712
01:01:39,008 --> 01:01:40,406
What is the reverse cowgirl?

713
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:42,915
Show me I'll pretend to the woman.

714
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,293
Like me I sit here ...

715
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:49,065
-And so you sit ...
-OK.

716
01:01:49,447 --> 01:01:50,692
This is the reverse cowgirl.

717
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,311
Right and when your facing me, that's called cowgirl.

718
01:01:54,688 --> 01:01:57,457
This here is the cowgirl or reverse cowgirl?

719
01:01:57,558 --> 01:01:58,479
This is cowgirl.

720
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:07,831
And what other positions are there?

721
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:09,353
Piledriver ...

722
01:02:10,655 --> 01:02:15,290
.. 69.
This is the girl's position, you don't want to be like this.

723
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,842
There is a missionary, doggystyle ...

724
01:02:18,104 --> 01:02:18,969
What's doggstyle?

725
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,580
You bend over like a dog does it ...

726
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,026
-Like this?
-Yes.

727
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,332
If you were a woman I'd be humping you.

728
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,055
I'd be humping you like this ...

729
01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:49,055
Want Sandwich anyone?

730
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:55,514
Perfect ...

731
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:14,217
Good boy ...

732
01:03:16,287 --> 01:03:18,787
Oh Yes gamame ...

733
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:25,428
Come look at my eyes ...

734
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:27,777
Look in my eyes,
not look at that.

735
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:36,494
Because the calls to look into the eyes?
Fuck pussy why you watching?

736
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:38,244
To be more focused.

737
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,782
This is swingers party.

738
01:03:44,015 --> 01:03:49,522
Okay? ... If you don't want pussy then get out or quit fucking touching me.

739
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,048
I didn't come here for no queer shit.

740
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,434
-OK.
The then-clear.

741
01:03:56,951 --> 01:03:58,559
This is a fucking swingers party, right guys?

742
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:05,800
Bye ...
Come with me.

743
01:04:09,297 --> 01:04:11,137
-I was just going to the Kitchen
-Yes yes yes

744
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:21,343
Maybe we should get to know each other,
let ...

745
01:04:24,019 --> 01:04:25,616
Let us know the first bit ...

746
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,736
-What?
-You have to have many male seduction.

747
01:04:31,052 --> 01:04:32,853
I do not want you to do something that you will regret.

748
01:04:33,273 --> 01:04:36,517
Like you wake up this morning having lost
your virginity and you feel ashamed.

749
01:04:36,744 --> 01:04:39,909
Let's take this a little slower ...

750
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:43,734
Shut up. Sit the fuck down!
Sit the fuck down!

751
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,126
Don't fuck around...

752
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,184
We sit down to discuss it first?

753
01:04:53,396 --> 01:04:57,811
Will you quit being a little bitch here and take your fucking briefs off.

754
01:04:59,013 --> 01:04:59,814
Yes ...

755
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:01,336
Thanks.

756
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:08,568
Do as I say.

757
01:05:10,085 --> 01:05:11,804
Take that fucking shit off now ...

758
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:20,315
Fuck ...

759
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:21,267
I got an idea.

760
01:05:21,632 --> 01:05:23,732
It's a little dress up..

761
01:05:24,946 --> 01:05:26,678
What is this?
You wanna dress me up as a man?

762
01:05:27,043 --> 01:05:27,867
No.. it's just a beard..

763
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,878
-And you want to wear a beard?
Come on-we have fun ...

764
01:05:31,102 --> 01:05:33,743
I don't need a beard ...
Take it off right now!

765
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:44,000
Get on your fucking knees and suck my cunt hair bitch!

766
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:02,925
I will become the straightest man who ever lived.

767
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:06,032
And when I became famous ...
You'll see! You'll see!

768
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:37,755
Want to see some ass kickin tonight?

769
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:42,166
Make some noise.
Put your hands together.

770
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:47,393
Give it up for the host of our new show ...
"Straight Daannn!!!!"

771
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:18,406
Are you ready for some man slamming action?

772
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,310
Who would like some old fashion heterofest?

773
01:07:26,154 --> 01:07:29,947
Are you are 100% heterosexual,
like me?

774
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,035
I want to hear you shout,
"The Straight bite.

775
01:08:00,718 --> 01:08:03,987
You know why?
Why does my asshole is just for shitting.

776
01:08:09,026 --> 01:08:12,134
It is nice to be here
Straight with other people.

777
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:15,067
It is nice to not have any fags here.

778
01:08:15,871 --> 01:08:18,797
You-faggot
-Who called me a faggot!?

779
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:23,371
Whoever called me faggot come up here and I'll
beat your ass.

780
01:08:44,335 --> 01:08:47,891
Who wants to be see straight dave fuck up this faggot.

781
01:11:18,344 --> 01:11:20,325
The film played everywhere.

782
01:11:20,483 --> 01:11:23,380
And Bruno was famous everywhere.

783
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:28,607
As for the Loutz ...
We decided to get married in California.

784
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:33,087
But because of the law had
either of two shows to the bride.

785
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:35,905
I feel that this is the biggest step,
you do in your life,

786
01:11:37,283 --> 01:11:37,745
-is a great time.
-You are right.

787
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:41,089
Will I be able to acknowledge,
before we begin?

788
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:42,358
Sure.

789
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:57,990
I don't marry two men or
two women.

790
01:11:58,872 --> 01:12:01,468
But if that's a man how is that our son?

791
01:12:04,164 --> 01:12:06,289
You gave birth to a black child? ...

792
01:12:07,099 --> 01:12:07,673
Yes.

793
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:10,120
When did you have the baby?

794
01:12:11,812 --> 01:12:13,093
I don't know why I even asked that.

795
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:17,794
Even if the marriage was not,

796
01:12:17,943 --> 01:12:20,212
we leave that to make us negative.

797
01:12:20,697 --> 01:12:24,151
We were happy.
We were together and had the OJ with us.

798
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:34,888
I became so famous that could
record my own Charity Video.

799
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:49,759
I wrote a song that will bring the world together.
800
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,671
Thrown weapons and bombs,

801
01:12:59,285 --> 01:13:03,170
and make love last forever.

802
01:13:08,357 --> 01:13:10,563
Came to heal the world

803
01:13:11,832 --> 01:13:15,208
and make the mission with substance.

804
01:13:20,839 --> 01:13:24,601
I am Austrian Jesus,

805
01:13:25,015 --> 01:13:28,299
White is the Ompama.

806
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,470
There is basis to fear,

807
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,933
war in South and North Korea.

808
01:13:41,215 --> 01:13:43,902
You really all Chinese.

809
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:47,217
Bruno is the the devil.

810
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,871
I had a dream for the 3rd World.

811
01:14:16,117 --> 01:14:19,166
clean water, food
and teaching.

812
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:27,802
In every village and every city,

813
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:31,280
A party that does not fade.

814
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:40,411
We need to live a world without hunger ...

815
01:14:40,672 --> 01:14:43,736
I am just like Bonnie much new.

816
01:14:44,845 --> 01:14:47,302
It is only 19 ...

817
01:14:47,878 --> 01:14:50,416
Bruno I am the devil.

818
01:14:53,307 --> 01:14:54,975
Hey if it is Gay, is Gay ...

819
01:14:55,678 --> 01:14:56,921
Ok.
