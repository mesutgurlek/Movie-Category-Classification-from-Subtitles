340
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:10,668
Therefore I had planed all this.

341
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,704
What you think,
I crashed on your car?

342
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:16,835
I came in front of you

364
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,074
I don't want that
they come to find from somewhere else

365
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:22,812
it will not be good

366
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,812
I'll convince my dad..
But what about your father.

367
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:35,976
He may think thatl and
my father made a plan..

368
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,943
I'll convince him.

From where dol get it.

372
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,872
Dont worry.
You'll get it from one person

373
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:54,639
I got a phone call from my man,
he's bringing the lamp

374
01:12:56,734 --> 01:12:58,680
he was saying that
he stole it last night.

375
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,671
That speaker and music
system which sold out.

01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:09,671
Its bmw steering.

377
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:15,774

379
01:13:23,634 --> 01:13:26,615

who stole our garage“

380
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,671
Let him come

381
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,874
go and waste on your girlfriend.

382
01:14:11,734 --> 01:14:16,581
How do you do this.

383
01:14:19,734 --> 01:14:22,772

388
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:58,745
Look at me ..

389
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:03,482
I've never spend money
on myself.

390
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,670
I always spend for my girl.

391
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:12,481
How hardly she got picked up.

392
01:16:17,434 --> 01:16:21,405
You see your luck..
You grew up in hustle.

393
01:16:21,634 --> 01:16:23,545
Nosign ofgirls

395
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:39,610
You're right monto,

Why so hurry

400
01:19:41,434 --> 01:19:43,345
I don't want them to know
from somewhere else.

401
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:47,247
I won't feel good.

402
01:19:49,334 --> 01:19:53,305

403
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:15,339

01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:25,282

414
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,101
but till you were gone.

415
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:53,069
You betrayed me
in exchange of trust.

416
01:22:55,067 --> 01:22:59,209
Today I'm letting you go because
of eshika, next time I'll kill you

420
01:23:35,067 --> 01:23:38,207
allright..
I'm ready to meet them

421
01:29:06,834 --> 01:29:09,678
whatever happened after
that randheer people will not sit idle

422
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:12,771
think about eshika.

423
01:29:13,734 --> 01:29:15,714
If she'll know all this“
50 what affect will be.

424
01:29:17,834 --> 01:29:20,838
You're like my sister“
Please obey me.

425
01:29:22,767 --> 01:29:26,715
Take eshika from here far away

426
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:29,814
our shadow will
be on you always.

427
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:35,940
Meera is gone“

428
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:39,805
Nobody knows where is she.

429
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:43,806
But I want to meet meera

430
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,746
have to tell her that
what had happened there..

431
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:52,911
I'm not very wise, butl understand
one thing after this massacre.

432
01:29:54,634 --> 01:29:56,705
Nothing is in life.

433
01:29:57,634 --> 01:30:00,615
Forget everthing“
And think about veer.

434
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:38,673
This destiny is repeating stow

435
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,773
raj know meera earlier.

436
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:45,669
Orwhat is the reason to say no

437
01:32:43,467 --> 01:32:45,469
your brother's real
name isn't raj.

438
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:50,539
Its mean his real
name is ramlal.

439
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:14,380
Therefore brother didn't got married.

440
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:17,548
Ramlal was screwed becaue
he could fullfll page's need.

441
01:35:41,267 --> 01:35:44,305
I just asked you question,
because I neverwanted to become father.

442
01:37:52,234 --> 01:37:54,145
My sister dumb your brother for money

443
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,372
I heared it from brother's
close friend.

444
01:37:58,234 --> 01:37:59,338
Heared it from his brother.

445
01:38:00,267 --> 01:38:02,304
Its all true..

446
01:38:03,367 --> 01:38:07,144
You both disappearfor few days.

447
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,280
Who knows they both
change the mind after thsi

448
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:14,282
they're not ice cream...
you both elope and get married.

449
01:39:49,034 --> 01:39:52,015
I've a idea for merging ramlal and pogo

450
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:53,271
we'll send the goons after pogo“

451
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:00,171
And when there'll be vilalin
and heroin situation hero will enter.

452
01:40:01,034 --> 01:40:03,207
Vilalin will pack up,
and hero heroin will patch up

453
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,173
to waking up old love,
you're giving old idea.

454
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,004
The strong intoxication
is in old wine.

455
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:16,080
You just say yes.

456
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:23,047
Whoééoe become goon

457
01:40:28,001 --> 01:40:30,072
its king's car

458
01:40:31,134 --> 01:40:35,139
why're you roaming in this ca r.
So its stolen

459
01:40:37,034 --> 01:40:41,983

50 change its colon.

460
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:46,104
50 I could sale it..
You know I'll never help you

461
01:40:47,134 --> 01:40:50,240
but the goods you stole of“
I've matterwith him

462
01:40:52,134 --> 01:40:54,011
but we've to hide this car
from raj brother.

463
01:40:55,167 --> 01:40:58,046
Hide the car,
and don't tell brother

464
01:40:58,967 --> 01:41:00,139
dol tell him aboutyour item.

465
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,971
Whateveryou did for me,
I will neverforget.

466
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:46,878
Please save me

467
01:44:12,901 --> 01:44:13,879
its that a way..

468
01:44:14,767 --> 01:44:18,738
Who thinks this ideas..

469
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,972
Are you gone mad?

470
01:44:24,901 --> 01:44:28,906
What do you think“
By doing this he.

471
01:44:30,767 --> 01:44:33,748
That relationship is over,
will never gain anything.

472
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,881
It doesn't look good“.

473
01:44:39,734 --> 01:44:40,940
How can you say this.

474
01:44:45,734 --> 01:44:47,873
First of all I don't believe
that sister leaved you for money

475
01:44:49,767 --> 01:44:53,840
if she leaved you,

538
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:06,607
After the parents.
I completed your desires.

539
02:04:10,668 --> 02:04:12,579
Never asked why

540
02:04:13,601 --> 02:04:15,581

decisions.

541

But I'll check first for her sister.

566
02:15:08,101 --> 02:15:09,910
Malik betrayed you

567
02:15:11,101 --> 02:15:12,978
whatever kaali said was right.

568
02:15:15,967 --> 02:15:17,947
Why did you tell me this before.

569
02:15:18,934 --> 02:15:20,072

02:18:54,834 --> 02:18:57,838
The garage is curs“

585
02:19:08,701 --> 02:19:10,738
Whateverl saw"
I believed on it.

586
02:19:12,667 --> 02:19:14,647
Didn't give you chance
to let you explain to me

You're crossing your
border line king.

613
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:45,247
Because seema rekha
never let me cross borders in college.

614
02:26:46,334 --> 02:26:48,336
It happens with everyone

what you did with my drugs?

616
02:26:53,234 --> 02:26:54,338
Whateverl did..

You were right“
And brotherwas wrong.

624
02:29:56,034 --> 02:29:58,310
You leave him for money,
because brother became don

Why didn't you tell him truth

628
02:30:17,234 --> 02:30:19,009

631
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:28,077
We should begin again
