Frankie: On college campuses
across the midwest,

2
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:09,916
January means one thing... sorority rush.

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:12,752
Parties, teas, and dressing to impress.

4
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:13,820
Oh!

5
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:16,022
Which one do you like better?

6
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:17,624
The one with the missing strap

7
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,759
or the one with the broken heel?

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,662
I checked on kickinltcollegestyle.com

9
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,831
in the "brush up on rush" section,

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,100
and they said to be casual but memorable...

11
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:29,068
Casuable.

12
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:30,703
I don't know how it works these days, Sue.

13
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:31,704
I haven't been in college for...

14
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:33,339
Years.

15
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:35,975
I just really feel like a sorority

16
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:37,777
is finally gonna be my thing, you know?

17
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:40,018
I mean, I've made friends
with people in the dorm,

18
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,921
but I just don't feel like
I've really found my people.

19
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,522
Or even my person, really.

20
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:45,490
Well, just remember.

21
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,025
If you get in, that's great,

22
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,927
but if you don't get in, that's fine, too.

23
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:50,862
Angelina Jolie was never in a sorority,

24
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:52,530
and she married Brad Pitt.

25
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:54,766
Not that marriage is the answer
if don't get into a sorority.

26
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,034
Or even if you do.

27
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,802
Marriage is not the answer,
is what I'm saying.

28
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:58,903
It's never a solution.

29
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:01,873
Oh, yeah. I like the one on the left.

30
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:03,041

Okay. Here's all you got to know.

34
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,287
The best sororities are the
Kappas, Thetas, Alphas,

35
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:14,686
and you're not gonna get in there, so...

36
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:16,154
Obviously!

37
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,089
I am not even trying for those,

00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:08,728
and cuddle you till you fall asleep.

329
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:09,863
You're a little late for that.

330
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:10,997
I know.

331
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:13,300
I should have done it nine years ago.

332
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:16,136
I-I mean, I've been asleep for a half-hour.

Oh.

334
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:20,440
Well, now that you're
awake, I've been thinking.

335
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:23,043
Since you're still on break
and I'm off for another week,

336
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:25,078
maybe we could have a mom and Brick day.

337
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,413
Why?

338
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:29,015
Just 'cause things are going so fast,

339
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:31,184
Mr. grown-up-pants-shopper.

340
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:34,321
I guess I got busy and
took you for granted.

341
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:37,357
But we really should spend time
together while we have it.

342
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,926
I don't know.

343
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:42,762
I mean, I'm older now. I've got a friend.

344
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:45,365
You might have missed your window.

345
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,968
Well, let's just see if we can
crank that window back open.

346
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:49,102
Here's an idea.

347
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:51,204
Let's write down a bunch
of fun things to do,

348
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:52,641
put them in a hat, and
pick one out each day.

349
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,075
- No.
- Okay, okay. Just one idea.

350
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:58,378
Fine. I guess... I'll go bowling.

351
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,246
Can I bring Troy?

352
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,314
What? No.

353
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,917
Troy got the pants. Bowling's our thing.

354
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,186
Fine, whatever. Good night.

Good night, sweet pea.

Uh, mom.

00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,829
Shh. Just one more minute.

Hey. I think I'm finally getting the hang

359

489
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,779
I remember when I first joined Twitter,

490
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,214
it took me like 10 minutes
to figure it out.

491
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,982
Hmm.

492
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:05,818
You know, I may not have to worry
about your future so much.

493
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,820
You seem like you're doing okay.

494
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,922
So that's it?

495
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,824
You're not gonna rub my nose in it?

496
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,342
Half the Internet's calling
me "the diaper dipwad."

497
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:16,296
Nah. My dad taught me
that when you're right,

498
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:18,765
act like you've been there before.

499
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:24,438
♪ ♪

500
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,312
Okay, you guys.

501
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,914
Before you open your final bid envelopes,

502
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:36,949
I just want to say...

503
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,087
This is the strongest pledge
class we have ever had.

504
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:42,489
You know, I remember back when...

505
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,226
You go first.

506
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:48,962
I can't wait to see where you got in.

507
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,465
What?

508
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,200
Who is it? Kappas? Thetas?

509
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,868
They changed the rules
so you could join both

510
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,070
because they both loved you so much?

511
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:59,405
I didn't get in anywhere.

512
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:00,973
What?

513
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:02,408
That's crazy.

514
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,944
If you made up a girl who
should get into a sorority,

515
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:05,945
it would be you!

516
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,480
You are, like, perfect.

517
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:10,283
You're funny. You're cool. You
have a horse named twinkie.

518
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,819
Actually, twinkie's my car.

519
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,488
My horse's name is Cinnamon.

520
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,224
Lexie!

521
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,959
We're gonna be Alphas!

522
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,160
Where'd you get in?

523
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,095
Um, I...

524
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:23,830
I actually didn't.

525
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:25,965
Um, but... but it's okay.

526
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,000
Seriously. Go on and have fun.

527
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,502
Don't worry about me.

528
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,503
Congratulations!

529
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:37,877
Lexie... that was so brave.

530
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:40,847
That was, like, "hunger games" brave.

531
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:41,981
Look at me. I'm a mess.

532
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,116
I'm going on and on

533
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,151
and you haven't even opened your envelope.

534
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:46,753
Okay.

535
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:49,522
Just because my life is
over doesn't mean yours is.

536
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:52,259
Go on. Open it.

537
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm not gonna.

538
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:02,902
What? Of course you're gonna.

539
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,771
This... this is the year of Sue.

540
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:06,906
You've got big things coming.

541
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:11,177
I do, and I don't think
it's being in a sorority.

542
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,079
What if I got in?

543
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,015
That would mean that next
year I would be a person

544
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,151
who helped make someone feel like this.

545
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,886
Don't be silly.

546
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:23,322
Yeah, it hurts now, but I'll get over it.

547
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,957
Believe me.

548
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,827
I am all about sisterhood and philanthropy,

549
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,996
but ever since the candle ceremony,

550
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:32,765
I can't stop thinking about that book.

551
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:35,034
And now I wonder... maybe we're not

552
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:37,003
supposed to just sit around

553
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:40,206
waiting for someone to love
us enough to make us real.

554
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,875
Maybe it's our job to love someone else

555
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:44,444
for them to become real.

556
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:47,146
We're not the rabbit.

557
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,148
We're the boy!

558
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,451
Wow.

559
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:54,187
That must have been some ceremony.

560
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:56,522
All right, come on. Let's get out of here.

561
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,057
Wait.

562
00:19:58,058 --> 00:19:59,392
Don't you even want to know if you got in?

563
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:00,861
Uh...

564
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,330
Nope, didn't get in.

565
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:06,165
Come on, you're just saying that

566
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,433
to make me feel better.

567
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:08,501
Honestly, I didn't.

568
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:09,503
Oh, wow. You really didn't.

569
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:13,072
I...

570
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:17,176
I have all these weird,
unfamiliar feelings inside.

571
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:19,178
Is this what rejection is?

572
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,913
Yep.

573
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,815
Luckily, you're with a pro.

574
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:25,218
Now, here's what you're gonna want to do...

575
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:27,186
Cry.

576
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:28,454
But not into your pillow,

577
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,789
'cause you're gonna have
to sleep on it later.

578
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,524
I suggest a sweatshirt or...

579
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:34,827
So, Sue had found a sister,
just not the sorority kind.

580
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:36,462
And the brochures were right.

581
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:38,364
If you go through rush,

582
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:41,801
sometimes you do find exactly
what you're looking for.

583
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:44,837
And as for Brick, well, we
finally did go bowling.

584
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:46,839
This is gonna be fun, huh?

585
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,975
Hey, maybe we can even
grab some dinner after.

586
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:50,810
You know, next time we go to the mall,

587
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:52,078
I think I'm gonna buy a shirt.

588
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,412
Me too.

589
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,815
I'm gonna get a tasteful zombie
shirt that girls would like.

590
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,817
Ooh. You know, I could help.

591
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:59,151
After the dark-wash jeans,

592
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,954
I really feel like I'm
developing a sense of style.

593
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:04,090
A person can only wear so much stripes.

594
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,158
I guess it was the natural order of things,

595
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,427
and it was good Brick finally had a friend.

596
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:10,796
I mean, he didn't talk
to me the whole night.

597
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:12,465
I was basically the chauffeur.

598
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,033
But that's okay,

599
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,501
'cause he'll be driving soon enough.

600
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:17,436
And who knows?

601
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:20,239
This could be the last time I
ever get to be his chauffeur.

602
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,043
And I was going to enjoy
every minute of it.

603
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:29,504
