for every mistake.

Every time a sheep goes the wrong way,
that's a mistake and you lose points.

- [ Fly ] A while back
when Rex was in his prime,

549
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:27,347
the winter rains brought
a great flood to the valley.

550
00:49:27,472 --> 00:49:30,766
Rex and the boss got most of
the flock onto the high ground.

551
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,894
Then Rex went back
to look for the strays.

552
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:37,647
He found them. They'd been
stranded by the rising water.

00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:43,651
He tried to herd them across
to safety, but they wouldn't budge.

to save their own skins.

and the water kept rising.

right through the night.

By morning,

was never the same again.

He'd never want anyone to know,
but he's almost totally deaf.

- That's not the half of it.

00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:24,392
[ Fly ] All this was barely a month
before the Grand National Challenge.

564
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:28,812
He tried his best, but he couldn't hear
the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.

565
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:32,523
The cold truth is that,
but for the stupidity of sheep,
