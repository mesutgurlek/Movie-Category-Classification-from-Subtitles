1
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,331
Extreme close-up!

2
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,779
OK. All right.

3
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,714
All right. Here we are
in our new surroundings,

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,653
the abandoned Acme Doll factory
in downtown Aurora, Illinois.

5
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:02,625
- An official babe lair.
- It'll be Chick Central.

6
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,594
I feel sorry for guys
who still live with their parents.

7
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,257
OK. You've probably noticed
we're on early tonight.

8
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:13,372
Usually, at this time on Aurora
Cable, you're watching Plant World.

9
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,872
They didn't want our 10:30 time slot.

10
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:20,274
But we were able to talk Plant World
into changing with Cooking World.

11
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,711
Although they didn't want to change.

12
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:27,342
Fortunately, White Supremacy World
was cancelled and the trades worked.

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,852
Finally, the reason we're on early

14
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,685
is because we're going to a concert
tonight in Chicago.

15
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,225
- Excellent.
- Yes.

16
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:40,264
Did I mention
that we'll be seeing Aerosmith?

17
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,427
Until next week,
good night and party on.

18
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,631
- Party on, Wayne!
- Party on, Garth.

19
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,310
And we're out.

20
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,718
- All right! Let's move, people!
- All right. Garth!

21
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,757
- To the Mirthmobile.
- The Mirthmobile!

22
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,659
All right!

23
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,177
Hi. I'm Wayne Campbell. Excellent.
Welcome to Wayne's World 2.

24
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,015
Let me bring you up to speed.
Come on.

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,092
There's a lot to tell you,
so let's take the scenic route.

26
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:50,125
A year has passed. I'm a little older
and a little wiser.

27
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,602
I'm starting to get hair
in really weird places.

28
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,640
I feel like
I'm turning into Sasquatch.

29
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,107
I still go out
with my girlfriend Cassandra.

30
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,042
She's cutting a record demo
right now.

31
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:06,379
Her career's really taking off.
You remember Cassandra, don't you?

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,389
What a babe! She'd give a dog a bone!

33
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,826
But you know,
even though I live on my own now,

34
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,494
everybody's really hassling me
to do something with my life.

35
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,800
To become an adult.

36
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,002
I feel like I'm in a John Hughes
"rites de passage" movie.

37
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,546
But what I'd really like to do
is something extraordinary.

38
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:42,348
Something big, something mega,
copious, capacious, cajunga.

39
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,618
But I'll probably
end up working at Great America,

40
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,990
mopping up hurl and lung butter.

41
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,567
You remember my best friend
Garth Algar, right?

42
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,703
I almost forgot.
This year, Garth finally got pubes.

43
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,078
You didn't tell them
about my pubes, did you?

44
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,725
No, of course not.

45
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,459
You are listening to WPIG, the Pig.

46
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:33,300
- All rock, all the time.
- WPIG Aurora.

47
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,842
Handsome Dan coming at you on
the short side of nine bells at WPIG,

48
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:43,210
America's rock authority. What do
you say we check in with Mr Scream?

49
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,762
God, Handsome Dan is so cool.
He must get a million chicks.

50
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,424
I bet he's totally studly and buffed.

51
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,504
With that voice,
he's gotta be a babe magnet.

52
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,747
Welcome to Mikita's.
How may I serve you?

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,984
I'd like 'rullers, 'ugar, 'ucks
and a Mikita 'cup...

54
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:32,695
And then I think I would like a large...
...with 'eam.

55
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,295
And could I please have
'elly donut and...

56
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,533
...raspberry and a 'nge drink?
- What?

57
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,771
- I'm sorry. And 'eaker 'oken.
- Let me recap the order.

58
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,676
A cruller, two sugar pucks,
a large coffee with cream,

59
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,876
a raspberry jelly doughnut,
orange drink, a box of five-holes.

60
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,854
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Drive around, please.

61
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,556
I'm so psyched.
Aerosmith's gonna kick ass!

62
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,932
But where are we supposed
to meet Cassandra?

63
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,044
Backstage laminates.

64
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,659
Encore! Encore!

65
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,919
Let's go!

66
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,491
Garth! Somebody just grabbed my butt!

67
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,238
- All right!
- I feel weird.

68
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,272
It's like a thousand fingers
urging you to let go.

69
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,913
- I'm having fun.
- Excellent!

70
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,869
- You guys wail! You guys rule, man!
- Lunch is here!

71
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,010
- Dude looks like a lady...
- So do you!

72
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,777
All right! Coming by!

73
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:43,547
Excuse me!
Where is the backstage area?

74
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,526
Excuse us. Excuse me.

75
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,843
They're cool.

76
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,016
- There she is. Cassandra!
- Campbell!

77
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,757
- Campbell!
- There she is.

78
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:27,425
- Sorry we couldn't sit together.
- No troubles. Great concert!

79
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:32,232
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Bobby Cahn of Sharp Records.

80
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,566
- Excellent.
- Good to see you.

81
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,734
- Bobby's my record producer.
- We must drop by the studio.

82
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,211
I don't have to tell you how
extremely talented Cassandra is.

83
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,680
You've heard, you've seen, you know.

84
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:51,551
Scott. I want you to meet someone.
Cassandra, this is Scott.

85
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,783
- Hi.
- And Dwayne.

86
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,951
- Actually, Wayne.
- Right.

87
00:09:56,128 --> 00:10:00,360
- Bobby says you're very talented.
- I was saying the same thing.

88
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,293
I want to ask you something.

89
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,269
- Don't you hate schmoozing?
- Yes. I just despise it.

90
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,412
Stand back, please!

91
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,647
We're not worthy! We're not worthy!

92
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:29,261
- You're worthy. Get up.
- You guys were excellent tonight.

93
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:33,125
- Thanks a lot. We'll see you inside.
- We're planning on it.

94
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,898
Excellent.

95
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,234
Gotcha. Great. Hold on.

96
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,606
Excuse me.

97
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:54,847
- Jeez. Wayne, look.
- Garth, it's Heather locklear.

98
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,854
And she's signalling to us!
There is a God.

99
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,018
Heather be thy name.

100
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,528
Schwing!

101
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,591
- Bobby!
- Heather!

102
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,966
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, we're...

103
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,004
- This is Cassandra.
- Hello.

104
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,301
We're supposed to be in there.

105
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,502
- No, you're not.
- My girlfriend's in there.

106
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,081
A lot of people's girlfriends
are in there.

107
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,150
Denied.

108
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,297
Hi! Where are you from?
I'm from Wilmette.

109
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,002
I'm from Cicero.
Isn't it cool to be downtown?

110
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,239
Are you those guys
with that TV show in Aurora?

111
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,043
- Wayne's World?
- Wayne's World!

112
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,086
- No!
- You guys sure look like 'em.

113
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,986
If Wayne says we're not,
we're not, OK?

114
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,261
How long does it take
to get here from Aurora?

115
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,727
It takes me 40 minutes door-to-door.

116
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:17,494
My ma gave me a dollar and
dropped me off at the park-and-ride.

117
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,842
Dogs. Dogs.

118
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,343
...and Marilyn. Marilyn.

119
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,513
I saw the creature.
I saw the creature...

120
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,970
- Who are you?
- I'm Jim Morrison.

121
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:36,308
- Cool. Who's he?
- A weird naked Indian.

122
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,177
Cool.

123
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,648
Why have you brought me here?

124
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,915
To help you find some answers, Wayne.

125
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,490
- Answers to what?
- Ask me a question.

126
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,359
Two trains travelling at 60mph, one
from Chicago, one from los Angeles...

127
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,931
No. Ask me a question
about your life.

128
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,035
What am I supposed to do
with my life?

129
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,864
You should put on a concert
in Aurora, Wayne.

130
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:08,605
- How will I get the bands to come?
- If you book them, they will come.

131
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,306
But I don't know
how to put on a concert.

132
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,975
You must go to England and find a man
named Del Preston,

133
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,519
the greatest roadie that ever lived.

134
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,783
He was with us in the good times
and the bad.

135
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,723
He'll help you. Any more questions?

136
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,790
Will Garth ever get his
Sports Illustrated football phone?

137
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,934
It was sent to the wrong house.

138
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,696
It will arrive tomorrow with
the swimsuit issue and the video,

139
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,137
The Stanley Cup - 100 Years of Glory.

140
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,611
How do I get back?

141
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,840
- Follow the weird naked Indian.
- Cool.

142
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,542
Wake up, Wayne!

143
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:54,658
Garth! I just had the most vivid
and powerful dream of my life.

144
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,796
Last night, Jim Morrison spoke to me.

145
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:02,400
He told me that the purpose
of my life was to put on a concert.

146
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:08,164
Guess what finally came in the mail?

147
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,638
I guess they sent it
to the wrong house.

148
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,573
My Sports Illustrated
football phone...

149
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,771
- Oh, my God!
- Cool.

150
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,678
My Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue...

151
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,553
Oh, my God.

152
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,884
...and the History of the
Stanley Cup - 100 Years of Glory.

153
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,084
Garth, it's a sign!

154
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:36,898
We will put on a concert.
Oh, yes. We will put on a concert.

155
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,312
This must be the place.

156
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,477
Maybe we should've called Cassandra
before we dropped by.

157
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:01,558
Garth, it's us. No one'll hassle us.
Cassandra needs the encouragement.

158
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,666
Excuse me, what are you guys
doing here in the street?

159
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,896
I'm stacking these chickens
in the crates.

160
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,667
Jim makes sure we have
plenty of watermelons.

161
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,833
So you're selling watermelons?

162
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,879
No, we just make sure there's plenty
stacked. Just like the chickens.

163
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:28,577
- What do they do?
- They walk past with this glass.

164
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,721
That's... weird.

165
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,020
You got to wonder
if this is gonna pay off later on.

166
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,807
- Cool.
- It's OK.

167
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,811
We ought to overdub a track
with Bobby. He can wail.

168
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,382
Give them a few minutes.
They're working on it.

169
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,146
The label figures
you got three singles on this one.

170
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,587
- They want you to come to the coast.
- Excellent.

171
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,728
Not bad for a little girl
from Hong Kong.

172
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,828
- What brings you here, Wayne?
- I had to tell Cassandra something.

173
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,268
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

174
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:28,209
Last night I had a dream. We're gonna
put on a concert in Aurora.

175
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,578
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah. It's a festival.

176
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,981
- A festival?
- A festival. You heard the man.

177
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:40,387
- Charming. What's it called?
- What's it called? It's called...

178
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,021
It's called...

179
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,532
- It's called Waynestock.
- Waynestock.

180
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,765
Who's going to be there?

181
00:17:55,541 --> 00:18:00,069
- Aerosmith and Pearl Jam.
- Who else?

182
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,145
Me and Wayne.

183
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,814
- And...
- And...

184
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,722
- Van Halen.
- Van Halen. Who else?

185
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,384
Yeah. Who else?

186
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,732
An old man fashioning a kayak
out of a log...?

187
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:27,033
- What?
- No! Rip Taylor!

188
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,537
Rip Taylor's gonna be there.

189
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:33,076
Rip Taylor? He's a God in my country.
He gets mobbed in the street.

190
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:38,376
Great, 'cause he's gonna be there.
I thought maybe you could play, too.

191
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,485
- I would be honoured.
- I wouldn't commit just yet.

192
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,087
You got some real gigs coming up.
Real gigs!

193
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,850
Real gigs?

194
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,426
Lx-nay on the condescension-ay
there, Chet.

195
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,599
- Bobby, can I ask you a question?
- What is it, Garth?

196
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,430
A sphincter says what?

197
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:06,343
I said, a sphincter says what?

198
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,976
You want me to say "what",
like I don't get it. Is that it?

199
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,584
Is that it?

200
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:21,852
Oh, dear. Last guy didn't get.
You big. You big.

201
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,258
We small. We better go.

202
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,596
- Where are you going?
- England!

203
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,535
I can't believe Paramount is paying
to fly us to England.

204
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,865
I thought they'd use doubles.

205
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:41,042
- Here we are at Piccadilly Circus.
- What a shitty circus.

206
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,408
Good call. There's no animals
or clowns.

207
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:47,484
What a rip-off.
Let's go to Buckingham Palace.

208
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:53,653
Does Princess Di still live here?
She is such a babe.

209
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,263
Did Jim Morrison give you
Del Preston's exact address?

210
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,701
- He said exactly london, England.
- OK.

211
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,338
I don't know about this, Wayne.

212
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:28,884
- Del?
- Hello?

213
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,874
- Are you Del Preston?
- I might be. Who are you?

214
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,775
- My name's Wayne Campbell.
- I'm Garth Algar.

215
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,714
That's terribly fascinating, man,
but you woke me up.

216
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,217
How can you sleep like that?

217
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:01,758
Listen, Sonny Jim, sleeping like this
will add 10 years to your life.

218
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,701
I learned it from Keith Richards
when I toured with the Stones.

219
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,770
That may be why Keith cannot be
killed by conventional weapons.

220
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,876
- How can I be of assistance?
- You're gonna think I'm nuts, but...

221
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,112
...someone visited me in a dream

222
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,154
and told me that Del Preston

223
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,054
would help me put on a concert
in Aurora, Illinois.

224
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,922
A concert?

225
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:44,561
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.
I don't do that any more.

226
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,376
I'm just an old geezer.
What do I know about music today?

227
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,536
When I was working,
it was all bands like Eric Clapton

228
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,181
and the Rolling Stones.

229
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,183
It's not like the Grateful Dead
are still touring, is it?

230
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,083
- Actually...
- Garth.

231
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,027
Look at this scrapbook.

232
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,956
- That's you with led Zeppelin.
- Yeah.

233
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,895
My old lady put that together.

234
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,628
We must've toured every concert hall
and venue in America,

235
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,932
me, my old lady and the road.

236
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,473
- Is that you and Bob Dylan?
- Yeah.

237
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,441
- Who's the old lady?
- That's my old lady.

238
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,476
It was fun,
but those days are gone forever.

239
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,849
But we came from America
just to talk to you.

240
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,287
I'm sorry.
I don't do concerts any more.

241
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,293
Come on. Let's go.

242
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:50,968
Well, I still think you led
a really cool life.

243
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,971
- It was nice meeting you.
- I guess Jim was wrong.

244
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,207
Hang about.

245
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,347
Was it Jim Morrison?

246
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,816
- Yes!
- Did he have a naked Indian?

247
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:13,151
- Yes!
- I have to ask you...

248
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,418
Didn't you think
it was a trifle unnecessary

249
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,926
to see the crack
in the Indian's bottom?

250
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,827
- Yes! Absolutely!
- I had the same dream.

251
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:30,905
- Del, you'll really love Aurora.
- Who's Aurora, anyway?

252
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:36,179
Frank, this is Bobby.
Did you get the tape?

253
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:40,409
What'd you think?
Definitely. She sounds great.

254
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,819
Yeah, the band is terrible.
It's a garage band.

255
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,323
They can't, I'm sure.

256
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,762
I'm working with them.
I'm still in this studio in Aurora.

257
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,159
What the hell you doing there?

258
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,267
- She wants to stay here.
- Why?

259
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,667
Same reason they all want to stay,
she's got a boyfriend.

260
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,331
Don't worry. I'll get rid
of the boyfriend and the band.

261
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,410
I'd like to finish the album in IA.

262
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,480
All right, Bobby.
Let's just get it done, OK?

263
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:19,050
And there I am in Sri lanka,
formerly Ceylon, at 3am,

264
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:23,422
looking for 1,000 brown M&Ms
to fill a brandy glass,

265
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,291
or Ozzy
wouldn't go on stage that night.

266
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,696
Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

267
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,565
and mentions there's a little
sweet shop on the edge of town.

268
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,070
We go, and it's closed.

269
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,608
There's me and Keith Moon
and David Crosby

270
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,612
breaking into this
little sweet shop, right?

271
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:49,618
Instead of a guard dog, they've got
this bloody great big Bengal tiger.

272
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:54,753
I managed to take out the tiger
with a can of mace,

273
00:24:54,926 --> 00:25:00,330
but the shop owner and his son,
that's a different story altogether.

274
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,765
I had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

275
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:10,966
Nasty business, really,
but sure enough, I got the M&Ms,

276
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:15,101
and Ozzy went on stage
and did a great show.

277
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,714
That was excellent.

278
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,719
To put on a really great rock show,

279
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:27,086
like Knebworth in England
or Woodstock,

280
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,161
there is only one place
you can do it, and that's here,

281
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:36,631
at Adlai Stevenson Memorial Park,
in the playing fields.

282
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,735
We better go check it out.

283
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,237
So, Wayne...?

284
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,747
I hear you're putting on
some kind of concert.

285
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:55,046
That's good. People need to be
entertained, need the distraction.

286
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,554
I wish somebody'd do something
to block out the voices in my head,

287
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,022
the voices that scream over and over,

288
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:06,186
"Why do they come to me to die?
Why do they come to me to die?"

289
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:29,350
- What do we do now?
- Here. Let me look at it.

290
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,915
Get the flashlight.

291
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:41,522
OK. There's the main gate,
and here we are.

292
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,692
- No, we're over here.
- I don't think so.

293
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,895
We turned left at the gate,
so that would put us...

294
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,633
Garth! Wait a minute.

295
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,578
I know where we are.
I'm pretty good with maps.

296
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,286
- Listen.
- What?

297
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:12,723
- Turn it off!
- I can't turn it off! I can't turn it off!

298
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:27,501
Waynestock? You'd purposely invite
rock 'n' roll into our community?

299
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,671
What's wrong
with a little entertainment?

300
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,285
Entertainment is fine, but this...

301
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,148
We have lots of big acts
that come through here.

302
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:42,316
- Ice Capades, Tiny Toons, Kenny G...
- Kenny G?

303
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,804
We don't even get
to apply for a permit?

304
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:04,278
We would love to put on
a rock concert... not!

305
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,817
Betty Jo, could we have the permits
for a festival, please?

306
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,727
Thank you. You must fill out
the necessary permit applications.

307
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,663
Permit applications.

308
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,462
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Betty Jo.

309
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,373
Hey, you're the guy
that's on that Wayne World show.

310
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,905
- Betty Jo?
- Yeah?

311
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,776
Thank you.

312
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:48,317
All right. Naturally, you'll need
the application for authorisation,

313
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:53,328
approval from the guilds and unions,
you'll need some release forms,

314
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:58,595
the decibel level... What?
Is something wrong?

315
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,707
- What do you mean?
- It's my eye, isn't it?

316
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,310
Why would we want to look
at your eye?

317
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,006
Is there something wrong
with that weird eye?

318
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:15,278
There's nothing wrong with my eye.
This one just has no pigment.

319
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,014
I'm what you call a partial ocular
albino, but I'm fine with it.

320
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,250
I have perfect 20-20 vision
with both eyes.

321
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,521
You're serious about
putting on a rock concert?

322
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,255
Are you kidding?
I'd give my right eye.

323
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:35,128
You realise there are certain
jurisdictions you'll need to follow.

324
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,707
I'd like to think I have
an eye for details.

325
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,147
I'm assuming you have the $5,000
occupancy permit...

326
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,014
...or you wouldn't be here.
- Exsqueeze me?

327
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,386
Baking powder?
$5,000 occupancy permit?

328
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,017
Yes, we have that, actually.
Piece of cake.

329
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,723
Fine. Then all applications
must be filled out in triplicate

330
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,896
and returned at least 10 working days
before the event, with the money.

331
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:12,168
We'll run through these
with a fine-toothed comb,

332
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,107
cross the Ts and dot the...

333
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,943
...lower-case Js.

334
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,257
I keep falling over. Oh, no.
I'm falling over a lot.

335
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,458
Damn these high heels.

336
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,333
Cassandra...?

337
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,305
- Why do you go out with me?
- I love being with you.

338
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,808
Most guys are jerks.
You're a good person.

339
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:54,442
Wait. Let me show you
what I got at a garage sale.

340
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,281
- Isn't that great? Heard of it?
- Exsqueeze me?

341
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:02,757
Have I ever seen this before?
Everybody has Frampton Comes Alive.

342
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,020
If you lived in the suburbs,
you were issued it.

343
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,687
It came in the mail
with samples of Tide.

344
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,664
Look at this old one.
Gerry and the Pacemakers.

345
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:15,363
That is old. I bet those guys
actually have pacemakers by now.

346
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,367
Can you believe they don't make vinyl
anymore? It's weird, isn't it?

347
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,980
- That is weird.
- Bobby said my album won't be vinyl.

348
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,878
Bobby says...
Are you and Bobby having an affair?

349
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,576
No, of course not.
Where did you hear that?

350
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,850
You know how these things start...
one guy tells another guy something,

351
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:38,359
then he tells two friends,
and they tell two friends,

352
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:43,398
and they tell their friends,
and so on, and so on...

353
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:48,437
- You know how it goes.
- Honestly, I'm not having an affair.

354
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,870
I'm nice to him
because he's my producer.

355
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:55,672
If this deal falls through, I lose
my visa and I go back to Hong Kong.

356
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,907
You have nothing to worry about.

357
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,916
My dad's coming to visit.
I'd love you to meet him.

358
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,112
Treat. I'm sure he'll just love me.

359
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,782
Yeah. If you're anything
like my old boyfriend.

360
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:15,259
- I'm nothing like him.
- Then we're screwed.

361
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,667
I haven't seen Garth in a while.
What's he up to?

362
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,463
Garth's doing his laundry.

363
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,664
Too bad he doesn't
have a girlfriend to do his laundry.

364
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,810
Yeah. Thanks for doing my laundry.

365
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,379
How do you get my clothes so white
and fresh-smelling?

366
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,813
It's an old Cantonese method
few people know about.

367
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:41,620
Wait a minute.
Calgon? Ancient Chinese secret?

368
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,612
Hello.

369
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,981
Hi.

370
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:16,492
- I don't recall ever seeing you in here.
- It's my first time in here.

371
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,358
That's right. My mom used
to do all my laundry, but I do now.

372
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,329
I'm what you call "sans parents".

373
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,830
I can go to a movie
on a school night, like that.

374
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,503
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

375
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,314
Would you like
some red rope liquorice?

376
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,919
Sure.

377
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,694
- What's your name?
- Garth Algar. What's yours?

378
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,909
- I'm Honey... Hornée.
- Nice to meet you, Miss Horny.

379
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,308
That's Hornée. It's French.

380
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,473
OK, Miss Hornée.

381
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,676
Garth, would you like
to have dinner some night?

382
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,755
I like to have dinner every night.

383
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,384
No, I mean us. You and me.
Would you like to have dinner?

384
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,058
A date?

385
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,935
Finally. It took, like, two hours.

386
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:56,293
I like 'em teeny and toasty.
So long.

387
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,795
- Bye.
- Bye.

388
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,199
- Maybe we'll see each other around.
- Yeah. See you around.

389
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,872
You forgot these.

390
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,684
Good night, Cassandra. Good work.

391
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,585
- Thanks. See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

392
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:32,890
I have got to get you to IA.
You are buried here.

393
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:36,056
I like it here.
All my friends are here.

394
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,397
- What time is it?
- 10:35.

395
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,664
Damn. I missed the start
of Wayne's show.

396
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,973
OK. We're in a doll factory, right?

397
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,705
It reminds me
of that movie The Leprechaun,

398
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,975
with that little guy that goes,
"I'm the leprechaun."

399
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,609
- Garth, I'm the leprechaun!
- Cool it, OK?

400
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,984
- I'm the leprechaun!
- Stop it, all right?

401
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,592
Don't try and steal me pot o' gold.

402
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,457
- Why do you like these guys?
- Because they're fun.

403
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,565
If I wanted a guy
that was all ambition,

404
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:12,760
I could've stayed in Hong Kong.
Those guys are 12 for 10 cents.

405
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,168
- You mean a dime a dozen.
- Maybe where you shop.

406
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,968
I think you underestimate them.
They're really sharp.

407
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,010
- Stop it, leprechaun man!
- Garth, chill!

408
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,704
What did those monsters do to you?

409
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,942
- I'm not...
- Sweetie. Sweetie.

410
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,852
Come on, sweetie.
Come on. Pixie dust. Pixie dust.

411
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,083
Sweetie, it's me...

412
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,284
- The leprechaun!
- No!

413
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,452
I'm the leprechaun.

414
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,723
Yeah. These guys, really sharp.

415
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:46,199
I'm scared! Want to leave, but can't.

416
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,861
- Want to move.
- Where you gonna move?

417
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,667
- You gonna move to Ireland?
- No!

418
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:51,899
'Cause I'm a leprechaun...

419
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,673
Wayne, we're here!

420
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,849
Here. Let me get the gate for you.

421
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:06,581
All righty. Come on in.
Nice digs, huh?

422
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,793
Cassandra, you look hot.

423
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,422
Sorry.

424
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,593
I'd like you to meet
my father, Mr Wong.

425
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,603
Please meet you acquaintance,
Wayne Campbell.

426
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,286
Very well, if that is your custom.
Prepare to die.

427
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,709
I know all seven animal styles
The crane. The stag.

428
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,615
The horse. The tiger.

429
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,757
The bat. The rat. The monkey.

430
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,018
The beetle.
I will take you, old man.

431
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,377
Your tongue is quick. But your sword?

432
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,644
- Oh, no.
- Wayne!

433
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,925
Hello? Can we talk later?
This is not a good time.

434
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,995
Just a moment.
I've got call-waiting.

435
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,563
Hello. Yes?

436
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,428
Can I call you back?
I am on the other line.

437
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,701
Yes, he received
a Sports Illustrated football phone.

438
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,787
Wayne, no!

439
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:10,130
You've impressed me.
You're worthy of my daughter.

440
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,302
We got a party tomorrow
at Komrades.

441
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,638
It's kind of a fundraiser
for Waynestock.

442
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:26,806
Right. There'll be a $ 10
cover charge. It'll be a big party.

443
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,579
Because it's at Komrades,
we're calling it a Communist party.

444
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,690
I remember one time
I was in a place like this.

445
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:47,804
Sri lanka. Formerly Ceylon.
It was about three in the morning.

446
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:52,636
I was looking for 1,000 brown M&Ms
to fill a brandy glass,

447
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,278
or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage
that night.

448
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,774
Jeff Beck pops his head
round the door

449
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:02,715
and mentions there's a little
sweet shop on the edge of town.

450
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,220
- Wayne! Garth!
- Milton! How's it going?

451
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,418
Awesome party!
Good tunes, good brew, good buddies.

452
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,564
I feel great, man. I feel great!

453
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,532
I don't know, man.
I hate my father. I hate my life.

454
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,637
But I feel great. You guys are great.

455
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,433
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

456
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,975
He's gotten a lot better.

457
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,206
- Way better.
- Yeah.

458
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:37,248
- Thank you.
- I'll be back in a bit.

459
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,493
- How's it going?
- Hi.

460
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,530
It's looking good, Campbell.

461
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,963
- I'll be at the bar.
- Good.

462
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,660
I'm so glad you made it.
You look amazing!

463
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:57,967
I see. Wait. I have great news.

464
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,633
Bobby's taking me to IA
to do the final mix on my album.

465
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:06,841
- Isn't that terrific?
- That's great. I'm ecstatic.

466
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:11,010
I'm beside myself with joy.
Hooray for Hollywood.

467
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,486
Living on your own has its perks.

468
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,888
Your mom doesn't tell you
to turn down the stereo.

469
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,222
That's a real drag.

470
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:23,628
Because moms genetically hate music
played at the appropriate level.

471
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,361
And my dad, forget it.

472
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:30,064
He'd ruin a led Zeppelin
reunion concert.

473
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,641
He hates music at the correct level.

474
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:38,646
But the shopkeeper and his son
was a different story altogether.

475
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:44,153
I had to beat them to death
with their own shoes.

476
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,421
- What's the deal with Bobby?
- Wayne?

477
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:54,523
It's getting a little out of hand.
I think you better say something.

478
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,895
Good call.
Everybody, I'd like to say something!

479
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,094
Excuse me. Everybody,
can I get your attention?

480
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,138
I'd like to say something.
Keep it down.

481
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,444
We're really glad
you could all make it.

482
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:14,209
We never knew we had so many friends
who believed in this concert idea.

483
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,047
When we first had this idea
of putting on this shindig,

484
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,712
we didn't know if anyone would come.

485
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,951
But look...
You're all here, pitching in.

486
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,756
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

487
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,428
Party on!

488
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,384
Garth, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling, man.

489
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,049
I think something's going on.

490
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,105
Hello. Yes?
Is this Aerosmith's tour manager?

491
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,871
It is? Hello.
My name is Wayne Campbell.

492
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,641
You don't know me.
I'm not mental or anything.

493
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:57,776
I'm putting on a concert in Aurora,
Illinois. Yes, I can hold.

494
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,292
Del, look. For years I thought
this was a Mercedes emblem.

495
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,451
Woodstock?
That was quite a show, man.

496
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:09,292
- You were at Woodstock?
- Excellent. What was it like?

497
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:14,666
It rained all morning and then
it cleared up in the afternoon.

498
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,872
That's it. I almost remembered
something else, but it's gone.

499
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:23,103
You can't remember what it was?
Still holding. I want...

500
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:29,448
- Wayne, look what I made.
- Good work, my friend.

501
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,684
You guys got the permit applications?

502
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,655
Got the money?

503
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:44,824
Good for you. Most people
just take them and never come back.

504
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,184
Position 1 to Position 2.
Do you copy?

505
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,691
This is Position 2 in position.
Position 3, what's your position?

506
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,298
Position 3. I read you.

507
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:21,301
- Position 4, do you copy? Over.
- 4 copies. Back to Position 1. Over.

508
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,497
I've to go to IA
for a couple of days.

509
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,872
If you need anything...
I'm at this number.

510
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:41,483
Position 1 to Position 2.
Did you see that?

511
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:46,652
This is Position 2 in position!
Sorry, man. I didn't see anything.

512
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,901
What is it?

513
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,734
Abort! We have been identified!

514
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,646
Abandon positions!

515
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,352
Wayne, let's run away!

516
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,511
Garth, it's locked! In here!

517
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,668
The Tool Box

518
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,091
Come on! Let's go!

519
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,009
Do it, Miss Thing! Do it! Do it!

520
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,573
Get it, girl! Get it, girl!

521
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:27,145
What's the matter? You look like you
want to say something to me.

522
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:30,480
- I think we should break up.
- What? Why?

523
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:36,149
Because there comes a time when
people should go their separate ways.

524
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:43,289
I mean, I've got Waynestock, you've
got your career and your producer,

525
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,904
and I just think it's time
that we should see other people.

526
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,170
I don't want to see other people.

527
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,175
- What about Bobby?
- What about him?

528
00:51:55,345 --> 00:52:00,214
Come on! Do you think
I'm a gullibull or even a gullicalf?

529
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,613
I've no idea
what you're talking about.

530
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:06,620
Right! Come on, now!
What about these?

531
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,397
- Where did these come from?
- I did a little detective work.

532
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:20,434
- You did spy on me.
- Yes, I did.

533
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,065
Easy.

534
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,705
I think she took that well.

535
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,812
Let's go.

536
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,020
Ladies and gentlemen!

537
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:46,663
Your roadie training begins today.
It will not be easy.

538
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,096
You will get tired.
You will get blisters.

539
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:56,968
You will get aches and pains.
But you will also get good.

540
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,171
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir!

541
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,439
Roadies present
and accounted for, sir!

542
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,747
Let's begin.

543
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,824
Eye on the task! Come on. Let's go!

544
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,000
Jesus! It's crazy!

545
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,700
They're getting better, Del. Look.

546
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,978
Get that microphone!

547
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,850
You're worthless!
You're less than nothing!

548
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:54,019
What's keeping you here?
You don't belong here!

549
00:53:54,197 --> 00:54:00,295
- Why don't you just quit?
- 'Cause I got no place else to go!

550
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,819
Thanks for coming in with me. I'm
always afraid to come in by myself.

551
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:35,031
Come. Come on.

552
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,072
Come on. Sit down.

553
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,784
And I'll fix us a little drink, OK?

554
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,911
There you are. An Old Fashioned.

555
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,223
This Coke's gone bad.

556
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:33,320
I just love a man
with a sense of humour.

557
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,123
- You know what I wish?
- What?

558
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:39,792
I wish I could climb inside that big
brain of yours and just walk around.

559
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,338
Really?

560
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,336
- You know what I love?
- What?

561
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:48,443
I love the way those big,
thick glasses magnify your pupils.

562
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,007
Look at me.

563
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:57,243
I'll bet you like to be
in control. Tell me.

564
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,823
When I was 17, my little sister tried
to borrow my Def leppard record.

565
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:06,519
- I said, "No way."
- That's just what I'm talking about.

566
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:13,697
- Oh, my God. You're so limber.
- Don't you just love music?

567
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,170
Do you have any Megadeth?

568
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:39,154
- Come with me.
- I'm blind.

569
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,410
I'm dancing.

570
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,015
You're real squiggly.

571
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,920
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yeah.

572
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,720
- Let me see. Oh. There.
- That's it. Yeah.

573
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:18,026
Feel naughty. Feel naughty.
I thought I saw a puddy cat.

574
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,169
Boldly go where no man
has gone before.

575
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:24,602
- There's got to be a way to find...
- Take me, Garth.

576
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,675
Where?
I'm low on gas and you need a jacket.

577
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:31,871
- I'm gonna be frank.
- OK. Can I still be Garth?

578
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,447
Shut up and kiss me.

579
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:08,076
Can I have some cocoa later?

580
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,526
Good morning, darling.
I trust you slept well.

581
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,791
I hope I wasn't
too much of an animal.

582
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:30,436
- Come. Hold me.
- You know I will.

583
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:35,672
Party on.

584
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,777
He's bobbing.
He's weaving. He winds up!

585
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,378
Outside!

586
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,458
- Are you all right?
- Women.

587
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:55,860
I feel like I'm in the delete bin
of life, next to Mahogany Rush.

588
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:02,527
I'm sorry.
Relationships aren't for the timid.

589
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,908
And I should know.

590
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,771
For I'm no longer a stranger
in the ways of the woman.

591
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:15,816
All right, man, all right.
Good work, my friend.

592
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:20,115
- On that note, game on.
- Game on!

593
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,057
All right!

594
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:27,856
He's wheeling. He's dealing.
He shoots! He scores!

595
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:34,801
OK. Ladies and gentlemen, it takes
two people to run a concert.

596
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:41,206
One backstage and one out front. Two.

597
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:46,242
One man alone cannot do this.

598
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,579
Wayne, you will run
the backstage team.

599
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:55,214
Milton, you are the liaison
between Wayne's backstage team

600
00:59:55,391 --> 01:00:00,590
and Garth's frontstage team,
which includes myself in the booth.

601
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:05,397
To the left and the right of
the stage are the machine gun nests,

602
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,229
belt-fed M-60 Brownings.

603
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:11,601
These babies tend to heat up,
so shoot in three-second bursts.

604
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,242
In the event of capture,

605
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,607
I will personally
distribute cyanide capsules,

606
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:22,547
to be placed under the tongue
like so. Any questions?

607
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,951
Yeah. I have a question.
When did you turn into a nut bar?

608
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:37,027
Thank you, Mr Scream. I'm gonna
be joined by Wayne and Garth,

609
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,432
giving us the low-down
on the Waynestock concert.

610
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:45,540
Hi. We're here to see Handsome Dan.
I'm Wayne Campbell.

611
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:50,543
Ja. I know. We've been expecting you,
Wayne Campbell. I am Bjergen Kjergen.

612
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,908
I love your accent.
Where are you from?

613
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:56,745
- I am from Sweden.
- Really? Where abouts in Sweden?

614
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,978
Knuergen, near the Bjoergen Fjords.

615
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,419
Nice to meet you, Bjergen Kjergen

616
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,287
from Knuergen
near the Bjoergen Fjords.

617
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,396
Knuergen...? That's Kluergen
province, near Bibuergen River.

618
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,226
- Ja.
- Now correct me if I'm wrong.

619
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:16,839
Your rainfall varies from 40 inches
in the winter to 200 in summer.

620
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,736
And your chief export
is modular furniture.

621
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,639
I did a project on Sweden
in the eighth grade.

622
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:25,975
I am impressed with your quest
for knowledge.

623
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:30,882
- Educated men are rare.
- I was up all night working on it.

624
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,453
Then the next day in gym class,

625
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:35,819
I was on the minitramp,
and I got diarrhoea.

626
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,455
I really wish I hadn't told you that.

627
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:45,363
I am sorry to hear of your illness,
but since you've sacrificed

628
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:50,029
your health for knowledge of my
country, I find you very attractive.

629
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:54,404
I hope to make love to you
in the near future.

630
01:01:56,412 --> 01:02:00,371
OK. All right. OK. All right.

631
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:03,549
Dick Van Dyke Show.

632
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,585
- Good work, my friend.
- Yeah.

633
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:17,224
- Are you wearing Brut?
- Yes.

634
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,426
My woman likes me in cologne.

635
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:24,164
Wayne, Garth, let me get
my headset off. I'll be right out.

636
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,440
Hi, Handsome Dan.
It's great to meet you.

637
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:41,318
- I'm not Handsome Dan.
- Hi. Hey.

638
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:46,093
- Hi...
- Handsome Dan.

639
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:55,228
Back with you on WPIG,
maximum grunt.

640
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:59,241
Our special guests,
Wayne Campbell, Garth Algar.

641
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,137
Wayne's World, all right.

642
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,802
Waynestock. Big event.
Everybody's excited.

643
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,974
It's gonna be a big concert
at Adlai Stevenson Park.

644
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:14,055
- A big party with some great bands.
- Like Aerosmith.

645
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:20,560
- There's still tickets left.
- Don't wait till the last minute.

646
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:25,356
'Cause it's a chance
for the city of Aurora...

647
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,527
To do something...

648
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,603
Fun.

649
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:35,574
- And to put the city on the map.
- It's a lot of work.

650
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:40,205
- Work is hard.
- You're not listening, are you?

651
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,777
I could say anything,
like "you're a complete tool".

652
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:50,415
You wouldn't hear, 'cause you're
a freak with a microphone.

653
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:54,721
It's not challenging any more.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

654
01:03:54,897 --> 01:04:00,233
- True, Sphincter Boy?
- What? Oh. They're getting closer.

655
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:04,305
Good information about Waynestock.
We'll be back after PIG sports.

656
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:08,671
It's 16 minutes past the big hour.
Right, Mr Scream?

657
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:16,810
Great. Good stuff.
I think people are getting cranked.

658
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:30,364
- Hi. Bobby, it's Wayne Campbell.
- Wayne. How'd you get this number?

659
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,560
It was written on
the back of a business card.

660
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:38,935
I'm looking for Cassandra. I have
to talk to her. It's really important.

661
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:40,632
I haven't seen her.

662
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,769
She said she might come to IA.
She wasn't definite.

663
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,247
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

664
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:52,217
I have to go. I'm with someone.
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

665
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,846
OK. Thanks. Bye.

666
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:03,191
- Important call?
- Some small-time promoter.

667
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,398
Let's get some lunch.

668
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,636
What you're saying is that
Peter lawford warned Kennedy

669
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:51,541
not to mess with
the military-industrial complex.

670
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:57,243
Yeah. Dig this, man...
J Edgar Hoover was one bad cat.

671
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,548
I mean, he had a completely
different bag from Jack.

672
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:05,558
He just couldn't groove. When two
cats can't groove to the same tune,

673
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:09,027
one of them has to visit
the man upstairs.

674
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,758
That's amazing, man. Excuse me.

675
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:16,962
Wayne, I want you to meet a friend
of mine, Sammy Davis Jr.

676
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,006
- Nice to meet you, Mr Jr.
- Nice to meet you, too, man.

677
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:23,236
I gotta split.
I got some cats I gotta hang with.

678
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:26,939
Bye, Sammy. He's a good man.

679
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,379
And now, Wayne,
what can I do you for?

680
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,714
Listen, Jim,
I'm really confused, OK?

681
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:35,652
We haven't sold any tickets,
we have no bands,

682
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,921
Garth is distracted by chicks,
I broke up with my girlfriend,

683
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,088
and on top of that,
Del's gone completely mental.

684
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:47,258
To complete your journey, you have
to help some people along the way.

685
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,735
This next little bit,
you'll have to go it alone.

686
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:52,533
Keep the faith, my friend.

687
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:58,010
If you book them, they will come.
Hey, Sammy, wait up.

688
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:02,851
Jim, what if nobody shows up?

689
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,931
Sand. Cool.

690
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:28,342
Right. Right, Moe. I understand.

691
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:32,277
- Nervous?
- A little.

692
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,109
I've never been
on The Tonight Show before.

693
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,649
Nothing to worry about.
After the show...

694
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,617
I have to fly to Aurora,
to Waynestock.

695
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,849
Waynestock?
What's this Waynestock thing?

696
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:47,223
- Nothing. Something she has to do.
- Hold on a second, Moe.

697
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:51,389
Listen, Bobby's put together
some great musicians.

698
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:56,004
You're making a great album.
Together, it can't miss.

699
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,766
You're in good hands. He's the best.

700
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,535
You listen to Bobby
and you'll be a big star.

701
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:06,204
A big star. Moe? Yeah.

702
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,647
We're almost out of time,
but I'd just like to point out

703
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:16,383
there are still plenty of excellent
Waynestock tickets still available.

704
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:19,084
Actually, there are about 10,000

705
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:22,128
excellent Waynestock
tickets still available.

706
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,323
And I'd also
like to address a rumour.

707
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,402
There's this rumour
that none of the bands have signed

708
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:31,404
and probably no one's gonna show up.

709
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:34,372
It's true that none of the bands
have signed.

710
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:37,103
Jim Morrison
and his weird naked Indian friend

711
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:41,613
visited me in the night and assured
me that all the bands will come.

712
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,550
That's all the time
we have this week, so until then...

713
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,656
- Party on, Garth.
- Party on, Wayne.

714
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,693
- And we're clear.
- All right!

715
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:06,872
I don't know if you should mention
that Jim Morrison thing any more.

716
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,705
Yeah. It's just that people
have started to talk.

717
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,438
They're saying things like,

718
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:15,482
"Hey, there goes Garth
and his friend Wayne..."

719
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,214
"...the psychopath."

720
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,554
It's embarrassing.
No offence or nothing.

721
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,215
No. None taken.

722
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,956
I believe this knife is yours.

723
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,065
It's just that things
have started to look a little bleak.

724
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,764
Bleak? What? Hey, no guff, Chet.

725
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,375
Until you pointed that out,
it hadn't occurred to me.

726
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:44,445
- Where you going?
- Mikita's.

727
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:48,208
- The usual. Are you coming?
- No. You guys go and have fun.

728
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:51,114
I'd probably end up
embarrassing you anyways.

729
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:55,747
No, no. I'm just gonna to stay here
and lick the cat's butt.

730
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:04,463
Just 15-20 minutes three times a
week can really make a difference...

731
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:09,502
- And all the other products?
- Joe, you know the price. 29.95.

732
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,066
That song is from your album.

733
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:18,338
Oh, man. She looks great.

734
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:22,507
It should be out next month,
or we hope it will be.

735
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,177
Who's we? Who are you looking at?
Let's see the guy.

736
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:31,554
- That's Bobby Cahn, my producer.
- That fine-looking man?

737
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,661
I'm in the wrong business.
I should be a record producer.

738
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:37,822
Then I'd have attractive
women smiling at me.

739
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:45,835
She will be mine again. Oh, yes.
She will be mine again.

740
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:50,307
- You were terrific. They loved you.
- You think so?

741
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,209
Listen to them.
They loved you. Me, too.

742
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:57,546
I didn't think I could do it without
my band. Your guys were so hot.

743
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:01,986
- Damn, I had fun.
- Good. Let's celebrate.

744
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:07,493
- Did you think about what I said?
- Yeah. I'm still thinking about it.

745
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,391
- Give me a week?
- OK.

746
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,604
W-what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?

747
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,774
Garth, I'm so scared.

748
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,038
Has someone hurt you?
I'll take care of it.

749
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,910
I'm a grown-up now, you know.

750
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:33,885
- It's... It's my husband.
- Your what?

751
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:38,288
Darling. I meant to tell you,
but my divorce isn't final,

752
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,487
and he came over here yesterday,
and he was crazy, like an animal.

753
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:47,762
- I wish someone would kill him.
- You mean, kill your husband?

754
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:52,071
No! Don't say it.
You mustn't even think it.

755
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:55,733
I know you love me,
but I won't let you kill my husband.

756
01:11:55,911 --> 01:12:00,007
Although I know you want to.
We both know you want to.

757
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:04,915
Then you could have me any time
you want. And I do mean any time.

758
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:09,714
Get me my cigarettes, would you,
lover? They're in my purse.

759
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,326
I'm just so...

760
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:22,126
That's a pretty big gun.

761
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:28,002
Darling,
all this talk about killing

762
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,635
and.45 magnums with
the clip filed down and the safety off.

763
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,510
It's just all so confusing...

764
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:38,119
I won't. I won't. I won't...

765
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:43,852
- I won't let you.
- He is a dead man.

766
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,425
No way.

767
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:01,602
You know what? I got myself
into this, I'll get myself out of it.

768
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,473
I'll take it on the chin
and be a man.

769
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:09,674
Keep the faith.
If you book them, they will come.

770
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:17,287
OK. All right, man. You got to stop
doing that, all right? Oh, man.

771
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:23,056
- Hello, is anybody here? Hello.
- Oh, my God! Rip Taylor!

772
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,457
- You must be Wayne Campbell.
- Yes, I am.

773
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,330
- How are you?
- Very good.

774
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,337
- This must be Waynestock.
- Yes, it is.

775
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:35,841
- It's rustic and bucolic, but cute.
- Thanks.

776
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:39,845
How are you, pal? Better get ready
for the show. Get dressed.

777
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,950
- You can see him?
- Of course I can.

778
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:46,417
How are you gonna to miss
a half-naked Indian?

779
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:51,018
- Rip Taylor, Garth Algar.
- Rip, you showed up. Cool.

780
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:54,094
My people
got a call from you. Thank you.

781
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,824
Before I could say no,
this guy came to me in a dream.

782
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,528
I said, "Who are you?" He said,
"Jim Morrison. I'm a dead rock star."

783
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:06,333
I said, "I'm not familiar with
your work." So he played The Doors.

784
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:10,911
I said, "You're like a crooner
in the rock milieu, which I like."

785
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:15,948
- Why is our order taking so long?
- He said, "You gotta do Waynestock."

786
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,348
I figured, what the hey?

787
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,852
- What's going on?
- Don't you know?

788
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:27,121
- We're here for Waynestock.
- Same here. Looking forward to it.

789
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,255
- Where did they come from?
- This is big.

790
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,424
We got to get back to the fields.

791
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:48,740
Have you seen Cassandra?
I know. It's weird.

792
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:51,442
I don't know where she is, either.

793
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:55,181
I know. She said she'd play,
and she never misses a gig.

794
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:58,190
If you see her,
send her over to Waynestock.

795
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,158
Thanks a lot, Chief.
All right, bye-bye.

796
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:06,324
Wayne! Wayne!
Here's what's happening so far.

797
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:10,233
People have started to show up,
but none of the bands are here.

798
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:15,008
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to hurl.

799
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:20,137
Garth, ix-nay on the url-hay.
Think! Where could Cassandra be?

800
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:28,082
I think I had too much Jolt cola.

801
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:33,488
Jeff, Wayne.

802
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:35,527
I cannot find your daughter
and I'm troubled.

803
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:39,793
Alas, my friend, I've chosen
another for my daughter.

804
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:43,836
You are an excellent warrior,
but I require more in a son-in-law.

805
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,337
He has money.

806
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:48,476
Name the one you have chosen!
He will die by my hand.

807
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,509
His name is Bobby.

808
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:54,115
He has offered security,
a career and a green card.

809
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,773
I arranged the match.

810
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:59,478
Though I am sure this will be
useless to you so late in the film,

811
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:03,182
they'll be married at the
First Presbyterian Church.

812
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:06,555
Sorry I could not invite you
to the wedding.

813
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:10,923
It's OK. She's marrying Bobby.

814
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,431
What are you doing?

815
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:20,439
I'm out! I have to find Cassandra
and tell her how I feel.

816
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,772
But I can't do the concert alone.
It takes two.

817
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:28,440
You're right. I'm in.
But I love her! I'm freaking out!

818
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,141
What am I gonna do?

819
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,482
Go get Cassandra.
Del and I will run the concert.

820
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:40,486
Just get Cassandra and be back
before we start. Go, now!

821
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:53,834
Now move it, people! Go! Go! Go!

822
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:58,576
- Hi!
- I'm kind of busy now.

823
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:04,146
I just wanted to know if you needed
anything from the permit office.

824
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,357
That's a Unix book.

825
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,258
- Yeah.
- Cool.

826
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,879
All right, men.
Our work here is done.

827
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,619
Excellent.

828
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:34,301
Where's the First Presbyterian Church
on Gordon Street?

829
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:37,104
- Gordon Street!
- Oh, yeah.

830
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:41,716
I once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street,

831
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:45,842
but that was a long time ago,
when I was young.

832
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:50,481
Do we have to put up with this?
Can't we get a better actor?

833
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:54,356
I know it's a small part,
but we can do better than this.

834
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:04,563
Gordon Street?
Oh, yes, Gordon Street.

835
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,874
I once knew a girl
who lived on Gordon Street.

836
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:11,444
Long time ago,
when I was a young man.

837
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,780
Not a day passes
that I don't think of her,

838
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:21,218
and the promise I made,
which I will always keep.

839
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:24,256
That one perfect day
on Gordon Street.

840
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:28,425
That's, five blocks up, two over.

841
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,358
Thank you.

842
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:04,697
- Welcome to Aurora!
- Eat me!

843
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:10,603
Not just a place,
but a state of mind.

844
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,318
Oh, Jesus. God, no.

845
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,595
Hi. Sorry!

846
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:15,793
Sorry, everybody! Wrong wedding!

847
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,538
Who's he?

848
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,896
Oh, Jesus. God, no.

849
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:53,665
What an asshole!

850
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:12,223
Son of a bitch!

851
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:17,596
- Son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch!

852
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:35,512
You punk. You crazy punk.

853
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:15,117
Stevenson Park! Step on it!

854
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:23,927
- One, one, two, two, two.
- Check two! Check two!

855
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:30,263
OK. We have some word that
there is some bad red rope liquorice

856
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,906
circulating in the crowd.

857
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:37,443
Repeat, stay away
from the red rope liquorice.

858
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:44,916
Do not bite any off and chew it.
It could cause a dental emergency.

859
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:53,951
Excuse me. Excuse me.

860
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,504
- Guys, huh?
- Wayne, Cassandra, you made it!

861
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,501
This is great!

862
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,380
What'll we do?
The bands haven't showed.

863
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,351
Jim Morrison said,
"If you book them, they will come."

864
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,547
It doesn't look too good.

865
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,718
Jim? Jim!

866
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:40,269
- We really are in the desert.
- Yeah, no guff!

867
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:47,137
- Jim Morrison.
- Told you so, man.

868
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:51,479
- How can I help you?
- None of the bands have shown up.

869
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:53,746
I know,
and they're not gonna show up.

870
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,888
Then why were we
supposed to put on a concert?

871
01:24:57,058 --> 01:25:00,391
Because you had to try
and do something with your life.

872
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,359
But it was a failure.

873
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,395
Whether you won or lost,

874
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,831
what's important is that
you gave it your best shot.

875
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:09,401
Sorry, man.

876
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,539
- OK.
- All right.

877
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:15,540
You'll think of something.
It's your movie.

878
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:19,436
Thanks a pantload, Chet.

879
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:25,519
Wayne, where are we?
How do we get back?

880
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,906
We don't want to end the movie
this way, do we?

881
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:54,743
Good call. If we're gonna go down,
let's at least go down in glory.

882
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:57,749
Let's do the
Thelma and louise ending. Yeah!

883
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:16,763
- Let's just keep going, Wayne.
- OK, Garth.

884
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:36,188
We don't want to end
the movie like this.

885
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:39,918
Yeah. Let's do the happy ending.

886
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,400
The bands haven't shown up.
What'll we do?

887
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,936
What are we going to do, you guys?

888
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:12,956
- You made it. Excellent!
- Welcome to Waynestock.

889
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:17,624
All right.

890
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:01,039
Jim, why was I supposed to
put on this concert?

891
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:05,643
Because you had to learn
that it doesn't matter what you do,

892
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,577
Cassandra loves you for who you are.

893
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:13,483
And that being an adult
means facing responsibility,

894
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:16,715
yet still taking the time
to have fun.

895
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:20,383
Right. It's sort of like
coming home on Friday night

896
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:22,461
and doing your homework right away,

897
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:26,191
so your Saturday night
is free to just party.

898
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:28,892
No, I like the way I said it better.

899
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,978
Excuse me.

900
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,451
Would you open the gate, please?
