1
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,718
<i>I will be truthful and mention</i>
<i>that before our rigid search...</i>

2
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:52,692
<i>...I had the opinion Jewish people</i>
<i>were having shit between their brains.</i>

3
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,597
<i>Primarily, this is because all I knew</i>
<i>of Jewish people...</i>

4
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:59,860
<i>...was that they paid Father</i>
<i>very much currency...</i>

5
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:05,099
<i>...in order to make vacations</i>
<i>from America to Ukraine.</i>

6
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:12,074
<i>I was of the opinion</i>
<i>that the past is past...</i>

7
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:17,248
<i>...and like all that is not now,</i>
<i>it should remain buried...</i>

8
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,048
<i>...along the side of our memories.</i>

9
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,657
<i>But this was before the commencement</i>
<i>of our very rigid search.</i>

10
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,760
<i>Before I encountered the collector...</i>

11
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,897
<i>...Jonathan Safran Foer.</i>

12
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,036
Your grandfather wanted you
to have this...

13
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,311
...for your collection.

14
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,348
Who is Augustine?

15
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:47,924
Grandma?

16
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:19,957
Where did you get that hat?

17
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,959
Alex gave it to me.

18
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,197
Take it off.

19
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,830
Why?

20
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,443
Because l told you to, that's why.

21
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:30,874
l think he looks cool.

22
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,537
Who asked you to speak?

23
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,683
Did l ask you to speak?

24
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,010
Did Mama ask you to speak?

25
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,379
Did Grandfather ask you to speak?

26
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:39,780
SHUT UP!

27
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,357
Don't talk to her like that!

28
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,656
Papa, l already have one son
walking around Odessa...

29
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:48,228
...looking like a raving lunatic.

30
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,293
l don't need another.

31
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,365
But Papa....

32
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,204
<i>My legal name is Alexander Perchov,</i>
<i>but all of my friends dub me Alex...</i>

33
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,037
<i>...because this is much more flaccid</i>
<i>to utter.</i>

34
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,442
<i>That is Father retrieving his fist</i>
<i>from the right side of my face.</i>

35
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:09,379
<i>Father is a first-rate puncher.</i>

36
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,149
<i>This is my miniature brother, Igor.</i>

37
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,949
<i>I am tutoring him to be a man</i>
<i>of this world.</i>

38
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:19,185
<i>For an example, I exhibited him</i>
<i>a smutty magazine three days yore.</i>

39
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,756
Why is it called sixty-nine?

40
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,731
<i>I explain it to him that this is</i>
<i>because it was invented in the year 1 969.</i>

41
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,701
<i>I know this because my friend Grisha knows</i>
<i>a friend of the nephew of the inventor.</i>

42
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:33,865
What did people do before 1 969?

43
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,472
<i>He is a genius, my miniature brother.</i>

44
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:43,277
<i>He will be made a VIP</i>
<i>if I have a thing to do with it.</i>

45
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:48,454
<i>This is Grandfather. Like my father</i>
<i>and myself, he too is dubbed Alex.</i>

46
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,917
<i>My grandmother, Anna, died two years</i>
<i>before of a cancer in her brain.</i>

47
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:56,394
<i>Precluding this,</i>
<i>Grandfather became very melancholy...</i>

48
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,591
<i>...and also, he says, blind.</i>

49
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,100
<i>His most recent employment</i>
<i>was Heritage Tours...</i>

50
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,433
<i>...a business he started in 1 950s...</i>

51
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:09,100
<i>...mostly for aiding rich Jewish people</i>
<i>to search for their dead families.</i>

52
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,011
<i>It is a strange employment</i>
<i>for Grandfather...</i>

53
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:17,619
<i>...as there is nothing he hates more than</i>
<i>rich Jewish people or their dead families.</i>

54
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:20,483
<i>This is Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.</i>

55
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,489
<i>She is Grandfather's Seeing Eye bitch.</i>

56
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,561
<i>Father purchased her for him not</i>
<i>because he believes Grandfather is blind...</i>

57
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,597
<i>...but because a Seeing Eye bitch</i>
<i>is also a good thing...</i>

58
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,894
<i>...for people who pine for</i>
<i>the opposite of loneliness.</i>

59
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,997
<i>In truth,</i>
<i>Father did not purchase her at all...</i>

60
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,112
<i>...but merely retrieved her</i>
<i>from the home for forgetful dogs.</i>

61
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,215
<i>Because of this,</i>
<i>she is not a real Seeing Eye bitch...</i>

62
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:50,045
<i>...and is also mentally deranged.</i>

63
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,520
<i>Most of all, she relishes when I sing to her</i>
<i>her most beloved song...</i>

64
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,057
<i>... ""Billie Jean "" by Michael Jackson.</i>

65
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,525
<i>But now I must tell you more of myself.</i>

66
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:08,363
<i>I am unequivocally tall. I do not know</i>
<i>any women who are taller than me.</i>

67
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,529
<i>The women who are taller than me</i>
<i>are lesbians...</i>

68
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,336
<i>...for whom 1 969</i>
<i>was a very momentous year.</i>

69
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,169
<i>For me, America is a first-rate place.</i>

70
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:19,336
KANGOL!!

71
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,678
<i>Most of all, I am beloved</i>
<i>of American movies, muscular cars...</i>

72
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,683
<i>...and hip-hop music.</i>

73
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:30,322
<i>I also dig Negroes.</i>
<i>Most of all, Michael Jackson.</i>

74
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:34,326
<i>He is a first-rate dancer, just like me.</i>

75
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,307
<i>Many girls want to be carnal with me</i>
<i>because I'm such a premium dancer.</i>

76
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:30,614
You're taking a Jew
to Lutsk this weekend.

77
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,016
-l can't, l have plans.
-What plans?

78
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,053
With Grisha at Club Zephyr.

79
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:38,352
Well, now you're taking
a Jew to Lutsk.

80
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,518
But we have VlP passes.

81
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,238
Papa, l need you to drive them.

82
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,738
Go to hell!
l'm not driving anyone.

83
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:57,242
Papa,
they are paying $ 1 200 American.

84
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:02,749
l don't care. l'm retired.
No more dead Jews.

85
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,682
Papa, you drive him to this place...

86
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:09,585
...show him everyone is dead
and you come home.

87
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,020
lt will be so simple.

88
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,924
He's looking for a woman
who saved his grandfather from the Nazis.

89
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,658
Trust me,
there is no one there anymore.

90
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,132
She is from someplace called...

91
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,430
...Trachimbrod.

92
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:26,769
lt's near Lutsk.
They said he has a map.

93
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,803
His name is Jonathan S. Foer.
He is a writer.

94
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:34,575
He wants to write a book
about the place.

95
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,843
Okay, l'll go.

96
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,954
But Sammy goes too.

97
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,148
Papa, please,
you know that is impossible.

98
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,350
She's demented!

99
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:49,127
You listen to me.

100
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,993
l'm supposed to be retired.

101
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,794
l am not supposed to
be dragging rich Jews...

102
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:56,631
...all over the goddamn country.

103
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:59,035
l'm blind. BLlND!
Understand?

104
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,905
My bitch is my eyes.
l'm not going anywhere without her.

105
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:06,206
Papa, l'm not saying
that l don't believe you're blind...

106
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,350
...but the American could have
a problem with this.

107
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:11,645
No bitch, no driver.

108
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:15,483
We could make a uniform for her...

109
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,926
...to make her seem more official.

110
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,359
Are you Jonfen?

111
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,188
What?

112
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,358
Jonfen. Are you Jonfen?

113
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,265
lt's Jonathan.

114
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,863
What?

115
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,175
My name. lt's Jonathan.

116
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:30,538
Jonfen.

117
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:35,583
Are you my translator?

118
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:39,448
Yes, l'm Alexander Perchov.
l'll be your humble translator.

119
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,324
l implore you to forgive my speaking
of English, Jonfen...

120
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,728
...as l'm not so premium with it.

121
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,003
My name is Jonathan.

122
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:17,251
This is our driver.
He is an expert at driving.

123
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,592
-ls he all right?
-What?

124
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,526
l mean, you know, is he healthy?

125
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,896
Of course. He's my grandfather.

126
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:34,501
Please, do not be distressed.
This is only driver's Seeing Eye bitch.

127
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:39,012
Okay, she's deranged, but so, so playful.

128
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,642
Wait, he's blind?

129
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:44,942
No, only he thinks this.
Please, do not be distressed.

130
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,346
Grandfather!

131
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,423
Grandfather, l've got Jonfen.
We should go to Lutsk.

132
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:55,952
Yes?

133
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:58,522
Are you sure he's okay?

134
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,361
-Grandfather!
-Shut up!

135
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:03,060
l'm blind, not deaf.
l heard you the first time!

136
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,206
What does he say?

137
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:08,038
He says, ''Okey-dokey, we will go now.''

138
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:11,569
-Where will the dog be?
-What do you mean?

139
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,306
l have a phobia.

140
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,219
A fear.

141
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,020
l'm distressed by dogs.

142
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:25,621
He is afraid of dogs.

143
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,762
Bullshit,
no one is afraid of dogs.

144
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,731
Grandfather informs me
this is not possible.

145
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,924
What?

146
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,932
Get in the car.

147
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,435
The bitch and the Jew
will share the back seat.

148
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,096
lt is big enough for both of them.

149
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,072
No, wait. Wait.
You don't understand.

150
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:46,078
l have a very serious, serious problem
with dogs.

151
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,682
l can't sit in there. You--

152
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,070
Were you able to manufacture the:

153
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,007
-What?
-The Z's.

154
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,941
Were you able to make the:

155
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,081
-l don't understand.
-Repose.

156
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,577
Did you repose?

157
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:00,983
Yeah, l reposed.

158
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:05,786
Good. Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.
is also in repose.

159
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,662
-Why do you call her that?
-What?

160
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,800
Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.

161
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:17,769
Because Sammy Davis Jr.
was Grandfather's most beloved singer.

162
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:20,737
You know, The Candy Man.
The Negro from the Rat Pack.

163
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,604
-And a Jew.
-What?

164
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:25,211
Yeah, he was a Jew.
You didn't know that?

165
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,544
Grandfather, the Jew says that
Sammy Davis Jr. is Jewish.

166
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,116
The bitch?

167
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,480
Not Jr. Jr., Jr. the singer.

168
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,679
That's bullshit!

169
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:39,117
Grandfather informs me
that this is not possible.

170
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:43,594
Of course it is. He converted. He's the most
famous black Jew in America.

171
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,530
-Please tell me, is the Shaq also the Jew?
-Who?

172
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:50,899
-Shaquille O'Neal, the Los Angeles Laker.
-No.

173
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,473
-And Michael Jackson?
-No, definitely not a Jew.

174
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:40,113
Father informs me you are writing a book
about this trip. You are a writer?

175
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,949
No.

176
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:44,719
Then what is this?

177
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:46,926
lt's a catalog.

178
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,119
Catalog.

179
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,266
Catalog.

180
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:55,160
l don't know why they told you that.

181
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,662
l'm not a writer.

182
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,002
l mean, l write, but l'm more of...

183
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,277
...a collector, really.

184
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,707
And what do you collect?

185
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,147
Things.

186
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,511
Family things.

187
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:15,951
lt is a good career, yes?

188
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,622
No, it's not a career.
lt's just something l do.

189
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,119
Why?

190
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:26,964
l don't know. Why does anybody
do anything? lt's just something to do.

191
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,128
l understand.

192
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,670
l also enjoy writing...

193
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:39,509
...but l truly feel l was born
to be accountant.

194
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,194
Are we close?

195
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,101
The Jew wants to know
if we are close.

196
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:09,004
Tell him to shut the hell up!

197
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:12,178
Grandfather says we're very proximal.

198
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:15,578
He says it will not be long
until we get to the superway to Lutsk.

199
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,910
And from there?

200
00:27:17,085 --> 00:27:18,450
How long from here to Lutsk?

201
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,521
Perhaps you would like me
to stop the car...

202
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,181
...and you two can
fuck yourselves to Lutsk!

203
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,553
What did he say?

204
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,686
Grandfather says you should look out
the window at the premium countryside.

205
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,048
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

206
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,557
-l just hope they have something l can eat.
-What do you mean?

207
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,320
l'm a vegetarian.

208
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,325
You're a what?

209
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:04,863
l don't eat meat.

210
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,225
How can you not eat meat?

211
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,530
l just don't.

212
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:14,932
He says he does not eat meat.

213
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,202
What?

214
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:20,580
-No meat?
-No meat.

215
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,239
-Steak?
-No.

216
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,441
-Chickens?
-No.

217
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,851
And what about the sausage?

218
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:29,122
No, no sausage. No meat.

219
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,255
He says he does not eat any meat.

220
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,957
Not even sausage?

221
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,289
l know.

222
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,522
What is wrong with him?

223
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,593
What is wrong with you?

224
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,801
Nothing. l just don't eat meat.

225
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:52,210
Hello.

226
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:57,714
Excuse me,
do you have anything without meat?

227
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:58,944
Why?

228
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,554
Our friend here is American--

229
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:03,088
l can see that.

230
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:06,284
Yes, of course,
but he does not eat meat.

231
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:08,489
What is wrong with him?

232
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,960
What did she say?

233
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,959
She says they do not have anything
without meat.

234
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:17,364
Don't they have potatoes or something?

235
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,729
Potatoes?

236
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,637
You only get
potato with the meat.

237
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,210
The potatoes come only with the meat.

238
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,408
But can't l have a potato
on a plate by itself?

239
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:33,510
Please, this American is deranged.

240
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,815
Would it be possible to have
a potato without the meat?

241
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,428
Welcome to Ukraine.

242
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:54,050
-And these are your family?
-Yeah.

243
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,327
My grandmother gave me this.

244
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:02,933
That's my grandfather, Safran.
lt was taken during the war.

245
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,829
lt's you.

246
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,497
l've heard that.

247
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,303
-And this is Augustine?
-Yeah.

248
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:15,110
My mother said that he never would have
made it to America if it weren't for her.

249
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:16,908
And she's from Trachimbrod?

250
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,985
Or somewhere near there.

251
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,788
This is Kolki. My grandmother's shtetl.

252
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,082
''Shtetl''?

253
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:24,451
lt's a village.

254
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:28,562
lt's Yiddish, it means ''village.''
lt doesn't seem to be far from Trachimbrod.

255
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,188
That's why l was thinking
it might be called Sofiewka now.

256
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,698
Why do you make such a rigid search?

257
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:44,403
l guess l just wanted to see
where my grandfather grew up...

258
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,514
...where l would be now
if he hadn't come to America.

259
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:50,913
You would be Ukrainian, like me.

260
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:55,044
Only not like me, because you would be
a farmer from some unimpressive town...

261
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:59,224
-...and l am from Odessa.
-l see.

262
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,088
And did your grandparents ever return
to Ukraine?

263
00:33:03,264 --> 00:33:06,700
God, no. My grandmother would go crazy
if she knew l was here.

264
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,335
Why?

265
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:10,035
She didn't think it was safe.

266
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:14,038
She said that before the war,
Ukraine was just as bad as Berlin.

267
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,336
Jews weren't exactly popular in Ukraine.

268
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:20,948
When the Nazis invaded, she actually
thought it would be an improvement.

269
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,043
Who told you this?

270
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,485
My grandmother.

271
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,821
Why did she say this?

272
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:33,084
l don't know. lt's just how she felt.

273
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,523
Grandfather...

274
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,257
...he says Ukrainians were
anti-Semitic before the war.

275
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,233
ls it true?

276
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:47,602
Grandfather?

277
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,191
lt's nice.

278
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:09,455
Really, it's just for sleeping.

279
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,703
-Jonfen?
-Yeah.

280
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,608
You were very proximal
with your grandfather, yes?

281
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,248
Yeah. Why?

282
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:36,113
Tomorrow we will make a search.

283
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:37,821
Good night.

284
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,254
Good night.

285
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,030
Make sure to secure the door
when l am gone.

286
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:50,432
l do not want
to make you petrified person...

287
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:54,302
...but there are many dangerous people
who want to take things from Americans...

288
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,000
...and also kidnap them. Okay?

289
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:58,934
Okay.

290
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:00,375
Good night.

291
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,352
Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.

292
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:14,492
Come on, let's go.

293
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,876
He seems like a good person.

294
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,479
Yes, he does.

295
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:16,817
We should try to help him.

296
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:18,552
How?

297
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:23,861
We should try to find her.

298
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:25,558
Who?

299
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:28,866
Augustine.

300
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:27,515
-What is it?
-Soviets.

301
00:38:28,488 --> 00:38:30,115
What happened?

302
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:33,516
lndependence.

303
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:51,905
Look.

304
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:09,822
We are looking for Trachimbrod.

305
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,729
Do you know it?

306
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:13,833
You heard of Trachimbrod?

307
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,203
Never heard of it!

308
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:18,702
Come here, please!

309
00:39:18,872 --> 00:39:20,032
Come here!

310
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:27,245
lt's a small village...

311
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:28,745
...Trachimbrod.

312
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:32,613
Mention the other names to him.
Perhaps one will sound informal.

313
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:35,584
Kovel', Kivertsy, Sokirentsy.

314
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,587
Maybe Kolki?

315
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,281
Yes, yes.

316
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,256
Could you direct us to them?

317
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:43,692
Of course.
They are not so far.

318
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:45,627
Go north on the superway.

319
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,792
Keep going north...

320
00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:50,630
...until you see wheat fields...

321
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:55,701
...then head east
through the farmlands.

322
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,207
Thank you.

323
00:39:57,577 --> 00:39:59,545
Here. Thank you.

324
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,613
-What is he doing?
-What is he doing?

325
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:05,718
-What are you doing?
-For helping us.

326
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:07,478
-What?
-l read in my guidebook...

327
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:09,781
...you can't find
Marlboro cigarettes here...

328
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:12,152
...so you should take them everywhere
as tips.

329
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,123
He doesn't eat meat.

330
00:40:17,464 --> 00:40:18,897
Thank you.

331
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:27,633
What is ''tips''?

332
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:31,642
Tips are something you give someone
in exchange for help.

333
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:35,077
You are informed you will be paying
for this trip with currency, yes?

334
00:40:35,248 --> 00:40:39,582
No, not like that. Tips are for small things,
like directions or the valet.

335
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:42,313
-Valet?
-You know, the guy who parks your car.

336
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,855
Why do you not park your own car?

337
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:09,543
How much currency would
a first-rate accountant receive in America?

338
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,942
l don't know.
A lot, probably, if he or she is good.

339
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:15,383
She?

340
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:16,715
Or he.

341
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:19,553
Are there Negro accountants?

342
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:24,195
Yes, there are African-American
accountants...

343
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:28,130
-...but you don't want to use that word.
-And homosexual accountants?

344
00:41:28,502 --> 00:41:31,869
There are homosexual everythings.
There are homosexual garbage men.

345
00:41:34,674 --> 00:41:38,201
And how much currency would
Negro homosexual accountant receive?

346
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:39,902
You shouldn't use that word.

347
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,741
-Which word?
-The N-word.

348
00:41:41,915 --> 00:41:44,850
-lt's not the N-word, but--
-Negro?

349
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:46,819
Yeah, that one.

350
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:49,683
But l dig them all the way.
They are premium people.

351
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,223
lt's that word, though.
You're not supposed to use that word.

352
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:56,022
What is wrong with the Negroes?

353
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,505
-Are you carnal very often?
-What?

354
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:11,701
With American girls, you make sex often?

355
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:14,210
Not really. Do you?

356
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:18,512
l inquired headmost. Do you?

357
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,118
Not really.

358
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:23,685
What do you intend by ''not really''?

359
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:28,091
l'm not a priest,
but l'm not John Holmes, either.

360
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:31,424
l've heard of this John Holmes.
With a premium penis.

361
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:34,097
Yeah, that's the one.

362
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:36,895
ln the Ukraine,
everybody has a penis like that.

363
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,463
What about the women?

364
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,732
You make a joke, no?

365
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,770
Yeah.

366
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,555
Come, Zlata, come.

367
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:30,623
Do you have any chewing gum?

368
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:45,437
Do you know where Trachimbrod is?

369
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,830
What's in Trachimbrod?

370
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:50,203
Nothing, it's just a place
we are trying to find.

371
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:54,042
lf there's nothing there,
why are you trying to find it?

372
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:57,545
Why do you ask stupid questions?

373
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,744
Where are we?

374
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:03,576
l don't know.

375
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:06,843
Ask the Jew.

376
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:10,379
-Where are we?
-l'm not sure.

377
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:12,024
He doesn't know.

378
00:45:12,192 --> 00:45:15,457
What do you mean, he doesn't know?
We're driving! How can he not know!

379
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:19,365
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-None of the roads have names.

380
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:21,523
l thought you were a certified guide.

381
00:45:21,735 --> 00:45:23,600
Grandfather is certified.

382
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:26,871
-Please, you're making this impossible.
-Shut up!

383
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,031
This is pointless!
We don't know where we are.

384
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:31,268
''Shut up'' means shut up!

385
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:33,071
Grandfather, we should stop.

386
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,208
What are you doing?

387
00:45:38,918 --> 00:45:41,682
Maybe we should stop and ask someone.

388
00:45:57,737 --> 00:45:59,671
Go and ask them.

389
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,734
Leave the Jew here.

390
00:46:03,843 --> 00:46:05,674
l'm not a moron, you know.

391
00:46:08,448 --> 00:46:10,177
l know what that word means.

392
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,681
What word?

393
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,350
lt's Russian for ''Jew,'' isn't it?

394
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:32,532
Wait! l'm coming too.

395
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:38,643
-What are you doing?
-l'm coming with you.

396
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:42,606
-You should not do this.
-Why not? l can help.

397
00:46:42,782 --> 00:46:45,307
You cannot help. You cannot even speak.

398
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:47,885
lt is bad enough that l am from Odessa.

399
00:46:48,355 --> 00:46:50,823
l won't speak.
l promise, l won't say a word.

400
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:17,248
Excuse me, could you tell me,
do you know where Trachimbrod is?

401
00:47:17,684 --> 00:47:19,015
Never heard of it.

402
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,917
Thank you.

403
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:24,721
Wait! What are you doing?

404
00:47:24,891 --> 00:47:26,552
They do not know.

405
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,991
What about Sofiewka?
Did you ask them about Sofiewka?

406
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:53,750
l'm sorry, l forgot,
it's also called Sofiewka.

407
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,048
What do you want?
l told you l never heard of it!

408
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:58,923
What's your problem, huh?

409
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,451
Maybe you've seen this woman?

410
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,061
What are you doing?

411
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:06,258
We are trying to find
the town of Trachimbrod.

412
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,765
l told you, we don't know.

413
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,400
Do you want a Marlboro cigarette?

414
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,367
Get lost! Go back to Kiev!

415
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:19,876
l'm not from Kiev,
l'm from Odessa.

416
00:48:20,046 --> 00:48:22,105
Then go back to Odessa!

417
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,919
-What did they say?
-Nothing.

418
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,318
They said nothing.

419
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:36,087
Hey, Odessa! You forgot your dog!

420
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:42,491
Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., come here!

421
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,540
Hey! Don't do that!

422
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,150
Why were you speaking English?

423
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:02,015
l commanded you not to speak!
You understanded me, yes?

424
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:03,621
-Yes.
-Then why did you speak?

425
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,519
-l don't know.
-Now they all think...

426
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,626
...l'm stupid American tourist, like you!

427
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:09,694
-l'm sorry.
-Why do you not listen?

428
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,694
This is not your country!

429
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,156
You little piece of shit!

430
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:17,200
Don't you put your
filthy hands on her!

431
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,930
lf you ever hit her again...

432
00:49:20,106 --> 00:49:23,166
...l swear to God,
l'll cut your hands off!

433
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:25,837
Do you understand,
you piece of shit?

434
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,817
Grandfather?

435
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,153
Grandfather?

436
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,221
What are you doing?

437
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:11,553
We're out of gas.

438
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,990
Jonfen?

439
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:50,362
Yeah?

440
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:52,935
Do you think my grandfather is...?

441
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:55,034
What?

442
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:58,270
Distressed?

443
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:03,748
What do you mean?

444
00:55:06,285 --> 00:55:09,118
What do you mean, what do l mean?
l do not mean anything.

445
00:55:12,158 --> 00:55:15,491
lf l meant to say something else,
l would say something else.

446
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:26,532
Something is not right.

447
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,740
lt is as if he's dreaming all of the time...

448
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,710
...even when he is not in repose.

449
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:45,150
Why don't you ask him.

450
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:49,691
No. That is impossible.

451
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:35,918
You found gas?

452
00:58:46,605 --> 00:58:49,768
Alex, get up, it's time to go.

453
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,676
What time is it?

454
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:04,046
He found gas.

455
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:40,118
lt's beautiful.

456
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:47,895
Tell him this is the most fertile
land in Eastern Europe.

457
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,731
Grandfather wishes me to tell you...

458
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:54,270
...that this is the most premium land
for farming.

459
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,432
lt's so green.

460
00:59:56,775 --> 01:00:01,576
Before the war, this was
the most beautiful place in the world.

461
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,241
You were here before the war?

462
01:00:10,422 --> 01:00:12,356
Tell him about Odessa.

463
01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:21,631
Tell him that the sand on the beaches
is more soft than a woman's hair...

464
01:00:23,302 --> 01:00:27,671
...and that Odessa is the perfect place...

465
01:00:28,607 --> 01:00:32,600
...to fall in love and start a family.

466
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:10,005
There.

467
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:15,684
Ask there.

468
01:02:41,273 --> 01:02:42,968
l'm sorry to bother you.

469
01:02:43,442 --> 01:02:46,343
How could anything bother me
on such a day?

470
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,819
Where are you from?

471
01:02:57,823 --> 01:02:58,949
Odessa.

472
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:01,418
l have never been to Odessa.

473
01:03:01,593 --> 01:03:03,424
You should go there.

474
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:09,463
Have you ever heard of a town
called Trachimbrod?

475
01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:15,604
l was told that
l should ask here.

476
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,376
Please, l don't want to trouble you...

477
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,843
...but have you heard of Trachimbrod?

478
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,780
l am sorry l bothered you.

479
01:03:50,843 --> 01:03:53,641
Have you ever seen

01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:31,680
We are searching for Trachimbrod.

484
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:35,750
You are here.

Are you hungry?

495
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,130
l can cook you something.

496
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:31,268
Please don't make any effort.

497
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:35,310
lt is nothing, but l must tell you...

498
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:37,073
...l don't have any meat.

499
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:40,615
What?

500
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,014
Thank you, but we are not hungry.

501
01:05:44,022 --> 01:05:46,855
lt has been so long since
l have had any visitors.

502
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:48,592
Do you live alone here?

503
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:52,453
You have someone?

504
01:05:54,266 --> 01:05:55,995
l have all of them.

505
01:05:57,769 --> 01:05:58,861
What did she say?

506
01:05:59,037 --> 01:06:00,868
l'm not so sure.

507
01:06:01,173 --> 01:06:02,265
What are they?

508
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:05,299
They are Trachimbrod.

509
01:06:06,345 --> 01:06:08,279
She says they are Trachimbrod.

510
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:44,738
ln Case

511
01:06:45,017 --> 01:06:48,646
This is my sister's wedding ring.

512
01:06:49,388 --> 01:06:50,855
'Tis a wedding ring.

513
01:06:51,023 --> 01:06:54,186
She hid it in a jar
and put it in the ground.

514
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:56,657
l knew this
because she told me.

515
01:06:56,828 --> 01:06:58,819
Many people did this.

516
01:06:58,997 --> 01:07:01,898
The ground by the river is still
filled with precious things:

517
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:05,036
Rings, money, pictures,
Jewish things.

518
01:07:05,671 --> 01:07:08,765
l was only able to find a few of them...

519
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:11,539
...but they fill the earth.

520
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:14,071
She's also a collector.

521
01:07:15,414 --> 01:07:17,177
Does she remember my grandfather?

522
01:07:17,749 --> 01:07:19,216
Do you remember his grandfather?

523
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:21,944
Who is his grandfather?

524
01:07:24,423 --> 01:07:26,618
The man in the photo.

525
01:07:27,392 --> 01:07:28,620
Safran.

526
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:30,419
Yes.

527
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:55,911
Safran.

528
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,785
My family, they....

529
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:05,990
ln case l....

530
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,234
My family wanted you to have this.

531
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:15,569
For everything that you did.

532
01:08:19,478 --> 01:08:20,968
What is this?

533
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:24,013
Money.
For what you have done for them.

534
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:25,911
What have l done for them?

535
01:08:26,084 --> 01:08:27,483
Safran was his grandfather.

536
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:29,986
No.

537
01:08:30,155 --> 01:08:32,419
He means Augustine.

538
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,542
That is Augustine, that is Mama,
that is me.

539
01:08:54,346 --> 01:08:57,440
This is Safran, Augustine and me.

540
01:08:57,849 --> 01:09:01,808
Mama was so fond of Safran,
he was so polite.

541
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:04,386
He would tell her she was pretty...

542
01:09:04,556 --> 01:09:07,320
...when in truth
she was not so pretty.

543
01:09:08,026 --> 01:09:12,793
l was older, so Mama thought
he should marry me instead.

544
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:15,196
But he was in love.

545
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:18,700
She says your grandfather
was in love with Augustine.

546
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:21,862
They were married on her name day.

547
01:09:23,408 --> 01:09:25,968
When we were kids,
my sister, Safran and l...

548
01:09:26,144 --> 01:09:29,580
...played kissing games
behind the trees.

549
01:09:30,682 --> 01:09:33,651
l can still remember
how l felt.

550
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:36,046
lt was a little like flying.

551
01:09:36,722 --> 01:09:38,383
Tell him.

552
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:41,552
She remembers kissing
your grandfather...

553
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,060
...and she flew a little.

554
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:47,489
What is your name?

555
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,677
This is Baruch...

556
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,218
...in front of the library.

557
01:10:08,019 --> 01:10:10,510
He used to sit there
all day long.

558
01:10:10,756 --> 01:10:13,748
He took out more books
than anyone in the shtetl...

559
01:10:14,226 --> 01:10:15,625
...and he could not even read!

560
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:19,563
He said
he liked to think about the books...

561
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:21,892
...think about them
without reading them.

562
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,960
He would always walk around
with a book under his arm.

563
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:27,932
''Nonsense!''
Mama would say.

564
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:32,972
They said he was insane.

565
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:37,537
We had this in common.

566
01:10:38,884 --> 01:10:40,317
Leave us.

567
01:10:45,423 --> 01:10:47,414
Leave us alone.

568
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:23,484
Jonfen, what you said at the hotel
about Ukrainians before the war....

569
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:24,987
Yeah?

570
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:30,457
Do you think it's possible
that my grandfather, he....

571
01:11:54,793 --> 01:11:56,624
Your shirt's inside out.

572
01:11:56,795 --> 01:11:57,989
What?

573
01:11:59,664 --> 01:12:01,222
Your shirt, it's inside out.

574
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:05,166
What does it mean, ''inside out''?

575
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:08,634
Nothing, it's just that the inside
of your shirt is on the outside...

576
01:12:08,807 --> 01:12:10,900
...and the outside is on....

577
01:12:14,379 --> 01:12:15,846
Forget it.

578
01:13:07,933 --> 01:13:09,764
Why do you do this?

579
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:15,137
Maybe sometimes l'm afraid l'll forget.

580
01:13:28,586 --> 01:13:32,454
Jonfen, l want you to know,
my grandfather...

581
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:36,488
...he's a good person.

582
01:13:50,075 --> 01:13:51,599
We're going.

583
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:55,237
We're going to Trachimbrod.

584
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:58,407
To the river.

585
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,683
She's agreed to take us there.

586
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:18,125
What's the matter?

587
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:22,804
l have never been in one of those.

588
01:14:23,575 --> 01:14:25,941
She's never been in a car before.

589
01:14:26,878 --> 01:14:29,938
Well, tell her they're safe now.
She shouldn't be scared.

590
01:14:31,449 --> 01:14:34,885
Please, don't be scared.
Cars are totally safe now.

591
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:37,521
They even have air bags,
crumple zones.

592
01:14:38,623 --> 01:14:40,488
Maybe not this one...

593
01:14:40,658 --> 01:14:42,353
...but most!

594
01:14:47,799 --> 01:14:48,959
Sammy, sit.

595
01:14:51,703 --> 01:14:54,866
Please, you have nothing to fear.

596
01:14:58,109 --> 01:14:59,542
l cannot.

597
01:16:05,877 --> 01:16:07,401
This is it.

598
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:09,677
What is this?

599
01:16:10,548 --> 01:16:12,573
This is Trachimbrod.

600
01:16:14,252 --> 01:16:15,879
We are here.

601
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:39,475
This monument stands in memory
of the 1 024 Trachimbroders...

602
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:46,282
...killed at the hands of German fascism
on March 1 8, 1 942.

603
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:57,255
This is all that is left.
They destroyed everything.

604
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:02,598
Only a few were able to get out
before they came.

605
01:17:04,068 --> 01:17:06,298
You were lucky to survive.

606
01:17:13,578 --> 01:17:15,944
They put us in lines.

607
01:17:16,314 --> 01:17:18,145
Made lists.

608
01:17:18,816 --> 01:17:21,080
lt was all very logical.

609
01:17:21,786 --> 01:17:23,219
They burned the synagogue.

610
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:24,377
What is she saying?

611
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,023
That was the first thing they did.

612
01:17:26,191 --> 01:17:27,488
They burned the synagogue.

613
01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:31,151
Then they unrolled a Torah on the ground
and told the men to spit on it.

614
01:17:31,329 --> 01:17:35,026
They unrolled something on the ground
and told them to spit on it.

615
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:40,797
My father would make us kiss
any book that touched the ground.

616
01:17:41,973 --> 01:17:47,468
Cooking books. Books for children,
plays, even journals...

617
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:50,312
...and this was our Torah...

618
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:51,675
lt was their Torah.

619
01:17:51,849 --> 01:17:54,044
...that had been in our synagogue...

620
01:17:54,219 --> 01:17:59,020
...since the first rabbi brought it here
300 years before.

621
01:18:01,326 --> 01:18:04,124
First was Yosef.

622
01:18:04,295 --> 01:18:05,819
First man was Yosef.

623
01:18:07,031 --> 01:18:09,158
He was a shoemaker.

624
01:18:10,702 --> 01:18:14,365
They held a gun to his daughter's head...

625
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:16,439
...and commanded him to spit.

626
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:19,540
And told him to spit on the Torah.

627
01:18:20,011 --> 01:18:22,980
He spit. They all spit.

628
01:18:23,147 --> 01:18:27,550
And tore and kicked and whatever else
they were told to do.

629
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,210
Except...

630
01:18:31,723 --> 01:18:33,418
...my father.

631
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,023
They all spit.

632
01:18:37,929 --> 01:18:39,760
Except her father.

633
01:18:41,599 --> 01:18:43,032
And then...

634
01:18:45,069 --> 01:18:46,832
...my sister.

635
01:18:47,005 --> 01:18:48,233
Augustine.

636
01:18:48,406 --> 01:18:50,533
She was pregnant.

637
01:18:52,243 --> 01:18:53,767
She was pregnant.

638
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:59,610
They put the gun
to her pregnant belly.

639
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:05,522
They said they would kill the baby
inside her if my father did not spit.

640
01:19:06,858 --> 01:19:08,587
He could not.

641
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:12,753
He would not spit.

642
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:16,525
Her father would not spit.

643
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:21,797
He did not spit.

644
01:25:28,072 --> 01:25:29,767
l made one for you.

645
01:25:37,648 --> 01:25:39,741
They're from the riverbank.

646
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,785
The Brod.

647
01:25:56,834 --> 01:25:58,529
Trachimbrod.

648
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:19,114
And where was his grandfather?

649
01:26:20,191 --> 01:26:23,786
Safran was gone before they came.

650
01:26:24,161 --> 01:26:26,220
He was gone before they came.

651
01:26:26,397 --> 01:26:27,728
Where?

652
01:26:27,965 --> 01:26:29,990
He left for America...

653
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:33,625
...to find a home for
Augustine and the baby...

654
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:37,969
...one week before they came.

655
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:43,279
He went to America to find a place
for them, and she was killed a week later.

656
01:26:47,184 --> 01:26:49,982
Please tell her there's something
l want to give her.

657
01:26:54,325 --> 01:26:56,259
l think it was her sister's.

658
01:27:02,266 --> 01:27:03,961
Yes, it was.

659
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:10,873
One moment, please.

660
01:27:25,523 --> 01:27:26,820
For you.

661
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:28,781
l can't.

662
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:31,353
He says he cannot.

663
01:27:31,529 --> 01:27:33,429
But he must...

664
01:27:33,597 --> 01:27:35,827
...he is a collector.

665
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,128
She says you must take it.
You're the collector.

666
01:27:42,773 --> 01:27:44,240
ln Case

667
01:27:49,613 --> 01:27:53,606
l didn't understand why my sister
hid her wedding ring in a jar...

668
01:27:53,784 --> 01:27:56,878
...and why she said to me,
''ln case.''

669
01:27:57,054 --> 01:27:58,988
ln case what?

670
01:27:59,623 --> 01:28:01,147
ln case she was killed.

671
01:28:01,325 --> 01:28:04,089
Yes, and then what?
Why did she bury it?

672
01:28:04,261 --> 01:28:05,285
l do not know.

673
01:28:06,163 --> 01:28:07,790
Ask him.

674
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:11,567
She wants to know why Augustine
buried her wedding ring...

675
01:28:11,735 --> 01:28:13,965
...when she thought she would be killed.

676
01:28:16,073 --> 01:28:18,940
So there'd be proof that she existed?

677
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:20,534
To remember her.

678
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:23,578
No. l don't think so.

679
01:28:23,981 --> 01:28:25,573
ln case....

680
01:28:26,417 --> 01:28:30,012
ln case someone should
come searching one day.

681
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:32,182
So they would have
something to find.

682
01:28:33,257 --> 01:28:36,351
No, it does not exist for you.

683
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:39,786
You exist for it.

684
01:28:39,964 --> 01:28:42,398
You have come because it exists.

685
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,669
She says the ring
is not here because of us.

686
01:28:46,003 --> 01:28:48,403
We are here because of the ring.

687
01:29:03,787 --> 01:29:05,652
Alex, tell her....

688
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:13,691
Thank you.

689
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,346
May l ask you a question?

690
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:35,017
Yes, of course.

691
01:29:36,253 --> 01:29:38,448
ls the war over?

692
01:29:50,334 --> 01:29:51,494
Yes.

693
01:29:52,903 --> 01:29:54,495
lt is over.

694
01:33:05,195 --> 01:33:06,526
Grandfather?

695
01:34:50,434 --> 01:34:53,631
Look, there's something
l want you to have.

696
01:35:02,946 --> 01:35:04,971
lt was my grandfather's.

697
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,150
lt was nice knowing you, Sammy.

698
01:36:14,217 --> 01:36:15,775
Jonathan!

699
01:36:38,308 --> 01:36:42,039
<i>I have reflected many times</i>
<i>upon our rigid search.</i>

700
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,177
<i>It has shown me...</i>

701
01:36:45,515 --> 01:36:50,179
<i>...that everything is illuminated</i>
<i>in the light of the past.</i>

702
01:36:51,054 --> 01:36:53,921
<i>It is always along the side of us...</i>

703
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:58,687
<i>...on the inside, looking out.</i>

704
01:36:59,463 --> 01:37:02,728
<i>Like you say, inside out.</i>

705
01:37:09,706 --> 01:37:15,042
<i>Jonfen, in this way, I will always be</i>
<i>along the side of your life.</i>

706
01:37:16,246 --> 01:37:19,704
<i>And you will always be along</i>
<i>the side of mine.</i>

707
01:37:22,018 --> 01:37:26,045
<i>Our families will be with us,</i>
<i>and our families' families.</i>

708
01:37:26,723 --> 01:37:28,714
<i>Your grandfather.</i>

709
01:37:29,059 --> 01:37:34,656
<i>And perhaps, in some way,</i>
<i>my grandfather as well.</i>

710
01:37:43,073 --> 01:37:47,806
<i>It is possible I will never know why</i>
<i>Grandfather did this to himself.</i>

711
01:37:51,481 --> 01:37:54,416
<i>Perhaps he wished to bury his life...</i>

712
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:57,379
<i>...along the side of his past.</i>

713
01:37:59,055 --> 01:38:01,250
<i>But I must tell you, Jonfen...</i>

714
01:38:01,425 --> 01:38:06,328
<i>...in this moment, he seemed,</i>
<i>as if for the first time in his life...</i>

715
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:10,099
<i>...contented to be where he was.</i>

716
01:38:16,273 --> 01:38:19,436
<i>Jonfen, I am sending you this...</i>

717
01:38:19,976 --> 01:38:23,275
<i>...because we have shared something</i>
<i>to exist for.</i>

718
01:38:24,114 --> 01:38:28,608
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>in case anyone comes searching.</i>
