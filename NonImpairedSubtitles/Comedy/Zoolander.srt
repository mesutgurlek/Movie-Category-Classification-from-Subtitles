1
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,002
Here in Malaysia, there is an almost
overwhelming sense of euphoria...

2
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,006
as the newly-elected prime minister
has given this nation hope...

3
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,010
promising to raise
the substandard minimum wage...

4
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,013
and end child labor
once and for all...

5
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:55,931
Already considered a living saint...

6
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,017
he has become this small country's
greatest hope...

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,936
for a thriving future
in the new millennium...

8
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,897
for a thriving future
in the new millennium...

9
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,899
Get closer, Jaco.

10
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,986
This is disgusting.
How could you let this happen?

11
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,990
I have negotiated
my butt off, Giorgio.

12
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,994
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts.
I even sent him some pet oxen.

13
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,997
I mean, they love that crap
in Malaysia.

14
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,915
But he won't budge.

15
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,002
Listen, 50 percent of my inventory
is manufactured...

16
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,920
in sweatshops
on the Malaysian border.

17
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,922
Something has got to be done.

18
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,009
If Malaysia goes, what is next?

19
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,012
My entire panty line
is made in Vietnam.

20
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:35,929
We'll all go bankrupt
within a year.

21
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,016
The Malaysian must be
eliminated, Mugatu.

22
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,021
What? No, I don't
have time for this.

23
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,024
Perhaps you'd rather go back
to turning out novelty neckties.

24
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,986
But my new fall line is almost due.

25
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,989
And I trust you would like to live
to see your spring line as well?

26
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,993
The Malaysian prime minister
visits New York in 14 days.

27
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:00,913
Do it then.

28
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,999
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week.
It's impossible! I have a show!

29
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,002
It's perfect. Invite him
to be your guest of honor.

30
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,005
That's not enough time.
It takes months to train an operative.

31
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,009
What about Fabio?

32
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,928
Too smart.
This is a rush job.

33
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,014
He's got to be extremely
dim-witted.

34
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,017
- You know the profile,Jacobim.
- A beautiful, self-absorbed...

35
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:26,021
simpleton who can be manipulated
and molded like Jell-O.

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,898
Or cookie dough.

37
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,984
- Or Play-Doh.
- Any kind of dough.

38
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,987
The point is,
we need an empty vessel...

39
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,990
a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.

40
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,994
And when he's finished,
we'll dispose of him.

41
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,912
But who?

42
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,914
I mean, where in all of God's
green goodness...

43
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,000
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

44
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,920
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

45
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,006
Derek, I just have a few more
questions, if that's okay.

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,925
Cool.

47
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,927
So when did you know
you wanted to be a model?

48
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,013
It would have to be the first time
I went through the second grade.

49
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,017
I caught my reflection in a spoon
while I was eating my cereal...

50
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,896
and I remember thinking,
"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking.

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,898
Maybe you could do that
for a career"

52
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:10,899
Do what?

53
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,986
- Be professionally good-looking.
- Right.

54
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,989
What would you say your
trademark is, if you have one?

55
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,992
Well, I guess the look
I'm best known for is Blue Steel.

56
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,995
What's that look like?

57
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,000
That's impressive.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,918
And then there's Ferrari
and Le Tigre.

59
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,005
Le Tigre's a lot softer.
It's a bit more of a catalog look.

60
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,009
- I use it for footwear sometimes.
- Can I see that?

61
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,023
Look, without Derek Zoolander, male
modeling wouldn't be what it is.

62
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,901
He is a fashion icon.

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,903
So, do you spend a lot of time
working on these looks...

64
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,905
thinking about them?

65
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,991
Sure. I've been working on Magnum
for at least eight or nine years.

66
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,995
Magnum? That's intriguing.
Can I see that?

67
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,998
Are you kidding? I shouldn't
even be talking about it.

68
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,918
It's nowhere near ready.

69
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,004
It's almost like
there's a light around him...

70
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,923
He exudes beauty.

71
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,925
I think about Derek
every time I design a collection.

72
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,011
You may be familiar with the belief
that some aboriginal tribes hold.

73
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,015
It's the concept that a photo
might steal a part of your soul.

74
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,934
What are your thoughts on that...

75
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,020
as someone who gets his picture
taken for a living?

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,023
That Blue Steel look he does...
Oh, my Gosh, the style and the hair...

77
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,986
It's almost like the new afro for
the white man, but it's beautiful.

78
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,990
Well, I guess I would have to answer
your question with another question.

79
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,994
How many "abo-digitals"
do you see modeling?

80
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,998
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
fashion industry's biggest night...

81
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,916
the VH1 Fashion Awards...

82
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,002
the VH1 Fashion Awards...

83
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,007
There he is, three-time
Male Model ofthe Year...

84
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,926
Derek Zoolander...

85
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,927
He's like music.

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,013
Proud owner of Blue Steel, the look
that made him the legend he now is...

87
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,933
He's almost too good-looking.

88
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:08,934
Hey, Paco!

89
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,020
That would be my main deterrent
in considering a relationship.

90
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,994
And that's who Derek Zoolander is
defending his title against tonight...

91
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,913
Hansel...

92
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,000
- Hansel, right here!
- All right, all right.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,918
The rookie sensation
who has burned his way...

94
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,920
into the eye sockets
ofthe fashion world...

95
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,007
and left them clawing
their faces for more...

96
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,010
Mugatu sucks!
Support the prime minister!

97
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,013
Mugatu uses slave labor!

98
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,933
Down with Mugatu!

99
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,020
You hate to see something like that
at an event like this...

100
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,898
Ugly protesters
bothering beautiful people.

101
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,984
There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu
has used cheap Malaysian workers...

102
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,988
to make his and most
of the garment industry's clothes...

103
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,909
Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

104
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,995
You're going for your fourth
Male Model of the Year award.

105
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,998
- Are you nervous?
- I have butterflies in my basket...

106
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,917
but I think I'm doing okay.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,003
We also hear you're working on a new
look. Can you tell us about it?

108
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,006
Actually, I can't, Steve,
because it's not yet perfected.

109
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,925
But I can tell you
that it's called Magnum and...

110
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,927
Shut, baby, shut!

111
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,929
If I tell you anything else,
this guy's gonna kill me.

112
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,931
Got that right.
How are you doing, Steven?

113
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,017
- Maury Ballstein, Balls Models.
- A man who needs no introduction.

114
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,020
Maury, you've handle every important
male model for the last 30 years.

115
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,898
- Derek's chances tonight?
- Let me tell you something.

116
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,984
Nobody can touch Derek.
Nobody! I gotta get inside.

117
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,987
I'm "shvitzing" like a "shmedrik"
with all these lights.

118
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you worried about Hansel?

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,919
Not as much
as I'm worried about Gretel.

120
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,005
Hey, put that Hansel and Gretel
line in your article.

121
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:03,924
I want people to know
how funny I can be.

122
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,010
Oh, believe me, they'll know.
It hits newsstands tomorrow.

123
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,013
Excuse me, Mr. Mugatu.
Mr. Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.

124
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,932
Time magazine.

125
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,934
Any comment on Prime Minister
Hassan's wage increases...

126
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,936
for Malaysian garment workers?
- No, he has no comment.

127
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,022
Let him speak for himself. Would you
like to see the prime minister...

128
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,985
out of power so you can continue
exploiting cheap Malaysian workers?

129
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,988
Hey, Mugatu! Screw you
and your little dog too!

130
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,991
Look out!
She's got an egg!

131
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,909
Oh, my God! Let go of me!

132
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,996
Yes!

133
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,915
Wow.

134
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,002
I just can't tell you how much
this means to me...

135
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,920
to be the first recipient
of this beautiful award.

136
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,007
We have a serious problem
on our hands, Maury.

137
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,010
This Malaysian thing
is getting out of hand.

138
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,927
I hear you,Jaco.

139
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,014
What this, the Slashie, mean...

140
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:55,017
is you consider me
the best actor slash model...

141
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,897
and not the otherway around.

142
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,983
His proposed wage increase
could ruin all of us.

143
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,986
I need it taken care of soon.
I have people to answer to.

144
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:08,906
Now to the important stuff.

145
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,992
These ain't no slashes, folks...

146
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,911
These are the pure breeds...

147
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,997
Here are the nominees
for Male Model of the Year...

148
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,917
Young, hot, brash...

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,003
With more covers in his first year
than any rookie model ever...

150
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,007
and an attitude that says,
"Wiho cares? It's only fashion..."

151
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,011
That Hansel's so hot ri ght now.

152
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,014
I hear a lot of words
like "beauty"and "handsomeness"...

153
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:35,933
and "incredibly chiseled features..."

154
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,019
To me, that's like a vanity,
a self-absorption...

155
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,897
that I try to steer clear of...

156
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,983
I dig the bungee... For me,
it'sjust the way I live my life...

157
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,902
I grip it and I rip it...
I live it with a lot offlair...

158
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,988
I live it on the edge,
where I gotta be...

159
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,991
I wasn 't like every other kid,
who dreams about being an astronaut...

160
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,996
I was always more interested in what
bark was made out of on a tree...

161
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,918
Richard Gere's
a real hero of mine... Sting...

162
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,004
Sting would be another person
who 's a hero...

163
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,007
The music that he's created...
I don 't really listen to it...

164
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,010
But the fact that he's making it,
I respect that...

165
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,929
I care desperately about what I do...

166
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,931
Do I know what
product I'm selling? No...

167
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,933
Do I know what I'm doing today? No...

168
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,019
But I'm here,
and I'm gonna give it my best shot...

169
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,904
Over the past decade...

170
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,991
male modeling has had a shadow
cast over it by one man...

171
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,909
and five syllables...

172
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,996
Der-ek Zoo-lan-der...

173
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,000
Modeling, to me, isn 't just
about being good-looking...

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,003
or having a lot of fun and
being really, really good-looking...

175
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,927
The calender was great...

176
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,014
because it gave people a chance
to see a side of my versatility...

177
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,017
The original Greek word for model
means "misshapen ball of clay..."

178
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,021
and I try to think about that every
time I get in front of a camera...

179
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,024
Three-time Male Model ofthe Year...

180
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,995
And the award goes to...

181
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,002
Hansel.

182
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,020
Thank you, Lenny.

183
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,898
Wow!

184
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,984
You know, a lot of people said
winning this award...

185
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,987
four years in a row
couldn't happen.

186
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,991
Well, I guess I showed...

187
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,008
I think we've found
our solution, Ballstein.

188
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,928
No, not Derek.

189
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,014
He's perfect, and you know it.
Now make it happen.

190
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,019
I stings me like a fissure
in my ass, but you're right.

191
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,022
He's ready.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,003
Who am I?

193
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,921
I don't know.

194
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:56,008
I guess I have
a lot of things to ponder.

195
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,012
Hey, the results are in, amigo!

196
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:03,015
What's left to ponder?

197
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,020
Nice comeback!

198
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:21,927
I can't stand Hansel!

199
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,013
I know, right? Riding in
on that scooter like he's so cool.

200
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,017
- And the way Hansel combs his hair.
- Or, like, doesn't.

201
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,020
It's like, "ex-squeeze" me, but
have you ever heard of styling gel?

202
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,984
I'm sure Hansel's heard
of styling gel. He's a male model.

203
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,902
Earth to Brint.
I was making a joke.

204
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,989
Earth to Meekus.
Duh, okay? I knew that.

205
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,908
Earth to Brint.
I'm not so sure you did...

206
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,995
'cause you were all,
"I'm sure he's heard of styling gel"...

207
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,998
like you didn't know it was a joke.

208
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,001
I knew it was a joke, Meekus.
I just didn't get it right away.

209
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,004
- Earth to Brint...
- Would you guys stop it already!

210
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,007
Did you ever think that maybe
there's more to life...

211
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,010
than being really, really,
ridiculously good-looking?

212
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,017
Maybe we should be doing something
more meaningful with our lives.

213
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,937
Like helping people.

214
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,024
Uh, Derek, what people?

215
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,986
I don't know.
People who need help.

216
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,989
Models help people. They make them
feel good about themselves.

217
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,909
They also show them
how to dress cool...

218
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,911
and wear their hair
in interesting ways.

219
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,913
I guess so.

220
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,999
You know what could really help you
sort through these important issues?

221
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,918
What?

222
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,004
Orange mocha frappuccino!

223
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:41,924
Yeah!

224
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,010
Come on, man! Come on!

225
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,999
"Derek Zoolander: a model, idiot"

226
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,022
- Brint!
- Huh?

227
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,995
Rufus, Brint and Meekus
were like brothers to me.

228
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,000
And when I say brother, I don't
mean like an actual brother...

229
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,003
but I mean it like the way
black people use it...

230
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,923
which is more meaningful, I think.

231
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,009
If there's anything that this
horrible tragedy can teach us...

232
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,013
it's that a male model's life
is a precious, precious commodity.

233
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,017
Just because we have chiseled abs...

234
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,937
and stunning features...

235
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,023
it doesn't mean that we can't die
in a freak gasoline fight accident.

236
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,987
So today, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to take this opportunity...

237
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,991
to announce my retire...

238
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,002
Hansel.
He's so hot right now.

239
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,006
I would like to take this oppor...

240
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,009
People!

241
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,012
I'd like to announce my retirement
from the male modeling profession.

242
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,933
What?

243
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,019
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more
to life than being good-looking.

244
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,898
And I plan on finding out
what that is. Thank you.

245
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,900
Mr. Mugatu! Mr. Mugatu!

246
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,987
If I could just have
a moment of your time, please, sir.

247
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,990
Just one minute of your time,
please, sir!

248
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,996
- What do you want?
- I'm trying to talk to Mugatu...

249
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,915
but he's tougher to get to
than the president.

250
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,002
Oh, I thought you were gonna tell me
what a bad "eugoogolizer" I am.

251
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,920
A what?

252
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,007
A "eugoogolizer"'
One who speaks at funerals.

253
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,012
Or did you think I'd be too stupid
to know what a "eugoogoly" was?

254
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,016
How could you have written
those terrible things about me?

255
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,019
Derek, my editor
put that headline on it, okay?

256
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,897
I'm sorry. I know
it came off kind of harsh.

257
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,899
Yeah, well, fortunately foryou,
not too many people I know...

258
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,985
read your little Time magazine,
or whatever it's called.

259
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,904
Look, maybe you could do me a favor.

260
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,990
All I'm trying to do is get some
background information on Mugatu.

261
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,909
Mugatu? If you knew anything...

262
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,995
you know Mugatu's the one designer
who's never hired me.

263
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:41,914
Come on. There's gotta be...

264
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,916
Sorry, lady. Not interested.

265
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,002
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
an after funeral party to attend.

266
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,926
Go back home?
You're overreacting...

267
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,928
I want to do something meaningful
with my life, Maury...

268
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,014
I have deeper thoughts on my mind.

269
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,933
The other day, I was thinking
about volunteering...

270
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:04,019
to help teach underprivileged
children to learn how to read.

271
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,897
Just thinking about it was the most
rewarding experience I've ever had.

272
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,983
Derek, I don't think you're cut out
for that kind of thing.

273
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,902
I mean, maybe I could even have
my own institute.

274
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,988
We could call it the Derek Zoolander
Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

275
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,910
What about us?
We built this place together.

276
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,996
Look out! Tushy squeeze!

277
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,916
When I met you,
you were a junior petite...

278
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,918
who couldn't book
a goddamn Sears catalog...

279
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,920
and who couldn't turn left
to save his ass.

280
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,006
- Now look at you.
- I can turn left!

281
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,925
Yeah, right.

282
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,927
Please. Some male models go left
at the end of a runway...

283
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,929
others go right.

284
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,015
You got a lot of gifts, but hanging
a louie just isn't one of them.

285
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,018
Sit down!

286
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,021
Hey, you want to hear
some great news?

287
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,986
Mugatu wants you
for his new campaign.

288
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,989
Didn't you hear me, Maury?
I just retired.

289
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,908
But this is Mugatu, Derek.

290
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,910
Right now, this guy is so hot...

291
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,912
he can take a crap,
wrap it in tin foil...

292
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,914
put a couple of fishhooks on it...

293
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,001
and sell it to Queen Elizabeth
as earrings.

294
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:14,006
Derek, you're the laughing stock
of the entire fashion world.

295
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,012
What do we do
when we fall off the horse?

296
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:29,021
We get back on.

297
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,983
Sorry, Maury.
I'm not a gymnast.

298
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,987
I'm going back home. I need
to get in touch with my roots.

299
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,990
Figure out who I am.
See you around, Maury.

300
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,983
Hey, Pop!

301
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,990
It's me.

302
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,994
Scrappy, Luke...

303
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,914
you rememberyour brother, right?

304
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,916
What do you want?

305
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,002
I thought maybe I could work
the mines with you guys.

306
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,005
All the Zoolander men together
again, like when we were kids.

307
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,010
Times have changed. You wouldn't
last one day down those coal pits.

308
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,014
Can't you even pretend
to be happy to see me, Pop?

309
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:49,017
Damn it, Derek, I'm a coal miner,
not a professional television actor.

310
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,023
Do us all a favor
and get out of here.

311
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,904
Pop, wait, please!

312
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,991
Give me a chance.

313
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,994
I won't let you down.
I promise.

314
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,003
Hold very still. Very still.

315
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,006
I'm working right now. This...

316
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,924
- Ouch!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,926
Did my pin get in the way
of your ass?

318
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,013
Do me a favor and lose
five pounds immediately...

319
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:29,016
or get out of my building like now!

320
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:29,933
Get out!

321
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:33,020
I'm so tired!
No, Todd, not now!

322
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,897
It's Maury.

323
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,898
Tell me something good.

324
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,984
You may have to start
looking for someone else.

325
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,987
There is no one else.
The show is in ten days, Ballstein.

326
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,907
Jaco, I hearyou,
but the kid's mixed up.

327
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,993
He went home... He's talking
about going offto ponder...

328
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,912
and tutoring underprivileged
retards or some shit.

329
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,998
I don't care what it takes.
Get him back..

330
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:56,001
We're running out of time.
Capisce?

331
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,004
Yeah, I capisce...
Now if I could only "ca-piss"'

332
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,007
My prostate's flaring up
like a frickin' tiki torch.

333
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,011
Give me a little pee-pee.
Come on, a couple of drops.

334
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:11,016
That's what I'm talking about!

335
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:14,019
That's what I'm talking about!

336
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,011
Surprise!

337
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:56,019
What the hell's
the matter with you?

338
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,907
Pacheco back to pass...

339
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:10,909
He's feeling pressure from Pressman...

340
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,911
He's looking for his all-American
John De Rosa, the wide receiver...

341
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,913
He's got him wide open
in the middle ofthe field...

342
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,915
Big rush...

343
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:17,916
Who's winning the match?

344
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,003
Hits Kevin Conley,
the tight end down in there...

345
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:24,006
State.

346
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,012
I think I'm getting
the black lung, Pop.

347
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,930
It's not very well ventilated
down there.

348
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:33,932
For Christ's sake, Derek,
you've been down there one day.

349
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,019
Talk to me in 30 years.

350
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,991
Moisture is the essence
ofwetness...

351
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,997
and wetness is the essence
ofbeauty...

352
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,013
Why'd you have to come back
to this damn town?

353
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:17,017
I wanted to make
a new life for myself.

354
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,020
I'm sorry I was born
with this perfect bone structure.

355
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,898
That my hair looks better
done up with gel and mousse...

356
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,984
than hidden under a stupid hat
with a light on it!

357
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,988
All I ever wanted to do
was make you proud of me, Pop.

358
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,991
With what? Your male modeling?

359
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,995
Prancing around in your underwear
with your wiener hanging out?

360
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,002
You're dead to me, boy.

361
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:48,006
You're more dead to me
than your dead mother.

362
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,011
I just thank the Lord she didn't
live to see her son as a mermaid.

363
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,018
Mer-man.

364
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,994
Who am I?

365
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:31,008
Hello? Derek,you hearing me?

366
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,926
- God?
- God?

367
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,013
Wihat the shit are you talking about?
It's me... Maury...

368
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,931
I hope you're finished
touching your roots...

369
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,933
because Mugatu's making you
an offer you won 't believe...

370
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:43,020
You gotta get your took us back here...

371
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,985
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was a little hesitant at first.

372
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,989
I mean, you've never hired me
before, and I've been around...

373
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,910
For ages and ages.
You've been around for a long time.

374
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,912
I never wanted anything from you.

375
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,914
And now that you're retired,
I can't have you.

376
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,916
And it's funny
how it switches like that.

377
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:07,002
But now the forbidden fruit
must be tasted.

378
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:10,005
Well, when Maury told me
what you were willing to do, I...

379
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,013
Are you not aware that I get farty
and bloated with a foamy latte?

380
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,016
My mistake,Jacobim.

381
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:24,019
Your mistake indeed!

382
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,989
Yes, Derek.

383
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,992
What Maury said
I was willing to do foryou.

384
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,995
Let's get back to the reason
that we're really here.

385
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:48,001
Without much further ado,
I give you...

386
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,005
the Derek Zoolander Center
for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

387
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:06,019
What is this?

388
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,899
A center for ants?

389
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:13,986
What?

390
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,991
How can we be expected to teach
children to learn how to read...

391
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,995
if they can't even fit
inside the building?

392
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,915
- Derek, it's just a small...
- I don't want to hearyour excuses!

393
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,002
The center has to be at least...

394
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:35,007
three times bigger than this.

395
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,012
- He's absolutely right.
- Thank you.

396
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:42,931
I have a vision.

397
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:46,018
And so do I.
Let me show you mine.

398
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,898
I can't help you, lady...
I don't know nothing about Mugatu...

399
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,900
But you've represented every
male model in each of his campaigns.

400
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,986
You must have some kind
of a relationship with him.

401
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,905
Even if I did,
why would I talk to you?

402
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,991
Shame on you how you picked on
Derek Zoolander in that story.

403
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,910
He's a sweet simpleton
who never hurt a fly.

404
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,996
Please don't change the subject,
Mr. Ballstein.

405
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,999
What about Mugatu's exploitation
of sweatshop workers in Malaysia?

406
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,918
- Do you have an opinion on that?
- You wanna hear an opinion?

407
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,004
With a push-up bra, you could have
a nice rack of lamb going on there.

408
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:18,008
Let me show you
the future of fashion.

409
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,013
Let me show you...

410
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,932
Derelicte!

411
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,934
It is a fashion, a way of life...

412
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:30,020
inspired by the very homeless,
the vagrants...

413
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,023
the crack whores that make
this wonderful city so unique.

414
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,987
And I want you, Derek,
to be the face...

415
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,990
the image... nay,
the spirit of Derelicte!

416
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,911
It'll be your glorious comeback.

417
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,913
Sounds cool.

418
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,999
Derek, I'd like you to meet
Katinka Ingabogovinana.

419
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:57,005
She'll be your day-to-day
on the campaign.

420
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,008
Let's get this model on his way!

421
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,011
The big show
is in eight days, Derek...

422
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:04,930
Like a caterpillar
becomes a butterfly...

423
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:08,016
so must you become Derelicte!

424
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,936
So you want me
to sleep in the gutter?

425
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,022
No... Wie're sending you
to a very exclusive day spa...

426
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,900
So exclusive,
no one knows about it...

427
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,987
Our little secret, okay?

428
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:28,912
- Mati lda, hey.
- Hey, Arch, what's up?

429
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,914
Nothing. I've just
been up for a few days...

430
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:34,001
putting together these background
articles on Mugatu you asked for.

431
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:37,004
Very thorough, Archie.
Thank you.

432
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:40,007
It's weird. I couldn't get
any info on him before 1995.

433
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,925
It's like he just appeared
out of the blue.

434
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,012
- Really? That's strange.
- Yeah.

435
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,931
- Matilda Jeffries.
- Keep pulling the sweater.

436
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,018
- Excuse me?
- Eventually the thing will unravel...

437
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,023
You mean, if you pull the thread,
the whole thing will unravel?

438
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,985
Now you're talking, sister. If you
want to know more, go to Pier 12.

439
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,989
Things aren't what they seem.

440
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:15,000
What kind of spa is this?

441
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,920
It's designed
for deep, deep relaxation.

442
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,006
Come, let's get you loosened up.

443
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:34,019
Good boy.

444
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,010
Oh, I'm sorry.

445
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,015
Matilda, what are you doing here?

446
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:15,018
I was...

447
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,983
What are you doing here, Derek?
I thought you quit the business.

448
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,986
Haven't you heard? I'm the new face
of Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

449
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,994
What do you mean, Derek?
You said Mugatu never hires you.

450
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:34,997
Well, I guess he changed his mind.
It's the world's biggest campaign.

451
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:39,001
What is this? Who are you?

452
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:42,004
This is private property. Nils!

453
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:48,010
I suggest you and your Kmart
Jaclyn Smith Collection outfit...

454
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:52,014
stay the hell away
from Derek Zoolander.

455
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:02,024
How do you feel, Derek?

456
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,905
When's the seaweed wrap?

457
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,907
You shut up now.

458
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,993
I want you to relax...

459
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,996
and breathe deeply.

460
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,003
Breathe deeply.

461
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:32,012
- I like this song.
- Of course you do.

462
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:41,021
Wielcome to your relaxation time...

463
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,983
Let this wonderful
'80s classic soothe you...

464
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,987
Just a nice, warm, happy time...

465
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,990
Happy, happy...

466
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,997
Nothing to worry about at all...

467
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:03,001
Just relax...

468
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,005
Hey there, Derek...
My name is Lil' Kleatus...

469
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,009
I'm just a kid who wants you to know
the truth about child labor laws...

470
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:16,014
They're silly and outdated...
In the good old days...

471
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:19,017
kids as young as five
could work as they pleased...

472
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,896
from textile factories
to iron smelts...

473
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,898
Yippee! Hooray!

474
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,985
But today, the age-old right
of children to work is under attack...

475
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,990
From the Philippines to Bangladesh,
in China and India...

476
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,993
and South America too...

477
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,912
But you can help
these children, Derek...

478
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,999
by killing the prime minister
ofMalaysia...

479
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:45,002
- He is bad...
- What?

480
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:49,006
You learn martial arts...

481
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:52,009
Prime minister ofMalaysia bad!

482
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,927
Martial arts good!

483
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:57,014
Kill naughty man!

484
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,934
Obey my dog!

485
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:02,936
On the runway,
you have one objective...

486
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,023
Do not be distracted
by the beautiful celebrities...

487
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,988
Do as you've been trained to do and
kill the Malaysian prime minister!

488
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,994
Karate chop! Bad, man! Awful man!

489
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,998
In your little blue suit
and your spiky black hair... Kill!

490
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:26,001
And you're
a super-hot ninja machine!

491
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:39,014
- Derek, are you in there?
- Hold your horses!

492
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:42,017
- Derek, please open the door!
- What a cuckoo dream.

493
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,898
- What?
- Hey, are you okay?

494
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,900
I've been trying to reach you
for a week.

495
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,902
A week? What,
are you having a whack attack?

496
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,904
I saw you this afternoon, dum-dum.

497
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,990
That was last Friday.

498
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,993
Earth to Matilda.
I was at a day spa.

499
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,996
Day. D-A-I-Y-E. Okay?

500
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,917
Look, I think I know
what this is about...

501
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,003
and I'm very complimented
but not interested.

502
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,924
- What?
- I can't sleep with you, okay?

503
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:17,010
- My head is killing me and...
- What are you talking about?

504
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,929
Okay, if you just want
to fool around a little bit...

505
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:22,015
Hey, I don't want to sleep with you!

506
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,934
I've been trying to tell you
you've been missing for a week.

507
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,020
Would you look at the date. Mugatu's
Derelicte show is tomorrow night.

508
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,983
I don't care what the date says.

509
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,987
You have 1,200 messages...

510
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,907
That is a bit above average.

511
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,994
- Derek, what happened in that spa?
- I don't know.

512
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,912
A little massage,
some aromatherapy.

513
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:46,999
I mean, look, lady, you can't just
come barging into people's lofts...

514
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,918
wanting sex,
then changing your mind...

515
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,920
then telling them that they've been
in a day spa for a week...

516
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,007
You have been in a day spa
for a week.

517
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:55,924
So what?

518
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:59,011
Do you understand that the world
does not revolve around you...

519
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:02,014
and your "do whatever it takes,
ruin as many people's lives"...

520
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,933
so long as you can make a name
foryourself as a journalist...

521
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,935
no matter how many friends
you lose...

522
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:09,897
or people you leave dead
and bloodied along the way...

523
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,983
just so long as you can make a name
foryourself as a journalist...

524
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,902
no matter how many friends
you lose...

525
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:17,988
or people you leave dead and
bloodied and dying along the way?

526
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,910
I told you I was sorry
about that article.

527
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:24,912
Enough! My head hurts!

528
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,998
And if it indeed is
what day you claim it is...

529
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,001
I have a pre-runway party
to attend, if you'll excuse me.

530
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,923
- By the way...
- What?

531
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,925
With your complexion...

532
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,927
you really shouldn't be wearing
your hair pulled back that tight.

533
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,929
What are you talking about?

534
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,931
It pulls back the skin
on your forehead...

535
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,933
creating a tension
which clogs the pores.

536
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:49,019
That's why you have some light
pattern dryness around your scalp.

537
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:52,022
Do you mind?

538
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:02,991
Cool.

539
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,004
I do not like snoopy reporter
with lack of fashion sense.

540
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:20,008
Not one little bit.

541
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:23,011
Not one little bit.

542
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,931
Hey, I just E-mailed you
all those searches...

543
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:29,017
on the male models who've
appeared in Mugatu campaigns.

544
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:32,020
It's pretty weird. It seems
like all of Mr. Mugatu's models...

545
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,983
have a bad habit of dying young
in freak accidents.

546
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,986
What?

547
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,995
- Wait a second.
- What?

548
00:38:57,004 --> 00:39:00,007
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.
- What's going on?

549
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,928
I don't want to hang out, okay?

550
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,015
I just need to speak
with Derek Zoolander, please!

551
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:11,018
I just thought the way you handled
losing that award to Hansel...

552
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,937
and then you sort of laid low
for a while...

553
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,898
and then made your comeback...

554
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,900
It was so courageous.

555
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,902
Look, I gotta go pee...

556
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:22,988
but I'd really like to continue
talking about this conversation.

557
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,993
Yeah.

558
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:30,996
- Everything cool, Derek?
- It's great, Biff. Thank you.

559
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,917
Hey, Derek. You rule.

560
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,003
Thanks, Paris.
I appreciate that.

561
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:41,006
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Maurice.

562
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:44,009
- Hey, my man.
- What's happening?

563
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,929
Derek, back on top, man.

564
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:48,931
Thanks, Billy. You rock.

565
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:52,017
No, you rock. When are you gonna
drop Magnum on us, buddy?

566
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:55,020
Not yet. Gotta tame the beast
before you let it out of its cage.

567
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:01,985
- Excuse me, bra.
- You're excused.

568
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,993
And I'm not your bra.

569
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,997
Whatever, dude. Whatever.
Peace. God bless.

570
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:18,001
Hey, Hansel, I'm sorry you didn't
get Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

571
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,922
Maybe next time.

572
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:22,923
What's that?

573
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:26,009
Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.
Sorry you didn't book it.

574
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,013
Oh, yeah?
I've never even heard of it.

575
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:33,016
Me and my friends have been too busy
bathing off of St. Barts...

576
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:34,935
with spider monkeys
for the past two weeks.

577
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,896
Tripping on acid changed
our whole perspective on shit.

578
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,983
So I guess you can "dere-lick"
my balls, capitan...

579
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,991
Would you hold this for me?

580
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,995
I can "dere-lick" my own balls,
thank you very much.

581
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:00,002
You think you're
too cool for school.

582
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:03,005
But I got a news flash
for you, Walter Cronkite.

583
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:10,012
You aren't.

584
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:16,018
Who are you trying
to get crazy with, ese?

585
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,022
Don't you know I'm loco?

586
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,984
Hey, I got a wacky idea.

587
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:27,988
What say we settle this
on the runway...

588
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,991
Han-solo?

589
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,919
Stop it.

590
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:45,005
Are you challenging me
to a walk-off...

591
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:48,008
Boo-lander?

592
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,927
Don't do this, Derek.

593
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,013
Listen to your friend Billy Zane.

594
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:56,016
He's a cool dude.
He's trying to help you out.

595
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:01,021
Oh, yeah. That's a walk-off
challenge, my friend.

596
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,987
Ten minutes.
Old Members Only warehouse.

597
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,906
You oughta remember that.
You're a dinosaur.

598
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,992
Let's go. Open up.

599
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,998
I heard some mad stories
about this kid. He's too limber.

600
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:23,001
Put a cork in it, Zane!

601
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,922
It's a walk-off.

602
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:30,008
This is urgent, ma'am.
Do you have any...

603
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:35,931
Hey, Matilda.

604
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:39,017
What is this?
Where is everyone going?

605
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,936
Good luck, Derek!
Kick Hansel's ass!

606
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,896
Thanks, Rico. I'll try.

607
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,898
You want to see the real world
of male modeling?

608
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:47,985
The one they don't show you
in magazines or the E Channel?

609
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,903
Yeah, I guess. Derek, please.

610
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,990
I have something really important
to talk to you about.

611
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:53,907
Not now, Matilda.

612
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,994
Han-sell-out is about
to have his Han-sell-ass...

613
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:59,997
handed to him on a platter
with french-fried potatoes.

614
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:03,000
Katinka, thought you might
want to know...

615
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,918
your boy Zoolander's rolling.

616
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:08,005
It's a walk-off.

617
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:31,904
All right,
who's gonna call this sucker?

618
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:34,990
If nobody has any objections...

619
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,993
I believe I might be of service.

620
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,002
Now, this'll be a straight walk-off,
old school rules.

621
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:50,005
First model walks, second model
duplicates, then elaborates.

622
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:55,010
Okay, boys, let's go to work.

623
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,929
Age before beauty, goat cheese.

624
00:43:57,012 --> 00:44:00,015
Whatever.

625
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:05,020
Right.

626
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:36,009
Playskool, baby.

627
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:06,915
You gotta cut me. I can't see.
I'm blind out there.

628
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:10,002
Evian.

629
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,007
It's okay.

630
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:28,937
- Where am I?
- It's okay.

631
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:32,024
- Kickin', Hoss.
- I'm going monk.

632
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:36,987
I gotta go monk. Prayer.
Pray to the Great Spirit.

633
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:57,007
Do it, Hansel.

634
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,013
Why is he sticking his hand
in his pants?

635
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:08,018
Do it, Hansel.

636
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,997
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Derek, you're not a kid anymore.

637
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:33,001
You could hurt yourself out there.

638
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:37,005
I can do this, Tyson.

639
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:49,017
Thank God I wore underweartoday...

640
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,988
He's going for it.

641
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:24,011
Oh, my God.

642
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,022
Disqualified.

643
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:41,904
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.

644
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:43,906
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.

645
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,908
What's going on?

646
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:47,910
I think Katinka wants to kill you.

647
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:50,996
Good. I deserve to die if I can't
beat Han-suck-ass in a walk-off.

648
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:54,917
Derek, that's not true.

649
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,003
The guy had to pull his underwear
out of his butt just to beat you.

650
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:06,011
And all he had to do
was turn left.

651
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,931
What do you mean?

652
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:12,017
I'm not an ambi-turner.

653
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:15,020
It's a problem I had
since I was a baby.

654
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:17,898
I can't turn left.

655
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,984
Derek, that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

656
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,987
I'm sure there are a lot of people
out there who can't turn...

657
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:30,994
There have got to be some people
out there, just like you...

658
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:34,998
who can't turn... turn left.

659
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:43,006
If you want answers,
come to Saint Adonis Cemetery now...

660
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:46,009
- Wait! Who are you?
- Who was that?

661
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:49,012
I'm not sure. I have to get
to Saint Adonis Cemetery.

662
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:53,016
I'm gonna take you to my apartment.
You can stay there until I get back.

663
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:54,935
Can I come with?

664
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:58,021
I don't want to be alone tonight.

665
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:12,995
"Pedro Scialfa"'

666
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,998
He died when he was 29.

667
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:22,004
"Vin Correjo"'

668
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:25,007
"Derriere Extraordinaire"'

669
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:32,014
Ninety-two minus sixty-three.

670
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:35,017
None of them ever made it past 30.

671
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:39,021
I did.

672
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:40,898
Who are you?

673
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:41,899
It's not important.

674
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:44,985
Are you a ghost?

675
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:47,905
He called, Derek.

676
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,991
Let's take a walk.

677
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,994
You think Zoolander's in trouble?

678
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,913
Think again.

679
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:58,999
What you've stumbled upon goes way
deeper than you could ever fathom.

680
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,918
The fashion industry
has been behind...

681
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:04,004
every major political assassination
over the last 200 years.

682
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:08,008
And behind every hit,
a card-carrying male model.

683
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,929
Okay, that's impossible.

684
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,931
Oh, yeah?
Listen and learn, sweetness.

685
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:17,017
Abe Lincoln wanted to abolish
slavery, right?

686
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,937
But who do you think made the
powdered wigs and leg stockings...

687
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,023
worn by our country's
early leaders?

688
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:26,985
Mugatu!

689
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,988
Slaves, Derek.

690
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,992
Without their free labor,
prices would have gone up tenfold.

691
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,995
So the powers that be
hired John Wilkes Booth...

692
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,998
the original model/actor,
to do Mr... Lincoln in...

693
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:46,004
I'll go on.
Dallas, Texas, 1963.

694
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:50,008
Kennedy had just put
a trade embargo on Cuba...

695
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:53,011
ostensibly halting the shipment
of Cuban-manufactured slacks.

696
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:54,930
Incredibly popular item
at the time.

697
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:58,016
Lee Harvey Oswald
was not a male model.

698
00:50:58,016 --> 00:50:59,935
You're goddamn right he wasn't.
But those two lookers...

699
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:03,021
who capped Kennedy from the grassy
knoll sure as shit were.

700
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:06,984
Well, what about you?
How do you fit in to all this?

701
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:09,903
This nation was swept...

702
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:12,990
I'll get it, ma'am.

703
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:18,912
I can't get over...

704
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,999
Wait a minute.

705
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:27,004
I know that hand.

706
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:30,007
It was in the fall 1973
Bulova watch catalog.

707
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:35,012
You're J.P. Prewitt.

708
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:38,015
The world's greatest hand model.

709
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:42,019
Once upon a time.
But things change.

710
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:44,897
Thanks to this homemade
hyperbaric chamber...

711
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,983
my sweet baby never did.

712
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:50,903
Let's keep moving.

713
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:53,989
And that's when I found out I was
in line to assassinate Jimmy Carter.

714
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,993
- So, how'd you manage to escape?
- Because I'm a hand model, mama.

715
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:01,997
A finger jockey. We don't think
the same as the face and body boys.

716
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:06,001
- We're a different breed.
- So why male models?

717
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:09,004
Think about it, Derek.

718
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:12,007
Male models are genetically
constructed to become assassins...

719
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:15,010
They're in peak
physical condition...

720
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:20,015
They can gain entry to the most
secure places in the world.

721
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:25,020
And most important of all,
models don't think for themselves.

722
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,023
- They do as they're told.
- That is not true.

723
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:31,985
Yes it is, Derek.

724
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:34,988
Yeah. Think about any photo shoot
you've ever been on.

725
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,909
You're a monkey, Derek!

726
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:41,995
Dance, monkey,
in your little spangly shoes!

727
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:44,998
Mash your cymbals, chimpy!
Dance, Derek, dance!

728
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:46,917
Good point.

729
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,003
But if this has been going on
for so long, Mugatu...

730
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,922
He's just a punk-ass errand boy...

731
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,008
working for an international
syndicate of fashion designers.

732
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:58,011
You do a little background check
on your Mr. Mugatu.

733
00:52:58,011 --> 00:53:01,014
You'll find he sold his soul to the
devil for a shot at the big time.

734
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:06,019
But why male models?

735
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:11,984
Are you serious? I just...
I just told you that a moment ago.

736
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:13,902
Right.

737
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:16,989
You're a killing machine, Derek.
They've programmed you.

738
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,908
But I won't do it.
I won't kill anybody.

739
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,995
It's not up to you. At the proper
moment, they'll triggeryou.

740
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:25,998
Usually using an auditory or visual
Pavlovian response mechanism.

741
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:30,002
- "Audi-what-ey"?
- And when it's over...

742
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:35,007
What? There's an after party?

743
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,013
Derek, get down!

744
00:53:42,014 --> 00:53:45,017
You gotta get
to Maury Ballstein's computer.

745
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:48,020
He recorded everything
in case they ever turned on him.

746
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:53,901
Derek, get a grip!

747
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,987
Good luck to you, Derek. I've
always been a fan of Blue Steel.

748
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:01,992
And I hear Magnum
is gonna blow us all away.

749
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,912
Come on!

750
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:07,998
- Get out of here.
- Hang in there,J.P.

751
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:12,002
You freakin' idiot!

752
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:19,009
Man, that was close... I can't
believe Maury's in on it too...

753
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,929
That she-male Katinka's
not messing around...

754
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,931
You're telling me!
For a second there...

755
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:25,933
I thought someone was gonna
be reading our "eugoogoly"

756
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:29,019
Okay, all right,
we need a place to hide.

757
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:31,897
Where's the last place anyone
would ever expect to look foryou?

758
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,898
I don't know.

759
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:35,984
Think, okay?
This is important!

760
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,992
I hate Hansel! Hansel, Hansel!
Everywhere I look! Hansel!

761
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:58,006
Were you looking for a rematch?

762
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:02,010
Excuse me, Hansel. I don't think
there's an easy way to put this...

763
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,929
so I am just gonna lay it out.

764
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:07,015
Derek has been brainwashed...

765
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:11,019
to kill the prime minister
of Malaysia.

766
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,896
And?

767
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,983
And we need a place to hide until
we figure this whole thing out.

768
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,987
Derek said this would be the last
place anyone would look for him.

769
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,908
Yeah, you're cool to hide here.

770
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:27,995
But first, me and him
gotta straighten some shit out.

771
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,000
Fine.

772
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,003
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?

773
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:40,007
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?

774
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:48,015
Well, you go first.

775
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:49,933
I don't know. Maybe I felt
a little threatened or something...

776
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:53,020
'cause your career
is kind of just blossoming...

777
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,898
and mine's kind ofwinding down
or whatever.

778
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,984
And I felt like,
"This guy's really hurting me"...

779
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:02,988
and it hurt.

780
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:05,991
And I felt like when you told me
to "dere-lick" my balls...

781
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,910
that really hurt.

782
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:10,996
Maybe I was scared, man.
You're Derek Zoolander!

783
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:14,917
Yeah, you're Derek Zoolander.

784
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,003
You know what it's like to be
another model in Zoolander's shadow?

785
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:27,012
You want to hear something crazy?

786
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:30,933
Your work...

787
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:34,019
in the winter '95
International Male catalog...

788
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,987
made me want to be a model.

789
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:48,992
I freakin' worship you, man.

790
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,913
I'm sorry I was whack.

791
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,915
I was whack.

792
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:58,001
I was whack.

793
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,928
So welcome to chez Hansel.

794
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:09,930
You're welcome to hide out here
as long as you want.

795
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:13,016
Well, there isn't much time.
The show's tomorrow night.

796
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:16,019
We have to figure out
a plan by then.

797
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,896
I'll round up the troops here.

798
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,983
Hey, what's up, y'all?
This is Derek and Matilda.

799
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:24,987
Derek, you know Natani and Chloe.

800
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:27,990
We got Buzzy Sullivan,
big wave surfer from Maverick's.

801
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:29,908
Hey, bra.

802
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:31,910
Oh, this is this fantastic band,
the Little Kings...

803
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:34,997
I met when I was ice sailing
in Finland.

804
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:36,915
That's my Sherpa, Lapsang.

805
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:40,002
Hey, everybody!
Listen up for a second.

806
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:44,006
Derek and Matilda are hiding 'cause
some dudes brainwashed Derek...

807
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,924
to off the prime minister
of Micronesia.

808
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:47,926
- Malaysia.
- Right.

809
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,013
So, they're gonna be hiding here.
Let's show them a good time.

810
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:55,017
- Right on!
- All right, come on, over here.

811
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:56,935
Oh, hey, Ennui,
will you do me a favor?

812
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:58,937
Will you get me some of that tea
that me and Lapsang got...

813
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,024
when we were climbing
the Mayan ruins?

814
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:11,992
This is really strong tea.

815
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:13,911
No, it's just right.
Trust me.

816
00:58:13,994 --> 00:58:16,997
What with all the intrigue
you guys have been dealing with.

817
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:20,000
You know, Matilda, I'm surprised
you're so worried about "Der-rock"'

818
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:24,922
From that article that I read,
it seems like...

819
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:28,008
you don't really care too much
about guys in our line ofwork.

820
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:32,012
Why do you hate models, Matilda?

821
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:35,015
- Honestly?
- Yes.

822
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:39,019
I think they're vain, stupid...

823
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:41,897
and incredibly self-centered.

824
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,983
I totally agree with you.

825
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:47,986
But how do you feel
about male models?

826
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:50,989
Sweet.

827
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,993
Okay, but seriously, Matil.
Is it all right if I call you Matil?

828
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:00,999
What's the deal, yo-yo?

829
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,002
You're not telling us everything.
There's something else, isn't there?

830
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,922
You guys really want
to know the truth?

831
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:10,008
- Yeah.
- Then I'm gonna tell you the truth.

832
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,013
When I was in seventh grade...

833
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:19,017
I was the fat kid in my class.

834
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,897
All right, forget it.

835
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:26,984
- No.
- Dude, be cool tonight. Come on.

836
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:29,987
I'm sorry.
Please, go ahead. My mistake.

837
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:33,991
I was the one that all the pretty
girls used to make fun of.

838
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:36,994
It was an awkward phase.

839
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:40,914
Anyway...

840
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:44,001
every day after school,
I would come home and...

841
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:48,005
you know, I'd flip through the pages
of my mom's Vogue and Glamour...

842
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:52,009
And I just...

843
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:53,927
I'd look at these women...

844
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:57,014
these perfect, beautiful...

845
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:01,018
just unbelievable, skinny women.

846
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:02,936
I just couldn't...

847
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,023
Oh, I couldn't understand
why I didn't look like them.

848
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:09,902
I just didn't get it.

849
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:12,988
So, um...

850
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,992
So I became...

851
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,999
What?

852
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:27,002
Bulimic.

853
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:32,007
You can read minds?

854
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:41,016
It's when you throw up
after every meal.

855
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,896
See, this is exactly
what you models do to people.

856
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,982
You make them feel bad
about themselves.

857
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:55,989
So what?
I throw up after lots of meals.

858
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,993
So do I. It's a great way
to lose pounds before a show.

859
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:03,997
Are you guys insane?
Do you understand? It's a disease.

860
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:08,001
How'd that affect you with guys?
Did they not want to get busy?

861
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,921
- Good point.
- Oh. Okay. You know what?

862
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:14,007
I'm not gonna sit here with both
of you and discuss my sex life or...

863
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:21,014
Or lack thereof.

864
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:25,018
Ooh, you mean,
like, like you, like you...

865
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:27,896
- Haven't really done it...
- You haven't done it...

866
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,898
Done it in a while, yeah.

867
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:32,985
Okay, what's a while?
Like, eight days?

868
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:37,990
More?

869
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,993
Oh, try a couple years.

870
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:42,911
- Oh!
- Oh, snap!

871
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:45,998
How do you live?

872
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:49,001
Seriously. Do you service yourself
ten times a day?

873
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:53,005
- End of discussion!
- Easy. Okay, hold on.

874
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:54,923
- Easy, easy.
- I'm not comfortable talking...

875
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:56,925
Easy.

876
01:01:57,009 --> 01:02:00,012
This has been
an emotional day for all of us.

877
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:05,934
I think we should get naked.

878
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:07,936
What?

879
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,898
Don't ask questions.

880
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:13,984
Just give in to the power
of the tea.

881
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:57,903
So I'm repelling down
Mount Vesuvius...

882
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:00,989
when suddenly I slip
and I start to fall.

883
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:02,908
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.

884
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:03,909
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.

885
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:06,995
Just falling...
I'll never forget the terror.

886
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:10,999
When suddenly I remember,
"Holy shit. Hansel...

887
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:14,002
haven't you been smoking peyote
for six straight days?

888
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:17,005
And couldn't some of this,
maybe, be in your mind??'

889
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:20,008
And?

890
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:21,927
It was. I was totally fine.

891
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,013
I've never even been
to Mount Vesuvius.

892
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:26,932
Cool story, Hansel.

893
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:30,018
Thanks, Olaf.

894
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,896
Dude, how dope was last night?

895
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,898
I mean, the soil room.
Dirt was flying.

896
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:37,985
You couldn't see anything.
It was like, whoa, who's that?

897
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:40,988
- Who's this?
- I think I'm falling for Matilda.

898
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,991
Dude,
I wasn't gonna say anything...

899
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:46,994
but it was crazy energy flying
back and forth between you guys.

900
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,912
It was like, whoa, look out!

901
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:50,914
There was a moment last night...

902
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:54,001
when she was between the two Finnish
dwarves and the Maori tribesman...

903
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:58,005
- Oh, yeah.
- Where I thought...

904
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:01,008
"Wow, I could really spend the rest
of my life with this woman"'

905
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,928
Really?

906
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,930
What do you call that?

907
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:10,017
I think you call that love, D-Bone.

908
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:16,899
So what time is it?

909
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:19,985
- Almost 5:.00.
- What?

910
01:04:19,985 --> 01:04:22,988
Hey, guys,
that show is in three hours.

911
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:25,991
Derek is dead unless we get
that evidence. Do you guys...

912
01:04:25,991 --> 01:04:28,994
Whoa, easy. How about a
"Good afternoon, Derek and Hansel.

913
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:33,999
Thanks for the freak fest
last night"?

914
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,003
- Hello?
- Hello?

915
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:39,922
Oh, hi, Katinka.

916
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:43,008
Uh, no, I just had a really late
party night last night.

917
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:47,012
- Derek, hang up the phone now!
- Where am I?

918
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:50,015
- I have to go! See you at 7::00.
- Hang up!

919
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:51,934
Derek, I thought I told you
to turn off your phone.

920
01:04:52,017 --> 01:04:55,020
Turn off my phone?

921
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,898
Turn off my phone?

922
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:59,900
- Yeah.
- Earth to Matilda.

923
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:02,986
This phone is as much
a part of me as...

924
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:05,989
You know what? Can we cut it out
with all the "Earth to's," please?

925
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,993
We're not actually saying this is
the Earth calling you, Matilda.

926
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:12,996
Yeah. No, I got that. I understand
you don't literally mean...

927
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,915
Uh, no, I don't think you do.

928
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:18,001
Listen. It's not like we thinkwe're
actually in a control tower...

929
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:22,005
trying to reach outer space
aliens or something, okay?

930
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:26,009
Hello.

931
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:30,013
- Oh, snap!
- A joke.

932
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:35,018
Instead of doing that, I'm gonna try
to figure out a way into Maury's...

933
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:39,022
before Derek assassinates
a world leader.

934
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,901
Wait.

935
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,988
I have an idea.

936
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:48,991
They'll be looking for us
at Maury's, right?

937
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:51,994
But they won't be
looking for not us.

938
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:56,999
What are you talking about?

939
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,917
Hansel, do you have
a cosmetics case?

940
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:02,004
Sure, I mean,
just for touch-ups or whatever.

941
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,007
What are you gonna do with that?

942
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,925
That'll do. Early in my career...

943
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:10,012
I used to do my own makeup
styling and tailoring.

944
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:11,930
If I can create
a basic disguise for us...

945
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:15,017
we may just be able to sneak
into Maury's, undetected.

946
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:19,021
You is talkin' loco,
and I like it.

947
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,003
Wielcome to Derelicte...

948
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:53,013
Hansel calling Matil.
We have entry. Repeat.

949
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:54,932
- Wie have entry...
- Okay, guys. I hear you.

950
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:58,018
Now, once you get the info, I want
you to E-mail it to my office.

951
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:01,021
I'll download the files, and we'll
take the information to the police...

952
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,983
We hear you loud and clear.

953
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:06,902
Listen, Matil.

954
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:09,988
I've been thinking a lot
about that bulimia thing...

955
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:12,991
And I want you to know I understand
where you're coming from.

956
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:16,995
I feel really bad that
good-looking people like us...

957
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:20,999
made you throw up
and feel bad about yourself.

958
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:24,002
For serious.

959
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:27,005
- Thanks, Derek. Now, hurry up.
- Okay.

960
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:31,009
I got the results on the name check
you asked for on Jacobim Mugatu.

961
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:35,013
- Or should I say Jacob Moogberg.
- What?

962
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:37,933
He changed his name when he went
into the fashion business.

963
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:41,019
Apparently, the guy was the
original guitar synth player...

964
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,896
for that band Frankie Goes to
Hollywood, but he got kicked out...

965
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,983
before they hit it big
with that song "Relax"'

966
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,986
After Frankie gave him the heave-ho,
he held a series of odd jobs until...

967
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:51,905
get this... he invented...

968
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:54,992
the piano key necktie in 1 985.

969
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:57,995
The guy's been
a fashion designer ever since.

970
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,003
First obstacle.

971
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:09,923
You ever use one of these?

972
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:13,010
I don't think so.

973
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:16,013
Watch out. Watch...
Fix that hem,Jason.

974
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:19,016
Please. I need... Katinka!

975
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:20,934
He's not here yet,Jacobim.

976
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:24,021
- That little toad-face better show.
- He will show.

977
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:27,024
Good, because I'm a hot
little potato right now.

978
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:31,987
There must be
an "on" button somewhere.

979
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:34,990
Did you press that apple thing?

980
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,913
Wait! Hansel!

981
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:25,999
Let's not lose our cool. Then
we're no better than the machine.

982
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,920
It's almost 7::00.
I gotta go.

983
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:33,006
No! Derek. Der, wait.

984
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:34,925
If you go, they'll make you
kill that Eurasian dude.

985
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:38,011
I don't care, Hansel. I've never
been late for a show in my life.

986
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:40,931
I don't plan on starting now.

987
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,933
Damn it, you're right.

988
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:46,019
Do me a favor. If anything happens
to me, give this to Matilda.

989
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,983
- Oh, no.
- Please, Hansel. Take it. Please.

990
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:53,986
- Ah, man.
- Take it.

991
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:58,991
Let's just say I'll hold on
to it till you get back.

992
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:02,911
Go!

993
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:04,913
Wie're live at the Derelicte show...

994
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:08,000
where controversial designer
Jacobim Mugatu...

995
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,003
has extended the olive branch to
Malaysian Prime Minister Hassan...

996
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:13,922
making him the guest ofhonor
at tonight's show...

997
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:17,009
And starring in that show,
veteran supermodel Derek Zoolander...

998
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:23,015
Guys, what's happening?
Did you find the files?

999
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:27,019
Matilda, we've got problems...
Derek's already left for the show...

1000
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,898
No. No, he can't. We don't
even know what the tri gger is.

1001
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:32,900
He just went running out of here.
I couldn't stop him.

1002
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,986
- I'll call him on his phone.
- He doesn't have it.

1003
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:37,905
- What?
- Yeah, he doesn't have it.

1004
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:39,907
What are you talking about?
He always has it.

1005
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,993
- No, he gave it to me.
- Did you find the files?

1006
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:45,913
I don't even know what they...
What do they look like?

1007
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:46,914
They're in the computer.

1008
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:50,000
They're in the computer?

1009
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,003
Yeah, they're definitely in there...
I don't know how he labeled them...

1010
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:54,922
- I got it.
- You gotta figure it out...

1011
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:54,922
- I got it.
- You gotta figure it out...

1012
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:58,008
We're running out of time.
Find them and meet me at the show.

1013
01:10:59,009 --> 01:11:02,012
Roger.

1014
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:03,931
In the computer.

1015
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:07,017
It's so simple.

1016
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:10,020
Hey, I just cut up
a couple of canta loupe halves...

1017
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,897
with some cottage cheese,
if you're hungry.

1018
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,983
Not the right time.
I need to figure out this trigger...

1019
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:16,902
before Derek kills
the Malaysian prime minister.

1020
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,988
You just seem a little tense.
I was trying to help you relax.

1021
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:22,991
Relax? The last thing I need
to do right now is rela...

1022
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,913
- That's it.
- Let's go, people!

1023
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:30,999
Let's go! Vagrants and whores,
you're wanted in Makeup!

1024
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:32,918
Runaways and street hustlers,
you're next!

1025
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:36,004
- You had us worried, Derek.
- Everything's cool.

1026
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:40,008
- I'm really psyched for the show.
- Good.

1027
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:43,011
Just remember, relax.

1028
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:45,931
Two minutes, Derek.

1029
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:49,017
Ah, there he is.

1030
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:52,020
I just want to wish you good luck.

1031
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,898
Don't you mean "good-bye"?

1032
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:57,985
What are you talking...

1033
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:02,906
I know it was you, Maury.

1034
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,908
I know it was you...

1035
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,910
and it breaks my heart.

1036
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:09,997
Derek, I don't know
what you're talking...

1037
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:15,002
Derek, I'm...

1038
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:20,007
I'm sorry.

1039
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:29,016
Glad you could join us, Kmart.

1040
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:30,934
Lucky for you,
there is no dress code.

1041
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:32,936
Lucky for you,
there is no dress code.

1042
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,897
I am vile spew...

1043
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,983
ofthe wretched masses...

1044
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:40,986
I am really, really dirty...

1045
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:45,991
I am Derelicte!

1046
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:02,007
You make me sick
to my stomach, Jaco.

1047
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:05,928
It'll all be over soon.

1048
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:09,014
Derek Zoolander will be dead,
and you'll be fine.

1049
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,933
You always are.

1050
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:14,019
Come on, Derek. You're on.

1051
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,023
Break a leg, Derek.

1052
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:53,016
It's "Relax"!

1053
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:56,019
I'm fine.
I've done this a thousand times.

1054
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,023
The trigger! It's "Re"...

1055
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:12,995
Concentrate, Derelicte...

1056
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:15,998
Do not be distracted
by the beautiful celebrities...

1057
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:20,002
Celebrities...

1058
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:29,011
Do what you've been trained to do,
and kill the prime minister!

1059
01:14:43,984 --> 01:14:46,987
J ust do it al ready!

1060
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:57,998
I got your back!

1061
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:01,001
What?

1062
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:02,920
It's that damn Hansel!

1063
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:06,006
He's so hot ri ght now!

1064
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,009
Popping and locking, fool!

1065
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:14,014
They're break-dance fighting.

1066
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:20,998
Derek Zoolander just tried to kill
the prime minister of Malaysia.

1067
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,003
That's bullshit!
Listen up, everyone.

1068
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:27,921
Mugatu's a dick!

1069
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:31,008
He tried to brainwash Derek
to kill the Claymation dude.

1070
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:36,013
That's a lie! Zoolander snapped
because he's over the hill!

1071
01:16:37,014 --> 01:16:38,932
He knew his career was over,
and he couldn't face it.

1072
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:42,019
No way. We got 30 years of files
right here in this computer!

1073
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,899
They're gonna bring you down!

1074
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:47,900
Oh, no.

1075
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:50,986
Down!

1076
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,908
Where did all the files go?

1077
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:58,994
Ha! I'm taking you out!

1078
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:01,997
- Yo, taste my pain, bitch!
- Huh?

1079
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:09,004
- Yes!
- Deal with that!

1080
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:16,011
You don't have the guts, Kmart!

1081
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,930
Wanna bet? And by the way...

1082
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:19,932
you were wrong about my outfit.

1083
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:23,018
It's the Cheryl Ladd Collection,
and I got it at J.C. Penney.

1084
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:27,022
On sale.

1085
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:33,987
Jig's up, Mugatu.
Everything they're saying is true.

1086
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:36,990
I've been in on it for 30 years.

1087
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,909
What are you doing, Ballstein?

1088
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:41,995
I'm done,Jaco. I got a prostate
the size of a honeydew...

1089
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:43,914
and a head full of bad memories.

1090
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,916
It's time to set things straight.

1091
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:49,002
You have no evidence.
Han-stupid destroyed everything.

1092
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:54,007
I got two words foryou, sugar...
Zip disk.

1093
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:57,010
The whole thing is in my den
in Long Island.

1094
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:00,013
I can have that evidence here
in 20 minutes.

1095
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:01,932
- That a boy, Maury.
- Hold on a second.

1096
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:05,018
I'm afraid of the radiation.

1097
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,897
Sheila, honey, it's me. Listen.

1098
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:11,984
I need you to bring that Zip disk
in the den down to the fashion show.

1099
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:17,990
I don't care
what the traffic is like.

1100
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:20,993
Take the goddamn service road
and get off before the bridge.

1101
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:24,997
So put it in one of those
Tupperware containers...

1102
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:28,000
and I'll heat it up in
the microwave when I get home.

1103
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,003
For Christ's sake, it's a casserole,
Sheila! It'll stay!

1104
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:33,922
Shut up!

1105
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:35,924
Enough already, Ballstein!

1106
01:18:36,008 --> 01:18:39,011
Who cares about
Derek Zoolander anyway?

1107
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:42,014
The man has only one look,
for Christ's sake!

1108
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:45,017
Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre?

1109
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:48,020
They're the same face!

1110
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:51,023
Doesn't anyone notice this?
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

1111
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:56,987
I invented the piano key necktie!

1112
01:18:56,987 --> 01:18:59,990
I invented it!

1113
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,909
What have you done, Derek? Nothing!

1114
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:04,995
You've done nothing! Nothing!

1115
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:08,999
And I will be a monkey's uncle
if I have you ruin this for me!

1116
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,003
Because if you can't
get the job done, then I will!

1117
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:17,007
Die, you wage-hiking scum!

1118
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,929
One look?

1119
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:25,015
One look? I don't think so!

1120
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,905
There it is!

1121
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,907
Magnum!

1122
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,909
Holy moly.

1123
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:46,995
Yeah, baby!
That's what I've been waiting for!

1124
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:49,998
Dear God.

1125
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:53,001
It's beautiful.

1126
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:08,016
Yeah!

1127
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,899
That's my kid.

1128
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:17,901
That's my son.

1129
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:18,902
That's my son.

1130
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,989
Whoa! Yeah!

1131
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,995
I love that kid.
Dumb as a stump, but I love him.

1132
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,914
Oh, Derek, you did it!
That was amazing!

1133
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:34,001
I know. I turned left!

1134
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:37,004
Yeah, that too. But you saved
the prime minister of Malaysia!

1135
01:20:38,005 --> 01:20:41,008
Oh, right. Cool.

1136
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:44,011
Thank you, Derek Zoolander,
for saving my life.

1137
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:13,999

1148
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:42,903
What are you gonna do?

1149
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:45,989
Screw him! Hold out for more!

1150

1154
01:21:55,999 --> 01:21:59,002
than just being really,
really, really good-looking.

1155
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:00,921
- Right, kids?
- Right!

1156
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:02,923
And cut!

1157
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:06,009
- Looks great. I think we got it.
- All right, Mitch. Thanks.

1158
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:09,012
- All right! That's a wrap!
- Hey, Hansel.

1159
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:12,015
I'm gonna take these kids over
to the George Washington Bridge...

1160
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:13,934
give them a little lesson
in base jumping.

1161
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:17,020
- Catch you at the teacher's lounge?
- All right.

1162
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:20,023
All right, guys. Last one to the
helicopter's a rotten egg. Let's go!

1163
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:25,988
- There's Daddy! Hi.
- Hey.

1164
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:27,906
- How's Derek, Jr.?
- He's great.

1165
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,908
Guess what.
He made his first look today.

1166
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:32,995
- Really?
- You wanna show Daddy your look?

1167
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:40,919
Wow.

1168
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:44,006
- Wanna hang out for story hour?
- Great. Yeah. Let's go.

1169
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:47,009
- Hey, who wants to hear a story?
- Yeah!
