1
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,600
[ Woman ] Do you know
the expression "a man's man" ?

2
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,770
A man's man
is the leader of the pack.

3
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,780
The kind of man other men
look up to, admire and emulate.

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,740
A man's man
is the kind of man who...

5
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,370
[ Chuckles ] just doesn't get
what women are about.

6
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,870
Nick, my ex-husband,
is the ultimate man's man.

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
I probably never
should have married him.

8
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
I don't think he understood
a thing about me.

9
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,260
So, this is Nick Marshall's office.
Wanna peek ?

10
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,300
Don't worry.
He never gets in before 10:00.

11
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,180
He'll send you on more errands than
anyone in the entire company...

12
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,180
'cause he can't do
anything for himself.

13
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,180
He's like this total bachelor and the least
politically correct guy in the universe.

14
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,520
He's the king of all
the T&A ads we do.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,770
You want babes in bikinis ?
He's your man.

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,400
My dad ? How can I
best describe him ?

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,530
He's always been...
like an uncle to me.

18
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,780
Yeah, Uncle Dad.

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,030
Although,
Nick was a charmer.

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,290
Completely irresistible
at first,

21
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,130
which feeds into
the whole "man's man" thing.

22
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,130
You know about
Nick's mother, right ?

23
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,920
Because once you understand
about Nick's mother,

24
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,300
you understand Nick.

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,930
[ Woman ] Nick was actually
born and raised in Las Vegas.

26
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,060
Nick's mother was a real,
honest-to-God Las Vegas showgirl.

27
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,900
When other boys were outside
riding their bikes and playing ball,

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,320
Nick was backstage
hanging with the girls.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
He was their mascot,
their little pet.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
They couldn't get enough
of those baby blues.

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
- Bang ! Bang !
- [ Laughs ]

32
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,500
If you ask me, I'd say Nick's
mother just about killed it...

33
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,840
for every woman
Nick would ever meet.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,010
She had a lot of sugar daddies
in her life,

35
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,890
but only one true love--

36
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,720
the boy
with the family jewels.

37
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,770
17, 18, 19, 20.
Let me see that, kid.

38
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,770
And since Nick
didn't have a father,

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,400
his mom made sure he was always
surrounded by strong male role models.

40
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,400
- Come here, huh ?
- [ Screams ]

41
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,160
- Men her little boy could really look up to.
- Now you're ready, huh ?

42
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,660
Keep countin', kid.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,410
There was nothing normal about
the way Nick Marshall was raised.

44
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,500
So, what can you expect ?

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,840
You don't have to be Freud
to figure out...

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,050
this was one cockeyed way
to enter the world.

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,910
[ Groaning ]

48
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,460
Oh !

49
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,630
Don't you ever knock ?

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,260
It's almost 10:00. You gotta go
to work, and I gotta vacuum in here.

51
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,090
And don't forget - Another one
who wears vanilla perfume.

52
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,260
Don't you know any women
who don't want to smell like candy ?

53
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,970
- Toss me my lighter, could you babe ?
- Babe ?

54
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,180
What am I,
a little pig ?

55
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,390
I don't have time
to make you no onion bagel,

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,400
so please do not start
to beg, okay ?

57
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,020
And just for the record, I don't like
finding these things in your sofa.

58
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,530
What kind of woman
wears underwear like this ?

59
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,860
Hey, my mother wore
underwear like that, alright?

60
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,030
Just put them somewhere,
will you, babe ?

61
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,160
Well, "babe" is gonna put it
in the trash where it belongs.

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,160
- So, your mother should excuse me.
- [ Sighs ]

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,370
Did you ever consider dating
a woman who wears real underwear?

64
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,880
You know, the kind that covers the entire
bottom the way it's supposed to ?

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,790
- No. But if I ever do, should I give you a call ?
- Oh !

66
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,670
I'm gonna go clean
the kitchen.

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
You couldn't toast me
a little bagel, could you ?

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,050
Light cream cheese, tomatoes.
Capers if we have any.

69
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,010
Please! Come on.
You know I can't think on an empty stomach.

70
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,350
Okay. All right. But only because
you didn't call me that pig name.

71
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,390
Okay, you got it, babe.

72
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,490
Mr. Marshall,
how are you doing today ?

73
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,950
- I'm fit as a dancing bear.
- I'll get that cab for you.

74
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,780
- [ Whistles ]
- That's some set of pipes you got.

75
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,700
- You have an excellent day, sir.
- And you.

76
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,170
At ease.

77
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,850
- [ Gasps ]
- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry !

78
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,810
I absolutely
did not mean to do that.

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,810
- Here. Let me get that for you.
- It's okay.

80
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,980
No, I'm mortified.
I can see your hands are full.

81
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,280
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Let me get the door.

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
- [ Giggles ] Thank you.
- Thank you.

Halfcup, grande, nonfat,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

85
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,080
"Halfcaff", grande, nonfat,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,620
- So, when do you find out ?
- Um, today, I think.

87
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,290
Unless I didn't get it, and then
I will just never find out.

88
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm sure I didn't get it. They were
looking for an "earth mother" type.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,630
I overheard the director
say I was more space cadet.

90
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,140
I'm an actress.
I can be whatever you want.

91
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,640
- Is that true, can you ?
- Oh, better be true.

92
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,470
Otherwise, I'm stuck playing ditsy
coffee shop girl the rest of my life.

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,690
Thank you.
Hon ? Thanks.

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,980
Oh ! Hi, Nick. Hi.

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,190
Oh, Lola, my love. When are you
gonna let me buy you dinner ?

96
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,820
Nick, I don't know why you don't
believe me. I'm not your type.

97
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,160
Trust me on this one. Cappuccino,
extra foam. Tall or grande ?

98
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,200
Grande. Or at least
I like to think so.

99
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,290
- Next.
- You know, rumor has it...

100
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,830
I'm getting some really
big news at work today.

101

Why don't you at least come out with me.
Celebrate. I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

102
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,130
Memo to you:
I work in a coffee shop.

Hi. What can I get you ?

104
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,340
- Hi. I'll take--
- Want me to stop asking you out ?

105
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,340
Sorry. This will
just take a sec.

106
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,260
Because, Lola,
give me the word and I'll stop.

107
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,890
Yes, I'm gonna give you the word
because I'm an actress.

108
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,310
Or at least I'm trying to be one.
I'm trying to concentrate on that.

109
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,480
So, you know, it would be
a good thing, if you wouldn't mind,

110
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,480
to stop asking me out !

Honey, you seem
so stressed.

112
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,990
I am stressed.
I have a lot on my plate.

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,030
So, let's not talk
about this now.

114

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,450
- Okay, that would be good.
- So, that's a date ?

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,830
It's a date.

Good morning, Sloane-Curtis.

- What's the dirt ?
- I was at breakfast this morning--

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
- Hey, Norm ! You winning ?
- Of course.

123
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,220
I heard Miller's shopping around,
looking for a new agency.

124
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,230
Miller Lite. I know.
I'm all over it.

Also, I heard Darcy McGuire left
B.B.D. & O. Good morning, Angela.

- You're kidding. Left or was fired ?
- I don't know.

Everyone there
is thrilled to get rid of her.

Well, so much for
edgy female vision.

129
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,200
So, that girl we met
last night at the club,

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,490
nothing happened after
you put her in the cab, right ?

131
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,790
It did ?
Something happened ?

132
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,870
But she said she had to
be in bed early.

133
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,670
I had her in bed by 11:00.
Or was it quarter to ?

134
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,670
You - You're like a genius,
you know that ?

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,380
What can I tell you, buddy ? I'm
blessed. And today is my lucky day.

136
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,550
Not only is my ex-wife Gigi remarrying--
right now, as a matter of fact--

137
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,220
but Wanamaker called me himself,
wanted to see me first thing.

138
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,890
- Called twice to confirm.
- Call me when he makes it official.

139
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,850
It's not gonna be as easy to suck up
to "creative director", you know.

140
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,020
Not to worry. I'll make us a lunch
rez at the Drake to celebrate.

141

Don't count your chickens,

Do you know the difference
between a wife and a job ?

- What is it ?
- After ten years, job still sucks.

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,630
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
That's not a good idea, no.

149
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
- Oh, Mr. Marshall, hi.
- Hey.

150
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,640
I put the story boards on your desk.
Picked up your shoes from Barney's.

151
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,640
Got your glasses fixed.
There was no charge.

152
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,640
This morning's staff meeting
was canceled.

153
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,640
And I got your cigarettes.
They're next to your laptop.

154
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,690
This morning's staff meeting
was canceled.

155
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,440
- That's what I was told.
- Hmm.

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,570
Good morning, girls.
[ Chuckling ]

157
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,860
Good afternoon, sire.

158
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,910
Hey, anybody know why
the staff meeting was canceled ?

159
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,910
Nobody called us.

160
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,790
Oh, but Mr. Wanamaker wants
to see you as soon as you get in,

161
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,120
which I told his office
was 15 minutes ago.

162
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,210
- I know.
- You couldn't show up on time ?

163
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,420
You know you're being promoted.
But you look very sharp, by the way.

164
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,420
- Thank you.
- Like a creative director.

165
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,800
- Very distinguished.
- [ Exhales Deeply ]

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,090
You able to handle yourselves
on the 44th floor ? Be truthful now.

167
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,550
Are you kidding ?
We were made for the 44th floor.

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Now, get up there already,
so we can break out the bubbly.

169
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,100
- Don't wait up.
- [ Both ] Don't wait up.

170
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,850
- He's so adorable.
- He says the cutest things.

171
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,320
Boy.

172
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,490
Sorry, buddy. I was in the board
meeting that would never end.

173
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,740
- Have you been here long ?
- A couple minutes. That's all.

174
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,160
Jess, can I get a cup of de-caf
and a couple Tylenol?

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,120
And see if we got any Echinacea.
And I need some club soda.

176
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,330
I got something on my tie.
Know what ?Just get me another tie.

177
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,670
I saw the mock-ups you did for
Johnny Walker. They're fantastic.

178
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,970
Oh, that's my job, Dan.

179
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,390
So, you know I'm not great
at making speeches,

180
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,470
especially when I haven't
got you to write them for me.

181
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,060
So, I'll do my best. I've been
in this racket over 30 years.

182
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,190
Let me tell you something,
it doesn't get any easier.

183
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,020
As a matter of fact,
it gets harder and harder.

184
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,020
The '80s
were our glory days.

185
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,110
They were all about
alcohol, tobacco and cars.

186
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,700
I felt like
I was on top of my game.

187
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,740
And then in the '90s, men stopped
dominating how dollars were spent,

188
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,790
and we lost our compass.

189
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,920
Women between 16 and 24 are
the fastest-growing consumer group.

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,090
Girls who were born in the mid-'80s
control our advertising dollars.

191
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,010
Sorry. No Echinacea.
Hi, Nick.

192
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,630
- Hey.
- Red or lavender?

193
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,510
Red. No, no, lavender.
That's good.

194
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,270
Lavender's good. While we've been
shooting beer commercials...

195
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,850
with the Swedish bikini team,
the industry has been transformed.

196
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,770
We were the agency in town
ten years ago.

197
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,650
Now we're struggling
to be third.

198
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,740
If we don't evolve and think
beyond our natural ability,

199
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,360
we're gonna go down.

200
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,280
"Think beyond our natural -"
I'm not quite clear what you mean.

201
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,750
What do you know
about Darcy McGuire ?

202
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,710
Oh, hey, I heard on the whisper
she just left B.B.D. & O.

203
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,920
I never met the woman, but
I hear she's a real man-eater.

204
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,550
She won that Cleo last year we
should have won for the add about--

205
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,590
Oh, yeah, right.
That was her ? I forgot about that.

206
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,050
Yeah, I wish I had. Oh, boy, I hear
she is a bitch on wheels.

207
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,100
- That's very funny.
- Yeah, why ?

208
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,980
[ Stammers ]
'Cause I just hired her.

209
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,110
To do what ?

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,900
You know I love you, Nick,
but it's a woman's world out there.

211
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,490
Getting into a women's psyche
is not exactly your strong suit.

212
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,830
You can get into their pants
better than anybody on Earth,

213
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,870
but their psyche
is a whole other ball game.

214
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,040
You hired Darcy McGuire
to do what ?

215
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,040
I know she hasn't done it totally on her own yet,
but somebody was gonna grab her.

216
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,340
And she's smart, Nick.
She's very smart.

217
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,800
You made her creative director,
didn't you ?

218
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm sorry, buddy. This isn't easy, but I got
the board breathing down my neck.

219
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,430
She's coming in this afternoon.
You'll meet her.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,850
- Come on. Roll with this.
- [ Coughs ]

221
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,860
Work with her because she's got what
I need to keep this place afloat.

222
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,780
She's got what you need,
meaning she's a woman.

223
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,900
You know how we can
compete with that ?

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,120
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming.

[ Women Scream ]

226
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,580
Not so fast, girls.
Put it on ice.

227
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,880
We'll break it out soon.

228
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,550
We're not moving
to the 44th floor ?

229
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,970
Not today.

230
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,300
- Oh.
- Okay, Gigi, one more.

231
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,970
Gigi, your ex is here.

232
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,690
Honey, you look like...
$48 million.

233
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,200
Thank you.

234
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,320
- May I kiss the bride ?
- Sure.

235
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,910
- Nick.
- Nick ! Ted.

236
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,040
Congratulations, Ted.
You're a lucky man.

237
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,080
Well, thanks.
I happen to agree.

238
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,960
So, you're going on a cruise.
Two weeks, huh ?

239
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,340
Well, actually, the cruise
is just the last week.

240
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,630
Alexandra has an itinerary,
and I faxed one...

241
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,930
to your office yesterday,
to your apartment last week.

242
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,300
Ted's office has one,
as does the school.

Hey, here she is. Pretty in pink.
So, two whole weeks together?

246
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,650
- Yeah, how you gonna handle it ?
- I'm gonna love it.

247
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,990
You can take care of your old man.
Cook for me. Get my slippers.

248
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,120
- Yeah, that'll be happening.
- Alexandra has a boyfriend now.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,910
- Mom !
- I'm just telling him so he won't be surprised.

250
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,160
You have a boyfriend ?
You're only 13 years old.

Am I ?
I thought I was 15.

We're gonna be fine.

- Okay if I meet Dad at his place ?
- Is it all right ?

- Yeah, well, I -
- What time ?

- 7:30.
- Okay.

- Bye, Mom.
- Oh, honey. I'm gonna miss you.

- Thanks.

- My goodness. Everybody showed up.
- Darcy, how are you ?

- Nice to see you. Hi !
- Pleasant surprise.

- God, what a small world.
- Welcome aboard.

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm so glad to meet you.

Hi. I'm Nick Marshall.

Oh, I've heard
a lot about you, Nick.

- Don't worry, can't all be true.

Let's hope not.

to meet Darcy McGuire.

283
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,100
- [ Applause ]
- Darcy's extraordinary reputation...

284
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,440
as a leader in the field
precedes her.

285
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,440
At B.B.D. & O., Darcy led
a creative team...

286
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,490
that snagged $500 million
in new business wins.

287
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,570
And that was
just last year alone.

288
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,620
Here at Sloane-Curtis, we've prided
ourselves on our strategic thinking.

289
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,000
Now it's time for us to step up
and once again prove ourselves creatively...

290
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,000
in the marketplace.

291
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,580
And I'm thrilled that Darcy
has consented to move across town,

292
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,840
join our team and lead us
into the 21st century.

Let me start off by saying
the feeling is mutual.

I am absolutely
thrilled to be here.

When I first started
in this business, it was my dream...

to work at Sloane-Curtis.

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,190

for a job here twice.

But it was B.B.D. & O.
that offered me a home.

303
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,580
And what I learned there
was that any success I had...

304
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,620
was a direct result of the team
of people that I work with.

305
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,040
I know that two heads
are better than one.

are better than two.

307

and our hearts into this company,

we will deliver,
I know that.

How are we gonna turn
this company around ?

317

When Sears decided to go
after women in their advertising...

318
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,870
and said, "Come see
the softer side of Sears",

319
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880

went up 30%.

320
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,750
Thirty percent.
That's huge.

321

Female-driven advertising
totaled $40 billion last year.

322

And Sloane-Curtis' share
of that was ?

323
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,770
Zero.

324
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,390
If you want to sell
an anti-wrinkle cream...

to a woman - forgive me-

you bring your business.

And we can't afford to not have
a piece of a $40 billion pie.

a little kit for everybody.

00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,770
Let me make sure I completely
understand what it is you're saying.

747
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,360
[ Sighs ]
All right. All right.

748
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,950
I hear what women think.

749
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,490
Yeah. You know,
Mr. Marshall,

750
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,830
this kind of imaginary
displacement scenario...

751
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,000
- I'm not imag--
- really isn't my thing.

752
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,380
I do, however, have a very good
friend over at University Hospital,

753
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,630
who specializes in male menopause
and testosterone depletion.

754
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:27,300
She's fabulous. I think what I'll do
is just give her a ring...

755
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,390
and send you over there.

756
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,850
Why did I answer my door ? I was so
into buying that lamp on eBay.

757
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,810
- How much was it going for ?
- How much was what going for ?

758
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,060
The lamp on eBay.

759
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,280
Oh, I see. That's good.
Very clever.

760
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,700
- Dr. Skolnick, please.
- All right, you don't believe me. Well then, try another one.

761
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,080
Go on. Pick a number.
Give it a whirl. Any number.

762
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,120
Okay. A number
between one and--

763
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,670
- A million. Why not ?
- One and a million.

764
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,170
All right.

765
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,170
Mm.

Wanna make a decision here ?

768
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,640
- Oy vay!
- Oh, you can say that again.

769
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,850
- I didn't say anything.
- I know, but that does not mean I that didn't hear it.

770
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:21,560
Okay. Okay. Let's say--
Let's say I do believe you.

771
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,280
- Yeah.
- That you-- you can hear what women think.

772

Even though I'm a grown
woman of... [ Thinking ] 51.

- 47.
- Oh, my lips are sealed.

774
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,700
Holy crap !
Oh, forgive me.

775
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,830
- That's all right.
- But this is phenomenal.

776
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,580
- You can hear inside my head.
- Yes.

777
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,090
Why would you want to get rid
of such a brilliant gift ?

778
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,090
Well, for starters,

779
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,050
almost every woman I know
thinks I'm an asshole.

780
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,470
- What I thought when I first met you.
- Doc, give me a break here.

781
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,390
Mr. Marshall, you might
find this a little unorthodox,

782
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,310
but would you mind
awfully if I smoked ?

783
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,770
- No, no, I understand.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

[ Coughs ]

785
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,240
Let's try to look at
the up side of this, shall we ?

786
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,250
You know, Freud died at age 83
still asking one question,

787
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,250
"What do women want ?"

788
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:27,500
Wouldn't it be strange and wonderful
if you were the one man on Earth...

789
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,090
finally able to answer
that question ?

790
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,680
Listen to me, Nick.
Something extraordinary...

791
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,220
and I think miraculous
has happened to you.

792
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,560
My advice is
you must learn from this.

793
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,890
You know, there isn't
a single woman that I treat...

794
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,480
that doesn't wish her man
understood her better.

795
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,480
If men are from Mars and women are
from Venus and you speak Venusian,

796
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:50,740
the world can be yours.

797
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,780
I don't know how this
happened to you or why,

798
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,620
but you may just be
the luckiest man on Earth.

799
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,330
Imagine the possibilities.

800
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,790
If you know
what women want,

801
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,790
you can rule.

[ No Audible Dialogue ]

[ Thinking ] Hubba-hubba, here he
comes, looking awfully good today.

804
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,740
And I haven't had sex
in four months. Okay, six.

Why did I tell him to stop
asking me out ? I'm an idiot!

- Idiot ! Idiot !

Hey, Nick, how's it going ?

Lola, my love.
I can't take no for an answer.

- About what ?
- About what ?

810
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,100
[ Chuckles ]
About us.

811
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:04,350
Just don't hurt me, Nick.
I've been hurt too many times.

812
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,770
I know how hard it is
to go out with someone new.

813
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,360
I mean, there's always
that fear of,

814
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,860
well, getting hurt.

815
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,950
- At least that's how I feel inside.
- You do, really ?

- [ Sighs ] All the time.
- Me, too, all the time.

817
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,950
So, let's just take it slow
and see how it goes.

818
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,660
Slow is good.

819
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,670
Slow is really good.

- Yeah.
- Are you free tonight ?

821

So, you don't think I'm gay ?
You're saying you never said that ?

822
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,000
- Right, I never said that.
- But that doesn't mean you didn't think it.

Is it the hair ? The highlights
happen to be natural.

- And you don't think I'm overpaid either, right?

Hi, Annie.
How's the boyfriend in Israel ?

Oh, by the way, I want to thank you
for picking up that wine.

00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,120
That's above and beyond.
I appreciate it so much. Thank you.

some water
or any kind of beverage ?

No, but thank you. If I'm thirsty,
I know where the coffee room is.

That's right, guys, don't help.
Just walk right past me.

Well, you've been here five minutes.
Looks like you've been here a year.

Oh, yeah. I'm compulsive.
It's a problem.

feel like he's checking me out ?

up his sleeve.

- Great photographs.
- No clue they're all Margaret Bourke-White.

ask you the same thing.

It's starting slow.

Yeah, right.

Well, you know, I don't
wanna beat around the bush.

- Uh, yes--
- Excuse me.

As I was saying,

869
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,790
I know nothing whatsoever about the products
you're going for personally,

870
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,420
but I do believe
I can sell anything...

871
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,130
once I know
what the buyer's needs are.

872
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,710
And what I'd really like,
with your kind indulgence of course,

873
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,050
is to go after
that really big fish.

874
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,130
I mean, the one
you really wanna land.

875
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,140
I'll learn what I need to know,
and I'll reel them in for us.

876
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,050
No, actually, I think
I'll reel them in for us.

877
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,020
That is, unless you're going after
something in particular yourself.

878
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,020
No. It's just that there're several
big fish out there at the moment.

879
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,560
Oh, yeah ?
Well, what's your biggest fish ?

880
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,610
To your mind,
who's your whale ?

00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,150
Um, Nike--
women's division ?

882
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,490
You heard
they were shopping ?

883
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,570
I got wind of it.

884
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,450
- Amazing. I heard no one knew.
- You knew.

885
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,500
- I heard no one else knew.
- It's okay if I know what you know.

886
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,670
- We're on the same team. Besides,
- Yeah.

887
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,790
I heard someone say once
two heads are better than one--

888
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,300
- Oh, you were listening.
- More than you know.

889
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,130
Okay,
here's what I heard.

890
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,720
Nike is shopping,
quietly.

891
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,470
But if they make a change,
it's gonna happen fast.

892
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,770
Now, you know this is
a tough one for us to get.

893
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,350
It would be a tough one for anybody
to get, but if we got it--

894
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,640
- That's all we'd need.
- I hear you.

895
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,940
So, what do they want
exactly ?

896
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,030
They wanna empower women.

897
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,530
- What ?
- I'm sorry.

898
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,200
- That won't work.
- No, okay. I'm sorry.

899
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,200
- I understand. Go on.
- Listen, they wanna get inside women's heads...

900
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,830
and reach them
on a very real level.

901
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:39,500
Now don't take this the wrong way, but yesterday
you got jumpy talking about lipstick.

902
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,010
- I know.
- Nike is state-of-the-art hard-core woman power.

903
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,630
You sure you wanna
go after this one ?

904
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,340
You get 'em here in two weeks,
I'll be ready.

905
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,350
[ Chuckles ]
This guy is kind of exciting.

906
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,350
Hey !
Glad I caught you both.

907
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,180
- You got a minute ?
- Sure.

908
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,310
I want you to look at these boards
for U.S. Air before they come by.

909
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,520
- Right.
- It feels like something's missing.

910
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,570
Hmm. I don't like
the graphics.

911
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,820
Feels a bit parochial.

912
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,820
Maybe it should be
in black and white.

913
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:12,700
- What do you think, Nick ?
- I don't know who you've had,

914
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,290
but, I don't know,
it seems kind of--

915
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,750
What's the word ?
Parochial to me.

916
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,080
Um, what do you think,
Darcy ?

917
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,880
I totally agree,
especially about the graphics.

918
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,510
They're parochial.
It's so funny you just said that.

919
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,510
Yeah ?

920
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,800
Why don't you get them to
try it in black and white ?

921
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,850
Might punch it up
a little.

922
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:36,060
What ?
Did you say something ?

923
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,440
No. I just swear I was
thinking the exact same thing.

924

[ Weak Chuckle ]
Were you ?

925
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,190
Black and white could really help.
Good idea, Nick.

926
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,450
Good idea, Nick ?
Speak up. Quick.

927
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,570
- Say something before he leaves.
- Uh, Dan ?

928
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,080
Want me to take another look at the boards ? Once
they have another stab at it, give me a buzz.

929
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,250
- I will. Thanks, buddy.
- Dan ?

930
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,790
In case they find Nick's idea
too retro, which they might--

931
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,420
- Oh, yeah.
- they may think it's old-fashioned--

932
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,800
I'd be ready with some--
maybe a dot com kind of thing ?

933
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,970
Maybe there's something about getting
on-line and being on-line at the airport.

934
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,260
No, I think we're fine, really.
Really, we're good.

935
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,890
- I like Nick's fix on this.
- Great.

936
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,310
Hey, you wanna come by later ? I got
a box of new Cubans, just came in.

937
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,610
- Great.
- Cool.

938
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,270
You smoke cigars ?

No.

940
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,610
You know, your office
is looking really snazzy.

941

- I love the red.
- Thanks.

Mr. Marshall,
your daughter's on line one.

- Oh. I'm sorry. Would you mind--
- Oh. Here you go.

He has a daughter ?
Didn't picture that. How old ?

945
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,250
She's 15. She's staying with me
while her mom's away.

946
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,300
- He's married ?
- Away on her honeymoon.

947

- Oh.
- Alex, hi.

948
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,470
Uh-huh. Oh, sure, honey.
No, that's great.

"Honey" ?
Who are you trying to impress ?

950
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,010
Okay, look, I'm gonna go out
with my friends after school.

951
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,970
Then can I bring them back to your
place, or will you freak out again ?

952
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,100
No, no, no, no.
No problem. Whatever you want.

953
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,150
- What time are you gonna be home ?
- Wait for me !

954

- I don't know. I gotta go.
- 8:00's fine.

I love you too.
Bye, sweetie.

Total shocker.
He's like a nice guy.

- Oh, of course.

- Yeah. Got a boyfriend that's 18.

959

- And you hate that, right ?
- [ Groans ] Hate it.

960
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,040
Yeah. But she digs him,
and he's invited her to the prom.

961
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,880
- That's a big deal, I guess.
- Going to the prom is mostly about the dress.

962
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,010
- You know that, right ? Oh, yeah.
- Is it ?

963
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:36,430
Once you got the dress handled,
it's all downhill from there.

964
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,140
This feels like a date. Why did I
go into all that ? He needs to go.

965

Well, I'm out of here.

Do some research downtown,
get inside women's heads.

Oh, I like that one, but it says
you can't wear it if you have hips.

But I'll be home early. Hey,
why don't you guys order a pizza ?

Oh, that is so sweet.

I wish my dad would do
something like that.

up for it by taking you shopping.

I mean, it's a pretty
important thing, you know ?

He must be stoned.
Fine.

And what the hell.
Let's go crazy.

I can't believe I asked him up.
Am I ready for him to come up ?

1012

If I sleep with him, he'll think
I'm a slut and never call me again.

1013
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,790
Or he'll call me all the time 'cause
he'll think he can get it whenever he wants.

Oh, what's the difference ?
He's so incredible !

- So, what do you think ?
- Well, I--

I'll only come up
if you really want me to.

- Yeah, it might help.

01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,610
Thinking of calling you.

1335
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,570
Obviously,
I did call you.

1336
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:49,030
Oh, no, that's all right.
I, uh--

1337
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,030
I was thinking about you too.

1338
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,140
Well, here's to another
great idea.

1339
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,350
- What, "Let's meet for a drink" ?
- Yes.

1340
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:19,520
- Yeah ?
- That's exactly what I wanted to say.

1341
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,730
Sometimes I think
you're a bit of a mind reader.

1342
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:25,110
But I don't have to be
a mind reader with you.

1343
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,110
- Hmm.
- You always say what you think.

1344
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,530
- I know. It's a curse.
- What--

1345
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,070
- Are you kidding ?
It's a relief-- an enormous relief.

1346
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,820
Do you know how rare that is,
to actually say what you think ?

1347
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:40,000
Do you have any idea how rare it is
for someone to actually like that about me ?

1348
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,460
Trust me, this has not been
a great thing in my life.

1349
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,460
My ex-husband didn't love me.
Let's just put it that way.

1350
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,550
He didn't love you ?

1351
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,550
Did I just say that ?

1352
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,550
Oh, God !
[ Laughs ]

1353
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,510
Um, I meant to say "it."
He didn't love it--

1354
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,520
that I spoke my mind.

1355
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:04,190
If you wanna know the truth,
I'm not sure he did really love me.

1356
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:07,150
- Ooh.
- There's a conversation starter.

1357
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:10,990
God. A smart person would
just get so very drunk now.

1358
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,240
How long
were you married ?

1359
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,240
A little less than a year.

1360
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,830
I've been divorced about nine
months now. We worked together.

1361
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,870
- You know that, right ?
- Oh, yeah. I knew that.

1362
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:23,870
- I heard it.
- Hmm.

1363
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,000
- What was that like ?
- It was great in the beginning.

1364
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,380
But it changed.
It became competitive.

1365
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:35,340
Suddenly, the better I did,
the worse we did.

1366
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,760
The price I pay
for being me.

1367
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,850
- I know that now. No, truly.
- [ Chuckles ]

1368
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,850
- Oh.
- No, no, it's true.

1369
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,440
Do you wanna know
all this about me ?

1370
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,440
Keep going.

1371
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,530
Well, that's why I needed
to get out there on my own,

1372
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,030
as scary as it was.

1373
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,030
I mean, not scary,
but, um--

1374
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:03,410
Well, yeah,
I was kind of scared.

1375
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,670
- Why ?
- I don't know.

1376
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,460
I guess I wasn't sure
I could do the job.

1377
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,500
I mean,
I thought I could do it,

1378
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:15,260
but I'm finding Sloane-Curtis
a much tougher place to navigate than I thought.

1379
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:19,260
I'm sorry.

1380
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,770
- I know you were up for my job.
- No.

1381
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:26,020
- I'm sorry I'm the one that got it.
- I'm-I'm not. I'm not.

1382
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,650
- I've learned a lot from you.
- Like what ?

1383
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:32,280
Like what ? For starters,
you really love what you do.

1384
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,780
- You really love what you do.
- Not as much as you do.

1385
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,950
How can you say that ?
You're so great at it.

1386
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:39,200
You're so great at it.

1387
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,080
I think Dan's even wondering
why he hired me. Really.

1388
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,710
I think the bloom
is definitely off the rose.

1389
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,960
You wanna hear something
really great ?

1390
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,960
Yeah.

1391
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,050
I just closed escrow on
my first apartment ever.

1392
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,300
Finally, I own my own place.

1393
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,560
- What? I wish I was a mind reader.
- No.

1394
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,890
I was just thinking...

1395
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,110
how men like me
can get so screwed up.

1396
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:17,490
I don't think
there are men like you.

1397
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,370
If we kissed,
would it ruin everything ?

1398
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,960
Listen to me.

1399
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,790
I think...

1400
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:32,420
you are one of
the great women.

1401
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,420
I really do.

1402
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,640
I'm sorry.

1403
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,310
But I just meant to say
thank you.

1404
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:50,850
I'm so sorry.

1405
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:25,430
Well, I, uh,
guess I'll see you...

1406
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:29,060
in, let's see,
three and a half hours.

1407
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,650
Nick, may I just say...

1408
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,900
you are an exceptionally
great kisser.

1409
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:41,530
No, I mean
really, really great.

1410
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:45,740
Well, I haven't had
this much fun making out since--

1411
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,210
I've never had
this much fun making out.

1412
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,080
Me either.

1413
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,590
- Don't let this get weird at work ?
- No.

1414
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:59,340
We have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

1415
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:03,300
We made out.
You and I made out.

1416
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:08,310
- And if I may, it was--
- Sexy as hell.

1417
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,520
God. That's just what
I was about to say.

1418
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,900
But I think I said it first,
I think.

1419
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,900
- Oh, no, you did.
- Oh.

1420
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,900
Um, well,
all right, then.

1421
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:32,040
Oh, I'm a grown woman.
Just say it.

1422
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,120
Do you want to come back
to my place ?

1423
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,630
Say it !
Do you want to come--

1424
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:38,550
Good night, Darcy.

1425
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:41,510
Good night.

1426
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,860
Good night.

1427
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:15,330
What am I doing ?

1428
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:28,970
Lola.

1429
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,980
It's okay. Okay.
Here he comes.

1430
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:37,650
- [ Lola Muttering, indistinct ]
- Lola ?

1431
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:40,570
I know I haven't
heard from you.

1432
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:43,440
Lola, how long
have you been out here ?

1433
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,450
Just a few... hours.

1434
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:48,450
Nick, you said that
you wouldn't hurt me.

1435
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,240
And then you slept with me, and then
you didn't call me for six days.

1436
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,040
So that, in the world of me,
that's torture.

1437
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,580
I mean, we have this totally
unbelievable, life-altering sex,

1438
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:00,630
and then
you just disappear.

1439
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:02,630
I mean, you-you-you
stopped drinking coffee !

1440
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:05,630
Lola, I'm so sorry.

1441
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,220
It's okay.

1442
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:10,430
It's okay, because
I figured out your little secret.

1443
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,100
- You did ?
- It's so obvious.

1444
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:15,140
How else would you know
the things that you know ?

1445
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:18,810
- It wasn't obvious to anybody else.
- Nick, come on.

1446
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,320
You're so sensitive.
You're so aware of my feelings.

1447
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,190
You're so tuned in.

1448
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,740
You talk to me like a woman,
you think like a woman.

1449
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,740
Nick ! Come on ! Admit it.
You're totally and completely gay.

1450
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,370
- I am ?
- You're not ?

1451
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:38,500
Oh ! I mean, if you're not,
you gotta tell me.

1452
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:41,630
Based on the other night--
Just put me out of my misery.

1453
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,630
Are you or aren't you ?

1454
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:46,340
Say you're gay. Then I'm not nuts.
I'm not undesirable.

1455
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:50,680
Not rejected by another guy !
Say it ! Say you're gay ! Admit it !

1456
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,140
Okay.

1457
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:01,900
I'm gay.

1458
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,480
How gay ?

1459
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,820
Oh !
I'm as gay as it gets.

1460
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,080
You're gonna make some guy
very happy someday.

1461
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,830
Oh, from your lips.

1462
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:23,340
God, I hate that
I'm crying.

1463
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:26,630
Well, look it.

1464
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:28,840
If things should ever change
in that department--

1465
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,340
- You'll be the first to know.
- You promise ?

1466
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:34,680
Oh, yeah, I promise.
Come here.

1467
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,240
Oh, boy.

1468
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:59,000
- It was very nice meeting you, Nick.
- And you.

1469
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,210
Thanks for pep talk, yes ?

1470
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,250
You two just
take care of each other.

1471
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:05,250
- And thanks for the yarmulke.
- Oh, no problem.

1472
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:08,090
- You wear it well, yes ?
- Happy trails, kids.

1473
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:11,050
- Isn't he great ?
- Darcy !

1474
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,510
I need to talk to you.

1475
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,520
Uh-oh, look at him.
I knew it. He is weird about it.

1476
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,940
This is not about last night.
It's about the Nike meeting.

1477
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,480
And I honestly believe
in my gut...

1478
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,690
- that you should make the pitch.
- Oh, God.

1479
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,780
- I guilted you into this last night.
- No, no.

1480
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,900
- It would be better if you did it.
- No, no, no.

1481
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,120
This is your baby.
You've gotta do it.

1482
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,280
I gotta go meet and greet
these folks. I'll see you in there.

1483
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:41,580
- It's not my baby.
- Yes, it is.

1484
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:50,760
I predict no one will even know I'm
gone until the files start to build.

1485
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,130
It could be days.

1486
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:57,300
And then someone
will finally ask,

1487
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:59,430
"Where's the geek in the glasses
who carries all the files ?"

1488
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:08,110
Do either of you two know what
the story is on this Erin girl ?

1489
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:10,360
- Miss Lonely Hearts ? Who knows ?
- Yeah.

1490
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,900
Ooh, I know.
She's been here two years.

1491
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:15,450
She tried to be a copywriter
but got turned down.

1492
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:18,490
- So she got stuck as a messenger.
- What fool turned her down ?

1493
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,450
You did, sire.

1494
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:24,790
Well, did I ever
meet with her at least ?

1495
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:27,630
I don't think so. As I recall,
you told me to "blow her off."

1496
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:29,790
Well, I wanna meet
with her now.

1497
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,880
The kid's got something.
She's kind of funny.

1498
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,220
This is your lucky day, pal. I just saw
the Nike group get off the elevator.

1499

All women. Your specialty.
Come on. I'll walk you up.

1500
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,470
I hate what I'm doing to Darcy.
I hate it !

1501
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,520
I'm gonna write her
a long letter, confess everything.

1502
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,520
- You're doing Darcy ? Since when ?
- No !

1503
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,520
I said I hate what
I'm doing to Darcy.

1504
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,520
- Men are stupider. It's true.
- Will you stop it ?

1505
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:51,610
- They are.
- "They" ? Are you officially a woman now ?

1506
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:54,360
Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have
screwed over the woman she loved.

1507
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,860
No, they don't think that way.
And another thing.

1508
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,950
- This thing about penis envy.
- Yeah.

1509
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:00,990
Not true. No.
They don't envy it.

1510
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,990
Half of'em
don't even like it.

1511
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,000
You know who has
penis envy ? We do.

1512
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,000
That's why we cheat
and screw up and lie,

1513
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,040
because we're all obsessed
with our own equipment.

1514
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,040
- You ready ? Okay.
- Yeah.

1515
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:13,050
Thanks.

1516
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,840
[ Nick ] You don't stand in front
of a mirror before a run...

1517
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,260
and wonder what the road
will think of your outfit.

1518
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:25,560
You don't have to listen to its
jokes and pretend they're funny.

1519
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:30,020
It would not be easier to run
if you dressed sexier.

1520
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:33,070
The road doesn't notice
if you're not wearing lipstick.

1521
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:35,530
It does not care
how old you are.

1522
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:37,530
You do not feel
uncomfortable...

1523
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,530
because you make more money
than the road.

1524
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:43,700
And you can call on the road
whenever you feel like it,

1525
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:45,910
whether it's been a day...

1526
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,290
or even a couple of hours
since your last date.

1527
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,210
The only thing
the road cares about...

1528
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,210
is that you pay it a visit
once in a while.

1529
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:59,050

Why are you not the happiest guy
in Chicago right now ?

1536
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:02,070
You just did so great.

1537
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,410
No, no, I didn't do so great.
We did so--

1538
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:07,870
No, actually,
you did so great.

1539
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,870
- You.
- You, me.

1540
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:12,290
We did great !

1541
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:15,960
Will you come with me someplace ?
I wanna show you something.

1542
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,510
- No, I have something I really need to finish.
- Please ?

1543
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,470
Please.

1544
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,480
Okay.
Here you go.

1545
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:40,110
- Come with me.
- All right.

1546
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:43,280
- Should I close my eyes or anything?
- No.

1547
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:47,410
So, you see those top
two floors right there ?

1548
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:50,120
I do.

Come here.

01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,220

It's beautiful.

What are you thinking ?

1555
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:54,430
You've got that look
you have sometimes.

1556
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:59,190
Yeah ? No. I was just wondering
when you get to move in.

- you in a beautiful gown.
- You can see all that ?

1562
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:21,420
Maybe you're naked and I'm the only
guest, but it'd still be elegant.

1563
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,630
Okay.
So this is upstairs.

1564

talk to you too. That was Nike.

that we won the account.

I gotta hand it to you. You saved
my ass. You saved the company's ass.

1584
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:45,110
Actually, Dan, I had very little
to do with saving anybody's ass.

1585
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:47,730
It's Darcy you should be thanking,

to admit when I screw up.

No, no, no, no. Dan, you did
the right thing when you hired her.

- Oh, yeah, she is.

- No, no. Not like that. No, no.

1594
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,930
Please. Look.

1595
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:17,140
I've been doing
a lot of listening lately.

1596
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,220
And I've decided...
I need to take a leave of absence.

1597
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:23,690
I need to get away from here
and get some perspective on things.

1598
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:26,860
What are you, nuts ? What is this ?
What do you mean ?

01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,230
This is the biggest account
this company has ever landed.

1600
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:31,230
Do you want me to have
nobody running the shop ?

01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,900
What are you talking about ?
Darcy's here.

For somebody who listens a lot,
you don't hear so well.

1603
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,910
I had a meeting with her today.
I sat her down.

1604
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:41,290
- We had a talk.
- Oh, Dan ! You didn't.

1605
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:44,290
- Tell me you didn't fire her.
- She didn't even put up a fight.

1606
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:46,500
- Oh, Dan, no !
- Hey, she's gone, pal.

1607
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:48,750
No, no. It's not too late.
Look, call her.

Tell her you need her back,
you made a mistake. Hire her back.

- Hey, calm down. I can't do that.
- Why ?

1610
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:56,890
Because I talked to the board and I
told them I don't need her anymore.

1611
01:40:56,970 --> 01:40:59,100
- Oh !
- They offered her a settlement.

01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:01,810

1614
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,810
Would you come out for one second ?
Let me tell you something.

1615
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:07,940
My job is to deliver you.

1616
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,070
Dan, Nike bought an idea.
It wasn't even mine.

1617
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:14,030
Every good idea that they loved
yesterday came from her.

1618
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,910
And if you don't get Darcy McGuire
back in here, and I mean pronto,

1619
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:18,950
the board is gonna be
paying you your settlement.

1620
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,030
This is all about
saving your ass, right ?

1621
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,620
Save it.

1622
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:34,050

and number as quick as possible.

- Yeah, sure.
- Where's the girl in glasses ?

1624
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:39,470
Erin ? I don't think
she's in today.

1625
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,150
- Did she call in sick ?
- I don't think so. Didn't show up.

1626
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:51,150
Oh, where does she live ?

1627
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:53,270
- Does anyone know where Erin lives ?
- [ Man ] Who's Erin ?

and-and--

he goes and meets up
with his old girlfriend...

with her.

1780
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:58,540
But you stood up for yourself. You know
how ahead of the game you are ?

1781
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:02,090
Anyway, a guy that treats you like
that and talks to you like that,

1782
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:04,630
- he's not--
- Worth my time. Yes, I know.

1783
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:08,640
- It's true. He's not.
- And he's a total game player, I hate that.

1784
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:15,270
You are so much smarter
than me.

1785
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:24,940
And look at you.

1786
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:28,280
That clown made out with a girl
with a tongue ring over you ?

1787

Honey...

1788
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,410
you look beautiful.

1789
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:42,250
Thanks.

1790
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,510
Take me home, Dad.

1791
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:46,940
What am I doing ?
She's not in the refrigerator.

1792
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:05,920
I wonder if it's too late
to go over there.

1793
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,210
No, it's not too late. It's never
too late to do the right thing.

1794
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:13,260
That's what I'll do. I'll go over
there and I'll do the right thing.

[ Intercom Buzzing ]

1796

Hello ?

1797
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:29,360
Uh, hi, it's me.
Oh, I'm glad I found you.

1798
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,280
Uh--

1799
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,410
Can I come up ?

1800
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:37,950
Darcy ?
I need to--

[ Door Buzzing ]

1802
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,460
Hey.

1803
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,750
You need to what ?
It's 1:00 in the morning.

1804
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:49,300
I need to talk to you.

1805
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:51,050
Okay.

1806
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:55,140
Thanks.

1807
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:00,470
So, you sleep here now ?

1808
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,850
I thought I might as well give it a
try before I have to sell the place.

1809
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:05,850
Sell it? You're not
selling the place.

1810
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,060
Can't afford to keep it.
I don't have a job.

1811
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:11,650
You know, you ought to try
returning some of your phone calls.

1812
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:14,490
- You got your job back.
- Oh, do I ?

1813
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:17,070
- You're a riot. You know that ?
- lt's true.

1814
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,160
Dan told me so himself.

1815
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:22,450
Why would he tell you that ? I
didn't do the job he hired me to do.

1816
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:24,500
Even I don't blame him
for firing me.

1817
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:27,790
Look, I'm, uh--
You can come on in.

1818
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:29,840
I don't have any chairs,
but if you wanna--

1819
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,960
What if I told you that...

1820
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:34,090
you did everything
that you were hired to do--

1821
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:38,430
everything-- but that
someone was sabotaging you ?

1822
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:43,640
Picking your brain,
swiping your ideas and--

1823
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:47,940
Well, you-- you never
even knew what hit you.

1824
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:51,400
- How is that possible ?
- Oh, trust me, it's possible.

1825
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,320
Well, who would do
such an awful thing ?

1826
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:58,950
I would.

1827
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,250
I was a dope
with a corner office.

1828
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:08,710
And when you came with the job
I was supposed to have,

1829
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:12,500
I mean, it didn't matter
to me that...

1830
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:15,920
you were better at it than me
or you earned it more than I did.

1831
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:20,890
As far as I was concerned, it was
mine, and I was gonna get it back.

1832
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:24,890
So I took advantage of you
in the worst possible way.

1833
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,400
Have you ever done that ?

1834
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,030
Taken the wrong road and--
No, of course you haven't.

1835
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:37,530
You wouldn't do that.
That's just--

1836
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:39,780
Somebody like me does that.

1837
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:42,580
And, uh--

1838
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:46,580
The problem with that was that while
I was digging the hole under you...

1839
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,040
I found out
all about you.

1840
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:53,040
And the more I found out...

1841
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:56,090
the more you dazzled me.

1842
01:58:58,170 --> 01:59:02,390
I mean, shook my world,
changed my life, dazzled me.

1843
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:07,520
And guys like that ex-husband
of yours, he made you feel that...

1844
01:59:08,690 --> 01:59:12,190
the price you pay
just for being you...

1845
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:14,400
is that you don't get
to have love.

1846
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:16,990
Isn't that what you were
trying to say the other night ?

1847
01:59:17,070 --> 01:59:21,910
That you weren't complete ?
That you weren't really a winner ?

Everything about you--

1849
01:59:25,290 --> 01:59:28,580
how smart you are,
how good you are--

1850
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:31,750
everything just makes me
want you even more.

1851
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:39,340
Oh, wow.
Boy.

1852
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:41,510
So it looks like I'm here
at 1:00 in the morning...

1853
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:45,510
being all heroic
trying to rescue you,

1854
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:48,270
but the truth is...

1855
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,730
I'm the one that needs
to be rescued here.

1856
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:00,150
I sure wish
I could read your mind.

1857
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:11,290
Well, I was thinking that, um,

1858
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:15,460
if everything you're saying
is true,

1859
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,630
if I really have
my job back...

1860
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:25,510
then I think you're fired.

1861
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:33,440
Well, I never-- I never really
thought about it from that angle.

1862
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:40,490
Well, not that
I don't deserve it. I-do-do--

1863
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:42,490
I'm stuttering.

1864
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:58,170
Now I feel kind of, uh,

1865
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:01,010
embarrassed that I told you
I needed to be rescued.

1866
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:04,930
But that's-that's fine.

1867
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:21,530
That's it ?

1868
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:28,910
I don't want that to be it.

1869
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,200
I don't want that
to be it at all.

1870
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:35,540
Then don't let a little thing like
me firing you stand in your way.

1871
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,420
I didn't know
what to react to first.

1872
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:45,550
Hey, news flash.

1873
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:47,550
I took the wrong road.

1874
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:52,100
What kind of knight
in shining armor would I be...

1875
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:55,190
if the man I love
needs rescuing...

1876
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:57,850
and I just let him
walk out my door ?

1877
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:07,950
My hero.
