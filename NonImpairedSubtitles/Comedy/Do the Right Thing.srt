344
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,024
You buy another beer?

00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,126

Tastes like cold pot liquor?

00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,533
All right, all right?
Butyou're askin' a lot

349
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,977
to make a man change

350
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,649
Hey! You old drunk!

351
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,187

352
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,223
about drinkin'

353
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,757
Move on?
You're blockin' myview?

354
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,593
You are ugly enough?

355
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,163
Don't stare at me?

356
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,665
The evil eye doesn't work on me?

357
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,669
Mother Sister, you been

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,638
You a drunk fool?

360
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,639
Besides that?

361
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,642
The Mayor don't bother nobody,

362
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,611
and nobody don't bother
the Mayor but you?

Hold your tongue?

367
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,778
You don't have that much love?

368
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,991
One dayyou gonna be nice to me?

369
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,993
We may both be dead and buried,

370
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,222
but you gonna be nice?

371
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,458
At least civil?

372

375
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,214
Yesterdayyou said you would?

376
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,682
Now today
you're changing your mind?

377
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,218
No, I'm not changing--

378
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,219
¿Ay, Mommy,

379
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,221
Get off of me, please!

380
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,655
I do everything foryou?

381
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,590
You can't do shit for me!

382
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,355
Yo tengo
el derecho de salirte.

383
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,796
Right, right?
You know it's not like that, Mommy?

384
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,795
I can do everything foryou,

385
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,299
but you won't do shit for me?

386
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,531

That lady makes me sick!

388
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,680
Your father makes me sick, too?

389
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,752
Everybody makes me sick?

390
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,042
Shit?

391
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,587
Your father ain't no real father?

392
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,520
He's a bum?

393
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,150
Chump change, to-the-curb,

394
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,728

395
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,589

396
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,097
Fuck Mike Tyson!

397
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,533
I rememberwhen he mugged
that woman on Lexington?

398
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,694
I remember that shit?

399
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,702
You're going to tell him?

400
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,636
I'll tell him?
Fuck MikeTyson!

401
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,639
To his face?

402

You goddamn right!

403
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,301
He'll knock
your goddamn ass off?

404
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,675
You talk shit now?

405
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,282
I'll drop him like a bad habit?

406
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,250
IfTyson dream aboutwhippin' my ass,

408
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,055
Well, gentlemen, theway I see it,

409
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,091
ifthis hotweather continues,

410
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,093
it's going to melt the polar caps

411
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,096
and thewholewideworld?

412
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,099
And all those parts
that ain'twater already

413
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,135

414
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,136
You dumb ass, simple motherfucker!

415
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,536

The polar caps?

417
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,539
Don't worry about it?

418
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,544
When it happens,
and I'm in my boat

419
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,148

422
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,420
You 30 cent away from a quarter?

423
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,118
How the fuck

Raggedy motherfucker!

430
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,306
I'm in good shape?

00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,669
I will be?

432
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,709
I'll be back on my feet
soon enough?

433
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,278
Look, raggedy-ass shoes!

So run over, you gotta

So, ML, ML, ML, tell me?

Hey, Sal, how come

any American-Italians eating in here?

472

All I see is black folks?

473
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,170
Since we spend much money here,

00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,012
Yeah?

823
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,123
You almost knocked me down?

824
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,161
The word is "excuse me?"

825
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,593
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?

826
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,599
You stepped on
my brand-new white AirJordans?

827
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,532
That's all you can say?

828
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,567
You're serious?

829
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,172
Yeah! I'll fuck
your prick two times!

830
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,170
Two times!

831
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,538
Who told you to be
in my neighborhood?

832
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,734
I own this brownstone?

833
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:50,746
Who told you to buy a brownstone
in my neighborhood?

834
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,316
What do you want to live

835
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,181
in a black neighborhood for,
anyway?

836
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,585
I understand this is
a free country?

837
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,157
A man can live
wherever he wants?

838
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,591
Free country?
I should fuckyou up for saying that?

839
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,163
Yo, man?
YourJordans are fucked up!

840
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,199
Might as well throw them shits out?
They're broke?

841
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,598
They looked good
before he messed them up?

842
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,467
He was even talking
aboutyour mama--

843
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,167
Shit, you used
to be so fine!

844
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,606
How much they cost?

845
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,642
$1 00!

846
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,212
$1 08 with tax?

847
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,781
You're lucky
I got a loving heart?

848
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,777
Next time, cross the street quick?

849
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,346
I'm out ofhere?

850
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,749
Break his feet!

851
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,022
You should buy me another pair!

852
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,057
Black Panther'd whip his ass!

853
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,422
You're lucky I'm
a righteous black man!

854
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,587
Otherwiseyou'd be
in serious trouble! Serious!

855
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,163
Let's fuck him up?

856
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,766
Move back to Massachusetts!

857
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,466
I was born in Brooklyn?

858
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,092
- No!
- Oh!
- Man!

859
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,172
Get outta here!

860
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,467
I should send Vito
with you all the time?

861
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,477
Yeah? No more
90-minute deliveries

862
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,047
Around the corner?

863
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,050
I work hard like
everybody else here, OK?

864
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,143
You know that's true, Pino?

865
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,280
Vito, come here?

866
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,425
Come here?

867
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,167
What's going on
between you two?

868
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,598
You boyfriend and girlfriend?

869
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,171
What did we just talk about?

870
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,169
What?

871
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,570
What did we just talk about?

872
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,142
What you talking about?

873
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,108
Smack him?

874
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,509
Any smacking
around here, I'll do?

875
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:34,583
You going to listen to him
tell you to smack me,

876
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,244
your older brother?

877
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,280
Rememberwhoyou are?

878
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,290
Your name is Vito Frangone,

879
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,395
not Vito Muhammad?

880
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:46,553
OK?

881
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,173
I'd love foryou
to stay out of my business?

882
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,176
Stop putting these thoughts
into my brother's head, OK?

883
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,577
Look, I don't play
that Muhammad shit, all right?

884
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,181
What Muhammad shit?

885
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,774
Look?? don't fuck me, all right?

886
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,545
Oh, man?

887
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,555
Fuck, man?

888
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,663
I hate this place?
I hate this place?

889
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,209
What a waste?

890
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,786
What a waste?

891
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,586
As I was saying

892
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,181
before we were
so rudely interrupted

893
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,158
by New York City's finest--

894
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,092
What was you saying?

895
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,130
The motherfucker
wasn't saying shit?

896
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,427
Yeah?
Look at that?

897
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,559
Look at what?

898
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,069
It's a goddamn shame?

899
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,503
What's a goddamn shame?

900
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,073
Sweet DickWillie?

901
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,506
That's my name?

902
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,101
Do I have to spell it out?

903
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,543
Make it plain?

904
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,114
OK, but listen up?

905
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,114
I'm going to break it down?

906
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,513
Let it be broke?

907
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,813
Can you dig it?

908
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,213
It's dug?

909
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,189
Look at those Korean motherfuckers
across the street?

910
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,226
Bet they haven't been
offthe boat a year

911
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,693
before they opened
their own place?

912
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,297
Right? It's been about a year?

913
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,299
A motherfuckin' year
off the motherfuckin' boat,

914
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,733
and they got a business
in our neighborhood?

915
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,303
A good business,

916
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,703
occupying a building
that had been boarded up

917
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,105
for longer than
I care to remember,

918
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,042
and I've been here a long time?

919
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,477
Yeah, a long time?

920
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,445
Hear, boy?

921
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,709
Now, for the life of me??

922
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,547
you know, I can't
figure this out?

923
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:27,215
Either them Korean motherfuckers
are geniuses??

924
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:32,257
oryou black asses
are just plain dumb?

925
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,128
Fuckyou?

926
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,132
It's got to be
because we're black?

927
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,530
Ain't no other explanation?

928
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,136
You know it's true?

929
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,229
They're always keeping
the black man to about shit!

930
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,706
Oh, oh! You motherfuckers
hold that shit down?

931
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,574
I'm tired ofthat
old excuse, that shit?

932
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,179
I swear, man,

933
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,215
I will be one happy fool

934
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,614
when we open
our own business

935
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,583
right here in our neighborhood?

936
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,210
I swear to God,

937
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,723
I'll be first to spend
what little money I got?

938
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,760
You motherfuckers
are always talking

939
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,726
that old Keith Sweat shit--

940
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,298
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that?"

941
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,299
You ain't gonna do nothing?

942
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,301
You're gonna sit on this corner?

943
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,735
When you going
to getyour business?

944
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,305
Just like I thought?

945
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,705
You ain't going to do
a goddamn thing?

946
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,311
But I'm going
to go give them Koreans

947
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,743
more ofmy money?

948
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,279
Out ofmyway?

949
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,575
It's Millertime, motherfuckers?

950
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,241
Old Moosehead fuckers
telling mewhat to do?

951
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,682
Coconut, you got nerve?

952
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,278
You got offthe boat, too?
Leave me alone?

953
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,382
Kung Fu, give me
one of them damn beers?

954
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,688
No more free beer?

955
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,261
No more free beer?

956
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,694
Don't push me, baby?

957
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,298
No more free beer?

958
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,696
Don't start no shit?

959
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,199
Mr? Sweet DickWillie?

960
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,530
Right? That's my name?

961
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,537
It's a motherfuckin' shame?

962
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,141
Man, ain't that a bitch?

963
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,749
Here, Doctor?
What's your name?

964
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,748
Eddie?

965
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,148
How old areyou?

966
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,150
1 0?

967
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,413
What makes Sammy run?

968
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,715
My name is Eddie?

969
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,154
What makes Sammy run?

970
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,849
My name is Eddie Lovell?

971
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,720
Relax? I wantyou
to go to the store for me?

972
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,127
What'll it cost?

973
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,425
How would I know?

974
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,693
What am I buying?

975
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,325
Eddie, you're too smart
foryour own britches?

976
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,165
How much doyou want

977
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,705
to go to the store
for the man?

978
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:24,671
50 cents?

979
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,265
You got a deal?

980
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,675
I wantyou to get me

Miller High Life?

982
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,716
Say it's foryour bedridden,
old granddad?

983
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,250
Now, go? Go?

984
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,549
What is wrong with him?

985
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,284
He ain't got no money for nobody?
