00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,120
PARIS, I LOVE YOU

3
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,960
SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD ROMANCES...

4
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,120
Are you leaving?

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,800
Shit.

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,120
Not a single free place.

7
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,000
Shitty neighborhood.
Shitty radio.

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,880
I can't believe it.

9
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,480
Alright.

10
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
Are you stupid?

11
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
You whore!

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Already?

13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,080
Impossible.

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,440
No.

15
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
Besides, he looks like a dumbass.

16
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,680
I've just arrived.

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,320
So I'm...
That's right.

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
Kids.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Not one is single.
Not one.

20
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,880
It's becoming a tragedy.

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,680
I don't get it. I have what it
takes to be likeable.

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm still handsome, lean.

23
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,160
I have a nice car,
which still works;

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,840
after a technical check-up,
no comments.

25
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,600
One of the wipers is screwy,
just one airbag, but it's OK.

26
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
My monthly income isn't bad.

27
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,800
My sense of humor is pretty good.

28
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,800
I can joke about many things.

29
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,480
About myself.

30
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,400
But I'm miserably lonesome...
All alone in the universe.

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Emptiness.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,280
What the...

33
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,200
Can you hear me?

34
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
Don't touch her.

35
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm a doctor.
Don't pick her up.

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,480
Don't move, doll.

37
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
She's fine.

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
I said, get up, doll.

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,600
Let her get up.

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
- Should we call the firemen?
- She's fine.

41
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,400
She needs sugar.

42
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
She should eat carrots.

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Carrots or rather beets?

44
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,200
She should eat sugar.

45
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,280
You'll lie down in my car
and you'll feel better.

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,120
It's alright, doll.

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,320
Stop it with that "doll".
It's starting to piss me off.

48
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,880
- Will you manage?
- Yes, thank you.

49
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,880
I'm sorry. I don't have
anything for you.

50
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm not the kind of guy,
who rides around with a box of tissues.

51
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,520
Thank you.

52
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,760
Don't mention it.

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,880
You stayed calm.

54
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Yes...

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,560
I passed a first aid exam.

56
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,560
Had you remained unconscious,
I'd have placed you in a PLS position.

57
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,440
What position?

58
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,400
A PLS position.
A safe lateral position.

59
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,160
I'd try to keep the main
axis of your body completely...

60
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
Can you turn off the music?

61
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Yes.

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,480
There you go.

63
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,800
Your hand on my neck
did me some good.

64
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,320
Me too.

65
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,480
If we think about dolphins...

66
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
In case of beached dolphins,

67
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,120
people pour water over them.

68
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
But it doesn't make a difference.

69
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,520
They die surrounded by
beings they don't know.

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Who told you that it
doesn't make a difference?

71
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,160
Yes...

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,520
It's true that it's not...

73
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,040
Anyway, you have cool shoes.

74
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,200
My Clarks shoes?

75
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,120
Yes.

76
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
I have them since I was 14.

77
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,520
Really?

78
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
But I don't wear them all the time.

79
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
No.

80
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,400
I have an appointment
with my tabacologist.

81
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,560
Your taba what?

82
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,920
My tabacologist.

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
- Soon?
- Yes, soon.

84
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
I can drive you there.

85
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
You don't know where it is.
There might be a traffic jam.

86
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,400
No problem.
I'll squeeze my way through.

87
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
I won't be there long.

88
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,920
No problem.
I'll wait for you.

89
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
Show me the thong.

90
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,360
Show us your ass.

91
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,760
Miss, can you borrow me
your thong?

92
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm out of dental floss.
Please.

93
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
Check out that chick.

94
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,720
Miss, if I buy you a drink,
can I get a rub?

95
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,040
I have a bungalow close by.

96
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,960
No luck.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Shut up.
Besides, she was no good.

98
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,640
Yeah, sure.

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,760
Shut it. I've had more ass
than you two put together.

100
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm the one who scores.

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
And you're no good.

102
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,160
Show me how you do it.

103
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,600
Look how an expert does it.

104
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
Hello, ladies.

105
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,160
You're charming.
A tasty dish.

106
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
You know what?

107
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,840
When you start shaving, let me know.

108
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
You loser!

109
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,800
You caved in.

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
You gotta go for it.

111
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,360
Show'em.

112
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,880
Listen: I'm not the one who
hasn't scored for a month.

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,920
Did you see that chick?

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
What's he doing?

115
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,840
He went to save her!

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,840
Are you alright?

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,800
Morons.

118
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,120
Thanks.

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,480
They have a bad look about them.

120
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm sorry about them.

121
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,520
It doesn't matter.

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,880
Can I help you?

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Yes, please.

124
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
Sorry.

125
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm not sure how to do this.

126
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Alright?

127
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,640
How do I look?

128
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
I'll show you.

129
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,200
Smile.

130
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,320
You now have another trick
to hit on girls.

131
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,720
I don't do that.
My friends screw around.

132
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
They're pathetic.

133
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,560
Yeah.

134
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,120
You have beautiful hair.
Why are you forced to cover it up?

135
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm not forced.
It was my choice.

136
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,440
Too bad.

137
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,800
Because you're very pretty.

138
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
Thank you, but...

139
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,000
Does that mean that without it I'm ugly?

140
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
I didn't mean that.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,280
You and your pals,
you only insult women.

142
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,160
Why do you talk like that,
even though you know

143
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
they don't like it?

144
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,680
It's enough that I find myself pretty.

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
When I wear my headscarf,
I feel I have a faith.

146
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,640
An identity.

147
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
I feel good.

148
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
And that's also beauty.

149
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,760
Explain that to your pals
and maybe one day...

150
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,040
they'll hook up with a chick.

151
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,120
I have to go.

152
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,840
Where to?

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
The mosque.

154
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
Can you hand me my bag?

155
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,720
Thank you.

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,280
And thank you for helping me.

157
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,240
Don't mention it.

158
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
Did you crack?

159
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,640
What?

160
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Are you nuts?

161
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,280
If you touch her,

162
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,400
her old man will
smoke your ass.

163
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,080
Miss!

164
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,280
Don't search.
I'm right here.

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Miss, you're late.
I've been waiting an hour.

166
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I don't get it.
We're a couple of cute guys.

167
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,920
Shall we go?

168
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,040
Hi.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
Grandpa, this is the boy
who helped me.

170
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

171
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,480
I didn't expect you here.

172
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,360
Francois.

173
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,440
Zarka.

174
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,240
- How are your hands?
- Fine.

175
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
It was very nice of you
to help her.

176
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,560
It was nothing special.

177
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,400
We're going this way.
Care to join us?

178
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,160
Are you a student?

179
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Yes. I'm studying history.

180
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,800
Very nice, my boy.

181
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Knowing your history
is very important.

182
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,520
Zarka wants to be a journalist.

183
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,880
An international journalist.

184
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,720
She wants to write about France.

185
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,400
But her own personal France.

186
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
Hello.

187
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,000
Hello.

188
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,440
Elie, can you bring us
two glasses of wine?

189
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,920
Show me.

190
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,840
Great.

191
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,320
The red is the most important.

192
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
We need to get the same red.

193
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,640
Alright.

194
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,560
Blood red.

195
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,880
Alright.

196
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
I think we used auto paint.

197
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,640
Come with me to
the back of the shop.

198
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
Have we met before?

199
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,640
I have this impression
we've crossed paths.

200
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,720
Where do you live?
I live in the 17th.

201
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,640
Maybe I saw you in my neighborhood.

202
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,520
You're not much of a talker.

203
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,040
I'm not sure, but I think
I've seen you before.

204
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,840
You have a mystic look.

205
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,120
There's really something
special about your look.

206
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,960
Do you believe in ghosts?

207
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
I really dig that topic.

208
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,760
Maybe we knew each other in
another time, another era.

209
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
Do you have a light?

210
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
A light?

211
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,160
Thank you.

212
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,360
It's weird, but when I saw you,

213
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,840
I felt the need
to talk to you.

214
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,440
As if...

215
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,320
I don't know...
It's very strong...

216
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
It's weird.

217
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,600
I figured that if I didn't
talk to you before disappearing,

218
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
I would be missing
out on something...

219
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,600
important.

220
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,160
That's beautiful, isn't it?

221
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,640
You work in a nice place.

222
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,920
I didn't want to miss the
chance to talk to you, because...

223
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,720
It's dumb, but I just didn't want to.

224
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,000
Anyway...

225
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,040
May I?

226
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,360
Yes.

227
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,880
Do you believe in soul mates?

228
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,360
Someone who's your other half.

229
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
Do you like jazz?

230
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Yes.

231
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,920
Charlie Parker.

232
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,760
And Kurt Cobain?
I adore Kurt Cobain.

233
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,200
Never mind.

234
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,720
I'll give you my number.

235
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,960
I'd love to talk to you.

236
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,440
If you call.

237
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,680
A more serious and,
above all, a longer talk.

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,880
Longer...

239
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,400
Here.

240
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Thank you very much.

241
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,600
It's done.

242
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,440
Have a good return trip.

243
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,880
Bye.

244
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

245
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,640
What happened?

246
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
His phone number.

247
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,800
Call him and you'll find out.

248
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
What are you looking at, asshole?

249
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,800
What are you looking at, asshole?

250
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,640
Stop it.

251
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,360
What are you looking at, asshole?

252
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,320
Axel, stop it.

253
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
I'm talking to you!
What are you looking at, asshole?

254
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm talking to you, cocksucker.

255
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,480
You like my chick?
You wanna do her?

256
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,440
Is that it?

257
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,760
You cocksucker.

258
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,280
You wanna do her?
You like her?

259
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,240
Look at him.

260
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,440
Look at that cocksucker.

261
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,480
What do you want?
You wanna do her?

262
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,720
Don't shit me!

263
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,920
You like her?

264
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,760
Look. That asshole is shitting me!

265
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,920
What are you doing, you shit?!

266
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Are you losing it?!

267
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,320
What are you doing?

268
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,080
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what I want, you jerk-off!

269
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,120
Bring your ass back here.

270
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,720
The slut!

271
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,320
With the tongue!

272
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,280
What a slut!
I can't take it!

273
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,680
That wasn't bad, was it?

274
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,480
You're a real killer.

275
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,200
You must work out regularly.

276
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
So...

277
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,800
Do you like hot jazz?

278
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,440
What were you doing
with your tongue?

279
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
Are you done?

280
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,560
Yeah, I'm done.

281
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
- Do you feel better?
- Yeah.

282
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,880
You like to fight?

283
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,480
Sure. When I'm with you.

284
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,480
- Do you love me?
- What do you think?

285
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,200
- Did you see what I did to him?
- I loved it!

286
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,480
Don't shoot people in the face.
It's not nice.

287
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,520
- Ana, is that you?
- Yes.

288
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,240
I have to get going.
I'm late already.

289
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,160
Call my cell at noon,

290
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
to tell me how
the morning went.

291
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,040
Yes.

292
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,360
Ana, I'll be back a bit later tonight.
An hour or so, not more.

293
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,120
Does that bother you?

294
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,760
No.

295
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,680
I'm sorry miss.

296
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,520
I'm sorry... Do you know where
I can find this hairdresser?

297
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,560
Do you know her?

298
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,360
Alright...

299
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,160
Hi, skaters.

300
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,120
Hi, youngsters.

301
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,400
Listen... Do you know where this is?

302
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,560
Miss Li.

303
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,920
- Good luck.
- Really?

304
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Sit!

305
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,400
Your ticket.

306
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,840
What the hell are
you doing here?

307
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,680
Let me introduce myself:
I'm Mr. Henny.

308
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,640
I'm a representative
for the House of Niole.

309
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,960
I've come to present you
our new line of products

310
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,320
specially designed for Asian people.

311
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
I'm at your disposal, if...

312
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,320
is you.

313
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Hello?

314
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,000
Jean?

315
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,680
Yes.

316
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,400
Bovais here.

317
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,240
How's your first day at work?

318
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,920
Yes, boss.
Fine.

319
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,880
Take it easy.

320
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,640
Yes.

321
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,280
Phones are not allowed.

322
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,480
Yes, miss.
I know where he is.

323
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,760
She's waiting for you.

324
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,960
There you are!

325
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
Get to work.

326
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,680
But... I've never done this.

327
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Piece of cake.

328
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,520
Let's do it.

329
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,560
What class!

330
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,360
Lacquer.

331
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,480
It means: I love you.

332
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,960
I LOVE YOU.

333
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,920
Would you love me more
if I had this hairdo?

334
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,160
No. I think I'd love you
more if you had this one.

335
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,440
I love you like this.

336
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,480
He looked at his wife,
who crossed the street.

337
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,240
She was wearing a red trench coat,
which she promised to throw away

338
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,680
and which she kept pulling out
of her closet, year after year.

339
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,840
She approached all
things the same way.

340
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,720
And it was that trait that
attracted him, when he first met her.

341
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,800
The same clothes worn
over and over again.

342
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,560
Piles of lipsticks,
which she never used.

343
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
That song...

344
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,640
life's vortex, which she
intonated while making food,

345
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,000
was a part of the life
that had become alien to him

346
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,400
and which he intended to abandon
between the main dish and dessert.

347
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,400
Hello, miss.

348
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,360
Hello.

349
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,480
He realized the weird and logical
inappropriateness of the place

350
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,400
he had chosen to abandon her.

351
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,840
It was here that he first realized

352
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,680
that he had stopped loving her.

353
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,440
When she smiled, he was
on the verge of shouting:

354
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,640
"I'm leaving you!"

355
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,280
"Stop smiling."

356
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,320
But instead he offered
her some wine.

357
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,760
It pissed him off that she never
ordered any hors d'oeuvres or dessert.

358
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,360
But she almost always
ate his whole portion.

359
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,920
The worst thing was that he always
ended up ordering what she loved.

360
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,160
"I'm not sure I actually like that cake."
he thought solemnly.

361
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,640
When she started to cry
like she never cried before,

362
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,600
he thought that she knows he
was leaving her for Marie-Christine,

363
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,200
a passionate flight attendant,
who he loved for a year and a half.

364
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,640
"She knows" he thought.

365
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,640
She's known it for some time.

366
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,000
I should have expected it.

367
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,040
Still crying, she took out
some documents from her handbag

368
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,640
and handed them to him.

369
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,400
The documents were written
in a lifeless medical language

370
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,600
and described leukemia in
its terminal stage.

371
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
I'm sorry.

372
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,040
Having read the documents,
the meeting's purpose flew out of his mind.

373
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,600
And a weird metallic
voice said to him:

374
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,160
You have to be up to the task!

375
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,840
And he was.

376
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
He ordered 3 pieces
of cake as take-out

377
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,280
and sent an SMS to his mistress.

378
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,520
FORGET ABOUT ME. SERGIO

379
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,760
He surrounded her with
the care she always desired.

380
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,760
He hung paintings.
He moved things from one place to another.

381
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,800
He accompanied her to morning
showings of her favorite movies.

382
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,520
He went with her to sales,
even though he hated shopping.

383
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,960
He read Murakami's
"Sputnik Sweetheart" aloud.

384
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,240
And everything, even the most
mundane things, had a different meaning,

385
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,920
since he learned he was doing
them for her for the last time.

386
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,040
Behaving like a man in love,

387
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
he once again became a man in love.

388
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,160
And when she died in his arms,

389
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,200
he fell into an emotional coma

390
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,280
from which he never awoke.

391
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,360
And until this day,
years later,

392
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,200
his heart still sinks

393
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,520
when he sees a woman in
a red trench coat.

394
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,920
Mommy, mommy...

395
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,520
Cowboys still exist.

396
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,120
I saw them in books.

397
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,440
You told me there are none,
but that was not true.

398
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Mommy...

399
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,320
Mommy, mommy...

400
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,360
Cowboys still exist.

401
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,840
It's true.
I saw them in books.

402
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,960
You told me there are none,
but that was not true.

403
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,280
Isis, go to the kitchen.

404
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,560
Are you going to
starve to death?

405
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,280
A week has passed.

406
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,360
He went to heaven.

407
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,840
It seems God wants me to suffer

408
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,440
and mourn here on earth.

409
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,600
Mommy, can I go out
to see my friends?

410
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,880
Mommy, I'm going out!

411
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,760
Justin?

412
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,040
Justin, don't go!

413
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,560
Justin?

414
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,280
Justin?

415
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,640
Justin?!

416
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,480
Justin...

417
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,960
Mommy!
Mommy!

418
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
Mommy!
Mommy!

419
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,640
Mommy, my friend, he doesn't have...
Can I go to him?

420
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,000
- Please.
- Don't go!

421
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,600
- Please.
- Don't go there!

422
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,200
Don't go there, understand?
Don't go.

423
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,840
Suzanne!

424
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,000
Dad's calling you.

425
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
Mommy!

426
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,760
Go.
Dad's waiting.

427
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,160
No...

428
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,080
Can I go now?

429
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,200
Suzanne!

430
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,680
What happened?

431
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,200
Where did you get this strength?

432
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
God gave me it.

433
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,120
What's your name?

434
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,760
Don't look at your parents.
Look at the camera.

435
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,120
- What's your name?
- Jean-Claude.

436
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,840
Jean-Claude, tell us where
your parents met each other.

437
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,880
In prison.

438
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,400
In prison?

439
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,360
Alright. Tell me about them.

440
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,800
My dad was sad because
he didn't have a woman

441
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,680
and he spent each morning
alone in his house.

442
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,800
STUPID MIME

443
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,520
Let me out of here!

444
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,280
Shut up!

445
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,440
I don't want to be
with these two!

446
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,080
Shit!

447
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,280
Put me in a different cell!

448
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,680
Help!

449
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,760
Let me out!

450
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,240
I've finished telling my story.

451
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,320
Son of mimes!

452
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,600
Son of mimes.

453
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,640
Claire!

454
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,720
I told you to take the metro.

455
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,480
Maybe I shouldn't have called.

456
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,960
I don't know.

457
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,720
You could speak to me in French,

458
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,440
since you're now in Paris.

459
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,040
You're not young!

460
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,280
I am experience.

461
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,320
No. I have experience.

462
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,480
I have experience.

463
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,040
I don't know...

464
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,120
You think this is funny?

465
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,480
It's my life as well.

466
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,680
And you thought of me?

467
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,240
Am I dreaming?

468
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,240
You want me to trust you,
but you do whatever pleases you.

469
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,760
You shouldn't smoke.

470
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Wait.

471
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,800
I be sorry.

472
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,600
No. I am sorry.

473
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,880
My little Claire.

474
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,800
Claire...

475
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,920
My little Claire.

476
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,600
Thank you, dad.

477
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,000
Sara.

478
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,760
Mr. Lang.
Good evening.

479
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,480
Good evening.

480
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,560
My little Gaspard!

481
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:52,880
Alright.

482
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,640
- See you, Sara!
- Bye.

483
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,120
See you, my darling!

484
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,800
Wait.

485
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,760
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

486
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,720
I'd like to know what he said.

487
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,600
My little Gaspard.

488
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,640
Ken here.
I've come to see Liz.

489
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,200
I'll go get Liz.
Wait inside.

490
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,600
I don't have any cash on me.

491
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'll go get some.

492
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,200
Do you know where
I can get some money?

493
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,320
On de Bretagne street.
Just turn right.

494
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,280
Here you go.

495
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,040
You don't have any change?

496
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,720
No.

497
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,480
We can get some at the cafe.

498
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,040
Yeah.

499
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,720
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

500
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,680
What would you like?

501
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,720
A beer.

502
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,760
- Two beers please.
- Yes.

503
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,400
What are you doing in Paris?

504
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,520
I'm playing in a movie.

505
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,400
What kind of movie?

506
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,600
A costume movie.

507
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,480
Are you filming this evening?

508
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,640
Yes.
The whole night.

509
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,560
I have to go there
in an hour.

510
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,840
Can I come?

511
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,720
If you want to.

512
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,600
But if I come, I don't
want to be thrown out.

513
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,360
What?

514
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,760
If I come, I don't want
to be thrown out.

515
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,160
You can call me.

516
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,880
I don't know your number.

517
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,640
It's an American phone,
so you have to dial 001.

518
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,600
Careful. It's strong.

519
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,800
See you later.

520
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,160
Yes?

521
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,320
Yes?

522
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,480
It's Liz.

523
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,440
If you want to come now's the time.

524
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,160
After it'll be too late.

525
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,240
You need my help?

526
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,320
Yes.

527
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,000
Yes, the same stuff
for my friend.

528
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:57,120
I'm at Payenne street number 12.

529
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,360
Where's Ken?

530
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He had to make a delivery.

531
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,840
For an important client.

532
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,760
He asked me to help you out.

533
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,760
Well... Bye.

534
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,760
Careful. It's strong.

535
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,440
Besides, you know that.

536
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,880
Something bit me.

537
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,520
A filthy mosquito.

538
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,160
You have to be careful in
a neighborhood like this.

539
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,120
Is the wound big?

540
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,720
What's your name?

541
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,720
Sophie.

542
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,760
I'd like to give you my card,
but I don't have it anymore.

543
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,120
Too bad.

544
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:19,960
Sophie?

545
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,040
Will you have
a coffee with me?

546
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,000
Please.

547
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,160
Can I rub your feet?

548
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,920
Why do you want
to rub my feet?

549
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
Because your feet hurt.

550
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,560
They do?

551
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,080
You ran all
night in my dreams.

552
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,560
Please. Have a coffee with me.

553
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,280
They're coming.

554
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'm sorry. Can you
bring us two coffees?

555
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,080
What are you doing?

556
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:04,840
Are you nuts?

557
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,160
Don't you remember me?

558
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,720
Miss, not this way!

559
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,560
That way, miss!

560
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,680
Yes. That way.

561
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,400
Thank you.

562
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,480
Don't mention it.

563
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,600
That's a pretty song.

564
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,520
Thank you.

565
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,120
Miss!

566
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,320
Miss!

567
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,440
Will you go and have
a coffee with me?

568
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,760
Do you think I'm stupid?

569
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,480
Get to work.

570
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,640
Don't play games with me.

571
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,280
Get up.

572
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,680
Pick up your stuff
and move out.

573
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,120
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for someone.

574
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,680
- Do you know each other?
- No.

575
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,160
What are you doing?

576
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,480
You don't know him either?

577
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,000
- Lend me your guitar for a moment.
- No.

578
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,240
For a moment.
I'll give it back.

579
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,360
And now I'm walking around
with your guitar!

580
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,840
What are you doing?

581
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,200
Where do you think you are?

582
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,160
Hello.

583
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:04,840
Excuse me.

584
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,320
Are you new on the job?

585
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,600
Miss, your coffee.

586
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,480
What can I get you sir?

587
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,280
A Debon.

588
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,200
Here you go.

589
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,960
- Can you play my favorite song again?
- Yes, of course.

590
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,640
That's a beautiful song.

591
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,920
I fell in love
when it was playing.

592
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,320
For the first and
only time in my life.

593
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,880
What are you doing in here?

594
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,720
Keep quiet.

595
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,400
I want to know
why you need this.

596
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,960
Showing me some affection
would be a nice change.

597
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,280
Instead of looking
at me with bitterness.

598
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,880
Give me a surprise kiss.
Surprise me with something.

599
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,120
But, but, but...

600
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,920
But that's not what
I call beauty.

601
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,160
You're the only woman
that I've ever loved.

602
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,240
Who do you think you are?

603
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,680
Get your dirty
hands off of me.

604
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,920
And stop touching me

605
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,600
and looking at me
with that crazy look.

606
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,560
Considering all that was bad,

607
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,120
I think we still
did very well.

608
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,800
AN EVENING WITH FANNY FORESTIER AND BOB LEANDER.
LAST DAYS.

609
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,880
Late in the night...

610
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,640
Yes?

611
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,160
Francine.

612
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,600
Francine...
I remember it exactly.

613
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,200
It was the 15th of May.

614
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,120
Spring was late to arrive
and rain clouds were gathering.

615
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,240
And you were screaming.

616
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,840
Good luck.

617
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,160
And of course you
were accepted.

618
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,040
You left Boston and
moved to live in Paris.

619
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,840
A small apartment on a
street in the Faubourg Saint-Denis.

620
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,800
I showed you my neighborhood,
my bars, my school.

621
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,360
I introduced you to my friends.

622
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,160
My parents.

623
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,360
I listened to you
as you learned your lines.

624
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,080
I listened to your singing,
to your hopes.

625
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,920
Your desires.
I listened to your music.

626
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:22,880
And you listened to mine.

627
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,320
You listened to my
Italian, German, Russian.

628
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,360
I gave you a walkman
and you gave me a pillow.

629
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,720
And then one day, you kissed me.

630
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,520
Time passed.

631
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,800
Time raced.

632
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,240
And everything seemed so easy,

633
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,280
so simple.

634
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:42,240
Free.

635
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,680
So new and unique.

636
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,640
We went to the movies.

637
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,520
We went dancing.

638
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:47,720
Shopping.

639
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:48,800
We laughed.

640
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:49,480
You cried.

641
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,880
We swam, we smoked.

642
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:51,760
We shaved.

643
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,080
From time to time
you screamed.

644
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,440
Without reason.

645
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,840
Sometimes with reason.

646
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,640
Yes, sometimes with reason.

647
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,600
I walked you to the conservatory.

648
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,240
I studied for my exams.

649
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,280
I listened to your singing,
to your hopes.

650
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,120
Your desires.
I listened to your music.

651
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,200
And you listened to mine.

652
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,160
We were close.
So close.

653
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,120
Ever closer.

654
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,280
We went to the movies.

655
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,480
We went swimming.

656
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,360
We laughed together.

657
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,240
You screamed.

658
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,520
Sometimes with reason.

659
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,200
And sometimes without.

660
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,160
Time passed.

661
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,360
Time raced.

662
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,600
I walked you to the conservatory.

663
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,160
I studied for my exams.

664
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:41,120
You listened as I spoke Italian,
German, Russian, French.

665
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,240
I studied for my exams.

666
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,160
You screamed.

667
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,040
Sometimes with reason.

668
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,920
Time passed, without reason.

669
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,040
You screamed.

670
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:47,840
Without reason.

671
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,360
I studied for my exams.

672
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,080
Exams, exams...

673
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,640
Time passed.

674
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,480
You screamed.

675
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,560
You screamed, you screamed...

676
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,800
I went to the movies.

677
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,160
Forgive me, Francine.

678
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,200
Yes?

679
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,320
- Thank you.
- Good night.

680
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,480
Mrs. Richmond.

681
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:27,640
Good evening.

682
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,120
Please, this way.

683
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,200
Good evening, sir.

684
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:30,840
Go ahead.

685
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,200
Here.

686
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,720
What can I get you?

687
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,800
Here you go.
The menu.

688
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,120
Two crabs and two
glasses of wine.

689
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,760
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs. Richmond.

690
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,920
You don't pay anything, sir.
It's on the house.

691
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,880
Whose turn is it to read?

692
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,360
Mine.

693
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,160
Alright, Carol.
Go ahead.

694
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,880
I'd like to tell you
about a special day

695
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,960
during my recent
trip to Paris.

696
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,760
My whole life I dreamed
of going there.

697
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:46,400
And that's why I studied
French in a class for adults

698
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,440
for 2 years.

699
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,720
I saved up some money
and went to Paris for 6 days.

700
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:57,520
After 5 days I still felt jetlagged

701
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:00,160
and I felt a little
tired the whole time.

702
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,720
This was my first trip to Europe.

703
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,960
I wanted to go there
for two weeks,

704
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,640
but I couldn't leave my
dogs all alone for that long.

705
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,760
I really liked the museums
and streets of Paris.

706
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:19,480
Only the food wasn't
as good as I expected.

707
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,720
I considered coming to Paris
with a group,

708
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:27,600
but I'm a very independent person.

709
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,080
Since I work as a
mailman in Denver,

710
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,920
I was used to walking every day.

711
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:39,080
I also wanted to live an
adventure in a foreign place.

712
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,280
Excuse me.

713
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,680
And I also wanted
to practice my French.

714
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:46,480
Do you know where I can find
a good restaurant around here?

715
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,960
They say a lot of
things about Paris.

716
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,160
They say it's a place
where artists find inspiration.

717
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,200
They say it's a place
where people come

718
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,840
to discover something
new about their lives.

719
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:11,600
They say it's a place
where you can find love.

720
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:20,800
Of course, at my age,
I didn't expect any of that.

721
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:27,120
But during those days,
I thought a lot about my life.

722
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,360
I pondered whether I liked Paris

723
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:36,960
and whether I would want to
live there if I had the money.

724
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,920
I imagined myself delivering
the mail every day

725
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:45,120
and getting to know
the people who live there.

726
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,480
I'm sure they're very nice.

727
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:55,200
I visited a known cemetery,
where famous people are buried.

728
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,000
I saw the grave of Jean-Paul Sartre
and Simone de Beauvoir.

729
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,240
According to my guidebook,

730
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:07,080
they were famous French writers,
who loved each other very much.

731
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,080
And that's why they're
buried together.

732
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,840
And I saw the grave of a man
whose name was Porfirio Diaz.

733
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:21,080
According to my book, he was
Mexico's dictator for 35 years.

734
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,800
It was interesting to be near
a man who had had great power,

735
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,680
but who now could not
move or talk.

736
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,520
I thought about my sister Patty,
who died at a very young age.

737
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:40,480
And I thought about my mother,
who died of cancer last year.

738
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,960
One day, I also will be buried

739
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,520
and maybe no one will
come to visit me.

740
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,760
But I don't care.
I'll be dead.

741
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,800
But I'm not a sad person.

742
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,040
On the contrary.

743
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,360
I'm a happy person.

744
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:06,000
I have many friends
and two wonderful dogs.

745
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:11,440
Sometimes I think that it
would be nice to have someone,

746
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,480
with whom to share this life.

747
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,120
For example, as I was looking down
on Paris from atop a skyscraper,

748
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:21,440
I wanted to say to someone:
"It's beautiful, isn't it?".

749
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,680
But there isn't anyone.

750
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:27,640
I thought about my
ex-boyfriend, Dave,

751
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,160
and whether he'd like this trip.

752
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,080
But I felt a little stupid,

753
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:37,400
because it had been
11 years since we last talked.

754
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,640
He's now married and
has three children.

755
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,520
And I found a very
pretty little park.

756
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:55,800
I sat down on a bench and
ate the sandwich I had bought.

757
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,080
It was very tasty.

758
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,400
And then something happened,

759
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,440
something that is
hard to describe.

760
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:38,800
Sitting there, alone in a
foreign country, far from my job

761
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,040
and all the people I knew,

762
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,480
a feeling came over me.

763
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,360
As if I recalled something,

764
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,480
something that I had never known
and for which I had been waiting.

765
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,840
But I didn't know what it was.

766
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,520
Maybe it was something
I had forgotten.

767
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:01,760
Or something I had
missed my whole life.

768
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,160
I can only tell you

769
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,440
that at the same time I felt

770
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:10,280
joy and sadness.

771
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,640
But not a great sadness.

772
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,800
Because I felt alive.

773
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,280
Yes.
Alive.

774
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,840
That was the moment when
I fell in love with Paris

775
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:36,520
and the moment I felt that
Paris had fallen in love with me.
