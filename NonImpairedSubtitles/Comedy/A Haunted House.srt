you wanna think about.

You can remote access these

I can set that up if you want.
Just give me your pass code.

you might wanna
check up on the missus,

00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,822
I would absolutely never do it.

484
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,358
Me neither.
Me neither.

485
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,427
What kind of pervert does that?

486
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,621
That's what you
would have to be.

487
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,254
It takes a pervert
to swap girlfriends.

488
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,560
You never have done it,
and you never would, huh?

489
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,658
No, Steve.

490
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,465
Even if you got drunk enough
or something like that?

491
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,369
Like, you might have a few
too many drinks and say,

492
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,639
"Why not?
Let's give it a try,"

493
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,132
if there was a couple
that was into it.

494
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,574
No.
No. Yeah, me neither.

495
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,634
That's how I feel.

496
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,078
But even, like, maybe
if you got a little high,

497
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,945
maybe on a Saturday night
or something like that,

498
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,348
and you were like...

499
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,510
(STAMMERS) Even then.

500
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,111
Yeah. Like, even if
this couple was, like,

501
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,180
up for anything
and raring to go,

502
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,284
and she was hot to trot,
like, a hot, hot lady.

503
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,591
It wouldn't matter.
You wouldn't do it, right?

504
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,962
Nigger, no.

505
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,627
Same here.
We're in agreement.

506
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,364
It's crazy to swap
girlfriends like that.

507
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,463
I am with you 100%.

508
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,072
Steve, want a beer?

509
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,270
Thank you very much.

510
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,007
Hey, babe, did you
tell Steve we have a ghost?

511
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,138
We don't have a ghost.
A ghost?

512
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,774
Yeah.
Awesome.

513
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,942
I think it'd be
cool to have a ghost.

514
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,007
MALCOLM:
We don't have a ghost.

515
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,279
No, Jenny, it's not cool.

516
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,446
We don't have a ghost.

517
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,547
You thought it
was cool in college.

518
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,284
We did a seance and everything!

519
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,224
A seance?
Oh, yeah. That's right.

520
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,317
You did a seance?

521
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,885
Yes.
Honey, it's college.

522
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,118
You do a lot of silly stuff.

523
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,189
Yeah.

524
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,290
Like that time we
got drunk and made out.

525
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,461
(STEVE LAUGHS)
Oh, it's all hazy.

526
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,731
You know, college,
it's like a big fog.

527
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,396
MALCOLM: We're gonna talk
about these college days.

528
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,495
Yeah, yeah.

529
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,701
A hazy, sexy fog,
it sounds like.

530
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,335
Wouldn't it be great if we all
spent the night? Together?

531
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,470
Well, that's an
interesting idea.

532
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,741
What do you think
of that, Malcolm?

533
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,543
A naked sleepover?
MALCOLM: No.

534
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,878
No?
It's weird.

535
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,350
Yeah, but it's definitely
gonna be weird.

536
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,887
But are you saying
weird good or weird bad?

537
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,149
Weird bad, Steve.

538
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,349
Okay.

539
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,549
All right, you guys.
It's been real.

540
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,527
Listen, I know a great
psychic if you need one.

541
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,620
Okay.

542
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,891
He told me I'd be surrounded

543
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,594
by big, black spirits
in my near future.

544
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,863
Vaginas crossed.

545
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,372
MALCOLM: Yeah, okay.
Right? Goodbye!

546
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,168
(LAUGHS) Well.

547
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,403
Listen, before we go, I just wanna
talk to you about something,

548
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,910
'cause Jenny's got
a birthday coming up.

549
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,002
Okay.

550
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,775
I wanna do something real
special for her, you know.

551
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,043
I was thinking maybe you could
invite a couple of guys over,

552
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,710
Like your cousin Ray-Ray,
maybe?

553
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,878
And some of
those big, black guys

554
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,444
that he hangs out with,
you know?

555
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,887
Jamal, and Hakim,
and Anforny, you know?

556
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,927
Just the six of us, right?
We'll have some fun.

557
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,019
We'll double stuff
the Oreo a little bit, huh?

558
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,796
Dirty up the white snow?

559
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,365
Black poles, white holes.

560
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,266
You know, maybe all pile on the
little white rabbit, right, you know?

561
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,599
Are you talking
about a mandingo party?

562
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,468
What? A what?

563
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,302
Excuse me!

564
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,572
I mean, I'm really, uh, not into that.
But if you're into that...

565
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,771
Um, I'm...

566
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,438
Well, we might be able
to work something out

567
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,537
if that's what you're into.

568
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,277
Hey, buddy, I mean...
Okay, bye, Steve.

569
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,508
Oh!

570
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,177
MALCOLM: Oh, wow.

571
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,411
That's beautiful.
Okay, Jenny.

572
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,512
All right. Goodbye.

573
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,988
Okay, honey, come on.
Come on, honey, come in.

574
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,820
You're lucky.

575
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,257
She is luckier.

576
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,989
Bye, guys. Bye!
All right.

577
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,964
(LAUGHS) Okay. All right.

578
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,991
KISHA: I think Jenny and
Steve are swingers.

579
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,592
MALCOLM:
You think? Wow.

580
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,262
This looks like
a ghetto Rite Aid.

581
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,567
Wrong Aid.

582
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,904
Oh, shit!
Did somebody shave a yeti?

583
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,840
KISHA: Very funny.
I shaved my legs.

584
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,572
With what, a weed whacker?

585
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,080
Wow. That's like
Apollo Creed's chest hairs.

586
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,172
That is crazy.

587
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,047
Oh! Hey!
Malcolm, come on!

588
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,485
Dude, turn that off.
Get out of here.

589
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,078
You got to close this.
Stop it!

590
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm claustrophobic, okay?

591
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,315
Yeah? Well,
I'm ass-trophobic.

592
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,916
You know what, Malcolm?
What?

593
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,519
Love it or leave it, okay?
Here. Here.

594
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,324
(LOUD GROANING) Take it, okay?

595
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,898
It's oak-y.
(MALCOLM LAUGHING)

596
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,094
It's... It's full-bodied.

597
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:52,961
I believe it's open.

598
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,130
Oh, that's...
That's nasty!

599
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,673
Mmm. The aroma.

600
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,866
The nastiest thing ever.

601
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,102
No, Malcolm! Malcolm!

602
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,643
Hey! No!

603
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,372
Move your little nasty foot.
Stop it!

604
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,411
Ow! Ow! Malcolm!

605
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,375
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

606
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,655
Uh, Malcolm. Malcolm?
Hmm?

607
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,166
The camera isn't off.

608
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,328
Yeah, the camera's off.
What are you talkin' about?

609
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,530
The light is on.

610
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,697
That's the standby light.

611
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,671
That's the record light.

612
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,902
I don't want to be
like those stupid girls.

613
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,309
Kim Kardashian with a sex tape.

614
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,075
First of all, Kim Kardashian's
worth $150 million.

615
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,509
Think about it, Kisha. You could
have your own reality show.

616
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,213
You could have your own clothing
line, your own perfume.

617
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
"Stank," by Kisha.

618
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,150
No.

619
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,658
Your window of opportunity
is closing quickly.

620
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,921
Turn it off.

621
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,121
Oh, God, you are a hater.

622
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,561
I'm not.

623
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,398
Malcolm. You ain't slick.
That camera's still on.

624
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,530
What?
(MIMICS) "What?"

625
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,106
(GRUNTS) That's cheap.

(VIDEOTAPE FAST-FORWARDING)

627

(YELPS) Whoo! Whoo!

628
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,872
(GRUNTS) Don't touch it.

629
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,508
Don't touch it.
That was crazy.

630
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,711
Oh, I got a cramp.

631
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,220
I told you we should
have recorded that.

632
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,223
I don't think they
make 30-second tapes.

633
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,421
Oh, come on. That was at least
two minutes, 15, 16 seconds.

634
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,018
Whoo! That was great.

Malcolm, you know
we have to go again, right?

636
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,231
(GRUNTS) I need a halftime.
You gotta talk to the coach.

637
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,599
Get some new plays.

00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,202
Okay, okay.

642
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,904
Woody's sore.
Mmm.

643
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:44,973
Yeah.

644
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,142
Good morning, honey.

645
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,982
Hi, baby.
Mwah.

646
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,112
(GRUNTING)

647
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,749
Malcolm, I told you
to turn the camera off!

648
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,784
I know. I'm shit.

649
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,420
But, baby, I was tearin'
it up last night. (WHOOPS)

650
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,698
Oh, please.
You were all right.

651
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,060
Baby, check this move.
Look at that.

652
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,653
Malcolm, I need you
to erase this tape.

653
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,566
I don't wanna end
up on the Internet.

654
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

655
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,269
Rewind the video.

656
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,602
Okay.

657
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,608
Did you see that?
Uh-huh.

658
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,997
See, I call that move
the Tornado.

659
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,406
No, stupid!

660
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,642
Look! The door, it moved.
You see?

661
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,046
MALCOLM: Oh, wow.

662
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,384
Well, there is a rational
explanation for all that.

663
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,649
See, what happens is,
with the Tornado, right,

664
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,452
the vortex in
which I move my hips,

665
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,084
especially with
a downward motion,

666
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,923
it creates that vortex.

667
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,293
I'm surprised the windows
didn't blow open.

668
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,195
You are stupid.
Sometimes it does that.

669
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,062
See, I'm working on a whole natural
disaster theme for me and you.

670
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,300
We gonna start with
the Mudslide tonight.

671
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,498
Or the Earthquake.
Earthquake is crazy!

672
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:45,064
'Cause I just get in and I shake up in
there, fast as I can. I just shake.

Malcolm!

676
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,070
Malcolm, come here, please!

677
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,490
Quick! What happened?
What happened?

678
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,388
Okay, so the glass was on
the counter, and then it...

679
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,724
Something knocked it off!

680
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,196
How do you explain that?

681
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,728
Well, maybe you put it
on the edge of the counter,

682
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,825
and it just slipped off.

683
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,365
Last night,
it was the door, Malcolm.

684
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,669
And then, this morning,
the pot was on the floor.

685
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,002
Maybe it wasn't put
on the rack properly.

686
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,842
All right, I'll take credit for that.
Lord knows you don't cook.

687
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,541
Oh, I love you, but stop.
Be careful.

688
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,741
You're gonna get
glass in your foot

689
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,079
and be trackin' blood
all through the house

690
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,585

Do you believe
me now, Malcolm? Hmm?

693
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,554
Maybe it was your vortex.

694
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,960
Oh, God.

That was just
the house settling.

703
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,844
No big thing.
Just go back to sleep.

'cause of the Tornado.

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,551
Oh, man!
Get off of me.

802
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,587
What are you doing?

803
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,623
I don't know
what just happened.

804
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,815
That was so scary.

805
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,817
Okay, you guys. This is a
simple channeling exercise.

806
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,293
Okay.

807
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,455
This is creepy.
Shh.

808
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,557
All right, Kisha, now just breathe.
Relax.

809
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,966
Do you feel anything?

810
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,560
No, not really.

811
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,629
What about you, Malcolm?

812
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,566
Just your dick in my back.

813
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,002
Well, that's a start.

814
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,079
Now, there are two kinds
of paranormal entities.

815
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:56,245
I specialize in the good ones.

816
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,755
Okay, yeah, like
Casper the Friendly Ghost.

817
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,188
Oh!
Yeah, he's fun.

818
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,625
And also Patrick Swayze
from Ghost.

819
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,458
(GASPS) I love that movie.

820
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,623
Yes, that one was
really moving.

821
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,224
Especially with the clay, and
he'd work the clay and just...

822
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,733
(SPITS) And he just
fuckin' has it, and...

823
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,305
Demons, though, are bad.

824
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,532
Those are pure,
pure, pure evil.

825
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,841
And they will pop up
at the worst possible times.

826
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,938
You know, like herpes.

827
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,650
What?

828
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,313
What are you looking at me for?

829
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,286
All I'm saying is,
do not aggravate a demon.

830
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,794
Do not try to contact them,

831
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,195
and whatever you do,
do not film them.

832
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,763
That will only
make things worse.

833
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,995
See? Don't film demons.

834
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,866
Very bad.
Okay.

835
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,905
Well, thanks a lot
for coming out, man.

836
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,809
Is there anything you
wanna get off your chest?

837
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,003
No, I'm good.

838
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,635
Is there anything you
want to put on my chest?

839
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,179
Huh? Wait'll you see
the clay scene.

840
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,544
Wait, wait. Uh...

841
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,649
I have a confession to make.

842
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,185
Yep, herpes!
I knew it.

843
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,686
Oh! Ick!
No, I don't!

844
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,015
But did I mention that I made
a deal with the devil

845
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,060
for a pair of
really cool Louboutins?

846
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,891
You made a deal with the
devil for a pair of shoes?

847
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,932
Not shoes, Malcolm!
Louboutins, okay?

848
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,333
They've got red soles,
and they make my calves pop!

849
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,338
(GROWLS)

850
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,840
Well, I really
needed them, okay?

851
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:28,140
You are screwed, sista,

852
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,577
with an "A."

853
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,515
This demon is not leaving this
house until it gets what it wants.

854
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,347
What's that?

855
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,910
Kisha.

856
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,788
You're fine, Malcolm.

857
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,155
Like, you're free to
be whoever you want.

858
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,484
It's a five-man
wrestling league.

859
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,550
I'm good.

860
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,653
It's so fun.

861
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,851
I bet it is.
It's not for me.

862
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,229
And everyone's really good.
Really?

863
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,561
Yeah, no, but it's competitive.

Okay. All right.

867

(SIGHS) Malcolm, (GASPS) something
is going to happen to you

868
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,747
that is going to change you.

869
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,742
Don't fight it.

870
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,258
Whatever it is,
don't fight it, okay?

871
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,310
Okay, I won't. I won't.
I can save you.

872
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,117
It's five guys.
We wrestle on Monday.

873
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,247
Okay.

874
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,087
I can save you.
No, thank you.

880
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,626
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

881
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,261
Why... Why didn't you tell me
this, like, on the first date?

882
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,431
Because you never would have
gone out with me again.

883
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,168
Exactly!

884

How long has this
been happening to you?

a nigger in or what?

Uh, I'm sorry, Father.
Come in.

Damn. Standing out here, nigger.
It's cold as hell.

Ooh.

Uh, bro, I'm gonna have
to level with you.

Uh, I... I can't leave her.
That's my girl.

Are you kidding me?
Come on, man.

pussy in the world, man.

be with just her.

I'm here to
exorcise your bitch, man.

So you wanna go in the room.
All the way in?

Her hair's all crazy.

right now, but I'm not.

that I don't have
the right stuff.

Do you have,
like, a loaded gun?

something a while back.

You gotta earn it.

You so hard, dawg!"

it's your
technique that's sloppy.

And I don't mean like,
"I saw my dead nana" scary,

of meth in the glove box

01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,722
I got a little something.

1735
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,161
DAN: What's going on?

1736
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:38,232
That's a demon party.
Yeah, look out.

1737
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,165
(SNIFFS)
(GRUNTS)

1738
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,596
What is this, 1985?

1739
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:44,900
Is there just one demon?

1740
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,033
'Cause I feel like we could
exorcise any demons in the area.

1741
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,168
What? I'll take on
a whole team of demons.

1742
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,576
What we should do is get
all the demons in one room

1743
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:51,670
and get rid of them
all at once.

1744
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,214
Do a collective
demon-gathering.

1745
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:54,741
We just walk up
to people's doors,

1746
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:55,875
"How you doing?
How you doing?"

1747
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,077
"Can we talk to you
about the Lord today?"

1748
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,881
"We heard y'all got demons up in there.
What's up?"

1749
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,114
Can I get in
the bed with your girl?

1750
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:03,056
I used to braid hair. I could
actually braid her hair right now.

1751
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,386
I'll be hitting her with some
Allen Iversons and stuff.

1752
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,155
I'll give her some Sprewells.
I'll take it back.

1753
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:11,032
Let's do a little exorcism.

1754
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,531
All right, "Blessed is he

1755

who, in the name of
charity and goodwill,

1756
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:22,110
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness."

1757
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:26,111
"For he is truly
his brother's keeper

1758
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,115
and the finder
of lost children."

1759
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:32,910
"And you will know
my name is the Lord

1760

when I lay my
vengeance upon you!"

1761
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,789
Did you just quote
Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction?

You got that. You got me on that.
You got me on that one!

1764
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:48,834
I love Sam Jackson, dawg.

1765
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,665
The Jheri curl will be
dripping and everything.

1766
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,297
Plus, on the plane movie.

1767
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,409
When he was on the plane
and he killed the snakes.

1768
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,977
That's my favorite movie.

we're here for, right?

Yes, go back to the thing that
got us here in the first place.

I want the demon that's in you to
come out and holler at a brother.
