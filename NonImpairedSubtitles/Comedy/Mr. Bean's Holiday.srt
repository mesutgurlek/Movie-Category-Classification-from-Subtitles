Beleived to have abducted the son of Cannes Film Festival,
Jury member Emil Dechevsky

A positive Id of the boy was made
at a service station yesterday

78
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:03,359
The police now believe ότι that the man
is travelling with a female accomplice

79
01:04:03,442 --> 01:04:07,401
A national manhunt has been launched
and stop and search procedures....across France

80
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:21,213

85
01:04:33,882 --> 01:04:35,761
You know the whole of France is looking for you

86
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:37,785
And now they look for me too

87
01:04:38,595 --> 01:04:40,264

88
01:04:45,706 --> 01:04:47,287
To the Beach

89

We take him there

91
01:05:36,843 --> 01:05:38,225
And the beach?

92
01:05:39,093 --> 01:05:40,307
Forget the beach

93
01:05:40,496 --> 01:05:42,198
I have only one scene in this movie

94
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:46,085
And I am not going to miss this Premiere
not for you not for the Police

95
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:49,206

96
01:06:19,804 --> 01:06:20,804
Bonjour Madame

97
01:06:22,496 --> 01:06:23,670

101
01:09:28,342 --> 01:09:30,480
Papa

102
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:33,240
Where is his father?

103
01:10:34,808 --> 01:10:36,555
A look this is my scene

104
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:58,441
He cut my scene

105
01:13:05,734 --> 01:13:06,881
It's Mr Carson Clay

106
01:13:53,477 --> 01:13:55,496
Where is he?
Where is the projectionist?

107
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,004
Stop

108
01:14:54,233 --> 01:14:55,541
He stole my son

109
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:57,614
No he didn't

110
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:00,817
Where is my son?
Where is he?

111
01:15:02,687 --> 01:15:04,135
Here

112
01:15:38,643 --> 01:15:41,659
A strange thing happens when you
are making a work of art

113
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:48,204
Don't quite see the elements come together 
and then when it all comes together 

114
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:51,658
there is something magical, or something 
organic, such a thing happened today

115
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:53,831
And everyone said this wouldn't work

116
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:58,935
They said it was a terrible risk but I wanna 
keep on making films just like this

117
01:15:59,777 --> 01:16:06,489
The video film combination it's something that's realy 
been done before but not quite like this

118
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:13,416
I am glad the reception was so great 
and I am just happy to be here

119
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:15,917
Vive La France
Bless you

120
01:18:00,112 --> 01:18:04,057
Come and see what I made
