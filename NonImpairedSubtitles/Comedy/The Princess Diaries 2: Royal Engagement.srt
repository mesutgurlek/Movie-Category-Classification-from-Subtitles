1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,787
<i>(man)</i> Although your diplomas
are equally specific, remember:

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,920
You are all going out
into the world as individuals.

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,365
I now proudly present

4
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:39,065
this year's Woodrow Wilson School
of Public and International Affairs

5
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,471
graduating class.

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,752
Go, go, go.

7
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,726
- Bye. We love you.
- You have to write.

8
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,595
- Thank your mom for all the cookies, OK?
- I'm very proud of you.

00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,038
<i>(Mia) Dear diary.</i>

10
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:20,512
<i>Well, it's me. Brand-new</i>
<i>college graduate-slash-princess.</i>

11
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,741
<i>Oh, I can't believe it's been five years</i>

12
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,684
<i>since Grandma told me</i>
<i>that I was a princess.</i>

13
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:32,316
Me? A... a princess? Shut up.

14
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,486
<i>And right after that,</i>
<i>my mother surprised me</i>

15
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,123
<i>by marrying my high-school teacher,</i>
<i>Patrick O'Connell.</i>

16
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:44,227
<i>It must be going well,</i>
<i>because they are now expecting a baby.</i>

17
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,603
<i>Lilly's remained the same,</i>
<i>as she continues to cause turmoil,</i>

18
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,165
<i>but now as a graduate</i>
<i>student at Berkeley.</i>

19
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,803
<i>Which she calls "Berserkeley."</i>

20
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,709
<i>"How's Michael?"you may ask.</i>

21
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,846
<i>Well, we're just friends now, as he</i>
<i>went off to tour the country with his band.</i>

22
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,513
Princess Mia.

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,651
Look out the window,
and welcome back to Genovia.

24
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,701
<i>Oh, there it is. My beautiful Genovia.</i>

25
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:25,144
<i>Of course, I'm completely excited to be</i>
<i>going back, but I'm also a bit nervous.</i>

26
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,202
<i>(man) Genovia One has landed.</i>

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,306
<i>(Mia) Grandma Clarisse will step down</i>
<i>by the end of this year as queen,</i>

28
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,011
<i>and I'll be taking over, since I'm now 21.</i>

29
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,077
<i>Mira, la princesa Mia.</i>

30
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,056
It's the princess from America! Hi.

31
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,887
<i>(man) Viva la princesa.</i>

32
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,793
<i>I know I studied diplomacy</i>
<i>and political science at school, but...</i>

33
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:48,493
<i>there is no course in "Queen,"</i>
<i>or "How To Run A Country 101."</i>

34
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,971
<i>But Grandma's going to help me, and</i>
<i>I'll take over when she thinks I'm ready.</i>

35
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,907
<i>Of course, I wonder... will I ever be ready?</i>

36
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:01,106
<i>In the meantime, I'm going to live</i>
<i>in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale,</i>

37
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,675
<i>and eventually sit on a throne</i>
<i>and rule the people of Genovia.</i>

38
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,913
<i>Is that scary or what?</i>

39
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,445
<i>Well, maybe Fat Louie</i>
<i>can give me some help.</i>

40
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,423
Her Royal Highness Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi

41
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,228
has arrived.

42
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,098
Welcome home, Princess.

43
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,840
And her royal pussycat, Sir Fat Louie.

44
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,875
<i>The one downer in my fairy tale</i>
<i>is I've never been in love.</i>

45
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,511
Countess Puck of Austria.

46
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,653
<i>However, this evening</i>
<i>is my 21st-birthday party,</i>

47
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:49,821
<i>and our tradition says I have to dance</i>
<i>with all the eligible bachelors in Genovia.</i>

48
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,627
<i>So maybe I'll meet</i>
<i>my Prince Charming tonight.</i>

49
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,862
<i>(woman)</i> The queen is coming.

50
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,805
Here she comes. Look alive.

51
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,240
Places.

52
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,744
She'll have a double-door entrance.

53
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,940
The eagle is flying.
Repeat, the eagle is flying.

54
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,347
She's in the foyer.

55
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,592
Beautiful.

56
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,262
But you're late, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:37,366
A queen is never late.
Everyone else is simply early.

58
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,967
Of course.

59
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,071
<i>(man)</i> Her Majesty
Clarisse Renaldi,

60
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,276
Queen of Genovia.

00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,342
<i>(fanfare)</i>

62
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,292
Greetings, good friends.

63
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,769
I am delighted
to welcome you here this evening.

64
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,863
<i>(</i>* <i>chamber music)</i>

65
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:15,108
- Thank you.
- I hope they have string cheese.

66
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,546
Ah, good.

67
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:24,121
Many of you will remember King Rupert's
and my granddaughter, Princess Mia.

68
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,455
<i>(all)</i> King Rupert. May he rest in peace.

69
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,928
Will you please
raise your glasses in celebration

70
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,933
of Princess Mia's 21 st birthday.

71
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:41,167
Presenting Her Royal Highness
Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi,

72
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,073
Princess of Genovia.

73
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,736
<i>(drumroll)</i>

74
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,707
<i>(fanfare)</i>

75
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,793
To Princess Mia.

76
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,890
<i>(all)</i> To Princess Mia.

77
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,465
- It happens all the time.
- Oh!

78
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,339
- And happy birthday.
- Thank you.

79
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,213
<i>(speaks Greek)</i>

80
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,242
- Oh, I don't speak Greek.
- <i>(speaks Greek)</i>

81
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,813
- And you obviously don't speak English.
- <i>(speaks Greek)</i>

82
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,860
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

83
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,657
One, two, three. One, two, three.

84
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,459
- One, two...
- Ow!

85
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,829
Sorry.

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,232
<i>(muttering in French)</i>

87
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,573
- Have you met the princess yet?
- Briefly. But she wasn't very friendly.

88
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:55,080
I got a hello and a goodbye.
Is this an American custom?

89
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,449
- I saw that.
- Oh, uh...

90
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,550
<i>(squealing)</i>

91
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,254
Oh, I've missed you.

92
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,262
- Sebastian.
- Majesty.

93
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,423
- Sheila.
- Majesty.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,594
- What have you been up to?
- Oh, just partying, girl. You know.

95
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,997
Oh, your foot. I'm so sorry. Are...

96
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,471
Are you all right?

97
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,236
I'll survive, Your Highness.

98
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,642
The fault was entirely my own. I apologize.

99
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,204
Are you sure you don't want to
exchange licenses and proof of insurance?

100
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,615
No, no. These shoes
were a little big anyway.

101
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,983
The swelling should help them fit better.

102
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,923
Hey, get a load of this guy.

103
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,398
Shimmy shimmy.

104
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,832
Hey, hey, hey. <i>Bitte.</i>

105
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,341
- You are a beautiful dancer.
- Oh, why, thank you so much.

106
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,070
Like a deer.

107
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,942
Or a chipmunk in the forest.

108
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,107
Looks like he's trying to land a plane.

109
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:08,279
Woodland animals
are a lovely thing to be compared to.

110
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,345
May I?

111
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,421
- Your timing is impeccable. Thank you.
- You're welcome, Your Highness.

112
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,897
Mia. I like to be called Mia.

113
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,198
And you are?

114
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,361
Nicholas. Just Nicholas.

115
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,533
Well, I'm very glad to see that my
clumsiness hasn't affected your dancing.

116
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,236
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot.

117
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,574
You can step on my foot anytime.

118
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,208
Aww.

119
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,417
It is Prince Jacques' turn.

120
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,052
Your Highness.

121
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,792
If this were my party,
we'd be kissing by now.

122
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,599
That's Prince Jacques.
He's about 12 years old.

123
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,766
He's a very precocious prince.

124
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,505
He wears aftershave
to make people think that he's older.

125
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,013
May I blow in your ear?

126
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,675
Can you reach it?

127
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,987
Princess, there's someone
from parliament you should meet.

128
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,456
Charlotte, how many
members of parliament are there?

129
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,686
Only two left, Your Highness.

130
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,030
- Cake, ladies?
- Oh, dear.

131
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,725
Oh, Your Highness, pardon me,
I am so sorry. It was only an accident.

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,566
It's fine, it's fine.
No harm, no foul, no bruise.

133
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,662
Thank you so much.

134
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,505
You should be more careful,
Your Royal Highness.

135
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,602
Somebody might try
to take that away from you.

136
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,479
Oh, I hope not.
But thank you so much for all your help.

137
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,447
Someone like me.

138
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,019
<i>Welcome back to "Eggs with Elsie."</i>

139
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,386
<i>I'm Elsie Kentworthy,</i>
<i>and today's topic is Princess Mia.</i>

140
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,190
Hi. How's it going?

141
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,130
- So sorry, I thought I was alone.
- No, Miss.

142
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,861
I'm Brigitte, if it pleases you.
At your service.

143
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,427
- And I'm Brigitta, Miss.
- Brigitte and Brigitta, I'm Mia.

144
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,030
And, please, you don't...
Don't curtsy like that.

145
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,010
- Not like this? How do you like it, then?
- Like this, maybe?

146
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,639
No, no, no, I didn't mean, like, you know...

147
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,445
No, no, not that way. I didn't mean it, um...

148
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:22,283
The queen bids you good morning,
Princess. She's in session with parliament.

149
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,516
- OK.
- I see you've met your lady's maids.

150
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,820
Yeah. Um...

151
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,461
- How do you turn off the curtsies?
- Oh.

152
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,463
Enough bowing. Back to your chores.

153
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,500
Her Majesty will meet you
in one hour at the throne room.

154
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,230
- OK.
- I'm sorry your suite isn't ready yet.

155
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,965
But you're welcome
to stay here in Her Majesty's suite...

156
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,870
No, no, no, no, it's fine. It's...

157
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,342
Hey, can I explore
the palace a little bit?

158
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,969
- Of course.
- <i>(dog barks)</i>

159
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,106
Oh. Well, you've met Maurice.

160
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,809
<i>(Mia)</i> Hey, Mo.

161
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,614
The throne room, in an hour.

162
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,987
The parliament of Genovia is in session.
Prime Minister Motaz presiding.

163
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,552
Viscount Mabrey, you have the floor.

164
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,925
<i>(man) Monsieur Mabrey, s'il vous plait.</i>

165
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:09,992
As we all know, the 21 st birthday
of an heir to the Genovian bloodline

166
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,334
is indeed a matter
of great public significance.

167
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:18,810
It signifies that this young person
is eligible to assume the crown.

168
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,279
Indeed, we are well aware of this, Viscount.

169
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,112
The queen has already
indicated that Princess Mia

170
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:30,087
intends to learn more at her side
before assuming the throne.

171
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:34,589
It was not Princess Mia
to whom I was referring.

172
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,912
Oh, wow.

173
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,717
King Chevalier

174
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,784
was the great-great-great-grandfather of...

175
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,454
Hello?

176
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,260
Ah... Oh.

177
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,824
<i>(clears throat)</i>

178
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,699
Proceed.

179
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,833
<i>(gasps)</i>

180
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,812
Nice.

181
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,147
Hello?

182
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,336
<i>(Mabrey)</i> So.

183
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,036
As of the 20th of October last year,

184
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,845
on the occasion of his 21 st birthday,

185
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:10,753
another Genovian of the royal bloodline
became eligible to assume the throne.

186
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,222
What?

187
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,226
My nephew, Lord Devereaux.

188
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,785
I beg your pardon?

189
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,822
My nephew's mother was my wife's sister.

190
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,637
Therefore, Your Majesty,
I am pleased to say

191
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:29,071
that my nephew
is ready to take his place

192
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,133
as Genovia's rightful king.

193
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,181
Shut up.

194
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,774
I beg your pardon?

195
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:44,482
- I mean...
- "Shut up" doesn't always mean shut up.

196
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,024
<i>"Taisez-vous" veut dire...</i>

197
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,025
In America, it's like
"Oh, my," "Gee whiz," "Wow."

198
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,256
- <i>"Fantastique," "Superbe," "Oy vey."</i>
- Yeah, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

199
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,925
But isn't Princess Mia
first in line to ascend the throne?

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,297
Not yet.

201
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:00,168
Genovian law states
that a princess must marry

202
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,867
before she can take the throne.

203
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,502
<i>(Clarisse)</i> We have never
enforced that law.

204
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,513
A man doesn't have to marry to be king.

205
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,345
I mean, this is the 21 st century,
for heaven's sake.

206
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:15,615
My granddaughter should
be given the same rights as any man.

207
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,212
Yeah!

208
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:27,226
Genovia shall have no queen
lest she be bound in matrimony.

209
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,694
Lord Palimore?

210
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:35,331
That is the law of Genovia
for the last 300 years.

211
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,867
Princess Mia is not qualified to rule
because she is unmarried.

212
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,379
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

213
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,542
Not all of us are sure that the princess

214
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:51,215
is the most suitable choice
to govern our great nation.

215
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,019
<i>(all)</i> Ooh!

216
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,151
Now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.

217
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,162
I suggest this honored body

218
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,427
allow Princess Mia one year,

219
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,593
during which time she must marry,

220
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,901
or she forfeits the throne
of Genovia to young Lord Devereaux.

221
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,338
What? No.

222
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,377
- I object. I object most strongly.
- One year?

223
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,036
- 60 days.
- Two months.

224
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,512
60 days?

225
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,310
30 days.

226
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,851
How could parliament expect me
to fall in love in 30 days? It's like...

227
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,656
It's like it's a big trick to get me
to have an arranged marriage, or...

228
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,354
No.

229
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,091
No, there's no...
That's it, there's no "or." There's... I...

230
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,225
An arranged marriage is my only choice.

231
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,500
What kind of person
agrees to an arranged marriage?

232
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,738
Uh...

233
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,801
You agreed to an arranged marriage.

234
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,211
- Right.
- Yes, I did.

235
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,010
And it turned out quite splendidly.

236
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,923
He was my best friend.
We grew very fond of each other.

237
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,619
I'm sure, Grandma, but...

238
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,926
I dream of love, not fondness.

239
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:11,197
But you don't have to do this, Mia.
You don't have to become queen.

240
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,270
This is so unfair.

241
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,144
<i>(man's voice) Amelia.</i>

242
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,583
<i>(both)</i> Courage is not the absence of fear,

243
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:34,390
<i>(alone)</i> but rather the judgment
that something else is more important...

244
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,792
than fear.

245
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,129
There are 550 years
of Renaldis on these walls.

246
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,872
And I will be up there
next to my father.

247
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,638
I'm sure I want my chance
to make a difference as a ruler.

248
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,143
Spoken like a true queen.

249
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,157
You, my boy, a true-born Genovian.

250
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,196
You should be our king.

251
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,555
I agree.

252
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:17,295
But how can we make it happen?

253
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,294
Give me one of your arrows.

254
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,933
I'm going to show you a trick that
I learned from an old Italian philosopher.

255
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,874
Niccolo Machiavelli.

256
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:31,644
I can make this dart
hit the bull's-eye every time.

257
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,410
<i>(yells)</i>

258
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,723
Yes, but that is cheating.

259
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,761
You've got it.

260
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:47,489
Lord Devereaux will be arriving shortly,
Mrs. Kout, with his snake of an uncle.

261
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,767
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,700
- Your Majesty.
- Hm?

263
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,672
I know Lionel is the prime minister's
nephew and he's interning for the summer

264
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,505
because he wants to learn about security.

265
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,911
But he never leaves my side.
He sticks to me like Velcro, madam.

266
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,212
It won't last very long.
He returns to school in the autumn.

267
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,549
- He wants an audience with you.
- What, now?

268
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,611
Now.

269
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,680
Lionel?

270
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,184
Short.

271
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,628
I don't know if you've met
Mrs. Kout, our housekeeper,

272
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,031
and Priscilla and Olivia, my lady's maids.

273
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,899
I'm doing a background check on Olivia.

274
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,098
Oh, that's not necessary, Lionel.

275
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,108
Everybody in this room
has high-priority clearance.

276
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,610
Of course, of course.

277
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,147
- Your Majesty?
- Hm?

278
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,207
I would gladly take a bullet for you.

279
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,047
Oh, how brave.

280
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,146
Most interns don't even
want to fetch me my tea.

281
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,192
The limousine is at the gates, madam.

and keep your eye on him at all times.

- Of course. Lionel.
- Oh, hello.

285
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,874
So is this all right to welcome
the viscount and his nephew?

286
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,777
Very appropriate. And pretty.

287
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,806
Oh, I can't believe
parliament invited the guy

288
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,853
who's trying to steal the throne
to stay here with us at the palace.

289
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,150
Oh, no, parliament didn't invite him.

290
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,985
I did.

Wha...

292
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,986
I offered to have him
hung by his toes in our courtyard.

293
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,622
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, what about Joe's suggestion, huh?

294
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:32,728
No. If there's any mischief going on,
I'd prefer it be right under my nose.

Ah, well, have you met him?

- No.
- Neither have I.

00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,527
Yeah, but he probably is, Grandma.
I mean...

303
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,162
Like, now, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
he wants to be the king of Genovia?

00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,359
- Your Highness.
- Mabrey.

310
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:35,130
Ma'am, may I introduce my nephew,
Lord Nicholas Devereaux.

311
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,533
Nicholas. We are delighted
to make your acquaintance.

312
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,266
Your Majesty, the pleasure is all mine.

313
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,503
And thank you so much
for inviting me to stay at the palace.

314
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,568
May I present my granddaughter Mia.

315
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,647
Your Highness.

316
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,383
Mia, would you care to welcome our guest?

317
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,726
Lord Nicholas.

318

<i>(Lionel sniggers)</i>

319
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,735
She always does that.

320
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:13,771
Uh...

321
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,467
I will personally
get some ice for that foot,

322
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,033
and I'll be with you
as quickly as I possibly can.

323
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,139
An accident.

324
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,206
Of course.

325
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,519
She's training to be a flamenco dancer.

326
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,926
Would you care to explain
what was going on out there?

327
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,485
Sorry.

328
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,795
I, uh, have met Lord Nicholas, actually.

329
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,066
Yep. At the ball. Didn't know
who he was, so, you know, we...

330
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,836
We danced, and I flirted.

331
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,173
I feel so stupid right now.

332
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,614
I see. Well, as your queen
I absolutely cannot condone it.

333
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,446
As a grandma, I say, "right on."

334
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,350
Now, if you'll come with me,
I have something to show you.

335
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,589
- Oh, yeah.
- I think you could leave that right there.

336
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,357
Uh... Yeah.

337
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,592
Thank you, culinary people.

338
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,759
<i>(whispers)</i> I'll be back.

339
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,731
The renovations for your suite
are finally finished.

340
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,001
Should have been ready for you
when you arrived,

341
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:28,570
but unfortunately we asked
Rupert's cousin to do the bathroom.

342
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:33,949
It's a good lesson. Nepotism
belongs in the arts, not in plumbing.

343
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,323
This is your very own suite.

344
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,453
- Are you serious? This is...
- Mm-hm.

345

<i>(gasps)</i>

346
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,630
- This is my room?
- Yes.

347
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,172
Oh, Grandma.

348
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,175
This is very nice.

349
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,234
Good.

350
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,082
We just made the bed.

351
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,952
This is so cool.

352
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,689
<i>(Clarisse)</i> Ah, Fat Louie. I think
he rather likes his new abode as well.

353
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,096
There's more.

354
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,639
- Is that mine?
- Why don't you go and find out?

355
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,647
OK.

356
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,047
I have my own mall.

357
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,618
Ooh, very nice shoes.

358
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:49,058
<i>(Clarisse)</i> I'm glad you like it.
Try pressing button number three.

359
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,822
Oh.

360
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,894
They're charming. I love these.

361
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,631
What do you think? Grandma?

362
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,196
I'm here.

363
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,641
Oh, hello. Ooh, love that.

364

366

Um... They're a little... gorgeous.

367
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,231
<i>(Clarisse)</i> I had a selection
of the crown jewels brought out for you.

368
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:34,136
They're yours to borrow,
with great discretion, at appropriate times.

369
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,835
Now for the best surprise of all.

370
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,115
Wow.

371
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:49,517
Gorgeous, Grandma. But kind of a letdown
after the jewels, I'm not gonna lie...

372
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,453
<i>(screams)</i>

- You're here.
- I know I'm here.

375
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,427
- You're in Genovia.
- I know.

376
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,468
- You're in my closet.
- Yeah.

377
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,400
- You're blonde.
- I'm blonde.

378
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,335
I'm so glad to see you.

379
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,033
I think this is
as good a moment as any to bow out.

380
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,838
I think I'll let you two ladies
catch up with each other.

381
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,538
<i>(Mia)</i> I can't believe you're here.
When did your flight get in?

382
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,103
- Just a little while ago.
- Oh.

383
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,672
By the way... I'm getting married.

- To who?
- I don't know.

386
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,190

He's a compulsive gambler.

Yes. Oh, yes,
I, I, I, I absolutely accept.

389
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:39,600
Prince William. He's not eligible,
because he's in line for his own crown.

390
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,865
Oh.

391
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,397
If he's not eligible,
why is he included in these pictures?

392
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:48,742
- I just love to look at him.
- Mm. Me too. Mm-mm.

393
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,906
- Your Majesty.

- Uh-huh.

00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,145
Plays the harp. No title, but good family.

396
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,247
- What about the title "husband"?
- Yeah, he's cute.

397
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,986
Mm. His boyfriend
thinks he's handsome also.

398

Right on.

399
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:07,328
No matter. Put him on
all the invitation lists. He's a divine dancer.

400

Too young.

- Does this popcorn taste like pears?
- Mm. Genovian specialty.

- <i>(Joe)</i> Arrested too many times.
- Wait, no.

405
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,666
We need someone titled,

406
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:24,909
someone who can help you run a country
without ego getting in the way.

407
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:29,317
Someone attractive, smart,
but not arrogant.

408
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,780
Someone with compassion.

409
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,018
Someone like him?

410
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,893
Yes. Someone very much like him.

411
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,627
Good choice, Mia.
I wonder I didn't think of him before.

412
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,261
- Andrew Jacoby.
- Duke of Kenilworth.

413

Aw.

414
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,469
Well, he looks... decent.

- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

425

Wait, Mia. A princess
should not run for a scarf.

I got it.

I felt it could be lucky for us, maybe.

465
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,789
- Do I have to put it on myself?
- No, I could do that.

466
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,849
- OK.
- Yes.

467
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,655
Oh, my goodness. It was a ring.

468
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,695
A royal proposal has been made.

469

- If you are.

<i>(Nicholas) Uncle, I hate to say this,</i>
<i>but you were wrong.</i>

475

Princess Mia has managed
to find a husband within a week.

476
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,256
Mia cannot possibly be happy
with the idea of an arranged marriage.

477
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,357
Your task is to romance her.

478
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,598
Show her what
a real relationship could be like.

479
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,333
A relationship filled with heat and passion.

480
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:21,202
- And change her mind about Andrew.
- Exactly.

481
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,649
And the 30-day deadline expires,
and the throne is ours.

482
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,743
And you're sure my father wanted this?

483
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,380
It was his dearest wish.

484
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,515
His last words to me were:

485
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:37,357
"Help him, Arthur.
One day he could be king."

486
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,258
I don't recall him
ever mentioning that to me.

487
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,096
Well, you wouldn't.
You were only six years old when he died.

488
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,534
But you do remember
who he named you after, don't you?

489
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,003
Yes. Grandfather Nicholas.

No, no, no, no. Niccolo Machiavelli.

491

Power, my boy,
means never having to say you're sorry.

Here, kitty kitty kitty. Come here, kitty kitty.

493
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,049
Yes. Thank you.

494
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,715
Thank you.

It was Andrew's grandmother's.

No, no.

You are the one

Big feet?

511

Well, you know,

517
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,796
Mia, I would remind you
that we only danced for about a minute.

518
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,305
It was more than a minute.

519

Well, maybe a minute and a half.

520
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,446
Fine. It was a minute and a half,
but it was also a lie,

521
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,915
because you didn't tell me who you were
and that you were trying to steal my crown.

522
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,885
Please pardon me, I just had
a momentary lapse of good manners.

523
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,890
You see, usually, when I ask a woman
to dance, I always show her my family tree.

00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,688
Oh. Well, aren't you just...

One has to be fair and very honest.

616

you have to show the people you care.

617

<i>(woman)</i> Citizen Jacqueline Grenough.

618
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,336
We will review
your scholarship application,

619
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,346

no later than the end of next week.

Oh, <i>merci,</i> Your Majesty.

621

Here is a melon for your table.

622
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,449
Oh, <i>merci,</i> Jacqueline. <i>C'est gentil.</i>

- <i>Bonjour,</i> Tiny.

625

May I present
my granddaughter, Princess Mia.

626

- Princess Mia.
- Monsieur.

627
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,666
Thank you for seeing me today.
Something for your table.

628
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,363
Thank you.

629
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,736
She's my favorite.

630
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,105
I hope you like omelets.

631
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,542
- May I?
- Of course.

632
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,341
Be careful.

633
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,713
- Aw, it's a chicken.
- Careful.

634
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,086
We have a chicken situation
in the throne room.

635
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,332
Mia.

636
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,267
Yeah?

637
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,966
A princess never chases a chicken.

638

<i>(Mia) Dear diary.</i>

639

<i>The whole court</i>

<i>And I'm wearing a floor-length dress.</i>

642
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,882
<i>I also have to be ladylike</i>
<i>while riding sidesaddle. Hah!</i>

643
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,293
- I can't ride sidesaddle.
- No, no, no.

644
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,593
I couldn't ride sidesaddle either
when I was your age,

645
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,498
and frankly, dear,
it is acutely uncomfortable.

646
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,935
Herbie is my riding companion.
Here he is.

647
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,297
Herbie.

648
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,280
- It's a wooden leg.
- Yes.

649
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:21,546
That is impressively sneaky, Grandma.
Did you come up with this on your own?

650
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,053
<i>Oh, no, it's a centuries-old idea.</i>

651
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,352
- <i>And you put the riding boot on it...</i>
- <i>Exactly.</i>

652
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,791
<i>Our ancestors knew</i>
<i>a thing or two, right?</i>

653
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,229
<i>You just drape your skirt over it</i>
<i>and nobody suspects a thing.</i>

Princess Amelia
Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi

656
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,406
reviews the Royal Guard of Genovia.

657
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:47,968
Now, the last time we spoke,
you mentioned that Princess Mia's horse,

658
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,776
Sandy, gets easily spooked by snakes.

659
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,842
So let's get it really spooked,
shall we?

660
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,478
This is a fake snake.

661
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,682
Oh, you're very observant.
A regular David Attenborough.

662
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,658
That's rubber, yes.
But it will spook the horse.

663
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,787
I'm Nick. Viscount Mabrey's nephew.

664

Ah, the chap who's trying
to stage the palace coup.

665
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,758
I'm Andrew Jacoby. Nice to meet you.

666
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:16,068
Lilly Moscovitz, official best friend
of future queen. I don't like you.

667
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,437
Pleasure.

668
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,999
Atten... hurgh!

669
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,110
I like all these men wearing helmets.

- Easy. Sandy, easy.
- Princess.

675
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,882
Princess. It's OK, Princess. I'm here.

676
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,421
No wonder she's so clumsy.
She's got a wooden leg.

677
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,557
<i>(laughs loudly)</i>

678
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,822
Talk about getting off on the wrong foot.

679

00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,744
You shouldn't hide.

682
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,311
It only makes them gossip more.

683
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,923
What do you want?

684
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:50,565
Just think, Mia. One more leg
and you could've easily outrun your horse.

685
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,966
I don't need this right now.

686
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,635
Mia, I'm...

687
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,505
I'm sorry, I...

688
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,705
No, you're not.
You never think about anyone but yourself.

689
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,841
So just this once,
can you please let me be miserable,

690
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,782
and not make me feel
worse about myself?

691
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:12,015
- Just go away. Go away, go away...
- Mia...

692
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:16,684
Princess, excuse me.
The queen has arrived.

693
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,720
Yes.

694
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,229
Nicholas.

695
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,206
Am I going to be disappointed in you?

696
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,312
Unfortunate incident, that.

697
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,473
I'm just leaving.
You going to come and see me off?

698
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:43,282
I'd like to speak
with your uncle alone, Nicholas. Please.

699
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:53,761
Viscount. You may not be aware of what
my job entails as the royal head of security.

700
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:58,859
My job is to protect the crown,
to make sure no harm comes to the crown.

701
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,895
To step in when someone toys
with the crown's emotions, you see.

702
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:09,139
I think the entire country understands how
well you cater for the crown's emotions.

703
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:16,110
If you hurt my girl,
you will answer directly to me.

704
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:19,212
And whatever crimes
I commit against you, remember:

705
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,747
I have diplomatic immunity
in 46 countries.

706
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,589
Including Puerto Rico.

707
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,598
Sir, you will find that the word "fear"
is not in my vocabulary.

708
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,293
Perhaps.

709
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,699
But it's in your eyes.

710
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,272
You forgot something.

711
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,371
- <i>Au revoir, Pierre, et merci beaucoup.</i>
- <i>Tres bien, Majeste.</i>

712
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:48,544
Nicholas, I...
I want to ask you a question.

713
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,179
Of course, Your Majesty.

714
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:55,658
Why are you so against
Princess Mia being queen?

715
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,786
Well, my uncle feels that
Princess Mia doesn't know the people.

716
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,456
And you feel you do know the people?

717
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,024
Yes. I was born here,
I went to primary school here.

718
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,195
I am a true Genovian.

719
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,330
Mia didn't even know
she was Genovian until high school,

720
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:13,172
and to be frank,
she's spent little time here since then.

721
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:17,179
Well, I happen to feel
that she'll make a great ruler.

722
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:20,683
She's terribly bright, sensitive, caring.

723
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,912
- I know that.
- You do?

724
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,946
Yes. Yes, I do. But...

725
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:30,653
How can one rule the people
if they do not know the people?

726
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,424
Touche. That's a very good question.
