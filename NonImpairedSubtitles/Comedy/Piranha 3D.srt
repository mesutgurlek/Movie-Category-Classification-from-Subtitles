1
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,640


2
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,760
It was a mistake. Can't we just work something out here?

3
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,280
Mistake or no mistake, you just destroyed private property.

4
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,920
And from the smell of your breath,
I suggest you take the ticket.

5
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Maybe get a ride home with your friends.

6
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,640
I don't know, I thought you'd take you home.

7
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Touching an officers uniform is considered an assault?

8
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
Were you aware of that?

9
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,280
You look pretty hot in tan.

10
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
It's not tan, it's beige!

11
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
Hey, take it easy!

12
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,560
Another step and you'll pissing lightning bolts into next week, ok?

13
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,120
Pretty much your average day in college

14
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,240
Hey Kelly, I wasn't sure you'd be coming back for spring break.

15
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,800
Yeah, I'm here

16
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
I can only assume you're down here
to get on one of those boats

17
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,960
No, I came down here to pick up
my little sister for music lessons.

18
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,240
What about yourself?

19
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm just waiting for my ride. Todd and his friends,
we're gonna go check out some music.

20
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
Todd Dupree?

21
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
Remind me who you're going out with again?

22
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,360
You gotta have standards ok, thats all I'm saying

23
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
Todd's a really good DJ.

24
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,680
Kelly! Let's go. Jump in we're late.

25
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,240
He says he's got backstage passes for Planners, you should come.

26
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,720
I would, but I'm pretty much under
house arrest with Shing Tsing and Laura.

27
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,000
Too bad

28
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,520
We'll miss you.

29
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,120
I gotta go.
- Come on, we gotta go!

30
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,360
I hope to see you before ...

31
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
... before you leave.
Pretty smooth Jake.

32
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,280
Hey asswipe! Cool shirt!

33
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Nice horn.
Thanks

34
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Nice boobs

35
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,440
Thanks

36
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,200
I have a training bra but I don't like to wear it, it itches.

37
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,600
Tell me about it.

38
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,920
Who are you waiting for?

39
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,800
My brother Jake. He's 17.

40
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,280
And he'll like your boobs too.
- They all do.

41
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,800
Come on, let's go.

42
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
What happened to you?

43
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,200
I don't want to talk about it, ok. Let's go.

44
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Hi Jake.

45
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,680
Try to not stare at her boobs.

46
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Shut up.

47
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
I like your shirt.

48
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,280
Why? You wanna throw something at me too?

49
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,920
No, actually I like The Pixies.

50
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,920
Danni, Danni, Danni, where the hell is Crystal?

51
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,240
She's over there with Andrew.

52
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,640
She went to buy sunscreen.

53
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,600
Sunscreen?

54
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
Andrew, Crystal, we don't need sunscreen.

55
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
We need body paint, condoms. We need Ready Whip

56
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,840
Tell her to come tomorrow I want bleach blonde
booty at the marina. I gotta get my first shot off by noon.

57
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,680
Make sure those titties are nice and perky!

58
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,760
Who's this?

59
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,040
This is Jake. He's a local.

60
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,280
Sandrat huh? You know your way around the lake?
-Yes.

61
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,800
You wanna job? I'll pay you cash.

62
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,560
No bullshit Jake.

63
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,880
My guide didn't show and I need somebody asap.

64
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,800
I need someone with ambition, someone who is willing to take chances ...

65
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,840
... If, you, know, what, I, mean.

66
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,240
Sir, you talk funny.

67
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Yeah, well, you're short! Hold on,
- This is Derick

68
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,040
Don't you disappoint me motherfucker. I told you!

69
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,280
I want the biggest Goddam boat this podunk town has to offer

70
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,680
Who is that?

71
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,200
Derick? He's the director.

72
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,760
So you're like a, er.. actress or what?

73
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
I am a 'Wild Wild Girl'.

74
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
What's a 'Wild Wild Girl', Jake?

75
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,720
Of course we know boats! Fuck the waiver! You signed the waiver!

76
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,240
So, Jake baby, are we gonna do this?

77
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
Do what?
- The job! Location scout! Get us around, show us the spots...

78
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,880
the G-spots.
I need a local.

79
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,480
I need you.

80
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,640
We're talking about life lesson here Jake.

81
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
Great, 10am, tomorrow. Don't be late.

82
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,040
And... wear a different shirt

83
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
I we'll see you tomorrow Jake.

84
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,320
Actually, tomorrow he's...

85
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,440
-Jake
Why'd you bother to knock, if you're just gonna walk straight in?

86
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,080
Am I disturbing you?

87
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,440
No, I'm just doing homework, and stuff for school.

88
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,200
Laura has been telling me that you may
have some other plans for tomorrow

89
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't know what she's talking about. I'm 100% baby-sitting.

90
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,400
What? No, we don't want babysitter.

91
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,680
Yeah mum. Especially not Jake.

92
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm serious, mum, we dont need one.

93
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,160
Out, out, out.

94
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,880
Jake, you know I don't have a backup.

95
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,680
I know mum. Don't worry, you know how crazy this week is for you.

96
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,400
And dont worry, I'll take care of the nitwits, ok?

97
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Remember, if you do not fulfill their responsibilities, I have power to arrest

98
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,680
and imprison you.

99
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,040
Mum, I'm not 12. playing on the sheriff card doesn't work.

100
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,560
No?
- No!

101
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,600
As I said, I'll take care of them, ok?

102
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
OK.

103
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,800
Now get outta here
-I promise next year I'll try to find another solution.

104
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,120
OK?
- Ok.

105
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,960
Oh and Jake.
-Come on Mum! Really?

106
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
It's time for dinner.

107
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,040
OK, alright, I'll be right there.

108
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,920
Hope I didn't wake the kids?

109
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,840
They'll sleep through anything.

110
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,040
So, Maggy said yesterday was the last time she saw him?

111
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,600
Yeah, just before midnight.

112
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,080
She said Matt took a boat to catch some bass.

113
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,560
She drove around the lake all night looking for him.

114
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,440
Where's the boat?.
- Over there.

115
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,640
Feeling like a skinny dip?

116
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,040
Yeah, if we can make it to the end of the pier

117
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,320
You mean I'm to old, or too heavy?

118
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,520
I think you're too chicken-shit!

119
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,880
By the way, Gordon called last night.

120
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,160
Yeah?

121
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,040
He said that U.S.G.S. recorded heavy seismic activity below the lake.

122
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,320
Really?

123
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah, they're sending in a team of seismologist divers

124
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,280
And he told them that you're gonna escort them out!

125
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,840
Jesus Christ.

126
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
We've just been invaded by 20,000 kids

127
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,040
makes us a little busy at the moment.

128
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
I know. That's what I told him

129
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,500
[creaking]

130
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,120
This doesnt sound too good

131
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,160
So, what time are the divers gonna get here?

132
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,760
He said around 10.

133
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,120
Shit.

134
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,640
Come on, just a little more.

135
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,520
I can't get it

136
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,020
- Jules!

137
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
Give me your hand!

138
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,560
Do you think a propeller could've done this?

139
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,600
I doubt it. Look at the bones. Nothing broken

140
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,640
It looks like toxic, are acidic decomposition

141
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,880
it's as it this body has been in the water for weeks

142
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,640
What would you say if I told that I'm
thinking about closing the lake?

143
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,600
...at least until we get an autopsy report
- An autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days

144
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,960
It'd be easier to drain this lake, than close it.

145
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,360
I's a big financial week for this town.

146
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
	I'm gettin too old for this

147
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,360
We're not liying to mum.
- Yeah, we won't lie to mum.

148
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,920
Come on guys, every year it's the same.
I'm stuck here with you

149
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,400
and miss all the spring break fun.

150
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,720
You mean spring break boobies!

151
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,600
What if I give you guys the cash for the baby-sitting?

152
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,960
Sixty bucks and you gotta deal.

153
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,680
Sixty? But I'm only getting paid forty.

154
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,920
Twenty dollar deception surcharge!

155
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,200
Don't pick up the phone, don't answer the door

156
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,000
and don't leave the house.

157
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,560
OK? I'm counting on you guys.

158
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Alright?

159
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Town rules son. You throw a peice of trash in the lake,
you gotta pick up 10 peices

160
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,120
After the dive, our presence is requested at 'Cocomos'
The Arizona State cheerleading team.

161
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,840
Hi, I'm Sheriff Forester.

162
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,920
Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site.

163
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,320
It's nice to have a welcoming committee around here

164
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,240
I assume that's technical equipment too?

165
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,920
Yeah, Sam, give them back.

166
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,360
According to the epicenter coordinates

167
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,080
we need to go here.

168
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,000
Ok, that's about 20 minutes out

169
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,880
Ready when you are.
-Alright

170
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,360
You dont see many women working Law Enforcement
out here in cowboy country.

171
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,080
You dont see a lot of cowboys though

172
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
Kelly.

173
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Jake.

174
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,600
Who exactly are you baby-sitting here?

175
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,240
This is a funny story actually.

176
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,680
Wow. Look at those idiots.

177
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,120
Yeah, it's terrible.

178
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,800
Sandrat! Hey Sandrat, I'm talking to you.

179
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Where the hell have you been? We've got the girls lubed up

180
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,160
We're ready to roll. I'm docking your paycheck!

181
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Let's go.

182
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,320
Now I see what you've been scouting last 15 minutes.

183
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,360
Kelly, it was great to see you, I know you gotta get going...

184
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,160
Hi Kelly, I'm Derick Jones.

185
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,640
Hi

186
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,480
You know this guy?

187
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
 Jake? Jake is my boy!

188
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,600
He's the man with the plan! The insight, the knowledge!

189
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,840
Great. Those girls, they aren't with you are they?

190
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,400
Yes, why? Are you into girls?

191
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,040
No, I'm just showing him around town. All the hotspots, stuff like that.

192
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,920
The job is called location scout, and Kelly you should come with us.

193
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,360
Today we're gonna be making movie history.

194
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,520
No, she's got other plans already.

195
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,760
Kelly do you like champagne?

196
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,040
I love champagne, actually I love ...

197
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,480
I would love to come on your boat Derek, thanks.

198
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,320
Come on, let me... let me help you aboard.

199
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,040
Hey Kelly baby. What happened to hanging with us today?

200
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,560
Who's that guy? Is he your boyfriend or something?
- No, he's just a boy from school...

201
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,760
 ...who said he has back-stage passes, when actually, he doesn't!

202
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,760
Come on Kelly!

203
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
T-shirts for you.

204
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
What the fuck.

205
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,060
That was Derick Jones!

206
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,560
Is that Jake Forester?

207
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,600
See you at 4 in wet t-shirt contest.

208
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,560
Dave, we have to talk about this

209
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,120
We told Jake that we'd stay at the house.

210
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,560
I told him that I would fish.

211
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,560
I can't if there are no fish.

212
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,160
The lake's too busy.

213
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,520
Come on. Sand Island is really close

214
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,280
I should've brought my trombone.

215
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,320
No way! "Be a girl and sunbathe or something!

216
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
When I become a rock star, just see if I let YOU be in my group!

217
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,240
Give me a break!

218
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,800
You play the trombone!

219
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,200
Here we go ladies... a little Champagne...
- Thanks
... the finest your gas station has to offer

220
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,280
Cheers!

221
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,600
to our newest 'Wild Wild Girl'

222
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,560
That's why we came here. Derick wants to capture innocence.

223
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,480
It's all about innocence

224
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,160
Just like her.

225
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
Don't worry. Derick's just making his play.
You might as well ask him not to breathe

226
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,560
It's the rules. Show a girl a camera and she WILL perform.

227
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
It's like a law of physics.

228
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,360
I've seen that guy charm the pants off a lot of ladies.

229
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,360
She's not messing up your party is she?

230
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,360
What do I care. She's not my girlfriend.

231
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,480
This is great. I'm having a great time.

232
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,840
We're going wild, I'm going wild.

233
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,760
Hey, Jake. How far is this place? Come on!

234
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there

235
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
Speaking of going wild...

236
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,680
you haven't seen anything yet!

237
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,920
Why not join us?

238
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,000
Hey, what's up guys?
- Close that door, you're ruining our shot!

239
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,600
Come on Sandrat. Get with the program.

240
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,080
Here they come, here they come. Here come my nymphs.

241
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,520
Oh my God!

242
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,360
Check it out! The fish, with boobies

243
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,160
If all fish look like that, I would fuck fish!

244
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,480
Looking good ladies. You like this, right Jake?

245
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,120
You should be paying us today, not the other way around!

246
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,400
Look at these goddess aquatic bitches. This is hot Andy!

247
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
This is so hot. This is what it's all about

248
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,400
Beer, sun and naked hunnies making out under water!

249
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,480
Mum, what's going on there?

250
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,040
How come you didn't pick up the home phone?

251
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,720
I've been trying to reach you.

252
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,080
I was outside. I can go and get it if you need me to.

253
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,800
No, that's okay.

254
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Oh my God!

255
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,880
What?

256
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,080
Nothing, just kids.

257
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,960
They're outside fishing...

258
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,240
... and it's really nice to see them ...

259
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,400
... playing with each other.

260
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,080
Put your ass on the glass!

261
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,680
Jake is someone there with you?

262
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,960
No, no, no. Just the kids on the lake.

263
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,440
It's crazy here. You know how it is.

264
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,040
Honey, I don't want Zane or Laura near the lake today, you hear me?

265
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,000
OK, we will stay home and we'll watch TV.

266
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,600
OK, I gotta go. Thank you so much for this

267
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,360
I'll try to come home early, ok?

268
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,360
Ok, ok. I love you. I gotta go.

269
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Kelly?

270
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,240
Kelly, where are you?

271
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,240
Kelly?

272
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,320
Jake, you missed the rest of the show.

273
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,880
Let's go. Towels for the girls.

274
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,360
Wow! Great! good work. Way to tie up a canoe

275
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,880
I must've gotten my knots mixed up.

276
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,280
So you catch zero fish, and lose us our only boat.
Today is just full of accomplishments

277
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,440
Jake's gonna kill us.

278
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,160
Somebody will see us. See, there are some boats over there.

279
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,320
Don't waste your time. They'll never see us, it's way too far.

280
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
Hello!

281
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,120
Hello!

282
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,720
We need help!

283
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
We're over here!

284
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,280
Help us, somebody.

285
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,040
We're over here, help!

286
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,480
Woah! Look at the size of that!

287
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,680
What is it? A cavern system?

288
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,160
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

289
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
You see this gap here?
-Yes.

290
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,920
The quake opened that up, now it's a connecting passage.

291
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,720
A lake under a lake?

292
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,960
That's right. I'm afraid it's still your jurisdiction.

293
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,920
This is part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area.

294
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,680
That's the beauty of it.

295
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,720
We're gonna be the first ones to explore it.

296
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,280
I don't know why you get s o excited by that crap.

297
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,360
All we ever see is rocks and sand.

298
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,320
I should warn them, it's not very pretty down there.

299
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
Tourists treat this lake like it's a garbage can.

300
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,640
How's it going down there?

301
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,400
Sheriff said that it's a real treasure trove down there

302
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,800
so I've got dibs on the old body spray, and 'Jugs' magazines

303
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
- I got dibs on home appliances.
- I got missing college girls

304
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,600
Oh my God!

305
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,800
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

306
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,600
Focus on the task.

307
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,280
At least 200 feet Novak

308
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,640
Almost full visibility.

309
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,320
You should see this. It's amazing!

310
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,560
Novak, do you hear me?
- Yes, copy that

311
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,960
You're about 90 feet to the entrance of the connecting cave

312
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
It looks like single file time

313
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,520
I'll go first

314
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,840
No, I should de the preliminary scout.

315
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,760
Anyway, you'll get us stuck!

316
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,040
Baby, I'm like an eel.

317
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,360
Electrical eel can get into small spaces that it is shocking.

318
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,200
That's weird

319
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,560
Here they are and they're splitting up

320
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,720
Is everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here.

321
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,920
I'm getting a serious drop in temperature

322
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,880
it's at least 30 degrees colder.

323
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,760
You're probably at the mouth of the underwater lake

324
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,200
Do you see anything?

325
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm entering the cave

326
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,000
Jesus!

327
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,760
It seems endless.

328
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,440
You gotta see this.

329
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,920
This is incredible

330
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,360
What do you see down there?

331
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,320
Something just bit me!

332
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,880
Yes, okay, I thought you like that kinda stuff?

333
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,840
Sam! Sam! Answer me!

334
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,520
Something's happening.
- What? 
I don't know. Give me my flippers.

335
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
Oh my God!

336
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,080
Your body is a temple, and now it is time to thank the Gods.

337
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,240
Andrew, camera.

338
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,280
Come on you.
No, no, no.

339
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,520
No, thanks. I think I've already had too much.

340
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,880
Come on, don't you want to worship at a beautiful altar.

341
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,720
I know you prefer champagne, but you believe us,
you can trust Crystal.

342
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,880
Come on Derick, she said no.

343
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,360
No, she said 'no thanks', there's a difference.
She understands that gratitude is the right attitude.

344
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,840
Kelly, come on, trust us. It's never cheating
if it's with another chick!

345
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,800
Come on.
-Try.

346
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,760
Come on, it's fun

347
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Have fun, do it! Everybody's doing it

348
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,250
You're not trying to take away her fun are you?

349
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,640
She's er... she's not my girlfriend.

350
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
Fine! I'll do it.

351
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
First you lick the salt
-ok

352
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,560
Here we go, come over here

353
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,800
Then you suck up the tequila.

354
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,920
You don't have to do it.
- I don't think we need any of your babysitting here Jake.

355
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
OK.

356
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,880
And to try with Jake and Kelly?

357
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,760
What?
- What?

358
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,720
I think not.

359
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,600
Come on guys, are we shooting porn today or not?
Lets make a decision

360
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,240
Thanks Crystal. Come Kelly.

361
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,520
Yes, and salt.

362
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,640
A little tequila.

363
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,160
Let's go.

364
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Mr. Goodman?

365
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,420
Coming.

366
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,580
I'm coming, hold your horses

367
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,980
The store is closed

368
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,180
I want to know what the hell this thing is doing in my lake?

369
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,660
Where did you catch this?

370
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,780
In the middle of the lake.

371
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
Where there are 2 people dead!

372
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,860
- Oh my!God! 
"Oh my" yeah that's right

373
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,980
Excuse me, but is that a fucking Piranha?

374
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,900
And it's not the only one.
- There are thousands.

375
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
Thousands! And they're pissed!

376
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,860
I heard about these things happening.

377
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,220
It's like those baby alligators in New Jersey, someone leaves them ...

378
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,660
... and then they bread.
- What?

379
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,260
Who released these fish into the lake?

380
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,820
What are you talking about?

381
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,220
This particular of piranha

382
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,660
vanished from the face of the earth

383
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,140
more than two million years ago!

384
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,620
Where's he going?

385
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,660
Allow me... to introduce...

386
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:54,420
The Pygocentrus. The original piranha

387
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,620
They used to swim the Colorado River

388
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,340
Right up until the Ice Age.

389
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,820
I don't understand how you found one... alive?

390
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,380
We discovered a subterannean lake,
through a rift created by the quake

391
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,380
How could it have survived so long, cut off from the surface?

392
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,700
Cannibalism.

393
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,460
They must have fought each other to survive.

394
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,140
See.

395
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,420
Scars.

396
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,180
See the eyes.

397
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,940
Jesus. It's like they're staring abck at you

398
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,860
No, no, no. Not staring. Sensing.

399
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,460
God! Dont do that.

400
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,620
Piranhas hunt in packs.

401
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,500
Not for protection, but for overwhelming force.

402
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,300
They're organised, methodical

403
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,700
The first bite draws the blood, the blood draws the pack

404
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,940
How do I stop them?

405
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,500
Sorry, you're not actually thinking about
going back out onto the lake?

406
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:16,380
They are killing machines but they are still fish.
You can catch them or kill them.

407
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,100
But if there really are thousands ...
-Yes?

408
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,820
Yesterday would have been a good time to start.

409
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,420
Shit.

410
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,900
My little brother and sister.

411
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,900
Are they waving for help?

412
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,060
I don't know. They should be home. I should be home.

413
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,660
Jake, what are you doing? You're gonna miss my money shot

414
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,460
It's my familly alright! They could be in trouble

415
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,140
You'll be in trouble if you don't get
my flying cacas right now!

416
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,340
What the hell is wrong with you man?

417
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,780
What's wrong with me?

418
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,620
Oh Godamit, your missing it, your missing it, your missing it.

419
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,260
Oh you missed it! What is wrong with you?

420
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,100
Listen, they're stranded out there.

421
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,700
They might need my help

422
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,980
Listen to me. My mum is sheriff.

423
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,740
OK. Let's swing by the island. Throw the minnows in the boat.

424
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,620
It'll be fun.

425
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,860
Get me up!

426
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,860
Get me up!

427
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,660
What's going on?

428
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Alright Lake Victoria, are you ready for some titties?!

429
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,740
Look at those weapons of masturbation!

430
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,100
Change!

431
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,660
Yes, we need the National Guard ...

432
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,500
...We need the Coast Guard! I need all the
forces you have the power to deploy!

433
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,620
Everybody back to the beach!

434
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,380
Everybody back!

435
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,740
<i>Read the Bible.

436
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,140
Don't talk about faith. Take the boat.
No more talk about faith

437
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,260
What the hell?

438
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,660
This is the Lake Victoria Sherrifs Department,

439
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,180
The Sherrif has declared an emergency.

440
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,980
Don't worry, we've got beer over here!

441
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,180
Cannonball!

442
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,060
I need you out of the water, now!

443
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,220
Jake? Why is he here?

444
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,980
I don't know.

445
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,300
We are so busted.
- No, he is.

446
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,940
I didn't even catch a fish!

447
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,140
Slow down.

448
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,820
OK, Jake,I'm not taking the fall for this. It was all Zanes idea

449
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,140
I paid you $60 to stay home. What do you mean.

450
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,660
I'll give you 40 and we are quits.

451
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,940
How about you get on a boat, go home and end of story.

452
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,900
Just get on the boat.

453
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,500
We should've been on the beach an hour ago
for the muthafucking main event.

454
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,340
Let's go!

455
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,340
Be careful pulling away from here. The rocks
can strip away the engine

456
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,500
Why don't you go and get some rest. Take Zane and Laura
with you, I don't want them anywhere near them.

457
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,380
The water is so clear.

458
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,860
What kind of fish was that?

459
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,100
I don't know.

460
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,220
I'm gonna make them take us home right now, ok?

461
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,220
What is that?

462
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,740
What happened?

463
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,940
Are you okay?

464
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,540
I think we hit something.

465
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,300
Andrew! Andrew, what the hell is going on?

466
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,620
I don't know. We're stuck on something.

467
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,660
Well, fix it Godamit

468
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,740
There are rocks everywhere.
- Yeah, they're down here.

469
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,380
What happened?

470
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,380
I think there's something caught on the prop

471
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,680
Stay here.

472
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,160
Crystal, get the sand rat up here

473
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,040
I said get the fucking sand rat up here! What's wrong with you?

474
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,480
Why can't you go get him yourself?

475
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,400
I'm just down here thinking how this whole fucked up day is your fault.

476
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,560
You wont help us with the new bitch, you don't do a fucking
thing I tell you and you take us way the fuck of course!

477
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,280
I get it, you're new at this. I'm cool with that...

478
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,240
but what you're doing ...

479
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,600
what this is ...

480
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,680
there's a word for it ...

481
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,760
It's a boat word, er what is it?

482
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,200
Mutiny! Is that what this is? Is it a mutiny

483
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,160
Relax Derek, ok? It's just getting a little wild

484
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,080
If anyone should be down there helping, it oughta be you!

485
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,920
Let me do that. Let me do that!

486
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,120
Let me do it!

487
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,560
This is an emergency. I need everyone out of the water now!

488
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,200
Get out of water now! This is an emergency!

489
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,240
Get out of the water now!

490
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,560
Come on! Come on!

491
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,520
Oh my God!

492
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,760
Oh my God!

493
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
What are you doing?

494
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,960
Where are you going?

495
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,960
Throw me a gun!
- It's fully loaded

496
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,040
Swim to the beach! Get out of water!

497
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,280
Get out of water!

498
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,440
Come on!

499
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,520
Todd, what are you doing?

500
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,240
Get the fuck out of the way!

501
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,720
You're gonna kill the engine.

502
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,400
Zane, Laura, hold on to something and get back from the glass.

503
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,320
Come on!

504
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Come on!

505
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,000
Yes, yes!

506
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,080
Holy shit!

507
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,880
Let's go!

508
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,280
Are you okay?

509
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,160
Are you okay?
- Yes.

510
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,440
Where is Kelly?
- It is on the other side.

511
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,400
There.

512
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,880
Kelly! Kelly!

513
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,680
Jake!

514
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,880
Get out of the water!

515
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,760
I cant find a way to you. Get out through the skylite

516
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,640
Jake!

517
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,360
Let's go. I don't want you to see this.

518
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,640
They took my penis! They took my penis.

519
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,080
Jake hurry up, the water's getting higher

520
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,160
Jake!

521
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,120
Kelly!

522
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,120
Hurry up!

523
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,400
Chew on this muthafuckers!

524
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,760
Everybody out!

525
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,040
All ashore!

526
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,320
Everybody out!

527
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,040
No! No!

528
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Hold this.

529
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,060
[phone ringing]

530
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,200
This is Sheriff Forester.

531
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,280
Mum?
- Jake.

532
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,840
I'm sorry, I screwed up. We're on the lake.

533
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,800
What?

534
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,960
Where are Laura and Zane?

535
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,440
They're with me on the boat.

536
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,480
Oh my God, Jake.

537
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,800
Whatever you do, do not enter the water!

538
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,760
You don't understand, Mum. Our boat is sinking.

539
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,320
Where are you?

540
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,520
What are you doing?

541
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,960
I'm coming with you.

542
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,120
Let's go.

543
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,120
That's mum.

544
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,400
Mum! Hey!

545
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,040
How are we gonna get the boat close?
- I don't know.

546
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,520
The rope. Do you think it will reach?

547
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,520
Jake, I'm gonna throw you the rope.
I want you to tie it to the highest railing

548
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,480
Okay, Mum.

549
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,480
Tied?
- Yes.

550
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,560
Back up a bit.

551
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,200
Watch out for rocks.

552
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,520
Watch out!

553
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,320
Ready?
- Yes.

554
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,920
Yes.

555
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,440
Keep it tight. I've got my radio

556
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,840
Hold on.

557
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,800
Mum, are you okay?

558
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,240
Is this everybody on the boat?

559
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,720
No, Kelly is stuck down in the cabin.
We can't get her out.

560
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,720
We can't get her out.
- Kelly?

561
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,560
God! Kelly?

562
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,320
Can you reach my arm?

563
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,560
Help me get out of here. Water is getting higher!

564
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,600
- Can you reach the skylite?
It doesn't matter. It's fucking stuck!

565
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,440
Jake!

566
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,000
I'm scared!

567
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,280
Please help!

568
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,560
Mum, hurry!
- Kelly?

569
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,600
- Were gonna die.
We are not gonna die, OK?

570
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,000
I need your help! Please!

571
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,960
The only way to reach it under the ship.

572
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,920
All of the rope.

573
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,840
What are you talking about? We can't leave her there.

574
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,360
When we all go over the rope, I'll come back for her.

575
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,600
I'm not leaving without her mum!

576
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,880
Jesus, Jake! The only way to get to her is for you to get into the water

577
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,360
I'm not gonna let you do that!

578
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,920
The reason she got on this boat was coz of me

579
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,720
This is my fault.

580
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,600
I'm not going without her.

581
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,280
- This isn't gonna hold much longer. Let's go!

582
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,160
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across and when I get back,

583
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,720
we are gonna do this. Together.

584
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,920
OK.

585
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,880
We're gonna keep the 2 little ones between us, you go first.

586
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,880
Can you do this?
- You better believe it! I don't pole dance for nothing!

587
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,640
You have a lot of explaining to do.

588
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,720
Ready?

589
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,600
Be careful, don't look down. Let's go.

590
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,560
Just like at the playground guys,

591
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,520
... hand over hand

592
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,880
Don't look down.

593
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,040
Don't look down, alright.

594
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,680
Come on, you can do this.

595
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,160
Don't look down.

596
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,720
GET OFF ME!

597
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,360
No! No!

598
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,680
Godammit!

599
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,000
Laura, listen to me!

600
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,320
If you move fast, it will not get you.

601
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,280
You have to move now!

602
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,600
Come on!

603
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,800
OK guys, you're here.

604
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,200
You did it.

605
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,400
Let's go, keep moving!

606
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,440
Are you ok?

607
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,840
Cut the engine.

608
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,240
What are you doing?

609
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,080
Jake, what are you doing?

610
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,920
What are you doing?

611
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,200
Jake!

612
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,720
Jake, do not!

613
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,440
They want blood, don't they?

614
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,000
Well, we'll give them.

615
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,360
Wet T-shirt, wet t-shirt.

616
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,080
Jake!

617
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,520
Oh my God! Oh my God!

618
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,840
We're gonna get out of here. Both of us!

619
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,600
- I'm in! I you need to pull us out as fast as possible! Do you copy?

620
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,920
- Ok, we're ready when you are.

621
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,640
Jake, what are you doing? They're gonna come back.

622
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,360
I gave them a snack. That's gonna hold
them off for a while at least

623
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,960
I need you to tie these together ok?
- Why?

624
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,920
Just do it!

625
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,720
Where are you going?

626
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,840
Jake!

627
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,680
Hold your breath, we'll swim to the bottom of the boat.

628
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,760
I need you to hold on tight. Can you hold on tight to me?

629
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,440
I need you to pull us out in 10 seconds, do you copy?
- We copy. 10 seconds from your signal.

630
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,000
Get the kids down.

631
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,960
10.

632
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,320
6 ... 5 ... 4 ...

633
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,280
... 3 ... 2 ... 1

634
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,000
Come on!

635
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,960
Come on, fucking thing!

636
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,960
Oh my God!

637
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,920
Holy shit!

638
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,640
Are you okay?

639
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,280
Kick your legs, come on!

640
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,560
Let's go!

641
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,400
You're alright.

642
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,800
Breathe, you're ok.

643
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,280
You're alright.

644
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,760
Oh my God! It's good to have you on board!

645
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,440
Shit.

646
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,040
Look mum, over there.

647
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,840
They died.

648
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,160
They're all dead.

649
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,640
You did it Jake!

650
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,760
Hey, it worked.

651
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,080
I thought dynamite fishing is illegal in these parts sheriff?

652
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,240
[over radio] -Sheriff! Sherrif?

653
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,320
Yes, this Julie.

654
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,480
Julie, we have a major problem.

655
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:13,800
I'm looking out at a school of dead piranha.
It's not all of them, but it's a good start.

656
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,120
You don't understand.

657
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,840
The specimen you left with me 

658
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:23,000
has no mature reproductive organs.

659
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,560
- What?
What are you talking about?

660
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:31,480
The piranhas that killed those divers, the ones you're hunting for...

661
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,480
They're not fully developed!

662
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,840
They're the babies!

663
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,960
Babies?

664
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,640
Well, where are the parents?
