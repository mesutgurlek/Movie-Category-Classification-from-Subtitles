1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,536
John?

2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,542
John!

3
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
John!

4
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,568
Johnny?

5
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,575
Johnny, I'm coming in.

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,078
- Ahh!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

7
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,581
- Oh, shit!
- Ahh! Ahh! Ohh! Whoa! Whoa!

8
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,582
What? What?

9
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,585
What? What the fuck?
I didn't see nothing.

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,088
Jamie. Jamie, what-- Stop.

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,590
Jamie, what are you doing?
What's going on?

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,092
God, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,593
Oh, man.

14
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,098
I was-- I have jock itch, okay?
I was scratching my jock itch.

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,101
You scared the hell out of me.
I didn't see anything, okay?

16
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,602
You can't just come in.
You have to call.

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,606
- I did call you! I called.
- What are you doing here?

18
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,608
I'm getting married.
Tim and I are getting married.

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,611
I'm engaged.

20
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,623
I knew it.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,127
I knew it. I could tell from the sound
of your voice on the messages.

22
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,628
I knew it. Shit.

23
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,635
John, it's been seven years.

24
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
I don't know what to tell you.
It still stings.

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,141
And it's still a surprise.

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,652
Listen.

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
We're going to this party
tomorrow night.

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,658
Tim and I are going.
Just listen.

29
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,661
It's a great party.
Very cool people.

30
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,164
People who would
stimulate you intellectually,

31
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:49,169
and I, you know-- I hear really,
really kinda great chicks.

32
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,671
I'm not going to a party.
Yeah, you are.

33
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,174
You're coming.
You gotta get out of the house.

34
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176
Just let me do my thing.
I'll find my own way.

35
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
I'll find someone
or I won't,

36
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,680
and I'll be a great uncle to your kids.
Stop it.

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
You're going to
take a shower,

38
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,685
and you're going to put some
pants on that are clean...

39
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,687
and those nice shoes.

40
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
And then you and Tim
will introduce me:

41
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,192
"Hey, this is the guy
that I dumped--

42
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,693
"who's my ex-husband--

43
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
but you'll love him!"

44
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,697
You know how pathetic
that sounds?

45
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
This is the perfect opportunity.
You're coming.

46
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,703
- I want you to come.
- I'm not going to a party.

47
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,794
Hey.
Hey.

48
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,296
Hey, John.
How's that going?

49
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,299
Good.
Good.

50
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,801
It's just, that, you know,

51
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,304
I could stare at a fire
for hours, you know?

52
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,307
It's like TV.

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,811
What?
This is--

54
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,315
I came. I got dressed up.
I know you did. I know.

55
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:57,320
John, drink that.
It's Red Bull and vodka.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,323
Drink it. Get lit.

57
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,325
Ladies find you attractive.
Come on.

58
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,827
All right, all right.
I'm not messing around. I'm serious.

59
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,329
You want me to get insane?
Yeah.

60
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,830
In the membrane.

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,834
John, put it
inside your body.

62
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,337
Tip it. Tip it. Tip it.

63
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,339
Let's go.
Ahh.

64
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,342
Giddyap. Come on, Big John.
Go, Johnny.

65
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,344
Come on.
Lot of pretty girls here.

66
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,845
Look at her. Oh, she's--

67
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,348
No, you can't follow me too.

68
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,849
Just watch and learn.

69
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,854
They were $39,
and I'm like, "See those?"

70
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,856
And he's like,
"They're perfect." Hey.

71
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,858
Hi.
Are you waiting for the bathroom?

72
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,362
Uh, no. Go ahead.
No, no.

73
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,865
I was just asking.
I don't have to-- I don't have to go.

74
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,867
Oh, well, it's right there.

75
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,872
Anyway, um, so--

76
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,875
Where did you get those?

77
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,377
Ooh, ooh.

78
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,878
Sorry.

79
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,383
I think the screws
came out.

80
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,886
Anyway--
You're just gonna hold that?

81
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,394
Well, um, we're kind of, like,
having a conversation here, so-- Oh.

82
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,396
Oh. I'm--

83
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,399
I'm gonna have some
conversations too here, eventually.

84
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,904
Hey, can I have
a vodka Red Bull?

85
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,410
Hey.
Hey.

86
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,415
- Do I know you?
- No, I was just being stupid.

87
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,917
You seemed friendly.
Hey--

88
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,421
Uh, red, please. Thanks.

89
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,424
Red Bull?
You having Red Bull? Uh, wine.

90
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,426
Oh.

91
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,431
Thank you.
So-- Mmm, no.

92
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,433
No.

93
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,436
Thanks.

94
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,442
I'm not an architect.
I'm not a deejay.

95
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:04,947
I'm not a... marketing executive.
Listen. Marketing--

96
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,451
You gotta be yourself and be
vulnerable and be honest...

97
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,955
and just get out there and
talk to somebody who's like--

98
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,957
Who should I talk to? you know,
seems like a normal girl.

99
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,461
Name one person. Look at the woman
on the couch. She's totally cool.

100
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,962
Okay, her? Done.
I'll go do it. Okay.

101
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,468
Hi. Is anyone sitting here?

102
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,470
Uh, no, go ahead.

103
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,972
Ahh!

104
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,474
Hi. I'm John.

105
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,477
I'm Ashley.
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

106
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,978
Thank you.

107
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,481
Are you having a good time?

108
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,984
Not really.

109
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,487
Me, either. Uh...

110
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,492
Can-- Listen.
I know we just met.

111
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,994
Can I be honest with you?

112
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,997
I just want to level
with somebody, okay?

113
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,502
Sure.

114
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:04,006
I am in a tailspin.

115
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,509
And I'm lonely.

116
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,512
I'm depressed,

117
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,516
and I'm borderline desperate.

118
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,520
But... I don't know.
I just-- I know myself.

119
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,022
I know that
I'm a really fun person.

120
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,526
I'm not a lonely person
or a depressed person.

121
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,528
I have-- I don't know.

122
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,032
I just feel like if I could find
the right person to be with me--

123
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,537
I have so much to give,
you know. I have all these gifts.

124
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,040
I'm like--
I'm a blast, you know?

125
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,545
I'm sorry.
I have to make a phone call.

126
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,548
Okay. That's--

127
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,388
Okay. Plan B.

128
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,893
You need to get more drunk.

129
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,921
- Nice penis.
- Ohh!

130
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,424
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
No.

131
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,427
- Go ahead, finish up.
- No, no, no.

132
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,931
Why does this keep happening to me?
It's the second time this week.

133
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,933
Really?
Yeah.

134
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,935
The other one was my wife.

135
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:45,441
My ex-wife. She's getting remarried,
but I'm fine with it, so--

136
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,445
Yeah, I overheard your-- your
conversation on the couch up there.

137
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,948
Ohh. Did you?
Yes.

138
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,950
- That was horrible.
- No, it wasn't.

139
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,955
I thought it was
really raw and honest.

140
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,959
You mean that?
Yeah.

141
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,461
- You really mean it?
- I did.

142
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:10,466
'Cause, um,
I've had a lot of weird conversations tonight,

143
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,969
and if you really mean that,
I think I'm gonna start crying.

144
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,971
I mean it. I mean it.
I mean it.

145
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,975
Why am I even--
I can't talk to you.

146
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,477
What am I doing?
I'm just gonna mess this up.

147
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,480
'Cause you're a really
hot girl and I'm just--

148
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,985
I'm sorry.
You're not messing it up.

149
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,489
Are you flirting with me?

150
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,996
This is insane.
I'm like Shrek.

151
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,497
What-- What are you doing--
I-- I didn't say that.

152
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,000
What are you doing here
in the forest with Shrek?

153
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,002
I was gonna pee
in the bushes--

154
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,504
Really?
and you took my spot.

155
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,009
Oh! Do you hear that song?

156
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,510
What?

157
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,512
Wait. I'm sorry.
Wait right here.

158
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:00,016
It's the greatest song ever recorded,
and I'm gonna go enjoy it,

159
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,518
and I'm gonna come back
and talk to you.

160
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,520
Don't worry.

161
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,524
Dance song! Come on, move out!

162
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,028
Come on, it's good stuff.
Dance party!

163
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,530
Dance party! Look out!

164
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,532
Clear the dance zone!

165
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,035
# # Don't # #

166
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,537
# # Don't you want me # #
Come on!

167
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,539
# # You know I can't believe you
when I say that # #

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,045
# # I love Red Bull and vodka!
# # Don't, don't you want me

169
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,549
# # Don't believe it
when you say that you don't need me # #

170
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,553
# # You think you've
changed your mind # #

171
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,557
# # You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry # #

172
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,062
# # Don't you want me, baby #
# Come on!

173
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:50,066
# # Don't you want me, ohh # #

174
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,068
# # Don't you want me, baby # #

175
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,572
Come on, you guys!
It's a party!

176
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:03,079
I guess I'm the only one
who loves a good song.

177
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,585
# # I was working as a waitress
in a cocktail bar # #

178
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,087
Thank you!

179
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,589
# # That much is true # #
Yeah, baby.

180
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:18,594
# # But even then I knew I'd
find a much better place # #

181
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,097
# # Either with or without you # #

182
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,099
Thank you.
Get up, come on!

183
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,602
# # Don't you want me # #
Come on!

184
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,105
# # You know I can't believe it
when you say # #

185
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,107
What are you guys doing?
Come on!

186
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,610
# # You think you've
changed your mind # #

187
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,115
# # You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry # #

188
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,617
# # Don't you want me, baby # #

189
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,620
Yes! Yes! Keep going.

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,123
# # Don't you want me now # #

191
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,128
How did you do that?

192
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,629
That was crazy.
Ohh.

193
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,132
Do you do exercises
or something?

194
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,136
You're amazing.

195
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,138
You're an angel.

196
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,640
You're a sex angel.

197
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,142
Oh, my God.

198
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,148
You want to sleep over?

199
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,169
Mm-hmm.

200
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,844
Hello?

201
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,345
Hi, Molly.

202
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,347
Hey, it's John.

203
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,350
Who?

204
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,853
John?
From last night?

205
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,857
John?

206
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,359
Just kidding, John. Hi.

207
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,361
Oh, okay.
I'm glad you called.

208
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,363
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm glad I called too.

209
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,866
That was really fun
last night.

210
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,369
Mm-hmm.
And thanks for the note and, um--

211
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,372
Hey, I was wondering if you
wanted to hang out tonight.

212
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,876
Sure.
Yeah?

213
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,879
Great. You want to come
over here then or--

214
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,883
Look, I have to run, but I'll
come over after work, okay?

215
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,885
Okay, sounds good.

216
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,887
Bye.
Bye.

217
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,958
Hey.
Hi.

218
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,460
How are you?
Good, good.

219
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,965
There's a whole custom-prepared plate.
I want yours.

220
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,469
You're a very good cook.

221
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,975
I just decided
to give it my all.

222
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,479
Which is not
the cool-guy thing to do.

223
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,481
I'm not into that anyway.

224
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,488
Okay? Okay.
I'll take your word for it.

225
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,494
I know I'm not supposed to say this,
but I really like you.

226
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,998
Is it crazy for me to say,
like, I want it to work out?

227
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:21,503
Is that too much?
Am I supposed to be cooler than that?

228
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,505
Oh.

229
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,509
My life is really
complicated right now.

230
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,514
But I'm definitely interested.

231
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,027
Hey. Where you going?

232
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,529
Hey, hey.

233
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,532
I-- I just have to--
I have to go.

234
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,035
Wait. Why do you have
to leave so late?

235
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,038
I just have to-- I have to--
Just call me tomorrow, okay?

236
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,043
Molly, wait. Give me one second, please.
Are you married?

237
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,046
Is that where you're going?
No, I'm not married.

238
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,048
What is it?
Are you a secret agent?

239
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,549
Just trust me.
What is going on?

240
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,551
Call me tomorrow, okay?

241
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,836
Oh, my God.

242
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,383
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Hey, hi.

243
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:24,386
Sorry.
Uh, what am I doing?

244
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,889
It's okay.
Hi. Uh--

245
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,891
Can I help you?

246
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:31,393
Uh, I'm sorry. Is this--

247
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,395
I think I have the wrong
address actually.

248
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,898
What address are you looking for?
Um...

249
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,401
Is this--
Does Molly live here?

250
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,403
Yeah. Can I ask who is asking?

251
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,906
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm John.
I'm a friend of hers.

252
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:45,908
I was in the neighborhood,
and I was, like,

253
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,409
"I think that's
Molly's house,"

254
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,412
but I didn't want to ring
the doorbell if it wasn't.

255
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:54,917
Um, no, it is. You can definitely ring
the doorbell. That's more conventional.

256
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,920
But, uh-- Yeah, I know.
I was just-- Whatever. I was shy. I was--

257
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,424
But I am a friend of hers,
and I'm sorry. Oh. I'm Cyrus.

258
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:04,426
Cyrus. Yeah.

259
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,931
- Her son.
- Her son. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

260
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:12,935
Um, yeah, anyway--

261
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:17,940
So how long you known Molly?

262
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,944
Uh, actually,
just a couple days.

263
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,946
Wow. Just a couple days.

264
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:26,949
Yeah, we just met, so--

265
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:30,953
But you could feel it
already, huh?

266
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:32,955
Like there's something
really special happening?

267
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:38,961
Y-Yeah.

268
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,466
Can I--
How old are you?

269
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,468
I'm almost 22.

270
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,470
Oh, okay. All right.

271
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,972
I'm 21.

272
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:54,476
So you-- you guys have always lived together?
You didn't--

273
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,979
You're not, like, in
from school or whatever?

274
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:59,481
No, I took my G.E.D.
when I was 16,

275
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,984
and then, um,
you know--

276
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:04,486
M-Molly and I are like best
friends so-- Oh, okay.

277
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,488
And my dad's not really in the picture.
Uh-huh.

278
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:09,491
She kinda homeschooled me
and raised me by herself.

279
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:14,496
And since then,
I've sort of been focusing on my music career.

280
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:18,000
Mm-hmm. Oh, that's--
So that's you? That's--

281
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,502
That's my studio.
That's my work space, yes. Yeah, I saw that.

282
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:24,006
You got a couple synths there.
Oh, more than a couple.

283
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,508
I think I have something
around seven pieces.

284
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,011
Yeah. Vintage
and some new stuff.

285
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:33,181
Would you like to hear
some of my-- my work?

286
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,183
Yeah, why not? I mean, yeah.

287
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:39,187
Great. Great.
Okay, great. Great.

288
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:43,191
Um, it's-it's untitled right now,
and it's an unfinished piece.

289
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,202
Slow

290
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,225
Sounds like Steve Miller.
You know that one Steve Miller song?

291
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:18,727
No, it doesn't.

292
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:00,769
Hi.

293
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:04,773
Hey.

294
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,779
It's good.

295
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,781
Ohh!

296
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:16,284
- Hi. Sorry.

297
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:20,288
I was in the neighborhood,
and Cyrus came out and let me in. I'm sorry.

298
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:23,792
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:25,794
Hi.
Hi. Hey.

300
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,796
Hey. Hey.

301
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:32,801
- Anyway--
- So, John, are you gonna stay for dinner?

302
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:38,306
Uh, uh--

303
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:39,808
Yes, dinner.

304
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,283
There's literally, like, 15 peppers.
- I know. Well--

305
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,786
I'm just not gonna be able to
eat it if they're on the side.

306
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,789
I know.

307
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,792
You asked for them
without peppers?

308
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,295
I did, but they never-- I'm not
gonna use this place anymore.

309
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,799
- There's a big red one right there.
- That's okay.

310
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,801
So, John,
I have to apologize to you.

311
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,804
What?

312
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,806
You came in
and I-I sat you down,

313
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,308
and I just started blabbing
all about my life.

314
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,311
I get overly excited sometimes,
and I apologize.

315
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,313
I honestly am curious
to hear about you...

316
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,818
and, you know,
just want to-- want to hear more about your life.

317
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,824
Well, uh, let's see.
I'm-I'm an editor.

318
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,827
I do freelance
editing work. Um--

319
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,332
I like to go to the movies.
I've got a pretty good DVD collection.

320
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,335
I mean, what--

321
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,837
what else do you
want to know?

322
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,839
I don't want to know
what you do.

323
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,341
I want to know what you are.
Who you are.

324
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,344
That's more what I'm--
what I'm interested in.

325
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,851
Are we really gonna-- You want me to?
Okay. I'm, uh-- I'm--

326
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,855
I'm divorced.

327
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,857
I got divorced, like,
seven years ago.

328
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:06,361
And it wasn't my idea.

329
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,864
It was--
You know, I got left.

330
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,869
Uh, I was kind of digging
myself into a hole with my life,

331
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,873
and my wife at the time
was not happy with it.

332
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,376
Told me so. Said to work it out.
I didn't work it out.

333
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,879
I ran away from her
emotionally...

334
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,381
and made a huge mistake...

335
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:31,386
and have been in kind of a dark,
existential place, to tell you the truth.

336
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,890
And then I met your mom
at a party,

337
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,892
and, I don't know.

338
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:41,897
Seems like things are looking up
for the first time in a long time.

339
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,901
That's--
Wow.

340
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,403
You asked. That's where I'm at.
Wow. Wow.

341
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,406
I like your style, John.

342
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,910
To John-- Our new friend.

343
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,413
You seem like a good man.

344
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,916
That was a lot
of information.

345
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,418
So, uh, are you gonna
stay the night?

346
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:07,422
Maybe we should ask
your mom. I don't know.

347
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,427
Um, I think that's
between me and John.

348
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,930
Fair enough.

349
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,933
I was just messing around. It's not,
uh-- It's none of my business.

350
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:22,938
It's valid. It's valid. If I was in your position,
I'd probably be a little--

351
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,941
I mean-- Molly?

352
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,943
Seriously, don't fuck my mom.

353
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,446
I'm just kidding.
I'm just joking around. Sorry. No.

354
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,448
Cy!

355
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,451
I know. I--
I'm sorry. Uh--

356
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,454
that's my attempt
at humor, John.

357
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,956
Okay.
That's, uh, just--

358
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,458
Enough said.

359
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,464
We did have sex.

360
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,468
I mean, if you want to be adults about it,
we did. That's--

361
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,470
I'm sorry if that's
weird or whatever,

362
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,973
but I'm not gonna sit here
and pretend like we didn't.

363
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,976
We met at a party and-- That's
not appropriate to talk about here.

364
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:05,480
Okay. I mean, I don't want to disrespect
you by treating you like a child or whatever.

365
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,984
You seem like you want to be
treated like an adult, and--

366
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,988
That's just it. That's--
That happened, so--

367
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,490
That's--

368
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,494
I accept that information.

369
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:43,885
- Hey, John?
- Hey.

370
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:48,890
I just want to say I thought
it was really great...

371
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:52,394
what you did at dinner,
opening up to me like that.

372
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:56,898
And I know it was weird,
but I thought it was great.

373
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,900
Thanks.

374
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,902
And it's great to finally
have a new dad.

375
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:09,411
You got to get used
to my weird sense of humor.

376
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:14,916
But I really thought that was-- that
was a great thing that you did.

377
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,919
Actually, your mom's
in the shower.

378
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:36,438
# # The king
falls off the throne # #

379
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:41,443
# # The king falls off
of the throne # #

380
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:57,459
Hi.
Hi.

381
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,461
- Night, John.
- Good night, Cyrus.

382
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:03,465
- Night, Molly.
- Good night, Cyrus.

383
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,467
Good shower?

384
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,470
Yeah.
Yeah?

385
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,475
You know, there's something that I've
been thinking about in the shower. And I--

386
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:19,981
I really appreciated what you were expressing
in the kitchen and throughout dinner.

387
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:24,486
And I've-- I--

388
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,988
I feel a little, um--

389
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:29,991
I guess a little embarrassed
and just a little, uh--

390
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:31,493
It's not even that.

391
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:34,496
I just want to say I appreciate
how open you were.

392
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:35,997
I love that about you,

393
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:41,503
and I'm sorry that I wasn't
as open about my boy.

394
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:43,004
No, that's fine.

395
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:45,507
It's your--

396
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,009
Yeah, I know.
your prerogative not to say that stuff.

397
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:52,514
It's private, we just met,
and I was fine with it. I mean--

398
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:55,016
He's a great kid too.
He is.

399
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,018
I'm glad you appreciate that.

400
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,020
I was going to leave,

401
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,523
and he was, like,
"No, come in, come in."

402
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:05,026
I'm happy to hear that.

403
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:08,029
I didn't--
I'm happy to hear that.

404
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,032
And that's the thing.
He's so--

405
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,037
He's very mature,
as you can see, in a lot of ways,

406
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,539
and he really pushes me.

407
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:22,544
But in other ways he's just--
he's not come into himself yet.

408
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:26,047
And-And it's coming,
and it's coming from a very deep place.

409
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:31,553
This could be a--
This is a very sudden--

410
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:34,055
You are very sudden.

411
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:38,059
And I haven't had a man over--

412
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,562
to stay overnight--

413
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:43,565
since Cyrus, uh, was born.

414
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:47,569
So it's a new thing.

415
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:51,072
Well-- But to tell you the truth,
you didn't have me over.

416
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:53,074
I-- I stalked you over--

417
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,076
Yeah, you gave it a little--

418
00:29:55,076 --> 00:29:58,079
I get seized sometimes,
so it's okay you're here.

419
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,585
Molly, everything is a gift,
at this point, to me.

420
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:05,086
Just getting to hang out.

421
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:08,089
Like every moment,
from moment to moment.

422
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,594
Thanks for talking to me
about my--

423
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:16,097
I just feel a little--
No, I know.

424
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:30,111
N-N-N--

425
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,613
No, we leave the door open.

426
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:33,615
Oh. I was just going to
take my pants off.

427
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:36,618
We just-- We-- We just
always leave the door open.

428
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,122
Um, okay.

429
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,135
Hey.

430
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:58,139
Good morning.
You guys are early risers, huh?

431
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,141
Yep. How'd you sleep?
Good.

432
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,643
Good. How'd you sleep?
Very well.

433
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:04,145
Good.
Nice.

434
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,148
So what's-- What's, uh--

435
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:10,151
What's going on?
What's the plan?

436
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:12,153
What are you guys doing?

437
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:15,657
Um, we go to Elysian Park every
morning and eat a little breakfast...

438
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:17,659
and take some photos
for a few hours.

439
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:21,162
Yeah. Cyrus composes
to images of nature.

440
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:24,666
Sounds cool.
I am supposed to work.

441
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,172
Should I blow it off?

442
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:38,680
I'll just get it over with.

443
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,183
I'll get in there. Get it done.
Then I have less to do next week, so--

444
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:44,686
Anyway, all right.

445
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,192
Here you go, Mom.
Did you guys see my shoes?

446
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:54,195
- No.
- They were right here.

447
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,198
Weird.

448
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,702
Okay.

449
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:06,174
Yeah. I can't believe
how deep into it I am already.

450
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,176
That's amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

451
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,178
Thank you.
I really am.

452
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,679
It's amazing.
Is it that obvious?

453
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,682
Am I-- Am I glowing?
You actually are.

454
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,186
You look good.
Just, you know, slow down.

455
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,688
Let's just be here now.
Don't worry, I'm not--

456
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,691
I know. I just don't want you,
you know, to obsess on this.

457
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,693
I was a little needy out of the gate.
Yes.

458
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,197
I'll admit that.
But it's settling in nicely now.

459
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,202
And other than one little
weird blip this morning,

460
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,704
I am not concerned
about anything.

461
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,706
What? What is it?

462
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:43,211
Um, when I woke up this morning,
my shoes were missing from their house.

463
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,713
Your white Adidas?
Yeah.

464
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,716
Your favorite shoes.
Oh, my God.

465
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,718
Well, then somebody
did you a favor.

466
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,221
Whatever.
It-It'll be fine.

467
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,733
- John?
- I definitely left my shoes in their living room.

468
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,237
You know what I mean?
I wore shoes into the house. Shoes-- John?

469
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,740
Can we not have this conversation
at 1:30 in the morning?

470
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,743
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea what time it was.

471
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,247
But the more I think
about the shoes,

472
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,749
now it's like every look the kid
gave me seems really weird.

473
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,751
- Like he was being friendly but--
- Yeah.

474
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,254
Will you please do me a favor
and meet them...

475
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,257
and tell me whether I'm the one
who's paranoid and crazy?

476
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,758
Sure.
Good night, John.

477
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,260
Fine. I will, okay?

478
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,264
It's got to be totally casual
and like it was an accident.

479
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,606
No.

480
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,609
Higher so that it takes longer and I can catch it.

481
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,111
Okay.

482
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,615
Yes.

483
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:59,620
Mmm. I love the ripples.
This looks incredible.

484
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,123
There they are. There they are.
Come on. Come on.

485
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,625
It ripples out almost across the whole thing.
Molly?

486
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,627
Hey.
Hey.

487
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,629
Oh, my gosh, Cyrus.
How's it going? John.

488
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,131
How you doing?
Hi.

489
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,133
I'm Cyrus.
So nice to meet you.

490
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,635
I was just saying,
"I wonder if they're hanging out in the park."

491
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,637
- I'm Molly. We've met.
- This is Jamie.

492
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,639
- We go jogging here all the time.
- You do?

493
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,143
Yeah. That's so weird,
because we're here literally every day.

494
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,646
Yeah, you said that,
but I didn't make the--

495
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,149
I guess, I don't know.
I guess the jogging track--

496
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,652
We took a little bit of a side diversion this time.
Yeah.

497
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,156
What are you doing?

498
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,658
Your hair-- The light is hitting
your hair in this great way.

499
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,162
It's like a crippled tree
reaching for heaven.

500
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,165
John, would you do me
a huge favor?

501
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,666
Yeah, what?

502
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,169
Would you mind
getting into the tree?

503
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,674
Try one where you get in
the tree just like a jaguar.

504
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:57,678
Like a jaguar?
Yeah, just climb up the tree like a jaguar.

505
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,681
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

506
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,184
You're a natural.

507
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,686
Now do one where you just
scream as loud as you can.

508
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,190
No, that's not screaming.
That's moaning.

509
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,692
You're bossy, Cyrus.

510
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,196
You look incredible right now.
I'm really trying to get the most of this.

511
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,198
All right.
Now scream as loud as you can.

512
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,231
What did you think?
Did you like them?

513
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,234
Yes! I think
they're really sweet...

514
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,736
and, uh, kind--

515
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,738
And the wrestling wasn't weird?
And quirky.

516
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,742
No, that was weird. But, you know,
in a good way. I don't know.

517
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,746
I don't think it was,
like, "strange" weird.

518
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,749
I mean, it wasn't "bad" weird.
You know?

519
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,251
They're really cool.
I like them.

520
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,253
They're cool, right?
They're fun.

521
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,754
They're fun.
They're great.

522
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,258
And I don't think
they stole your shoes.

523
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,761
Thank you for coming out here.
I appreciate it.

524
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,764
Don't worry. All right,
I'll see you at the office in a second.

525
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,766
Relax, okay?
All right. Okay.

526
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,767
Okay.

527
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,270
You're the best, Jamie.

528
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,946
Okay. That one.

529
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,449
That one's great.

530
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,951
No, let's skip that one.

531
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,956
Oh, that's perfect.

532
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,458
That's the perfect one.

533
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,963
Hello?

534
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,967
Hi.

535
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,970
No, no, no. I don't need anything.
Thanks. I'll see you in a minute.

536
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,472
Okay.

537
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,476
Who's that?

538
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,978
John.
He's gonna come by.

539
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,480
Cool.
Yeah.

540
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,983
I was-- I-- I was going to tell you and then--

541
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,487
- I don't know. We never talked about it.
- Okay.

542
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,989
Anyway,
he's coming over.

543
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,492
That was a lot.
You could have just said "John's coming over."

544
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,994
I know.
I guess I could have.

545
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:31,499
- I feel weird.
- You don't have to explain yourself.

546
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,501
I think it's nice that
John's coming to see you.

547
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,504
I think it's lovely,

548
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,006
but I still feel--

549
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,510
I feel really--
I feel really weird.

550
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,011
You feel weird?
Mm-hmm.

551
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,513
Why do you feel weird?

552
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,015
Are you okay with all of this?
Yes.

553
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,019
If I was 10, maybe I'd feel weird,
but I am a grown-up,

554
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,523
and you deserve somebody
who can love you--

555
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,527
in a way that I can't love you,
and-- Okay. Okay.

556
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,029
I think it's great.
Okay.

557
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,532
I'm the weirdo.

558
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,034
Hey. How you doing?

559
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,035
Hey, Cyrus.
Hey, John.

560
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,537
Hi.
Hi.

561
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,540
Welcome.

562
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,559
Well, well, well.

563
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,561
You've closed the door.

564
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,074
Ohh!
What? What's going on?

565
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,578
No, no, no! It's okay. Stay!
Stay in here. Stay here!

566
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,086
Is everything okay?

567
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,608
Oh.

568
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,978
Hi, John.

569
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,982
Oh, hey.

570
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,486
I was just looking
for your mom.

571
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,988
I think she's asleep.

572
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,491
Oh, okay.

573
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,495
Come here.

574
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,001
Come here.

575
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,004
You hungry?

576
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,009
I heard you scream,

577
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,014
and your mom didn't tell me
what was going on so--

578
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,522
Night terrors.

579
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,024
I used to get them a lot
when I was younger,

580
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,027
and I just recently
started getting them again.

581
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,030
I'm sorry.

582
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,033
I'll get through it.
Sounds terrible.

583
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,035
Um, I'm glad you're up,

584
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,037
because I've been wanting
to talk to you man-to-man.

585
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,045
No. I'm-- I'm all right.

586
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:11,051
I didn't want to say anything,
'cause Molly asked me not to, but...

587
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:18,058
I think-- I think you might be
coming on a tad too strong.

588
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,062
Okay.

589
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,565
She said that?

590
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,569
She didn't say it
in those exact words but--

591
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,572
Wow. I mean--

592
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,577
I don't want to get into it, but
those were not the signals...

593
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,079
I was getting at all tonight.

594
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,583
In the past,

595
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:48,589
when she's losing interest,

596
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,594
she tends to
overcompensate sexually.

597
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,601
I just think that if you
pulled back 10% to 20%,

598
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,604
emotionally speaking,
you'd do a lot better for yourself.

599
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,113
Wow.

600
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,615
Okay.

601
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,618
Okay, I'm gonna
go to sleep.

602
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,123
Night, John.
Good night.

603
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,160
Did you see John this morning?

604
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,163
He actually left
last night.

605
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,166
Last night?

606
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,169
Come take a seat, Mom.

607
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,676
You look so serious.

608
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,682
I talked to John last night.

609
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,185
Uh-huh.

610
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,698
What?

611
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,700
He...

612
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,705
feels that things
are moving really fast,

613
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,707
and...

614
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:51,211
I think he wants to just
slow down a little bit.

615
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,714
He said that?

616
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,216
Read the note.

617
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,221
I mean,
it's just so not like him.

618
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,229
Are you saying
that I'm making this up?

619
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,732
No, I'm just--
I'm confused.

620
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,735
You're confused?
What do you mean you're confused?

621
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,738
I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
and you're, like, attacking me?

622
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,740
- I'm just trying to help!
- Wait!

623
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,742
Where are you going?

624
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:08,064
Hello?

625
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:09,565
Hey.

626
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:11,567
Hey.

627
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:15,071
Can you come over?
Something's going on with Cyrus.

628
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:18,074
Is everything okay?

629
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:21,077
He's been gone all day.
He's missing.

630
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:23,079
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm on my way.

631
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,580
Thanks.
Okay, bye.

632
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:37,843
Hey.

633
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:41,847
You okay?
Mmm.

634
00:45:41,847 --> 00:45:43,849
Thanks so much for coming.

635
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:52,858
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?

636
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:58,364
Mm-mmm.
No?

637
00:45:58,364 --> 00:46:01,367
I could order something
or pick something up or--

638
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,372
Mm-mmm.
You should eat something.

639
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:08,374
Mmm, I'm not hungry.

640
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:16,882
Hey. Hi.

641
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:18,884
Hi.

642
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,387
Hello.

643
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,889
Hi. Come here.

644
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:25,891
What happened?

645
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:29,895
Molly, why don't you,
uh-- why don't you sit down for a sec, okay?

646
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:31,397
Sit down for a second.

647
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,399
Um--

648
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,901
You guys want to
talk alone or--

649
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:38,904
No, this concerns you.
You should stay, John.

650
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:40,406
Are you sure?
Yeah.

651
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:42,408
Okay.

652
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:46,412
I don't want to make this emotional.
I've decided to move out.

653
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:51,917
I'm an adult now, and I think
it's time for us to move on.

654
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:55,421
I-I--
It's pretty sudden though.

655
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:56,922
- I rented a room.
- You rented a room?

656
00:46:56,922 --> 00:47:00,926
I found some musicians on Craigslist,
and I'm gonna rent a room in their house.

657
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:02,928
And it's gonna be
better for both of us.

658
00:47:02,928 --> 00:47:04,930
And besides,
you have John now,

659
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,933
and you guys need some space
for your relationship to flourish.

660
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:10,436
It's for the best.

661
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:12,438
Yeah.

662
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:17,443
I think that maybe--
This is so sudden.

663
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:23,449
- Maybe you're feeling some anger or--
- I'm not angry.

664
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:25,951
Maybe you should just
take it slowly, step-by-step.

665
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,453
You guys are so serious.

666
00:47:28,454 --> 00:47:30,956
It's not a big deal.

667
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,963
Well, I need to go,
'cause I'm gonna go paint my room tonight.

668
00:47:37,963 --> 00:47:41,467
Then I'm gonna come back with a truck
tomorrow and get the rest of my things.

669
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,469
Will you pack them up
for me, Mom?

670
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:45,471
Uh--

671
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:48,974
Please. It'll be easier.
Just give me a hug.

672
00:47:56,982 --> 00:47:58,484
I love you.

673
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:04,490
It's okay. We'll take some time off
and let the dust settle a little bit,

674
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,993
and we'll all get together
for dinner or something, okay?

675
00:48:10,996 --> 00:48:12,998
John, really nice
spending time with you.

676
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,000
Okay.

677
00:48:57,543 --> 00:49:02,047
It's gonna be good.
I'm excited about the new place.

678
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:06,051
Tilt it sideways a little bit.

679
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:26,071
Thanks, John.
Yeah.

680
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:33,078
Will you thank Molly for packing
up all this stuff for me, please?

681
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:37,082
Actually, she had to work,
so I did most of it.

682
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:40,085
Oh.

683
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:45,090
Thanks.

684
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:47,593
No problem.

685
00:49:49,094 --> 00:49:50,095
Okay.

686
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,602
See you.

687
00:50:07,613 --> 00:50:08,747
That's great.
There you are.

688
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:11,250
You are not gonna believe this.
He did it.

689
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,751
He stole my shoes.

690
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:16,255
This means my whole friendship
with the guy is based on bullshit.

691
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:19,758
All right, let me just finish-- The first night
I was there, he was messing with me.

692
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:22,261
That means there hasn't been
an honest moment yet.

693
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:23,762
Jamie!
I get it. I'm sorry.

694
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:28,267
I have to do this. Then I have to go
to the flower shop for my wedding.

695
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:30,769
Can we just talk about this later, please? Yes.

696
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:32,771
I will wait.

697
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:34,773
It was the act of taking the
shoes that was the big deal...

698
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:38,277
and the fact that he's been lying
the whole time I've known him.

699
00:50:38,277 --> 00:50:41,780
Bringing me in, acting like, "Hey, yeah,
come on in. No problem.

700
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,782
Any friend of my mom's
a friend of mine."

701
00:50:43,782 --> 00:50:45,784
The whole time just
to get me to trust him,

702
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,786
so he can turn around
and stab me in the back.

703
00:50:48,287 --> 00:50:49,288
Oh, my God.
It's interesting.

704
00:50:49,288 --> 00:50:50,789
Don't you guys see?

705
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:54,793
By saying he's leaving because of me,
he makes me the bad guy.

706
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:58,297
Right?
It's like he lit the fuse and ran away.

707
00:50:58,297 --> 00:51:00,799
Will you go look over at those flowers?
I'm sorry, you guys.

708
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:02,801
That's okay.
These are nice ranunculus.

709
00:51:03,302 --> 00:51:05,804
Keep naming flowers, John.
Whatever you'd like.

710
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:07,306
It's just a wedding, honey.
Don't sweat it.

711
00:51:07,306 --> 00:51:09,808
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll leave you guys alone.

712
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:12,311
I just have to--
I feel like--

713
00:51:12,311 --> 00:51:13,812
It's all right.

714
00:51:13,812 --> 00:51:16,815
She's sitting there, lonely,
in this house, miserable,

715
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:19,818
which is exactly
what he wants her to feel.

716
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:44,843
Are you all right?

717
00:51:44,843 --> 00:51:46,345
No.

718
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:48,347
Come here.

719
00:51:54,353 --> 00:51:55,854
It's gonna be okay.

720
00:51:55,854 --> 00:51:57,356
No, it's not.

721
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:07,366
I know it seems just weird that it was so fast,
but it really is gonna be all right.

722
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:09,368
No, it's not okay!
Okay.

723
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:19,878
Let's just go to sleep.
Yeah.

724
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:37,896
Listen, I know you're tired
of me saying this.

725
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:39,398
So don't say it.

726
00:52:40,399 --> 00:52:43,402
And it's upsetting to hear.
It is.

727
00:52:43,402 --> 00:52:45,904
But it's not
gonna be all right.

728
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,407
It's gonna be terrible.

729
00:52:52,411 --> 00:52:54,413
That's true.

730
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:56,415
Things are really
not gonna be okay.

731
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,918
That makes me feel better.

732
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:08,427
Just be honest with me.

733
00:53:08,427 --> 00:53:10,429
Yeah. Yeah.

734
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:15,934
Thank you.
Thank you.

735
00:53:17,936 --> 00:53:18,937
You're welcome.

736
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:26,445
I like you.
I want to be with you.

737
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:31,950
I love being with you.

738
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:47,466
I want to wake up
in the morning at your house...

739
00:53:47,466 --> 00:53:49,968
instead of waking up
at my house going,

740
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:51,970
"I gotta get over to her house.
I miss her."

741
00:53:56,475 --> 00:53:57,976
What do you think?

742
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:04,983
Did you just ask to move in?

743
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:07,486
Yes. I did.

744
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,994
So, hold on. Hold on. But...

745
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:19,498
I don't know which way the wind
is blowing with Cyrus.

746
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:22,000
And I don't know how he's feeling.
Yeah, of course.

747
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,002
I don't think that he knows
how he's feeling and--

748
00:54:24,002 --> 00:54:27,005
Let's take it day by day...

749
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:30,509
for as long as we can go.

750
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:41,520
Okay.

751
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,522
Yeah, let's do this.

752
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:12,384
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

753
00:55:12,384 --> 00:55:13,885
Right there.
Hmm?

754
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:16,388
I'm taking you right there.

755
00:55:16,388 --> 00:55:19,391
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?

756
00:55:23,395 --> 00:55:25,897
I want to get fucked.
You're naughty.

757
00:55:26,398 --> 00:55:28,900
Mm-hmm.

758
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,901
Hey, guys.

759
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:32,904
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

760
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:33,905
What the--

761
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:35,907
Hey, man.

762
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:36,908
Cy--

763
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:39,911
Sorry for interrupting you.
Good to see you.

764
00:55:40,412 --> 00:55:41,913
Hi.
Yeah.

765
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:46,918
Uh, were you planning on
coming over?

766
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,420
We didn't get a message.

767
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,422
Just came home for a bit.

768
00:55:56,928 --> 00:56:00,432
That was, uh, bad timing
there, huh?

769
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:04,936
Can I have a hug?

770
00:56:07,939 --> 00:56:08,940
Yeah.

771
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,942
Come here.

772
00:56:14,946 --> 00:56:17,449
I went through something
really tough tonight.

773
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:21,453
Oh, baby.

774
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:22,954
What happened?

775
00:57:13,505 --> 00:57:15,507
He wants to come back home.

776
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:18,510
Okay.

777
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:21,513
He's been having
panic attacks.

778
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,015
Oh, no.

779
00:57:25,517 --> 00:57:26,852
Hmm.

780
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:33,358
The weird thing is,
it was his decision, you know?

781
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:35,360
He is an adult and--
I mean--

782
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,862
But these
are panic attacks,

783
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:39,364
and that doesn't have anything
to do with being an adult or not.

784
00:57:39,364 --> 00:57:40,866
Yeah.
An adult, that's--

785
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:42,868
No. I know, I know.

786
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:45,370
Yep.

787
00:57:46,872 --> 00:57:47,873
Ohh.

788
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:52,878
Do you mind if
I go talk to him?

789
00:58:07,893 --> 00:58:08,894
Hey.

790
00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:14,900
You can relax.
It's just me.

791
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:17,903
I'm sorry?

792
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,936
We should talk.

793
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:03,949
What the fuck are you doing
with all your shit in my room?

794
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:08,954
Oh, you're going to stop
bullshitting now? This is good.

795
00:59:08,954 --> 00:59:11,957
You know,
I was gonna come back.

796
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:14,960
I was gonna apologize
to you both.

797
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,463
But after this shit you just pulled?
You just fucked yourself, John.

798
00:59:18,964 --> 00:59:20,966
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hide my belt now?

799
00:59:20,966 --> 00:59:23,969
You gonna light a bag of shit
on fire in front of my door?

800
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:25,470
You are out of your league.

801
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,472
I will do whatever it takes.
Listen to yourself.

802
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:29,975
What do you think your mom would
say if she could hear you right now?

803
00:59:30,475 --> 00:59:31,977
Who's going to
tell her? You?

804
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:33,979
Who do you think
she's gonna believe?

805
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:37,482
Her son, who needs her now more than
ever after his battle with panic and anxiety,

806
00:59:37,983 --> 00:59:40,986
or this new guy who clearly
wants her kid out of the way?

807
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,488
You listen to me,
you little weirdo.

808
00:59:43,488 --> 00:59:46,992
If you want to mess with me,
I'm gonna mess with you right back.

809
00:59:47,993 --> 00:59:48,994
Oh, buddy.

810
00:59:53,198 --> 00:59:54,699
Everything okay?

811
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:56,201
Yeah.

812
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:57,702
I was feeling
a little panicky.

813
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:02,707
I was talking to John about how happy
I am to be around you guys right now.

814
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:06,711
The thought of going back
to that house...

815
01:00:07,712 --> 01:00:10,215
makes me all...

816
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:11,716
fluttery and nauseous.

817
01:00:11,716 --> 01:00:15,220
You don't have to
go back there, sweetie.

818
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,725
You know, um,

819
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:25,730
I've never told anybody
this before, but, uh,

820
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:29,234
I used to get
anxiety attacks.

821
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:31,236
You did?
Yeah.

822
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:33,238
So I know how scary
they can be.

823
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:36,741
Wow. Did you have a good
family to help you get through it?

824
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:38,243
You know, I didn't.

825
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,245
I couldn't imagine
going through this alone.

826
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:41,746
Yeah, but I did.

827
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:45,250
It was terrifying.
I didn't know what was going on.

828
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,252
They didn't even call them
anxiety attacks back then.

829
01:00:47,252 --> 01:00:49,754
I just thought
I was going crazy.

830
01:00:49,754 --> 01:00:51,756
I almost left college.

831
01:00:51,756 --> 01:00:54,259
But I decided to tough it out.

832
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:57,262
And that decision
made me who I am.

833
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:01,266
This could be that
moment in your life.

834
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:03,768
Where you go from
being a boy to being a man,

835
01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:07,272
and you say, "You know what?
You're not gonna beat me."

836
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:14,279
- Do you guys not want me to come home?
- No.

837
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,284
'Cause if so, just say so,
and I'll totally find another place.

838
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:22,787
I'll figure something out.
That's not what he's saying, Cyrus.

839
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:26,791
No. Not at all.
I'm not saying that.

840
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:28,793
Look.

841
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:30,795
You know what
the right decision is.

842
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:36,801
You know in your heart
what the right thing to do is.

843
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:40,305
When I looked in my heart,

844
01:01:41,806 --> 01:01:43,308
I decided that it--

845
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,311
I decided that
coming back here...

846
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:49,314
was not defeat,

847
01:01:49,314 --> 01:01:52,317
but, in a way,
like a weird victory.

848
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:55,320
And if it's okay
with you, John,

849
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,822
I'd really like
to come back home.

850
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,333
Okay.

851
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,835
Thank you, John.

852
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:13,338
You're an amazingly
selfless guy.

853
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:16,341
Thanks, buddy.

854
01:02:27,352 --> 01:02:28,853
It's halftime.
Are you hungry, hon?

855
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:31,356
I am so fucked.

856
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:32,857
Honey?

857
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:40,865
I think it's time you just had a
conversation with these people--

858
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:42,367
You know,
all three of you.

859
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:45,370
I can't.
I can't do that. Why?

860
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,871
Because if I do,

861
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:49,874
it's just gonna be between me and him,
and she's gonna pick him, and that's it.

862
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:52,377
I lose. I can't do that.

863
01:02:52,377 --> 01:02:55,880
But you tell me
she's supersensitive,

864
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,884
and if you really love her,
then have the conversation with her.

865
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:03,888
It doesn't, you know--
Just let the truth come out.

866
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:12,397
Good night.
Okay.

867
01:03:12,397 --> 01:03:14,899
I love you.
I love you.

868
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:17,902
Good night.
Good night.

869
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:20,405
Oh, um,

870
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,908
I forgot to ask.
John, do you have an extra tie I could borrow?

871
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:25,910
A what?

872
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:29,414
A tie. I want to try and look
nice for the wedding tomorrow.

873
01:03:30,915 --> 01:03:32,917
Uh, yeah. I think I do.

874
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:38,423
I've got a bunch of ties,
so I'll find one for you, if you need it.

875
01:03:38,423 --> 01:03:40,425
Thanks.
All right, good night.

876
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:54,439
Um, wow. I didn't know that Cyrus
was coming with to the wedding.

877
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,941
Oh.

878
01:03:57,942 --> 01:04:00,945
Yeah. Yeah. I-I--

879
01:04:00,945 --> 01:04:02,947
I-I know it's a lot,

880
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:07,452
but he's going through
a lot, so--

881
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:09,954
Yeah.
Okay?

882
01:04:09,954 --> 01:04:10,955
Okay.

883
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:14,459
Um,

884
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,461
I don't know
how to put this.

885
01:04:19,964 --> 01:04:21,466
Uh,

886
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,969
do you ever feel like...

887
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:27,972
Cyrus is not being...

888
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,978
a hundred percent genuine?

889
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,981
How do you mean?
I don't know.

890
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:40,985
I know he's going through a lot,
and I'm not trying to deny that.

891
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,491
Um,

892
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:47,992
I mean, like--

893
01:04:47,992 --> 01:04:49,994
I'm sorry.
Spit it out.

894
01:04:49,994 --> 01:04:50,995
No. Uh--
You're just--

895
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:54,499
He's behaving in a way
that I think...

896
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:57,502
is--

897
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:59,003
um--

898
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:03,007
All right,
I don't know how else to--

899
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:06,010
I wasn't gonna tell you about this, but, whatever,
I'll show you.

900
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,522
My shoes were
in Cyrus's closet.

901
01:05:20,024 --> 01:05:21,526
Hidden.

902
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:30,034
So, what--
what does that really mean?

903
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,037
I don't know.

904
01:05:33,037 --> 01:05:35,039
You know,
sometimes I think--

905
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:40,044
and I want to put
this exactly right--

906
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:43,548
he might be...

907
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:45,049
acting...

908
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,554
out...

909
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:51,556
with this behavior.

910
01:05:54,058 --> 01:05:56,060
How long have you
felt like this?

911
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,563
Do I feel that way?
I don't know.

912
01:05:58,563 --> 01:06:03,568
I'm just unearthing things in
my own head right now. I just--

913
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:06,571
You know what?
This is too important.

914
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:08,072
We should have Cyrus come in here.
No.

915
01:06:08,072 --> 01:06:10,074
Let's talk about this.
No, no, no.

916
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:13,578
Trust me.
It will really put him on the spot.

917
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:16,080
He's having panic attacks.

918
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,583
We'll have a great time at the wedding.
Are you sure?

919
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:21,586
Yeah. Yeah.

920
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,127
Cyrus.

921
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:04,629
Shh, shh, shh.

922
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:06,130
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

923
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,632
Cyrus. Shh.
It's me.

924
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:09,133
Are you all right?
Am I all right?

925
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,135
Yeah.
What are you doing in my room?

926
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,137
I want to talk to you.

927
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,142
Listen, I know why you want to
come to the wedding tomorrow.

928
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:24,649
This wedding is really,
really important to me.

929
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:29,654
And my ex-wife's feelings are really,
really important to me.

930
01:07:31,155 --> 01:07:33,157
And I know we've been messing
around with each other,

931
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:37,662
and it would be a great time for you to
mess things up for me and your mom.

932
01:07:37,662 --> 01:07:39,163
I agree.

933
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,165
But here's the thing.

934
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:45,169
Do you know what it feels like
to be knocked unconscious?

935
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:49,674
Because if I sense for one second
that anything weird is going on,

936
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:54,178
or you're even thinking of pulling some shit,
I will knock you out.

937
01:07:55,179 --> 01:07:56,681
Do you understand?

938
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:01,185
Yeah.
Good.

939
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:03,688
Then let's have a great time
at the wedding tomorrow, okay?

940
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:38,689
How you doing, Roger?
Good. Good. You look great.

941
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:39,690
Thank you.

942
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:50,201
Um,

943
01:08:50,201 --> 01:08:52,703
you know this is a big day
for John, right?

944
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:54,705
Yes.

945
01:08:58,209 --> 01:08:59,710
Okay.

946
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:09,220
I choose you to be mine.

947
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,722
To live with you
and laugh with you.

948
01:09:12,723 --> 01:09:17,228
To stand by your side
and sleep in your arms.

949
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:23,734
To be joy to your heart
and food for your soul.

950
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:26,737
To bring out the best
in you always.

951
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:33,744
Jamie and Tim,
please join hands and repeat after me.

952
01:09:34,745 --> 01:09:37,748
I, Jamie, take you, Tim--

953
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:39,750
I, Jamie,
take you, Tim--

954
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:42,753
to be my lawfully
wedded husband--

955
01:09:42,753 --> 01:09:44,755
to be
my lawfully wedded husband--

956
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:46,757
to have and to hold--

957
01:09:46,757 --> 01:09:48,759
to have
and to hold--

958
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:50,761
to love and to cherish--

959
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:52,763
to love
and to cherish--

960
01:10:15,786 --> 01:10:18,789
John. John.
Yeah.

961
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:18,015
Oh, I'm in here.

962
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:24,522
What?

963
01:11:28,526 --> 01:11:31,529
Cyrus, are you drunk?

964
01:11:32,029 --> 01:11:33,531
What happened?
How did you get drunk so fast?

965
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:37,535
I saw the way you
looked at her, John.

966
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:41,539
You can't marry her.
You'll never, ever marry her ever.

967
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:43,541
Listen to me.

968
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,543
Before you embarrass yourself,

969
01:11:45,543 --> 01:11:48,546
let me call you a cab and send you home,
'cause you're drunk.

970
01:11:48,546 --> 01:11:50,047
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay away from my mother.

971
01:11:50,548 --> 01:11:52,550
What'd I warn you
about last night?

972
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:55,553
Don't you do this to me!
She's all I have! Don't marry her!

973
01:11:55,553 --> 01:11:58,055
Knock it off!
You're not gonna take her away from me!

974
01:11:58,055 --> 01:12:00,558
Calm the fuck down!
You'll never fucking punch me, John!

975
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:03,060
- Get your shit together!
- Just leave us the fuck alone!

976
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,563
Fuck you!
She's all I fucking have!

977
01:12:05,563 --> 01:12:08,566
Go, John!
Go! Just go away!

978
01:12:08,566 --> 01:12:11,068
- Just go away and leave us the fuck alone!
- Put some water on your face!

979
01:12:11,569 --> 01:12:12,570
Stop it!
Leave us alone!

980
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,071
You stop it!
Stop it!

981
01:12:14,572 --> 01:12:16,073
What are you doing? Hey!

982
01:12:16,073 --> 01:12:18,075
Hey! Hey!
I'm not doing anything!

983
01:12:18,075 --> 01:12:19,577
What, are you
out of your mind?

984
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:21,579
You stop it!
He hit me.

985
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:24,081
- Did you hit him?
- He attacked me in the bathroom!

986
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:26,083
Did you hit him?

987
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:28,085
He hit me.
John!

988
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:44,101
Open your eyes, Molly.

989
01:13:34,318 --> 01:13:35,820
He went crazy in the bathroom.

990
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,822
Well, I didn't see
that part.

991
01:13:37,822 --> 01:13:40,825
I didn't even know that happened.
So, what did you think?

992
01:13:40,825 --> 01:13:43,327
Did you think that I suddenly-- I wasn't thinking.

993
01:13:43,828 --> 01:13:45,830
tackled Cyrus
and was beating him up?

994
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:49,333
- How could you think that about me?
- I just reacted.

995
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:52,837
I just saw my son
on the floor being hurt.

996
01:13:54,338 --> 01:13:57,341
From the moment
that I met you,

997
01:13:57,341 --> 01:14:02,346
as soon as your son became aware of it,
he made it his mission to split us up.

998
01:14:02,346 --> 01:14:05,349
Every step of the way,
every overture I made,

999
01:14:05,349 --> 01:14:09,854
every time I tried to be understanding and
reach out to him, he's shut me down.

1000
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:11,355
He hates me, Molly.

1001
01:14:11,355 --> 01:14:13,858
- He hates me.
- He's having a really tough time.

1002
01:14:13,858 --> 01:14:15,359
He's not having a tough time.

1003
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:16,861
Your son hates me.

1004
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:21,365
And I gotta say,
I fucking hate him too.

1005
01:14:35,379 --> 01:14:37,381
Nothing here
between us that's...

1006
01:14:40,384 --> 01:14:43,387
worth taking
another look at?

1007
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:45,890
You and I--

1008
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:48,392
We do have something.

1009
01:14:50,394 --> 01:14:52,396
And I know how rare it is,

1010
01:14:52,897 --> 01:14:54,899
because it's
been a long time...

1011
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:58,903
since I had anyone
close to someone like you.

1012
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:04,408
But I am not prepared...

1013
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:07,912
to get deeper into it and
hoping it's gonna work out,

1014
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:11,916
and then two years down the line
it's not gonna work out,

1015
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:14,418
and you guys have each other,

1016
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,923
and I'm alone again.

1017
01:15:18,923 --> 01:15:23,427
I just think there's so much
here between us and--

1018
01:15:26,931 --> 01:15:29,934
He's gonna not--
He's gonna wreck it.

1019
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,442
So that's it.

1020
01:15:38,442 --> 01:15:39,944
I'm sorry.

1021
01:16:20,484 --> 01:16:22,987
I've been thinking
about us, and...

1022
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,992
I feel like I've missed a few
things in our relationship.

1023
01:16:27,992 --> 01:16:31,996
And I feel that
I've done you a disservice...

1024
01:16:33,497 --> 01:16:36,000
with the way that I raised you,
in some aspects.

1025
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:43,507
I'm so proud of...

1026
01:16:44,008 --> 01:16:46,010
who we are
and how close we are.

1027
01:16:48,012 --> 01:16:49,513
I don't think
there's any reason...

1028
01:16:49,513 --> 01:16:52,016
to feel negatively about that.

1029
01:16:54,018 --> 01:16:56,520
The fact that you and I
have a hard time...

1030
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,522
letting another person...

1031
01:16:59,523 --> 01:17:02,026
hang out with us is...

1032
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:07,031
unhealthy for us, I feel.

1033
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:11,035
I don't want you
to think that...

1034
01:17:11,535 --> 01:17:17,041
I want you to be alone forever
or want you to be unhappy.

1035
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:23,047
I want you to find somebody
and be with him.

1036
01:17:25,549 --> 01:17:30,554
But I know in my heart
that John is not that person.

1037
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:39,063
There are things that are
happening from all sides of this.

1038
01:17:39,063 --> 01:17:41,065
I-I--

1039
01:17:41,065 --> 01:17:44,068
I know what happened
with the shoes.

1040
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:52,576
Who cares? It's shoes.

1041
01:17:52,576 --> 01:17:55,079
It's so stupid. It's shoes.
I don't care about shoes.

1042
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:02,586
But I care if
you're lying to me.

1043
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:12,096
I used to feel like you and I had
a special little thing, and now...

1044
01:18:12,096 --> 01:18:14,598
I'm feeling like you...

1045
01:18:15,599 --> 01:18:18,102
are letting me go away.

1046
01:18:23,607 --> 01:18:25,609
No one will ever...

1047
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:27,611
ever take your place.

1048
01:18:28,612 --> 01:18:30,114
Ever.

1049
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:36,620
Well, I'm happy he's gone.

1050
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:46,630
I'm not happy right now.

1051
01:19:32,342 --> 01:19:33,343
What do you want?

1052
01:19:35,846 --> 01:19:38,348
I want you to come back
and live with us.

1053
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,352
Are you
fucking kidding me?

1054
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:45,355
Come on,
just go home, Cyrus.

1055
01:19:45,355 --> 01:19:47,357
It's not the same anymore!
Oh, it's not the same?

1056
01:19:47,357 --> 01:19:48,859
No. She's depressed!
That's 'cause you fucked it up!

1057
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:51,361
She misses you, John!
I know you love her!

1058
01:19:51,361 --> 01:19:52,863
Yeah, I know!

1059
01:19:52,863 --> 01:19:55,365
We had a great thing,
and you fucked it up!

1060
01:19:55,866 --> 01:19:59,870
Please, John. Just hear me out and then
you can make the decision for yourself.

1061
01:20:00,871 --> 01:20:02,873
I'll move out.
I'll do whatever you want.

1062
01:20:02,873 --> 01:20:05,375
Don't punish her
'cause I'm a fucked-up person.

1063
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,377
I-I-- It's--

1064
01:20:07,377 --> 01:20:09,880
It's not her fault.
No, it's not her fault!

1065
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,883
It's not her fault!
It's your fault!

1066
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:17,888
So you just live with that,
you asshole!

1067
01:20:17,888 --> 01:20:22,392
It's your fault that I'm back
in a shitty apartment all alone!

1068
01:20:22,893 --> 01:20:25,896
You're a little fucking liar
and an asshole!

1069
01:20:25,896 --> 01:20:27,397
So fuck you!

1070
01:20:33,403 --> 01:20:34,905
Go away!

1071
01:20:43,914 --> 01:20:45,415
Are you still out there?

1072
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:22,452
Move over.

1073
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:42,472
Let me ask you something.

1074
01:21:44,474 --> 01:21:46,476
Were the panic attacks
real or fake?

1075
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:51,982
They were real at first,
and then...

1076
01:21:53,483 --> 01:21:56,486
sometimes I would fake them
to get sympathy from Molly.

1077
01:22:04,494 --> 01:22:06,496
I brought you something.

1078
01:22:08,999 --> 01:22:11,001
It's mixed,
but it's not mastered.

1079
01:22:11,001 --> 01:22:13,003
So it's not final.

1080
01:22:17,507 --> 01:22:21,511
I think I might be a really fucked-up
and dysfunctional person, John.

1081
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,022
You did some
fucked-up stuff.

1082
01:22:35,525 --> 01:22:37,527
But it's my fault too.

1083
01:22:44,534 --> 01:22:47,037
How'd you get through
all these panic attacks?

1084
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:56,546
I'm sorry.
I never had panic attacks.

1085
01:22:57,547 --> 01:23:00,050
I made that up
to try to get rid of you.

1086
01:23:08,058 --> 01:23:10,060
It was war at that point.

1087
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:13,063
I was desperate.
I had to come up with something.

1088
01:23:13,063 --> 01:23:15,065
You were boxing me out.

1089
01:23:23,573 --> 01:23:25,075
You're good, John.

1090
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:28,078
Well, you're good.

1091
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:35,085
Would you mind--

1092
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:40,090
Would you mind
giving me a ride home?

1093
01:23:42,092 --> 01:23:44,094
Okay. Is your mom home?

1094
01:23:45,095 --> 01:23:47,097
No.

1095
01:23:47,097 --> 01:23:48,598
All right. 'Cause--

1096
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,103
I don't know. I'm just--

1097
01:23:53,103 --> 01:23:56,106
I'm really not ready
to talk to her yet.

1098
01:24:08,785 --> 01:24:11,288
I'm just gonna drop you off
right here, if that's okay.

1099
01:24:11,288 --> 01:24:12,789
Yeah.

1100
01:24:19,296 --> 01:24:21,798
Thanks for the ride.
No problem.

1101
01:24:49,326 --> 01:24:51,828
I have some of your stuff
in the garage that you left.

1102
01:24:51,828 --> 01:24:53,830
I'll go grab it.

1103
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:56,833
Right now?
Yeah. I'll be right back.

1106
01:26:25,121 --> 01:26:29,626

1108

1109

1110
01:26:48,144 --> 01:26:53,149

1117
01:27:50,206 --> 01:27:56,212

might be the right place # #

1118
01:27:56,212 --> 01:28:00,717
# # Might be that sweet space # #

1119
01:28:00,717 --> 01:28:02,719

1120
01:28:05,221 --> 01:28:10,727

all this time # #

1122
01:28:21,237 --> 01:28:27,243

turn to an old road # #

1123
01:28:27,243 --> 01:28:31,247
# # But the secret's too slow # #

1124
01:28:31,247 --> 01:28:34,250
# # Or we're too fast # #

1125
01:28:51,768 --> 01:28:56,773
# # Look me in the mouth
I got nothin' in my smile # #

1126
01:28:59,776 --> 01:29:04,280
# # I've been waitin' for you
You're just my style # #

1127
01:29:07,283 --> 01:29:12,789
# # Look me in the gut
I got fear for my own name # #

1128
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:17,794

1129
01:29:19,295 --> 01:29:21,297
