It's too bad that 99% of the bible's
completely unreadable.

to understand.

angle of insertion.

created for, to help guys like us.

And we owe it to the others.
I ruined the bible.

1032
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,992
I'm calling from
East Great Falls High School.

1033
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,959
NOAH: It was the summer
of my junior year, 1969,

1034
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,679
and my buddies and l,
we take this trip to Amsterdam,

1035
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,514
where we run into a group
of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos

1036
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,639
who were willing to trade their bodies
for a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPs.

1037
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:38,032
Well, needless to say, we had ourselves
one super weekend with those gals,

1038
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,834
sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

1039
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,353
But the sad news was,
we had no idea what we were doing.

1040
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,112
We had no technique.

1041
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,119
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

1042
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,033
and we run into this Dutch hooker
in the red-light district,

1043
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,429
and she tells us about this book.

1044
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:00,395
It was a sex manual, evidently written
in the 19th century by some priest.

1045
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,755
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

1046
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,195
and then when we got back
to East Great Falls,

1047
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,919
I had the bright idea to write my own book

1048
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,879
and add my own observations
and experiences and advice

1049
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,714
and leave it in the library for some
other hapless virgin in the class below us.

1050
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,713
But I had no idea it had been
passed down for 40 years.

1051
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,434
Your book is a legend, Mr Levenstein.

This is a real piece of history here.

What happened to it?

1060
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,432
Well, that's why we're here.

1061
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,714
The bible kinda got ruined,

1062
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,588
so we wanna call everyone on the list
and try to reconstruct it.

Oh.

1064
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,674
Well, I think you boys might need
some help.

1065
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,354
Well, girls have the advantage,
because girls talk to each other,

1066
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,034
and don't kid yourself,
they talk about the penis.

1067
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,396
Penis size, penis shape,
the angle of the bend.

1068
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,358
Whether it winks at you. They talk.

1069
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,194
Now, to really make love to a woman,
you gotta really care about her.

1070
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,068
But... Hey, sex is great, but sex with
someone you love? That's awesome.

1071
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,832
Dude, that is so profound.

1072
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,035
Telling you.

1073
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,917
Yeah, definitely gets lonely on the road.

1074
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,434
Sure, I made love to all kinds
of different food groups.

1075

Did you ever try making love
to a peanut-butter sandwich?

1076
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,948
Nothing comes close.

1077
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,075
What?

1078
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,233
Well, maybe a deboned ham hock,
but that takes a whole lot of prep.

1079
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,835
Bend your knees.

1080

Next time you spank it, sit lndian-style.

are like musical instruments.

Sure, you can have any technician
blow on your horn,

1084
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,118
but to place your instrument into
the hands of a true expert?

1085
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,794
That, my young friend, is true harmony.

1086

NOAH: Guys don't talk to each other

1087
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,671
because they view each other
as competitors,

1088
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,398
which I think is crazy. You know?

1089
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,790
Because men need to help each other
and work together to get laid.

If you're honest and treat a girl with respect,

01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,278
Yeah. I heard.

1254
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,436
-But you still hate me?
-No.

1255
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,871
No. Why would you say that?

1256
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,918
You haven't said a word to me
since that night.

1257
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,471
I know. I'm sorry.

1258
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,949
I guess I just...
I needed time to work through my feelings.

1259
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,832
And? What did you decide?

1260
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,549
Gibbs says that Stifler has to sit on
a foam rubber doughnut for six weeks.

1261
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:17,269
And he says they're talking about
amputating his feet from frostbite.

1262
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,397
Gibbs is a liar.
Stifler doesn't need amputation.

1263
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,948
That's too bad. I got an A in Shop.

1264
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,429
(SNORTS)

1265
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,317
Oh, my. Was that a snort?

1266
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,914
Come to gloat?

1267
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,036
No. Just looking for a fag.

1268
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,749
Just 'cause I took a moose pickle up my ass
doesn't mean I'm gay.

1269
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,559
Very funny. How's your bum?

1270
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,599
Feels like I gave birth to a mayonnaise jar,
but thanks for asking.

1271
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,312
Hey, I heard about your boyfriend.
That really sucks.

1272
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,472
Yeah. I thought only high school boys
were jerks.

1273
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,198
It turns out they never outgrow it.

1274
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,829
Imogen, no offence,
and you're the most mature girl I know,

1275
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,234
but a 24-year-old dude isn't gonna take
a high-school girl seriously.

1276
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,673
I suppose not.

1277
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,392
You wanna sit down?

1278
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,234
What for?

1279
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,233
I just thought we could both use
a friend right now.

1280
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,389
Stifler.

1281
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,959
My bad. Reflex.

1282
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,268
(LAUGHS)

1283
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,279
ROB: I'm sorry.

1284
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,908
You have to make your own decisions.

1285
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,788
You know, I just...
I thought we had something.

1286
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,074
We did.

1287
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,829
We do.

1288
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,559
I was scared.

1289
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,434
Of what?

1290
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,758
I really like you.

1291
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,430
And I want it to be special.

1292
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,837
I guess I just wanted to be ready.

1293
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,992
So you almost had sex with Stifler
so you'd be ready for me.

1294
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,395
Yeah.

1295
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,999
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1296
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,508
Well, I heard you got some practise.

1297
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,958
You know, the truth is,
is nothing happened.

1298
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,513
I didn't want it to be random like that.

1299
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,869
And...

1300
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,399
I couldn't picture my first time
being with anybody else but you.

1301
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,473
What was that?

1302
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,758
I don't know.

1303
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,837
-Looks like we're stuck.
-Yeah.

1304
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,717
You know, we could be up here for a while.

1305
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,835
Yeah.

1306
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,598
LUBE: Hey, can I ask you a question?

1307
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,318
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1308
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,834
Why do you hook up with assholes
like Scott Stifler anyway?

1309
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,115
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

1310
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,237
(SCOFFS) You know,
you're just the same as all the rest.

1311
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,435
I'm just some sort of trophy to you.

1312
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,875
You don't care about me.
You just wanna sleep with me,

1313
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,679
because you think
it's some sort of status symbol.

1314
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,875
Sorry.

1315
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,115
(ASHLEY SlGHS)

1316
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,189
God.

1317
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,995
How long are we gonna be up here?

1318
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,193
I'll get help.

1319
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,113
ASHLEY: What are you doing?

1320
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,839
It's not that far down,
and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.

1321
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,831
What, is this supposed to impress me?

1322
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,876
The thought had crossed my mind.

1323
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,951
Absolutely not. First of all, it's just wrong.

1324
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,235
Second of all,
you're not even supposed to touch the door.

1325
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:33,393
And third, it's just really dangerous, okay?
So just get away from there.

1326
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,835
Right. What was I thinking?

1327
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,635
Whoa!

1328
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,312
(ASHLEY SCREAMlNG)

1329
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,319
Are you okay?

1330
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,833
I think I hurt my leg.

1331
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,114
(SlGHS)

1332
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,389
Idiot.

1333
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,553
Are you okay?

1334
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,919
Are you crazy?

1335
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,439
Are you okay?

1336
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,112
Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1337
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,590
About what you said
about how I don't care about you

1338
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,319
and you're just a trophy,
that's actually not true.

1339
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,757
I really like you.
We went to elementary school together.

1340
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,077
I remember when you sang Hey Ya!
in the sixth-grade talent show.

1341
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:32,119
I remember when you fell off the pyramid
at the homecoming game, freshman year.

1342
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,953
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

1343
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,669
I just liked how you played it off
like it was all part of the routine.

1344
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:45,074
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe,
but I actually like you for you.

1345
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,754
Look, this may be a shock to you,

1346
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,913
but I have no idea what I'm doing with girls.

1347
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,597
But I really wanna learn.
You just give me a chance.

1348
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:01,277
That's all I'm asking.

1349
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,794
And I guarantee that
I will make it my life's mission

1350
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:09,077
to satisfy you in every way possible.

1351
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,714
-Let's go back to the...
-To the cabin.

1352
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,314
Dude. You forgot to sign it.

1353
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,028
You sure we can't just keep it
for one more year?

1354
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,031
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.

1355
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,155
ROB ON COMPUTER:
This is my little brother, Cody,

1356
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,109
and this is what he does
with the vacuum every day.

1357
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,917
No! Hey! No!

1358
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,358
CODY: Help! It's stuck! I can't get it off!

1359
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,589
(CODY GROANING)

1360
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,309
Help! Help! It's stuck.

1361
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,035
(LAUGHS) Gotcha.

1362
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,349
CODY: Help!

1363
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,509
No!

1364
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,391
She was using me. I... That was really bad.

1365
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,069
Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?

1366
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,480
Wanna suck me off in the Sharper lmage?

1367
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,320
Rob, are you some kind of jive turkey?

1368
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,192
He's like an inch away from the real McCoy.

1369
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,637
Did you bring condoms?

1370
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,835
What?

1371
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,912
I wet the bed until I was 13 years old, okay?

1372
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,474
You nancy boys couldn't get lucky
at a Jonas Brothers concert

1373
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,596
with a fistful of backstage passes.

1374
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,555
Faith in God and His promise of eternal life.

1375
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,913
Now, put the condom on the banana.

1376
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,435
Who didn't see that coming?
Look at the time. Gotta go.

1377
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,079
I think that is quite enough pictures
of the cheerleaders.

1378
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,559
How about we get some of the game?

1379
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,035
We're eating.

1380
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,509
(FARTS)

1381
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,389
You've been fucking Americans or...

1382
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,638
Watching, loving...

1383
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:07,149
Bear with me.

1384
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,993
If she's down, bring her flowers.

1385
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,669
If she's thirsty, serve her fine champagne.

1386
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,035
Yeah, 'cause, I'm telling you,
my wife is pretty effing hot.

1387
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,430
I'm talking a tight, tight ass
and squeaky clean.

1388
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,834
Is that cream-filled? You rock.

1389
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,470
Oh. Don't mention that, okay?

1390
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:29,312
And whenever it comes to making out,
put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.

1391
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:31,312
