1
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,436
# It was only me

2
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:28,962
# there was no you

3
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:34,918
# why be so scared of love...

4
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:43,480
# ask your heart this question

5
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:48,120
# why these problems with love

6
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:52,639
# break those chains

7
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,882
# and may it beat again

8
00:00:57,527 --> 00:01:02,157
# you're here and gone
# you're intoxicated

9
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:06,923
# why be so scared of love

10
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:11,837
# are you the only one to get lost
# in the sea of love

11
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:15,756
# as for me, I lost myself
# in your breath

12
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:29,036
# the road is long

13
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,880
# dreams are short

14
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:38,446
# love is real

15
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:43,485
# is it love that's false

16
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:47,681
# you're the only one left

17
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:53,078
# who hasn't tasted love
# in this world

18
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,562
You're not going to that
bachelor party, Celal.

19
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:59,241
But one of my best friends
is getting married.

20
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,319
He's throwing a bachelor party
and you expect me not to go?

21
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:05,001
If I don't go to Çiko Mehmet's party
I'll be a laughing stock.

22
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,362
Don't even think about it.
We've been together for 6 years.

23
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:10,081
You've never mentioned him once.
Who is this Çiko Mehmet?

24
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:14,200
He's one of our group. An unassuming guy.
That's why you haven't heard of him.

25
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,165
What's the name of the girl this
Çiko Mehmet guy is marrying?

26
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:19,836
The name of the girl...
They're keeping it a secret, Ceren.

27
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:23,004
Her identity hasn't been revealed yet.
Half of the invitation is blank.

28
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:26,244
- I swear he hasn't told us.
- Nonsense! That's a dumb excuse.

29
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,881
Look, Ceren, sweetie. I'm going.

30
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,999
I'll wish him the best, then come home
like a perfect gentleman.

31
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,277
If you were a perfect gentleman,
you wouldn't be going to Aksaray.

32
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:35,601
Don't push it.

33
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:38,799
Everyone knows about
the girls in Aksaray.

34
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,236
Everyone knows what they get up to.
Don't provoke me, Celal.

35
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,484
What's wrong with Aksaray?
We're going to watch performances...

36
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:48,640
...by light-skinned girls from the Balkans
and Russia who have a certain standing...

37
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:51,804
...who've had ballet training, know what
they're doing, and are really hot.

38
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:56,079
Then we'll watch two or three
belly dancers do their thing.

39
00:02:56,207 --> 00:03:00,485
We might stick some money
in their cleavage, just to help.

40
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:01,562
That's how it's done.

41
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:04,804
If you go to that bachelor party
this relationship is over.

42
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:07,361
The end of"Celal and Ceren".
Get it?

43
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,636
- I'm going, Ceren.
- You're not going.

44
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,041
- I'm going.
- You're not going.

45
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,283
- I have to go.
- You're not going.

46
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:14,045
You're not going to that bachelor party.

47
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,727
- I'll go at 11:00 and come back at 1:00.
- You're not going anywhere.

48
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:18,565
- I'll go at midnight and come back at 3:00.
- You're not going.

49
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:21,042
Then I'll go at 9:00 and come back
tomorrow morning.

50
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,476
Look here. Stop it.
I'm going to smack you.

51
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:26,804
- Look Ceren, I have to go.
- You're not going, or it's over.

52
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,281
But, Ceren...

53
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:31,365
If you go to that party
you'll neversee me again.

54
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:33,160
Give me that transit pass.

55
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:36,126
Give me the pass at least!

56
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:57,285
Dad, look. My big brother's coming.

57
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,438
Where have you been?
You big lug.

58
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,599
Dad, there was an accident on the bridge.
Traffic was terrible.

59
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:05,480
What bridge? What bridge do you
take to get here?

60
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:08,075
How do I get here, Dad?
How do I get to Karaköy?

61
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:11,079
Do you expect me to go via Tarabyaüstü?
I go along Barbaros Boulevard.

62
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,675
Zincirlikuyu feeds into Levent.
The traffic's always horrible.

63
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,281
- He's lying, Dad.
- Look, you've gonna get a smack.

64
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:19,001
Go inside. Get the equipment.
We're going to an installation.

65
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,925
- Have him come too.
- No, he has some business with me.

66
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,235
I swear, he really got on my
nerves this morning.

67
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:31,202
A bunch of guys going to Aksaray
for a bachelor party. Yeah, right.

68
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:33,283
We're talking about Celal.
Just let him go.

69
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,160
- What can he get up to in Aksaray?
- That's men for you.

70
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:39,597
You can't trust them. And they get
him to drink this thing called "rocket".

71
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:42,360
Afterthat, my boy totally loses it.

72
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,081
Those no-good friends of his get him
to drink it. It's his weakness.

73
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,880
- Then it gets dangerous.
- That's what I've been saying.

74
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:51,278
Are you thick orwhat?
What kind of friends are you?

75
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,717
I told my boss about it and
asked her.

76
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:55,405
"Can I go?"
"No, you can't. "

77
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,882
I didn't insist. I asked,
and she didn't let me.

78
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,440
Ceren's the one in charge.
Sorry about that.

79
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,876
I'm not coming. Go have fun.

80
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,838
Don't try to force me.
I'm tired, anyway.

81
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:05,719
What do you mean you're not coming?
How did that happen?

82
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,042
You make me sick.
You've turned into a total pushover!

83
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,680
Be a man!

84
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:12,082
Bang your fist on the table
and say, "I'm going out. "

85
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,596
Don't get me started!
Don't try to get out of it!

86
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:17,878
I've given 6 years to this relationship.
I can't spoil everything now.

87
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,760
I have responsibilities. Do you
think I'm desperate forsex like you?

88
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,206
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that?

89
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:24,238
- A ring.
- An engagement ring.

90
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,439
This girl's going to be my wife some day.
My life companion.

91
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:30,002
I have an idea.
Why not go without telling her?

92
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:32,436
That's right. She'll never know.
She'll think you're sleeping. Come on.

93
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:35,764
No, guys. Please.
I want to go with you.

94
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:39,163
I really do. And I'm almost ready
to let you talk me into it.

95
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:40,766
But please don't.

96
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:44,163
What are you up to?
Have your friends gone?

97
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,718
They're gone, gone, gone.

98
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm all on my own, darling.

99
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:57,164
Good for you, sweetie.
You listen to your Ceren.

100
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,041
You don't make me repeat myself.

101
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,875
You don't go to nightclubs.

102
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,959
I could gobble you up.

103
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:09,439
I could gobble you up, too,
but... but... but...

104
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:13,998
...but there's a lot more
I'd like to eat.

105
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,441
My J-Lo lookalike.

106
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:23,760
My little baby, my cow, my pussy-wussy.

107
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:25,559
What do mean, cow? Celal?

108
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:28,121
I didn't say anything bad, sweetie.

109
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:30,602
You know I don't likejokes like that.
What's a pussy-wussy?

110
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,558
It was a compliment.

111
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,679
Okay. I forgive you.

112
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:39,761
Right, darling. My battery
is almost gone.

113
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:42,806
I'm telling you so you don't get mad
if you can't reach me.

114
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:45,003
Sweet dreams, then.

115
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,687
Okay, dear. Okay. Hang up now.

116
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:50,118
- You hang up.
- No, you hang up.

117
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:51,765
- Hang up.
- You hang up.

118
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:54,037
I'm not hanging up.
You hang up.

119
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,721
Hang up, Ceren.
Hang up, this is expensive.

120
00:06:56,927 --> 00:07:00,078
Okay, Celal.
I love you. Good night.

121
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:01,840
Good night, baby. Good night.

122
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:10,005
That was a masterful performance.
I was great.

123
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:12,118
- Good for you.
- Bravo!

124
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,403
What did I tell you?

125
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,884
Way to go! That's my boy.

126
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,643
Off we go to Aksaray.

127
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:58,760
I'm telling you right now:
I don't plan to drink much tonight.

128
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:00,843
But this is my bachelor party.

129
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,800
- Right, the rocket shots have come.
- Oh, good grief.

130
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:06,487
- What's with all the shots?
- Come on, drink up.

131
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,644
- No, I can't drink. No.
- Tomorrow's Sunday. Are you nuts?

132
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,201
Come on, come on.
All together.

133
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,526
Hey, Kubi. Could you check my thingy?

134
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:17,683
- I'm talking to you.
- Okay.

135
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:20,804
- For God's sake.
- Drink up.

136
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:28,115
What do we say to another round?

137
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,039
Cheers! Cheers! Let's do it!

138
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:32,323
I don't feel so good.

139
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:00,075
Let's go, let's go

140
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:02,522
Darling, let's go

141
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:07,721
Let's get happy
and say "Oh my goodness

142
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,836
You damn scumbag.
I saw everything, you bastard.

143
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,316
You've ended everything between us.
It's over! You bastard.

144
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,796
Kubi! Kubi! Kubi! Kubi!

145
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,081
I saw my text messages
the minute I woke up.

146
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,801
Ceren sent 70 messages.
She swore in 18 of them.

147
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:36,252
And cursed me in 22 of them.

148
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,243
Try to calm down first.
You're a big guy.

149
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:42,440
The relationship I've been built piece
by piece forsix years is over.

150
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:45,035
Hey, I'm talking.
Try listening.

151
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,437
My fingertips are tingling
and my lips have gone numb.

152
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,717
And the most nerve endings
are here, and there.

153
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,919
Buddy, calm down.
Take a deep breath.

154
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,000
You're really screwed, brother.

155
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:00,837
Berkay uploaded all the photos
from last night to Facebook.

156
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,479
- What videos?
- The videos of us partying.

157
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:08,644
- Where'd he put them?
- On Facebook.

158
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,565
- On which Facebook?
- How many Facebooks are there, dope?

159
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:15,155
- Zuckerberg's?
- That's the one.

160
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:19,965
I'm done for.
It's all over. I'm toast.

161
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
- How could I do something like that?
- Come have a look.

162
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:25,524
Just look at them!

163
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:29,356
Ceren thinks we're at home asleep.
Can you believe it?

164
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,006
Can I tell you something?

165
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,402
I can't believe I've spent six years
of my life with Ceren.

166
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,597
I only spent six minutes with
these girls...

167
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:38,685
...and I swear life's better already.

168
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:45,320
- Get closer.
- How can I get any closer?

169
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:48,558
Am I supposed to walk through
one of the girls?

170
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:55,560
If this is a woman, what is Ceren?
Tell me. What is she?

171
00:10:57,607 --> 00:11:00,758
I said her name. I shouldn't have...
I said "Ceren" loud and clear.

172
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,563
I'm screwed.
I'm totally screwed.

173
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:07,207
You can count on me.
We'll come up with something.

174
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:10,239
Okay? We'll decide on something.
We'll brainstorm.

175
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,198
I'm totally boned.
I swear.

176
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:16,075
Are you a total idiot?
Do you have shit for brains?

177
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,805
Is there a donut up there?

178
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,636
Is your hair red because you have
ketchup for brains?

179
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,806
Who films a booze-up like that?
Why?

180
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,557
It's the golden rule: What happens
in Aksaray, stays in Aksaray. Period.

181
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,758
How was I supposed to know?

182
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,805
Tatyana and Svetlana said, "this is great,
Berkay, upload the video. "

183
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,919
So I did. But I deleted it three
minutes later.

184
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,436
On the Intemet, everything spreads
like a virus.

185
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:42,998
Okay, he's an idiot. Ajerk.
A moron.

186
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:47,036
Why do you keep making me drink 
rocket shots? You know I can't say no.

187
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,086
You did the same thing at my
engagement party.

188
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:53,405
Rememberwhat happened.
Think back to that day.

189
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:57,725
I'm full of thejoy of cutting the ribbon
forthe young couple.

190
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,636
I'm cutting it in front of you all.

191
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,325
We say, "In the name of God... "

192
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,482
Cut it. Cut it.

193
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,645
- It won't cut. What should I do?
- Just nick it. This is terrible.

194
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,120
- It won't cut. How can I cut it?
- Just nick it.

195
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,966
It won't cut. They brought dull scissors.

196
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,518
It won't cut.
The scissors are dull.

197
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:14,796
- Cut it, uncle.
- Shall I cut it?

198
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,158
What did you do?
What did you do?

199
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:20,404
You ruined everything.
Just look at that. Who'd do that?

200
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,523
- You should have said something.
- Ah, darling.

201
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:24,478
I could have given you permission to go.

202
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:28,322
It's over. You all chipped in
to end my six-year relationship.

203
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,007
But I deserve it.
Who was itching for it? Celal Manki.

204
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:34,717
What will Ceren do? She'll kick my ass
right out of her place.

205
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,401
So she kicks your ass and boots you out.
So what?

206
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:41,236
You're a grown man.
You can stick up for yourself!

207
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:42,636
Just look at you.

208
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,122
You're a Doberman that's tumed
into a poodle!

209
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:48,523
If I put a burning hoop here,
you'd jump through it.

210
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,525
That's how she's trained you.
I've never seen anything so pathetic.

211
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:55,117
I trusted you.
I thought I could depend on you.

212
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:58,877
I closed my eyes and put myself in
your hands, you animal. You dog!

213
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:01,846
- You ox.
- I open my eyes, and poof!

214
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:04,726
Where is he? Off to the Russians.
Who'd do something like that?

215
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:08,277
To someone like me? Six years
together, and he's my first boyfriend.

216
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:12,400
You know girls, I had my first
time with him.

217
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:14,445
Blah, blah, blah.

218
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:17,923
Is this how you'll set up a home?
Is this how you'll be a father?

219
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,325
Is this how you'll be head of the house?
You'll have a family to support. Afamily.

220
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:25,964
- You'll be a deadbeat dad, at best.
- You said it.

221
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:30,717
And he actually calls me and says,
"Honey, I'm going to bed now, okay?"

222
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,601
Are you kidding me? You must be...

223
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,883
We talked on the phone like
imbeciles every single day.

224
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:39,602
Idiot. How do I know he didn't
do the same thing every other day?

225
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,043
If Ceren's a woman, what are these?

226
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:46,006
God damn you.
Damn you.

227
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:48,123
And you've been engaged for
a whole four years.

228
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,886
What's he trying to do?
What kind of a jerk is he?

229
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:53,965
He's stringing you along.
He never intended to marry you.

230
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,681
Just drop him for God's sake.
He's playing you for a fool.

231
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:59,321
He has it coming.
Throw away the ring.

232
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:02,320
Throw away the ring, Ceren.
Just throw it away.

233
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,076
Celal, she doesn't respect you.

234
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:08,643
She pressured you.
She forced you to lie.

235
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,157
Then when you lied, she dumped you.

236
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:14,558
She pressured you, made you lie
and dumped you.

237
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,162
She's responsible for it all.
Don't you see?

238
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:20,279
If she'd given you your freedom
you wouldn't have lied.

239
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:23,444
You'd have partied and then gone
home. You didn't do anything wrong.

240
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,718
You're right, she pressured me.
She pressures me.

241
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:31,160
You can't go here, can't go there.
You can't do this orthat. Enough.

242
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,882
I was just having fun with my friends.
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

243
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:39,006
She made me lie. She left me no choice
but to lie.

244
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:42,125
And that's not all.
She was badmouthing Kahraman.

245
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:45,523
- She was trying to throw him out.
- She has a grudge against Kahraman.

246
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:49,358
It's him or me, she said.
Who'd say something like that?

247
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:53,201
Him or me? What's that supposed to mean?
Who'd get jealous of a bird?

248
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:56,478
I said, "Everyone goes,
but Kahraman stays. "

249
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,199
He's my baby.

250
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:01,524
He only says one word, and only once
every three months. He calls me "dad".

251
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,719
He was so lucky to go out with you.

252
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,917
Who does he think he is?
He'sjust some thick brute.

253
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:10,039
He sits there with two Moldavians and
says, "If these are women, what's Ceren?"

254
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,203
- Who do you think you are?
- Really...

255
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:17,039
...I don't deserve this.
I really don't.

256
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:18,562
- Anything there?
- No.

257
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:21,879
- You're exaggerating.
- What do mean, Gülce?

258
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:24,396
He wasjust having fun.
What's done is done.

259
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,802
He had fun with his friends, he
screwed up, and he went home.

260
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:29,526
- Wouldn't anyone have done the same?
- If course they wouldn't.

261
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:32,838
He can't. They're engaged.
They're planning a future together.

262
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:37,006
- Possible. You always contradict me.
- I just don't get it.

263
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:39,880
- Don't contradict me all the time.
- Hold on a second, girls.

264
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:44,205
What are you doing? You're all saying
something different. Be quiet.

265
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:46,841
You have to make the most
of this opportunity.

266
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,195
You have to turn it around.

267
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,045
Tell hershe can't dump you
because you're dumping her.

268
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:53,842
Pop that zit. Grin and bear it.
Pull that scab right off.

269
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:59,200
You have to dojustice to the
testosterone running through your veins.

270
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:02,205
Whip it out and shake it.
Show them what you're made of.

271
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:05,637
You've gone all limp.
You've tumed into a doormat.

272
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,117
Is that any way to live? Huh?

273
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:10,681
Do you know the story of Sultan Süleyman?

274
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,481
He almost took over the world.

275
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:17,486
Then he ran into Hürrem Sultan.
See, it's always a woman. Do you see?

276
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,364
And what about Helen of Troy?

277
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:23,036
The Trojan Warwas fought over her.

278
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:27,285
Empires clashed! People died!

279
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:31,326
There was famine! They froze on
the battlefield. All because of a woman!

280
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,759
The Huns were split over a woman.
It's always a woman!

281
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:39,363
Czechoslovakia broke apart.
Awoman ended Czechoslovakia!

282
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,366
What would I do all alone?
What would I do if I were single?

283
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:47,322
Czechoslovakia, I said!
Who are you?! What are you?

284
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:52,404
I'm asking you to think it over.

285
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:57,039
You're right. I'm sick of it.

286
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,677
I'm going to run forfreedom,
like Kunte Kinte. Enough already.

287
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:04,646
I've had it up to here.
It's Hakuna Matata from now on.

288
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,998
That's it. One-night stands from now on.

289
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,038
- Anything that moves, gets it.
- That's the spirit.

290
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,204
She corralled me into marriage,
step by step. Like the riot police.

291
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,005
She had me up against the wall.

292
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:18,676
I don't want any of it. Screw marriage,
screw the engagement, screw it all.

293
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:21,685
I took it off. Look.
Look at the ring.

294
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,004
- I threw it away and now I'm free.
- Way to go.

295
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,436
Oh. I feel light as a feather.

296
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:32,322
Just watch what I do next.
I'm going to call and say it right out.

297
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,604
- Call her. Go on, call her.
- Don't call her. She won't answer.

298
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:39,402
Just see what happens now.
Watch what happens next.

299
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:41,882
Aha!

300
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,236
Did you see that?

301
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,604
He's calling me because you didn't
pick up, the bastard. Should I answer it?

302
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:47,477
- Answer it.
- Don't.

303
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:48,517
- Answer it.
- Don't.

304
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:51,764
- Should I answer it?
- Answer if you want.

305
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,842
- Yes, is that shithead Celal?
- Don't curse at me.

306
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:59,722
I'll put another bump in that nose
of yours. Put Ceren on the phone!

307
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:01,646
Just a second.

308
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,206
Hello?

309
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,839
I don't feel good.

310
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,395
Hello? Ceren?

311
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,563
We've been togetherforsix years.

312
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:24,157
And while we've gone through
some tough times...

313
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:26,204
...I think we've had some great times too.

314
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:30,923
And I also think we fit together
like Feng Shui.

315
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:34,966
Like Yin and Yang. And as a result
of that unfortunate incident...

316
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:40,287
...the other night, I want you to
know that I've grown and...

317
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:44,076
...I've made some decisions. I don't
think there's any point in you...

318
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,722
...wasting yourtime any more either.
We've reached a new stage in...

319
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:52,483
...our relationship, and I think it's time
we moved on to a new level.

320
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:53,642
Marriage. He's about to propose.

321
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,520
I think we have no other choice, Ceren.

322
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,719
Let's move on to a new stage...
Let's take thejump together.

323
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,001
Meaning?

324
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,244
- "Meaning," she says.
- A new season and fresh hopes.

325
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:08,246
A new season and fresh hopes.
What I'm trying to say is...

326
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:11,325
- United we stand.
- United we stand.

327
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:16,357
- We are the champions...
- We are the champions. Come on, guys.

328
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:20,002
- More cushion for the pushing...
- More cushion forthe pushing.

329
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:24,242
- Damn you to hell.
- Celal, are you making fun of me?

330
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,279
No Ceren, ignore that last one.

331
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:30,679
Ceren, what I'm trying to say is,
will you go out to eat with me?

332
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,605
No. No!

333
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:37,965
Yes. Alright.

334
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:42,525
Okay, we'll grab a bite. I'll be
waiting at that place of ours.

335
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,764
Come by yourself. Okay?
Bye then. Bye.

336
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:49,596
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Boo!

337
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,639
What do you mean, boo?
Just go and don't look back.

338
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:56,362
You melted at the thought of
marriage and a ring, didn't you?

339
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:57,926
Don't you have any pride?

340
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:59,799
Oh! Freedom!

341
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:03,283
Celal, you were great.
You spelled it all out.

342
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:06,080
Free at last.
Everything's okay now.

343
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,039
Freestyler.

344
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,166
Hit and run.

345
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:14,601
Hit and run.

346
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:18,516
My dear Ceren, first of all, I wish to
welcome you.

347
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:23,042
As you know... I invited you here.

348
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,678
Wait for him to go.

349
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,399
Come on.

350
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,685
What are you doing?
Do you expect me to say something?

351
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:38,756
I'm pouring some water.
I'm almost done.

352
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,957
You poured water on our conversation.
Now get going.

353
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,806
- Sorry. Bon appetit.
- Get going.

354
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,238
Anyway, Ceren, let's start
where we left off.

355
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,962
Ceren, I want to say we've had
six wonderful years together.

356
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:53,679
We've come a long way.

357
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:57,083
Thanks to your self-sacrifice
and my self-denial...

358
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:00,557
...we've had some great
times together.

359
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:03,037
Through tears and laughter.

360
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:05,641
Until that dark day.

361
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,965
On that dark day, you made
me tell a lie. You pressured me.

362
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:10,803
- Me?
- Yes.

363
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:15,000
You threw me into the arms of
Olga and Helga and Svetlana.

364
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,687
- Celal.
- You helped release my inner being.

365
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,037
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You unleashed my subconscious.

366
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:23,876
And thanks to my idiotic friends
you accidentally found out what I did.

367
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:26,726
And you asked me for a reckoning.
I find that unacceptable.

368
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,485
- You made me lie...
- Me?

369
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:32,606
Yes. You made me, Ceren.
I'm calling your bluff...

370
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,807
...and flinging it in your face.
I'm leaving you.

371
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,758
I've left you. It's over.
It's over just like that.

372
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:39,366
Hold on a minute.
Are you breaking up with me?

373
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,921
- Yes, right now.
- You invited me here to break up?

374
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,885
Yes, I invited you here to break up.
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

375
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:48,443
- Off you go.
- Who the hell are you? You rat bastard.

376
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,082
Who do you think you are?
Who?

377
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:54,005
I can see how right I was.
You've turned all ugly.

378
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:55,560
- You're a pig.
- You're so revolting.

379
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,757
You ox! You're the one who's
reduced me to this.

380
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:00,082
- You're disgusting.
- You've done this to me!

381
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:03,199
- This is for you...
- Damn it.

382
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,400
- What's all this?
- You're disgusting. I'm spitting poison.

383
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:08,199
- Get rid of your poison somewhere else.
- God damn you.

384
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,760
- Stop spitting.
- It's a waste of spit.

385
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,360
- Get lost.
- God damn you.

386
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:14,047
- Stop cursing me here.
- God damn you to hell and back.

387
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,522
Go on, then. Curse me.
Do you think your curses will work?

388
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,677
If God loved you, would he have
created you like this. Stumpy.

389
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,081
- Stumpy?
- Yeah, stumpy. Go.

390
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,042
- Damn you, Celal.
- You have the stature of a dwarf. Now go!

391
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:23,878
- You're a worthless piece of shit.
- Leave a 20 for the tip.

392
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,078
- Damn you.
- Leave a 20!

393
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,646
Sorry.

394
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:32,999
If I'd proposed, there'd have been
screams of joy.

395
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:37,320
I break up with her, she screams
bloody murder. That's life.

396
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:45,437
What's going on? You've been
staring at us all night.

397
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:47,802
Look at him.
I did the right thing.

398
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:51,556
If he'd done the right thing he'd still
have all his teeth and hair on his head.

399
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:55,202
He's sitting there like a giant
shriveled up colon.

400
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:58,200
I you put him in a body bag nobody
would think anything of it.

401
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,646
You've finished him off for good.

402
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,075
And two, three, four.

403
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:04,399
I'm waiting on the island shoreline

404
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,844
Hey, hey hey.

405
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:16,640
Make me rejoice

406
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:21,196
I'm asking for your hand

407
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,479
Really, I'm so happy.
I feel at peace.

408
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:27,075
- And on the very first day.
- You feel lighter, don't you?

409
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,765
- You feel free and easy.
- Oh, you bet I do.

410
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:31,117
Now wejust need to find some fresh
meat and dip ourwicks.

411
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:33,556
- Count me in.
- The color's back in his face.

412
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:37,805
I swear, the color's back.
Just look at you.

413
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:40,926
Hey. Are they looking at us?

414
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:44,926
Of course they are. Do you see
any other alpha males here?

415
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:47,598
They're looking at us.

416
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:51,197
I got all rusty the last six years.
Look. First minute, first goal.

417
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,238
We're flirting with girls.
I don't believe it.

418
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:56,200
- Why wouldn't we? Are you crazy?
- Are they really looking at us?

419
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,557
- They are, but...
- I'll make contact.

420
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,247
Wait. They're pay to play.

421
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,882
- Pay to play?
- For hire. Mercenaries.

422
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:07,443
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's obvious, they're streetwalkers.

423
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,844
Saying something like that about
two Istanbul girls from good families.

424
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:15,683
You can see the purity of their
hearts and souls in their eyes.

425
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:19,760
Two innocent virtuous girls.

426
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:24,199
Stop smearing people. Enough of your
pigeonholing.

427
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,916
Pay to play?

428
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:34,639
Let's toast, my dark-haired darling.

429
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:37,400
Let's drink every night,
my dark-haired darling.

430
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:39,444
You know, I'm so happy right now.

431
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,001
Hanging out with a different
girl forthe first time in my life.

432
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:43,765
What's that? "Black Pepper"?

433
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:47,323
That's the one.
"Black Pepper" on my first day of freedom.

434
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,483
- Do you want the blonde orthe brunette?
- It doesn't matter.

435
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:53,603
- Tell me.
- The dark one's a bottle blonde anyway.

436
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:57,244
Guys, just so you know.
It's 500 euros a head.

437
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,363
Then screw till dawn.

438
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:02,047
I don't want any problems later.
You'll have to pay in advance.

439
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,637
- 500 euros for some tail.
- We'll keep them working till dawn.

440
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:09,356
- I don't have that much on me.
- Gentlemen, are you ready for some fun?

441
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:11,318
Since I didn't know yourtype...

442
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:13,677
...I prepared a mixed assortment
for us all to share.

443
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:15,957
- What?
- What have you done, Ayşegül?

444
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:19,238
Spell out "Narcotics"with them
and take a photo of us in front.

445
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:21,240
- Come on.
- I've never seen anything so disgraceful.

446
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:23,358
You're classy girls.
What are doing here?

447
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:26,206
I defended you in front of my friends.
You're putting me to shame.

448
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:29,160
Enjoy life, Celal.
You're all ours tonight.

449
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:31,078
I'm going to smack the one
who said, "enjoy life".

450
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:32,481
- Get rid of those.
- Celal.

451
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,365
We're not that kind of guy.
Take them away.

452
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,085
Please, take them away.

453
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,602
- A-ha!
- Police! Surrender!

454
00:25:39,727 --> 00:25:43,083
I don't believe it.
Not another raid?

455
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,556
Okay, hold on. Just a second.
Don't panic.

456
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:48,326
Someone complained about the noise.
I'll talk to the cop.

457
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:52,076
Commissioner, what do you mean,
drugs? We don't do drugs.

458
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:55,756
Send it to ballistics.
It's got nothing to do with me.

459
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,447
Why'd you go there then?
For hookers?

460
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,364
No. Let's not call it that.

461
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:03,439
Just some messing around.
We werejust hanging out.

462
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,159
You big lug!

463
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:06,806
Welcome, Dad.

464
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:09,839
I'll let you off this once.
Forthe sake of your father.

465
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,878
I better not see you here again
forsomething like this.

466
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:15,158
I understand, Commissioner.
I'll be back for otherthings.

467
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:16,999
Now if you'll excuse me.

468
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:18,924
Are you eating fruit, Celal?

469
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:21,761
Apples are good for you. You know?
Cherries are really good.

470
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:23,400
Cherries are good right up to the stem.

471
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:25,722
Don't drink any soda, son.
It's terrible for you.

472
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:27,599
Watch out for gene food.

473
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:31,083
They say everything modified
these days, Celal. It scares me.

474
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,926
We've been talking about this for
days, even at the baths.

475
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:38,159
We have to think about gene food
everywhere we go these days.

476
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:43,526
Celal, your relationship with Ceren
is the best thing you've done.

477
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,724
You're no good at work.
You don't have any skills.

478
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:50,358
You don't play any instruments... What
happened to that violin I got you?

479
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:52,239
You threw it out, didn't you?

480
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:54,841
You don't have any skills, son.
You run around like a scamp.

481
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:59,245
But you have Ceren. I'm thrilled that
girl will be a part of our family.

482
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,762
She's a sound, strong, no-nonsense girl.

483
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:04,441
She'll keep you in line.
She'll know how to run a household.

484
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:07,127
Mother, Ceren and I have split up.

485
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:09,442
Celal, I never really liked her anyway.

486
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,200
Insolence was written all over her face.

487
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:15,764
There was something rough about her.
Like a day laborer.

488
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:19,562
If you hadn't separated, I was
planning to break you up myself.

489
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:21,484
I could have done it, just like that.

490
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,882
Do you know what my grandmother
used to say?

491
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,402
Beware of girls whose asses
are close to the ground.

492
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,483
- Mother, please
- Okay, okay.

493
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,963
Forget about all that.
I'm here for you.

494
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:34,726
I'll find you a nice girl.
I've got someone in mind.

495
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,758
Mom. Mom.

496
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,764
I just came out of a six-year relationship.

497
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:40,684
I'm not ready for anyone new.

498
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,719
I want to be single
and run with the hit squad

499
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:46,487
I'm going to play the field.

500
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:49,041
What's a "hit squad"son?
I don't get it.

501
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,556
I mean, I want to be a young gun.
On my own, take aim and fire.

502
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:53,120
You should see her, son.

503
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:56,637
We had a women's day at the baths
last Sunday.

504
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:59,122
That's where I saw her.
Melahat's daughter.

505
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:02,444
Ah, Celal. You should have seen
the way she walked in.

506
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:05,885
That long, blonde hair.

507
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:08,840
That alabaster skin.
Aface radiant as the moon.

508
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,639
Can you imagine it, son.

509
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,327
The way she washed
herself at the basin.

510
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:16,678
If you saw those breasts.
If you saw those thighs.

511
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:19,765
Those legs. Slender as a spear.

512
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:24,244
That tiny mouth. Her lips
like a cherry.

513
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:27,838
Can I tell you something?
Girls with tiny mouths...

514
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,680
- Mother.
- ... are no big grumblers, son.

515
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:34,243
I adored her. She'sjust the girl
for my Celal, I said to myself.

516
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,198
I was swept away.

517
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,841
The perfect girl for you.
Don't miss out on her, Celal.

518
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,958
Okay, mother, I'll meet her.
Where is she?

519
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:44,523
She works at a pizzeria. Her name's Hande.
You can pick her up there.

520
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:47,764
- Hande?
- Hande. Such a lovely name.

521
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:50,242
- Alright, mom.
- Thank you, dear.

522
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:53,484
At last, Celal. My wishes have come true.
With God's blessings.

523
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:55,362
Alright.

524
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:03,244
Welcome.
How can I help you?

525
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,200
Excuse me?

526
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:09,560
- Hande?
- Pardon me? Who?

527
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:10,915
Hande?

528
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,442
No, I'm Merve. Hande's inside.
She'll be right out.

529
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,762
Hande, come quick.
Look who came.

530
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,726
Ah, Celal.

531
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:21,520
Hello. Pleased to meet you.

532
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:24,605
Your mother mentioned you.
She said you sought my hand.

533
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:27,687
I came to get two pizzas.
What are you up to?

534
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:31,316
- She can watch the register. Come on.
- They meet at the baths every week.

535
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:34,917
She told me about it and
I agreed to meet you.

536
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,403
- Bye-bye, sweetie. See you.
- Have fun.

537
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,325
Celal. Celal, wait for me.

538
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:44,123
Celal, why aren't you waiting?
Why are you acting like this?

539
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:49,796
Have you evertried it like this?
You fold it up like a wrap.

540
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,362
Then you eat it. Want some?

541
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:55,806
No. Finish eating and let's go.

542
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,123
Can I ask you something?

543
00:29:58,407 --> 00:29:59,681
No, you can't.

544
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:02,236
What's your favorite sex position?

545
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,717
Missionary or doggy style?

546
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:11,241
Didn't I say you couldn't ask me anything?
Why are you talking dirty?

547
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:12,840
What's wrong? Is it a turn-on?

548
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:16,442
I think everything should be talked
about openly in a relationship.

549
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,246
What relationship? What do you mean?
You're talking nonsense.

550
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:21,523
Eat your pizza and let's go.

551
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:25,004
- You're sweet.
- Thanks. Thanks.

552
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,715
Slow down.
You'll choke.

553
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:34,399
You'll choke. Go slow, lady.
Eat more slowly.

554
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:37,435
Get up.

555
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:41,246
Oh no!

556
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:45,760
She died right in front of me!
Come quick. She choked.

557
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,043
What should I do?

558
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:53,040
I know I should do mouth-to-mouth,
but I really don't feel like it.

559
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:57,920
- My man, my Celal.
- What are you doing?

560
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:02,200
No! What are you doing?

561
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,001
- My Celal.
- Good grief!

562
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:08,159
Get back! I swear I'll sock you
in thejaw!

563
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:12,160
- Masher! Masher!
- Sister, I didn't do anything.

564
00:31:12,527 --> 00:31:13,960
- What are you talking about?
- She's a young girl.

565
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:16,806
- Grab him!
- What are you doing?

566
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:19,078
You beast!

567
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,837
Kahraman! What's wrong, boy?

568
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,242
Something's wrong with Kahraman.
He passed out three times today.

569
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:32,325
Why didn't you tell me?

570
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:37,598
Look at this, his
stool is dark blue.

571
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:39,724
He usually craps dark blue
when he's sick.

572
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:42,884
And it's greenish-white when he's
Getting better.

573
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:45,123
We've got to take him in right away.

574
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:47,886
Get me a box or something.
Have you found something? My boy.

575
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:51,477
I'll take him in like this.
And get me some newspaper.

576
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:54,485
Don't forget to give him
the drops from the vet.

577
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,519
Yes?

578
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:58,882
Kahraman isn't feeling well.

579
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,601
- If you can heal him again...
- We will. What is it, a cat?

580
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:02,716
- No.
- A dog?

581
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:04,075
- No.
- What is it?

582
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:05,799
A crow.

583
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:09,362
Celal Manki?

584
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,921
That's me. Have we lost Kahraman?

585
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:14,845
No, he's fine. He's undergoing
a minor procedure.

586
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,596
- Don't worry, he'll be fine.
- Oh, thank God.

587
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:21,567
Aren't you Auntie Asuman's son,
Celal Manki?

588
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,798
- Yes.
- Do you remember me?

589
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:24,843
No.

590
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:27,083
We spent a few holidays
together at Aktur.

591
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:29,243
You had a broken leg the last time.
Do you remember?

592
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,800
A broken leg?

593
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:35,204
Yes, that's right.

594
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:36,555
- Selen.
- Selin.

595
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:37,881
- Selin.
- Selin.

596
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:39,804
- Selin. How's it going?
- Fine.

597
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:43,397
You haven't changed a bit.
You've grown a bit. You're curvier.

598
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:48,123
- You haven't changed at all.
- Thanks. I try to keep in shape.

599
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,203
- How are your parents doing?
- They're fine.

600
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:53,080
You know, my mom's getting on.
She's got varicose veins.

601
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,556
She wears support hose. Really tight.

602
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,599
She pulls them way up,
practically to her belly button.

603
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,605
She looks like an ice cream cone.

604
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:03,479
Spilling out of those hose.

605
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,837
Come here, I'm going to show you
something funny. Come to my office.

606
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:09,204
- Look who's here.
- Oh my God. Just look at that.

607
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:13,003
- Berkay and Kubi.
- And who's that?

608
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,999
- Timur.
- Ah.

609
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:17,681
Do your see your parents there?
And my aunt.

610
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:19,525
God your aunt's ugly.

611
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:22,241
- No, she's not. My mother...
- She's got a big mole on her cheek.

612
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:27,681
- Who's Ceren?
- Ceren? Who?

613
00:33:27,927 --> 00:33:31,476
This came out of your crow's stomach.
"Celal and Ceren" is written in it.

614
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,240
- Oh, that ring doesn't belong to me.
- What? Isn't your name Celal?

615
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:37,757
I'm Celal, but it's not mine. Even if it
was mine I don't know any Cerens.

616
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:42,039
I don't know anyone named Ceren.
Which means the ring isn't mine.

617
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:43,726
- Then whose is it?
- Your mother's.

618
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,519
- Pardon?
- Uh... my grandpa's.

619
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:48,241
It belongs to my grandpa.
It has great sentimental value.

620
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:51,359
- Then Ceren is your grandmother.
- What are you, a census worker?

621
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,443
Give me the ring and I'll go.
It's important to me.

622
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,444
Grandpa was a womanizer, I guess.
He handed out rings.

623
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,239
Mind your own business.

624
00:33:57,487 --> 00:34:00,524
Don't hire people like that.
It's bad forthe animals' psychology.

625
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:06,876
The girl I'm about to bring here...

626
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,442
...is going to be my wife one day.

627
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,603
I've fallen in love.
Head over heels.

628
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:15,561
Love at first sight. I saw her...
I was smitten.

629
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,679
I felt all chumed up, butterflies,
just like you said.

630
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,640
And you even know her.
You know her, just wait.

631
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:23,958
- We know each other?
- Get ready, I'm bringing her in.

632
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:26,483
Come on, dear. Keep them shut.
- I am.

633
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:27,881
I'm wondering what you'll do.

634
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:30,840
Come on, come on. Stand right there.
Don't open your eyes. Ready?

635
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,083
- I'm ready.
- Go on, open your eyes.

636
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:37,036
This is Selin. Selin from Aktur.
She's become a veterinarian.

637
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:40,239
She took care of Kahraman.
Made him well.

638
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,483
- How are you, Selin?
- Hello, Timur.

639
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:44,518
- Barış.
- How are you?

640
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:46,882
- How nice.
- It's been a while, hasn't it, Selin?

641
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:48,759
- What a coincidence.
- How are you, Kubi?

642
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,562
- Fine, I can't complain.
- Celal, I've got to get going.

643
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:56,325
I really must go.
I've got two operations tomorrow.

644
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,165
No, please sit down.
Have some chicken with us.

645
00:34:58,247 --> 00:35:00,715
- I've got to get to bed early.
- Oh, please.

646
00:35:00,847 --> 00:35:03,077
- I've got to get to bed early.
- Then I won't insist.

647
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:05,363
- Right? No insisting.
- See you later, guys.

648
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,955
Let me walk you out.
Come on, I'll walk you out.

649
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:12,359
We can sort this out with a modem,
and eight splitters.

650
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:17,204
I'll send it with Celal.
Bye. Thanks.

651
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:20,241
- Can I tell you something, Celal?
- Go on.

652
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:23,956
- You know Selin from yesterday?
- At the word "Selin" I get all funny.

653
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,601
I screwed her.

654
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:29,726
- Screwed her how?
- We screwed like bunnies.

655
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,042
Like bunnies?

656
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,556
You know the summer you
broke your leg. At Aktur...

657
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:38,198
...I took her up to the attic of
Perili Manor and screwed her.

658
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:44,683
What kind of guy are you?
Damn you to hell.

659
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:47,363
I had a broken leg that summer
and was laid up at home.

660
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:50,445
My poor mother invited you
to dinnerten times.

661
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,603
- None of you bothered to drop by.
- Yeah but we...

662
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:56,083
I know what you're here for.
Who'd take a girl to Perili Manor?

663
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,402
- Bye, Celal. See you.
- Bye.

664
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:02,483
- How's it going?
- Why'd you come slinking in like that?

665
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,082
- I've something to tell you.
- Go on.

666
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:08,637
- You remember Selin, who came yesterday.
- Yes, I remember her.

667
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:11,202
Hejust told me.
Barış did.

668
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:14,046
They did it.
I know.

669
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,876
He's lying.
Barış and Timur both came on to her.

670
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:20,840
She ignored them, of course.
I went to the machine room of the pool...

671
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:23,481
...and had my way with Selin.

672
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:27,557
- In the pool's machine room?
- Yes.

673
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,964
I was young. The blood was
pumping through my veins.

674
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:33,840
I was young too!
I was young.

675
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:37,438
I had a broken leg. I was a cripple.
And I was young too!

676
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:40,081
What kind of guy are you?
My poor mother...

677
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:43,524
...invited you to dinner all those nights
and you never came.

678
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:47,202
I ate all the beans and watermelon
all by myself.

679
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:50,365
Now I can see
what you were all after.

680
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:53,399
One of you took herto Perili Manor,
the other to the machine room.

681
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,722
Couldn't you find anywhere else?
What the hell is wrong with you?

682
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,884
- Anyway, I'm going.
- Go. Go.

683
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,965
I'll spell it right out.
You'd betterstay away from Selin.

684
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:07,957
That summer, over on the rocks,
we really got it on.

685
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:11,603
I'm going to lose it.
I'm going out of my mind.

686
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,601
If one more person comes in here
and says they screwed Selin...

687
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,884
...I swear I'll hang myself from the ceiling
with a piece of cable.

688
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:22,122
No, this can't be. You screwed her too?

689
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,956
What are you talking about? You asked me
to pack up Ceren's things.

690
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:27,725
What am I supposed to do with them?

691
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:29,924
Ah, what a relief.

692
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,686
I could handle the others,
but not you.

693
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,445
I couldn't have handled you.

694
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:36,882
Have it delivered express.
Send it off.

695
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,679
And let that be the end of it.
The end of that problem.

696
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:40,559
- Okay.
- Is that all?

697
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:43,720
Celal, get your equipment and tools.

698
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:47,044
You're going to Dila Hanım's villa in 
Tarabya. You're installing a network.

699
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,000
But Dad, I've got work here.
I'm about to ship some cable.

700
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,322
Do it quick.
Get yourstuff and go.

701
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:55,957
- Have that mutt come with me then.
- No. He's got some work to do with me.

702
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,726
You always send me to make house calls.

703
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:02,044
I do all the work.
That mutt just sits here.

704
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:06,645
You put "General Manager" on
your card, but just look at you.

705
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:18,523
Yes?

706
00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:21,519
I'm from Manki Cable Electronics.
You have an installation.

707
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:24,525
Ah, I was expecting you.
Come right in.

708
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,236
- Should I take them off?
- No. Come right in.

709
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,957
How long have you been
doing installations?

710
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:33,603
I've been doing it for 7 years.
I'm still new at it.

711
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:36,566
My boss was a real master.

712
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:40,475
He's actually my dad. Manki Cable.
My boss is my dad.

713
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:44,926
He can lay it like no one else.
At his side, watching him at work...

714
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:48,597
...holding the other end
if he needed it...

715
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,877
...I learned the tricks of the trade.
What I mean is...

716
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:54,716
...what I have is the youth my dad
doesn't, and the enthusiasm...

717
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:58,920
...agility, speed, can-do attitude
and dynamism that youth brings.

718
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,124
Just lay it down the best you can,
that's all I ask.

719
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:04,440
Right.

720
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:08,484
Let's get started.
Where exactly do you want it done?

721
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:11,121
Come along. I'll show you.

722
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,681
Come on.

723
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:15,720
God help me.

724
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,118
How's it going?
Is it getting any easier?

725
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:26,082
Yes it is, ma'am.
I stretch the cable from here...

726
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:29,244
...right towards this corner. Here...

727
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,119
...under the bed...

728
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,677
Ah! Ah!

729
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,723
- Ma'am, what are you doing?
- Lie down!

730
00:39:36,847 --> 00:39:38,405
- What are you doing, ma'am...?
- Lie down, I said! Lie down!

731
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:40,882
Alright, ma'am, I'm laying down.
Please calm down.

732
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:44,443
Sister, what have you done?
What kind of outfit is that?

733
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:46,478
Show me how you lay your cable.

734
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:49,519
I lay cable.
You misunderstood.

735
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:53,003
We can talk this over like
two civilized people.

736
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:56,324
Let's sit down and talk.
Oh! Oh!

737
00:39:56,447 --> 00:39:57,562
Scratch me.

738
00:39:57,647 --> 00:40:00,684
I have trouble doing it even
in normal conditions.

739
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:03,685
- How I am supposed to do it here?
- Say, my white ass.

740
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:06,082
- What? My white ass?
- Say, my white ass.

741
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:08,801
- My white ass! My white ass, okay.
- Say, meow.

742
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:11,760
Meow! Meow.
Meow. Enough already.

743
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,559
- Say, lay me.
- I'll lay you, sister.

744
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,643
Just put that down.
Let's talk it over...

745
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,758
...and someone will get laid.
Please put that down, sister.

746
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:21,726
- I've got a whip phobia.
- Okay. I'm putting it down but...

747
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:26,520
- ...I brought this.
- Damn. What the hell is that?

748
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:27,842
I'll blow you away.

749
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,798
No, sister. Not that.
I don't like that either.

750
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,282
Please.
Is that a blender?

751
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:33,840
Who has sex with a blender?

752
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:36,003
Okay. I'll put it down...

753
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:38,555
...but I'm putting this over your head.
- What is it with all the toys?

754
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,201
Damn you.
And I'm all tied up.

755
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:45,286
Please don't.
No. Take that filthy thing away.

756
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:49,204
Please! Who knows who wore it.

757
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:52,046
No, stop it.
Haven't you got a husband?

758
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,965
Goddamn woman!

759
00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:00,077
- Good day, ma'am. Ceren SarsıImaz?
- Yes, that's me.

760
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,516
- You've got a package.
- Who's it from? What package?

761
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:04,717
Let me see.
Celal Manki.

762
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:06,957
Damn him.
What's he sent me?

763
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:10,284
What could that bastard be sending me?
What's he sent after all that?

764
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:12,045
We're not authorized
to open packages.

765
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,920
But the word "bastard" implies
there's been a separation.

766
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:17,845
Old belongings tend to get sent.

767
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:20,481
- Good bye.
- He sent it COD.

768
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:22,598
That'll be 47.90.

769
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:26,606
He must have decided to screw
you one last time.

770
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:31,286
He sent it COD.
That dickhead.

771
00:41:31,727 --> 00:41:34,321
- What did he send?
- That loser. All my stuff.

772
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:35,880
- Here it is.
- The jerk.

773
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:38,726
Open it up.
What's in it?

774
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:41,925
Asweater.
Slippers. A hair clasp.

775
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,122
What's this?
What's this?!

776
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:49,400
This isn't mine. Why's he sending
other women's underwear?

777
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:51,199
Have I got underwear like this?

778
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:53,124
With butterflies, the idiot.

779
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:56,080
Is he trying to rub it in?

780
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:59,358
- Okay, calm down.
- Why should I?

781
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,723
- What are you doing, Kubi?
- What do you think?

782
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:05,601
- Did you sort it out, son?
- No, Dad. She didn't let me.

783
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:09,766
She wouldn't let me touch a thing,
and said she wanted my experienced dad.

784
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:12,117
- She said my dad should lay it.
- She's a good customer.

785
00:42:12,247 --> 00:42:15,159
- I'll go sort her out.
- Sure, she's a good customer.

786
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:17,801
And such a welcoming hostess...

787
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:22,045
...so eagerto serve and please.
Such a good person.

788
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,840
Would you believe it, she was all over
me? You really should go.

789
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:26,480
- Fine, I'll go...
- Go and screw...

790
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:29,081
- What?
- Go and screw the cables down.

791
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:32,563
- She's got this amazing entrée.
- Okay, I'll handle it.

792
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,283
- Did you send it?
- Yes.

793
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:41,286
There's a problem with the mother board.
The RAM's burned out.

794
00:42:41,407 --> 00:42:43,045
We need RAM money.

795
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:46,045
I see, RAM.
How does RAM bum out?

796
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:48,397
Did you sit on those
RAM's?

797
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:52,116
It came with 250 GBs.
I got you another 32 GBs.

798
00:42:52,247 --> 00:42:56,001
We salvaged 8 GB from Cemal's
old computer.

799
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:59,398
That's 290 GBs of RAM.

800
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:02,365
MIT doesn't even have that much RAM.

801
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:04,717
- I'll top you up at 300, but that's it.
- Okay.

802
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:09,279
What I feel right now is
something like disappointment.

803
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,846
I want him to suffer.
I want him to grovel like a dog.

804
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,037
We'll kill him and
play with his corpse.

805
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,759
So... What shall we do?

806
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:21,602
I've got an idea.
I'll torment him. The dog.

807
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:24,845
So, girls. Your problem is
attachment and tying the knot?

808
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,686
That's right, Müjgan.
A knot. Like a noose.

809
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,480
- Who's been wronged?
- Her.

810
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,756
Me.

811
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:34,641
- Have you got a photo of the dog?
- No. I tore them all up.

812
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,883
I've got one. I brought it
just in case.

813
00:43:37,007 --> 00:43:39,043
- Hand it over.
- Dog.

814
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:46,884
This ragdoll is him.

815
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:50,363
First a curse,
to dry up all his luck.

816
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:52,443
So he can't meet anyone new.

817
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:56,765
And it all goes wrong if he does.
- Amen, sister.

818
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:03,200
Do you know what I want?
Awhole lifetime with you...

819
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:06,200
...full of smiles and laughter.

820
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:11,163
First get that parsley out of yourteeth.
That's no way to talk to a lady!

821
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:14,882
Don't look at me like that.
Go rinse out your mouth.

822
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:17,282
Where you'd get that T-shirt?
It's nice.

823
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,921
What T-shirt?
You're looking at my boobs.

824
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:22,845
- No, I'm crazy about fabrics.
- Pervert. You're all the same.

825
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:25,162
You're all perverts.

826
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:29,679
Some like brunettes,
others like blondes.

827
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:32,926
I like them light-skinned,
like you.

828
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,402
Do you think you can say just anything
just because we're having a drink?

829
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:37,597
- What are you talking about?
- Are you looking at my boobs?

830
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:40,287
- No, I'm not.
- Are you looking at my boobs?

831
00:44:40,407 --> 00:44:41,556
Pervert!

832
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:45,601
The first thing I notice in a woman
is her eyebrows.

833
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:48,999
Yours are amazing,
like twin gliders.

834
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:51,516
What's that supposed to mean?

835
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:58,446
Did you just goose me?
Have you no shame?

836
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,125
What do you mean, goose?
My hands are up in the air.

837
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:01,566
Don't lie.
I felt it.

838
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:04,599
- He did it.
- No, you did. Pervert.

839
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:09,441
Are you all crazy,
you're all smacking me.

840
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,000
Can you let me get off?

841
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:14,722
We've dried up his luck.

842
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:17,566
Now we can come at him
from the other direction.

843
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:22,246
- What do you mean?
- We'll get other men to want him.

844
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,116
Have you got nine-inch cable, sir?

845
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:28,566
- What kind of cable?
- Athick nine-incher.

846
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:29,642
No.

847
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:32,645
- Have you got a 12-incher?
- No.

848
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:36,043
- Have you got a 15-inch cable?
- Here you go, sir.

849
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:39,718
What's up, fag?

850
00:45:40,327 --> 00:45:42,204
What's going on?

851
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:44,599
Hello. How are your oranges
today, Hasan?

852
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:48,037
Never mind my oranges, Celal.
Let me give you a peach.

853
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:49,760
A nice, smooth one at that.

854
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:52,765
Hasan, what are doing?
And at your age.

855
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:54,439
You should be ashamed of yourself.

856
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:58,201
What's that?

857
00:45:59,647 --> 00:46:00,966
- What are you doing?
- You give me goose bumps.

858
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:04,477
What are you doing? Go.
- Hey handsome, want to go get a tea?

859
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:08,043
- What are you talking about?
- Please? Just a cup of tea.

860
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:10,920
Get out of here. I don't want any tea.
Just get out!

861
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:14,039
You're sure you haven't got any cable?
Bye-bye.

862
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:17,559
Is there a protest somewhere?
They keep coming one afterthe other.

863
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,484
Is there a parade or a procession
orwhat?

864
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:21,643
Okay girls, we've done a lot.

865
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:24,281
Shall I curse his very being now?

866
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:28,605
- His very being?
- I mean his everything.

867
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:42,877
Uncle Murat, as you know, Ceren and I
were togetherforsix years.

868
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:44,959
And it just ended.

869
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,206
I expected to run around
sowing my oats.

870
00:46:49,447 --> 00:46:52,245
But there's nothing. Nada.

871
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:55,087
Like it's been cut off.

872
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:58,040
Sliced right off.
I can't believe it.

873
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:00,687
What used to be hard as a
hatchet handle...

874
00:47:01,007 --> 00:47:05,000
...is now like a dead fish.
A leaky balloon.

875
00:47:05,487 --> 00:47:09,480
I tried everything.
My friends all gave me advice.

876
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:12,919
I rubbed it with bleach.

877
00:47:13,687 --> 00:47:15,405
I soaked it in ketchup.

878
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:19,237
I stuck it in the vacuum cleaner
for 5 or 6 hours.

879
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:21,842
When it turned purple I took it out.

880
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:26,325
I shocked it with batteries.
One at the tip, one at the base.

881
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:29,123
Nothing. No signs of life.

882
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,318
Okay. I understand.

883
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:36,680
It's completely psychological.
Look at this.

884
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:43,921
Primitive man. The problem
goes all the way back to them.

885
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:47,960
He lives in a cave with his family.

886
00:47:48,887 --> 00:47:51,560
Here, he's going out to hunt.

887
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:56,678
He kills a deer and brings it home
to his woman in the cave.

888
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:59,800
They eat theirfill.

889
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:02,238
Then they hit the sack.

890
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:04,562
- Ah...
- You see...

891
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:08,366
Every man has a cave.

892
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:11,638
A place where they feel safe.

893
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:14,076
- Right.
- At the same time...

894
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:17,762
...they have a woman...

895
00:48:17,927 --> 00:48:20,043
...with whom they feel safe.
- They do.

896
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:23,716
You don't have a cave
or a woman.

897
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:27,483
That's your problem.
Do whatever you can...

898
00:48:27,927 --> 00:48:31,203
...to get one of those women
into your cave...

899
00:48:31,727 --> 00:48:36,198
...and make love to her. Only then
will your dead fish wriggle back to life.

900
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:37,920
I see.

901
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:41,438
Murat, I've only had
two women so far...

902
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:45,761
...and I just broke up with Ceren,
So she's out of the question right now.

903
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:48,277
I'll have to find my
first love, Sibel.

904
00:48:48,407 --> 00:48:51,080
If she's worthy of entering your cave...

905
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:53,039
...she'll do.
- She's worthy.

906
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:56,842
Now, I'm going to give you
a special syrup.

907
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:01,358
Take one capful one hour
before sexual relations.

908
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,445
Don't take too much.
It can cause loose bowels.

909
00:49:04,727 --> 00:49:08,402
- I take it orally, right?
- That's right. Just one capful.

910
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:11,360
Or you'll get loose bowels.
A single capful.

911
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:13,239
A capful.
What do you mean, "loose bowels"?

912
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,280
It's better known as "the runs".
- Okay, Murat.

913
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:20,155
This is very difficult for a man.

914
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:23,319
There's no need to be afraid.
Murat is always at yourside.

915
00:49:23,647 --> 00:49:26,639
Thanks. But there's one thing.
Don't tell anyone...

916
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:28,883
- I won't, son.
- Please, it's really tough.

917
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:32,556
I understand. Alright, Celal.
You can trust me.

918
00:49:37,927 --> 00:49:39,645
Okay. Here goes.

919
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:43,962
This will make it easier.

920
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:47,878
Why not take two more capfuls.
So it's certain to work.

921
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,405
Here we go.

922
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:07,123
You haven't changed at all.
Flesh firm as ever.

923
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,004
- Makes a nice smacking sound.
- Don't do that.

924
00:50:09,127 --> 00:50:11,357
- Don't.
- Don't.

925
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:13,559
Come on, let's do it.
- Do what?

926
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:15,200
- Let's get started.
- Started with what?

927
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:17,124
What do you think?

928
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,317
You're being naughty.
Don't, Celal!

929
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:22,120
I'm ticklish.
Please.

930
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:25,645
- Did you make that sound?
- I think so.

931
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:32,039
Is there a monster inside you?

932
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:34,601
You know my outside monster too.

933
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,957
You animal.

934
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:42,523
Celal, you might as well take a dump.

935
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:45,560
What kind of noise is that?
I've never heard anything like it.

936
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:47,365
I wonder if I caught a chill.

937
00:50:47,607 --> 00:50:50,246
Never mind. I'll fart my way
through sex if I have to.

938
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,517
Stop it, I said.

939
00:50:59,847 --> 00:51:02,042
- I feel awful.
- What should we do?

940
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:04,920
With this pain I can't hold it in.
It's going to come out.

941
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:07,641
- Don't you dare.
- It's going to run down my leg.

942
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:08,876
Don't.

943
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:11,039
- I'll run off to the toilet.
- Alright.

944
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:14,557
Don't touch me. It makes me
have to shit even more.

945
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:18,926
God! It's coming.
Oh no.

946
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:22,881
What's this? What's this?
Sibel! Sibel!

947
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,398
I forget to tell you.
I'm redoing my whole life...

948
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,398
...including a new bathroom.
- Where do you go to the toilet?

949
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:30,165
- My neighbor...
- Where do you shit?

950
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,120
My neighbor's, Auntie Türkan. Run.
That's where I go.

951
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:35,597
It's starting.

952
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:38,846
It's going to run.

953
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:45,281
Open up, lady!
Through the hall, Türkan!

954
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:49,603
Coming through!

955
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:00,439
What are you doing?

956
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:02,563
They say it goes away if you get scared.

957
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:05,281
That's hiccups!

958
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:08,844
How can the need to shit pass?
Do you think it disappears?

959
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:11,083
I shit myself!

960
00:52:11,887 --> 00:52:15,562
So much for caves and women
and my first woman.

961
00:52:15,687 --> 00:52:19,157
It smells like a sewer out here.

962
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:22,597
Pardon me, Auntie.
- Son, you're a grown man.

963
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:26,117
You should be ashamed of yourself.
And at this age?

964
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:28,761
When people get the urge they
go to the toilet...

965
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:31,760
...and do their business.
Come in and get cleaned up.

966
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:34,924
I'll give you my late husband's pants.

967
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:37,800
Get inside. Go on!

968
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:42,925
What are you doing running around
like a madman?

969
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:45,322
Sorry, I'm going through
a really rough period...

970
00:52:45,447 --> 00:52:47,165
...and I won't play clown for you.
Leave me alone.

971
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:48,686
I've got some bad news.

972
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:52,277
I'm already in the shit. Go on.
Tell me.

973
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:55,359
Ceren is going out with some guy
named Baturalp.

974
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:58,998
I'm serious. I saw it on Facebook.
They're posting on each other's walls.

975
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:01,726
Herstatus is "In a relationship".
- We're talking about Ceren here.

976
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:05,283
Would Ceren do something like that?
- Come see for yourself...

977
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:07,921
...and don't blame me. Come on.
- Are you kidding?

978
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:10,083
- Why would I kid you?
- Are you kidding?

979
00:53:10,207 --> 00:53:12,846
If this is a prank,
I'll be pissed off.

980
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:16,004
See. In a relationship.
That's her page.

981
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:18,403
Go back. With Baturalp.
Do you see that?

982
00:53:18,527 --> 00:53:22,202
So, Baturalp is screwing Ceren.

983
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,318
Watch your mouth!

984
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:26,278
She's still yoursister-in-law,
even if we broke up.

985
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:28,238
What do you mean "screwing"?
That's no way to talk.

986
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:30,835
I'll smash your head into the monitor.

987
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:33,435
He's taking herto dinner.

988
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:36,238
Taking her to dinner?

989
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:38,165
Now I really feel like shit.

990
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:40,243
Mood swings can do that.

991
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:42,921
Your body's full of adrenaline
right now.

992
00:53:43,047 --> 00:53:45,561
Going to dinner, huh, Baturalp?

993
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:47,763
Then Baturalp taking us to dinner too.

994
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:51,038
I'm not dropping this.
I'm going to that dinnertoo.

995
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:54,045
- Are you coming with me?
- You know I'm with you all the way.

996
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:56,317
I'd do anything for you.

997
00:53:56,447 --> 00:53:59,439
Let Baturalp compliment us
on our skirts too.

998
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,360
Let Baturalp buy us dinner too!

999
00:54:02,687 --> 00:54:05,042
- Are you coming?
- I'm coming!

1000
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,522
Come on, get up.

1001
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:12,122
It's such a nice place.
- Do you like it?

1002
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:14,841
- I love it.
- Allow me to say something.

1003
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:16,765
With you, it's even nicer.

1004
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:20,078
Thank you. That's very kind.

1005
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,197
Welcome, gentlemen.

1006
00:54:26,447 --> 00:54:28,085
We don't feel well at all.

1007
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:30,364
Not at all.

1008
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:34,076
What kind of lowlife are you?

1009
00:54:34,447 --> 00:54:36,119
What kind of lowlife?

1010
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,484
What kind of lowlife?

1011
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,879
Smarmy bastard!
What kind of lowlife?

1012
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,077
- Step outside.
- Outside.

1013
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:46,721
Step outside.

1014
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:48,844
I'll tum that blazer into a T-shirt.

1015
00:54:48,967 --> 00:54:51,845
I'll tum that blazer into a onesie.

1016
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:53,520
- Me?
- You, you.

1017
00:54:53,647 --> 00:54:55,126
Is there another smarmy bastard here?

1018
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:58,244
- Come outside!
- Any other half-ass aristocrat here?

1019
00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:02,321
He's ratting to the waiter.
He's trying to scare us.

1020
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:04,803
Those two hoodlums
are disturbing me.

1021
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,839
- I wonder if you could throw them out?
- Of course, Baturalp Bey. Immediately.

1022
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:10,516
Oh, we're so scared.

1023
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,395
Celal?

1024
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:16,196
Ceren, this isn't about you.
Tum back around.

1025
00:55:16,327 --> 00:55:19,399
- Celal, could you leave?
- Turn round, Ceren. It doesn't concern you.

1026
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:22,078
- Excuse me.
- Sir, is there a problem?

1027
00:55:22,207 --> 00:55:26,086
Sir, please behave yourself.
Baturalp is an important patron.

1028
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,324
I'll be forced to throw you out
if you go on like this.

1029
00:55:29,607 --> 00:55:32,041
Stop waving your arms around.

1030
00:55:32,327 --> 00:55:33,965
- Fine, sir. I apologize.
- Alright?

1031
00:55:34,087 --> 00:55:36,476
Our patronage isjust as important
as Baturalp Bey's.

1032
00:55:36,607 --> 00:55:39,519
So don't go poking your nose
into everything.

1033
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:42,957
Okay, brother? You're a fine fellow.
All dressed up.

1034
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:46,443
Now go get me some carapacheo.

1035
00:55:46,727 --> 00:55:48,080
Then we'll leave without making trouble.

1036
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:51,802
- Perhaps you meant carpaccio?
- Perhaps you meant carpaccio.

1037
00:55:51,887 --> 00:55:54,003
- Right, sir.
- Go on.

1038
00:55:56,047 --> 00:55:58,561
Hey! Salt shaker!

1039
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:01,806
Are you ratting to the waiter? Huh!

1040
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:05,516
I'll make a romantic drizzle.

1041
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:07,246
- Celal.
- I've got lots of spit.

1042
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:08,800
I can spit long range.

1043
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:11,999
- Don't worry about them.
- He's such a jerk.

1044
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:14,956
- Really...
- Look at them now.

1045
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:17,840
Kissing hands!
You think we're pimps, or what?

1046
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:19,685
- Sir, please.
- Hand kissing and all that.

1047
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:20,882
You'll have to leave.

1048
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,520
- Are we pimps?
- Celal?

1049
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:25,758
Kissing my girlfriend's hand
right in front of me.

1050
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:27,036
You think we're pimps?

1051
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,556
Let go of her.

1052
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:32,077
I apologize to everyone.

1053
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:34,965
It's a love thing.
Sorry about that.

1054
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,722
I couldn't sock him in thejaw,
So I'm still mad as hell.

1055
00:56:40,807 --> 00:56:43,162
Just drop it.
You scared him. Let's go.

1056
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:45,801
- Okay then
- I should have socked him one...

1057
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:48,322
...and then I'd feel better.
I'm not going anywhere right now.

1058
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:51,405
Don't be silly. The guy's scared.
Come on.

1059
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,283
That's the same guy, isn't it?

1060
00:56:57,887 --> 00:56:59,206
It looks like him.

1061
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:01,966
Good day, brother.
- Good day. Yes?

1062
00:57:02,247 --> 00:57:04,078
- Are you Felicio?
- Federico.

1063
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:06,358
- What?
- My name's Federico.

1064
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:09,207
- Are you going to play in there?
- Yes.

1065
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:13,321
Get another poster made.
Some naked leg is showing.

1066
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,365
And pull up your socks.

1067
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:18,997
There's something I want to ask you.
Something I've got to sort out.

1068
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:21,243
Let's take a little walk.
I've got something to ask you.

1069
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:23,927
How do you manage this
music business?

1070
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,165
Well, first I rehearse with my friends.

1071
00:57:27,287 --> 00:57:28,402
- We look for the right sound.
- Right.

1072
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:34,203
Ceren, where'd you find a jerk
like that?

1073
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:37,406
I'd never expect that of you.
Really.

1074
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,763
I don't know whether to take
your going to dinnerwith me as...

1075
00:57:40,927 --> 00:57:43,282
...an insult or a compliment.
None of it makes sense to me.

1076
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:45,875
I'm sorry, but that's that.
He's a real jerk.

1077
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,998
That's enough. Please stop.

1078
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:49,680
Whatever.

1079
00:57:50,047 --> 00:57:55,201
I'm not going to waste this dinner
talking about a useless jerk.

1080
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:59,085
- To your beauty.
- Thank you.

1081
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:10,006
Good evening, Istanbul.

1082
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,400
I'm Federico Valerio
Delvez de Garcia de Valerio.

1083
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:15,763
This is a great group.

1084
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,640
- I have no mother and no father.
- Especially the soloist.

1085
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:20,126
Federico Flemenco.

1086
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,523
I came into this world alone,
in a favela in Barcelona.

1087
00:58:23,887 --> 00:58:27,163
Neglected by God and the angels.

1088
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:31,759
Within him burns the...

1089
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:40,126
...undying flame of the Mediterranean.

1090
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:45,595
Middle-aged women know it well.

1091
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:49,197
Okay, men, don't get angry.

1092
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:52,285
Middle-aged men know it well too,
I might add.

1093
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:57,002
I will begin the night by
greeting you and mingling.

1094
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:59,806
Off we go.

1095
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:12,559
Hello, blonde lady.

1096
00:59:35,647 --> 00:59:37,763
Welcome, Baturalp Bey.

1097
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:42,000
How are you, sir?
Do you recognize me, bastard?

1098
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:49,686
- Celal, what are you doing?
- Here, take this wig.

1099
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,555
And the mustache.
It'll make you look a little like a man.

1100
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:55,242
I'll see you later.

1101
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:59,401
Good evening. Enjoy your dinner.
Let me get that.

1102
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:10,036
Come here. Come here.

1103
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:12,046
What are you doing here?

1104
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:13,964
I wanted to talk to you about yesterday.

1105
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:16,362
Talk about what? Get up.
The customers will see you.

1106
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,796
- I'll get fired.
- I'm not getting up.

1107
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:20,246
Did you kiss that guy, or not?

1108
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,925
- What's it to you?
- Tell me, Ceren.

1109
01:00:22,047 --> 01:00:23,799
Tell me, or I'll take a dump right here.

1110
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:27,158
I'll drop my trousers and squeeze
one out right here.

1111
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:28,646
- Really?
- I'll stink the place up.

1112
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:32,646
You're disgusting. I make a living here.
Get out of here, you idiot.

1113
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:34,962
Did you kiss him or not?
- What's it to you?

1114
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:36,844
- Did you kiss that guy?
- What's it to you?

1115
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:39,395
I don't have to answer to you.
You have no place in my life.

1116
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:42,997
What do you mean "no place"?
Did you kiss that dickhead or not?

1117
01:00:43,527 --> 01:00:45,358
- We didn't kiss.
- Tell me the truth.

1118
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:47,284
You're lying so I don't get mad.
Tell me the truth.

1119
01:00:47,407 --> 01:00:50,365
We kissed. We kissed like crazy.
Okay?

1120
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:52,682
We kissed for hours.

1121
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:56,403
- Happy now? Okay?
- You're lying, Ceren.

1122
01:00:56,927 --> 01:00:59,316
How could you kiss him?

1123
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,007
How could you do that?

1124
01:01:02,127 --> 01:01:05,756
You're killing me here.
I kissed him, she says.

1125
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:09,756
She says they kissed.
Damn it, they kissed.

1126
01:01:10,007 --> 01:01:12,157
Look at him. He's going nuts.

1127
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:14,164
How could you have kissed?

1128
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:16,323
- What's that idiot doing?
- He's gone crazy.

1129
01:01:17,247 --> 01:01:21,001
How could you kiss him?
How could you?

1130
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:26,915
You should be ashamed.
Shame on you.

1131
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:32,605
- Did you really kiss him?
- No. We didn't kiss.

1132
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:35,155
I lied to drive him crazy.
He's really taking it hard.

1133
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:37,243
- He's going crazy.
- Crazy isn't the half of it.

1134
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:40,279
- He's gone on a rampage.
- He's running around like an ox.

1135
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:41,760
Watch your mouth.

1136
01:01:46,447 --> 01:01:49,678
She says they kissed.
Damn the lips that kissed his.

1137
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:52,196
You're so cruel.

1138
01:01:58,607 --> 01:02:01,440
That idiot Kubilay
drank it all.

1139
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:04,559
Right when I need it most!

1140
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:13,276
My heartache won't heal.
This won't be enough.

1141
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:16,524
It's not enough.
I need something stronger.

1142
01:02:16,807 --> 01:02:19,037
Like. Like...

1143
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:22,239
Like cologne. Ceren brand cologne.
Damn it.

1144
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:25,200
This cologne's called Ceren.
80 proof.

1145
01:02:25,527 --> 01:02:28,439
Are you up for 80 proof?
I am.

1146
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:31,122
I sure am!

1147
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,403
Did we blow a fuse?

1148
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:08,401
Is there a blown fuse?

1149
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,966
Is it dark in here?

1150
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:16,520
Is it dark?
Is there a blackout?

1151
01:03:19,887 --> 01:03:23,516
Who's authorized to order
a blackout?

1152
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:25,445
Musa?

1153
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:29,317
I'm stuck here.
Musa.

1154
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:32,764
Could you take a look?

1155
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:40,922
Why are the lights out?

1156
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:43,607
It's pitch black. Musa?

1157
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,362
Can anyone hear me?

1158
01:03:46,647 --> 01:03:48,877
Where are the stairs?

1159
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:11,842
The lights are on. Now they're off.

1160
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,881
They're on. Off.

1161
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:18,001
On. Now they're off.

1162
01:04:18,407 --> 01:04:20,523
Sir, how's your arm?
Is the cast itchy?

1163
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,279
Thank you, how are you?

1164
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:25,126
Fine, sir. What about your arm?
How's your cast?

1165
01:04:25,247 --> 01:04:27,886
- What cast?
- On your arm.

1166
01:04:32,407 --> 01:04:33,635
Why'd you put a cast on my arm?

1167
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:36,759
There's a fracture in your elbow.
And you dislocated yourshoulder.

1168
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:39,436
I wish you a speedy recovery.

1169
01:04:39,807 --> 01:04:43,720
Speedy... look.
Cologne changes everything.

1170
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,166
Everything gets mixed up.
I'm looking at you right now.

1171
01:04:48,447 --> 01:04:51,120
One of your eyes is over there,
and one's over there.

1172
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:54,000
One's crooked
and the other's slanted.

1173
01:04:55,847 --> 01:04:58,315
Your teeth are pointy.

1174
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,435
And your ears are droopy.

1175
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:09,205
You're such an ugly girl.

1176
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:12,959
You look like Yoda. Yoda.

1177
01:05:13,287 --> 01:05:16,597
From Star Wars.
That's how I see you...

1178
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:21,355
But this eye...

1179
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:24,196
...sees everything blurry.
And this one is clear.

1180
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:27,081
I can see with my right eye,
but it's blurry with my left one.

1181
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:29,557
Because you drank calogne
and nearly blinded yourself.

1182
01:05:29,687 --> 01:05:31,166
Not calogne,
cologne.

1183
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:34,081
You drank cologne
and nearly went blind.

1184
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:37,279
True. But those who drove me
to drink should be ashamed.

1185
01:05:37,407 --> 01:05:40,285
She kisses some guy and then
tells me about it.

1186
01:05:40,407 --> 01:05:44,116
How can I bear it?
What do you think I am?

1187
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:46,325
Let's go.
Are we done here?

1188
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:48,881
No, sir. Not yet.
You fell down the stairs.

1189
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:51,276
- You hit your head.
- I'm not insured.

1190
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,637
- You're under observation tonight.
- I'm not insured, I can't stay...

1191
01:05:53,727 --> 01:05:56,161
You have to stay because you're
under observation.

1192
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:57,760
Okay.

1193
01:05:58,327 --> 01:05:59,806
Okay, you can go.

1194
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:04,005
Get well, buddy.
Is your heart broken?

1195
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,278
Yes. I'm heartbroken.
I drank cologne.

1196
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:10,319
I fell down the stairs.

1197
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:12,802
I have a cracked elbow
and a dislocated shoulder.

1198
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,760
I know that pain, brother,
that terrible pain.

1199
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:19,044
Is that "smelly" tattooed on our arm?
- What do you mean, smelly?

1200
01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:21,597
It says, Shelley.
My old girlfriend.

1201
01:06:21,887 --> 01:06:24,685
Shelley wasn't my first love,
but she was my last.

1202
01:06:25,007 --> 01:06:28,443
My love for her is seared in my heart,
and carved onto my body.

1203
01:06:28,847 --> 01:06:30,963
Only Shelley
can judge me.

1204
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:33,203
Great. That's wonderful.

1205
01:06:33,527 --> 01:06:35,961
Congratulations. Kubi?

1206
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:40,484
I'm starving, Kubi.

1207
01:06:40,607 --> 01:06:43,246
And my mouth's dry. Can you
get something from the canteen.

1208
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:44,561
Sure.

1209
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:47,526
See what I did?

1210
01:06:47,647 --> 01:06:49,319
Fake out.

1211
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:52,797
I'm getting a tattoo, too.
I'm going to write "Ceren" across my heart.

1212
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:09,196
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

1213
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:13,881
Take my coat, would you.
Brother.

1214
01:07:14,127 --> 01:07:17,199
I want to carve the name of
the woman I love across my heart.

1215
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:19,039
- I'll take care of it.
- Right over my heart.

1216
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,239
- Consider it done.
- I'm going to prove my love forever.

1217
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:24,961
I'll take care of it.
She'll love it.

1218
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:28,717
Ma'am, did a guy with an arm
like this pass this way?

1219
01:07:28,807 --> 01:07:30,160
Yes. He went that way.

1220
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:32,198
- Where?
- That way.

1221
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:34,523
Quiet. The phone's ringing.

1222
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:36,797
Write what you want here.
Make sure there's no mistake.

1223
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,122
- I'll get everything ready.
- Okay. Thanks.

1224
01:07:39,407 --> 01:07:42,160
Where are you? I'm waiting for you,
sandwich in hand.

1225
01:07:42,247 --> 01:07:44,807
I went for a walk. Awalk.

1226
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:46,964
You've all screwed me over
and I'm taking a walk.

1227
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:50,323
- Where did you go?
- What's it to you?

1228
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:53,923
I need to tell you something.
I saw you as a brother...

1229
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:56,396
...a real brother.

1230
01:07:56,527 --> 01:07:58,836
But you're not my brother.

1231
01:07:58,967 --> 01:08:02,084
You're a prick.
- Where are you?

1232
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:05,404
You ran off with a broken arm!
Where'd you go?

1233
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:09,600
You know what you are,
I'm writing it down...

1234
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:13,961
...you're a big asshole. Assholes.
I'm writing it down.

1235
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:16,119
Asshole. Assholes!

1236
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:18,363
I'm underlining it.
Ass.

1237
01:08:18,487 --> 01:08:21,559
I'm underlining it again
so you get the message.

1238
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:24,360
Give me your coordinates
so I can find you.

1239
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,325
Where am I?
Just a second.

1240
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,678
Tell me what you can see.

1241
01:08:29,807 --> 01:08:32,196
There's a window. Awindow.

1242
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:34,716
- What kind of window?
- Awindow and lights.

1243
01:08:34,847 --> 01:08:37,361
- Tell me what you see through the glass.
- There's a man here.

1244
01:08:37,487 --> 01:08:40,285
Are you thinking straight? Never mind
the lights. Tell me about the street.

1245
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:44,400
Hang up. I've had enough of you.

1246
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,086
- Put it right here.
- Are you ready?

1247
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:49,277
- I'm ready. Right here.
- Where should I put it? Show me again.

1248
01:08:49,407 --> 01:08:51,398
- Right here.
- You have to take this off.

1249
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,836
I can't. I have a broken arm.
Idiot.

1250
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,958
- Then we'll cut the T-shirt.
- Cut it here.

1251
01:08:56,087 --> 01:08:57,600
- Here we go.
- Cut it here, right here.

1252
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,525
Calm down. Relax.
I'll sort it out.

1253
01:09:00,647 --> 01:09:02,126
- Cut it straight.
- I'll manage, don't worry.

1254
01:09:02,407 --> 01:09:03,726
Straight. Overto here.
- Calm down.

1255
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,685
Over to here.
That's enough.

1256
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:09,163
Calm down.

1257
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:13,000
- Put it right here.
- We'll do a no. 10.

1258
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:17,198
- Are you ready?
- I'm excited. It's my first time.

1259
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:19,125
I'm uncovering it.

1260
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:28,002
What does it say?
- Whatever you wrote down.

1261
01:09:28,727 --> 01:09:31,241
- Does it say "ass"?
- You wrote "ass".

1262
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:34,561
Who'd write "ass" on their chest?
Are you an idiot?

1263
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:37,406
Has anyone ever asked you
to tattoo "ass" across their heart?

1264
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:39,563
You wrote "ass" on that
piece of paper.

1265
01:09:39,687 --> 01:09:42,804
- I did what you wanted.
- So you just tattooed what I wrote?

1266
01:09:42,927 --> 01:09:44,519
Yeah. That's what you wanted.

1267
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:46,763
- I should have written your mother's name.
- Leave my mother out of this.

1268
01:09:46,887 --> 01:09:48,684
- I wish I'd written her name.
- Leave her out of this.

1269
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:52,163
If wrote a phone number would you
have written that? Like a fast foodjoint?

1270
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:54,437
- That's enough. Get out of my shop.
- Oh really?

1271
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:56,762
You write "ass" on my chest,
then tell me to get out.

1272
01:09:56,887 --> 01:09:59,685
You wanted it. Get out.
- And you call yourself an artist.

1273
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:01,479
- Get out of my shop.
- You have hair like a sheep.

1274
01:10:01,607 --> 01:10:04,280
I'll rip your denim shirt off.
Yourfaggoty denim shirt.

1275
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:05,760
- Don't touch me.
- Act like a man!

1276
01:10:05,887 --> 01:10:07,445
- Don't touch me.
- Act like a man.

1277
01:10:07,567 --> 01:10:09,046
I have a broken arm!

1278
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:10,958
- Get out of my shop.
- I'll show you!

1279
01:10:11,047 --> 01:10:13,720
Stop it!

1280
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:21,000
Just look at my face.
Damn you.

1281
01:10:21,127 --> 01:10:23,436
Can't you think for yourself? Has anyone
ever wanted an "ass" tattoo before?

1282
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:25,836
I just don't think about it.
Drop it already.

1283
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:29,320
Enough! You gave me a headache.

1284
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:32,280
I swear I'm going to flip out.
Who do you think you are?

1285
01:10:32,407 --> 01:10:34,716
I'll break your other arm.

1286
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:35,922
Hi.

1287
01:10:36,007 --> 01:10:38,646
She found somejerk.
They were flirting.

1288
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:42,157
Like she was rubbing it in.
And she said they kissed. How could she?

1289
01:10:42,287 --> 01:10:44,755
It's terrible what she's done.

1290
01:10:45,047 --> 01:10:47,925
Metin, don't take this the wrong way,
but you really need a shave.

1291
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,765
You can't run around with stubble.

1292
01:10:49,887 --> 01:10:52,196
Have some respect for your art.

1293
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:55,717
Celal Mankie, you can go.

1294
01:10:55,847 --> 01:10:57,883
See you later.
Let me leave you this.

1295
01:10:58,127 --> 01:11:00,482
Take care of yourself.
Nice to see you all.

1296
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,165
Thanks. See you.

1297
01:11:02,487 --> 01:11:04,842
Just look at me.
I've disgraced myself.

1298
01:11:04,967 --> 01:11:08,437
I broke my heart and my arm.
And all because of you.

1299
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:11,122
We gave you some advice.
You broke up with her on your own.

1300
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:13,807
- You tossed away your ring.
- What do you mean?

1301
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:15,360
Didn't you cheer me on?

1302
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:18,206
Leave her. Leave her. What was all
that about six years?

1303
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:21,199
What about Czechoslovakia
and the Huns?

1304
01:11:21,327 --> 01:11:23,363
- So now it's ourfault?
- Of course it's yourfault.

1305
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:26,763
Didn't you say the Huns had a queen?
You made all those comparisons.

1306
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:29,202
- Fine.
- You ruined my life.

1307
01:11:29,727 --> 01:11:32,719
I've been cursed ever since
I broke up with Ceren.

1308
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:36,602
Look at me. Now I understand.
I know I can't live without her.

1309
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:40,243
Who else would put up with me?
Who would put up with me?

1310
01:11:40,407 --> 01:11:42,716
- Who'd put up with me?
- So you've wised up now.

1311
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,997
Then you'll have to do something
to win her back.

1312
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:46,918
I will. I'll win her back.

1313
01:11:47,007 --> 01:11:49,726
I left her, and I lost her.
And now I'll win her back.

1314
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,236
Then show her how much you love her.

1315
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:55,518
- That you won't make the same mistakes...
- Don't give me advice.

1316
01:11:56,887 --> 01:11:58,400
Ceren! Ceren!

1317
01:11:58,807 --> 01:12:02,436
See? I "heart" love you.

1318
01:12:02,647 --> 01:12:04,603
But the "U" is behind the bush.

1319
01:12:04,727 --> 01:12:06,797
Get lost. They'll all talk about me.

1320
01:12:06,927 --> 01:12:10,203
I'm so sorry. Come down here
and let me kiss you.

1321
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,636
Go away. Stop it.
This is getting embarrassing.

1322
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:15,804
I'm shouting it out.
Allah!

1323
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,357
I'm in love with you!
Ceren, my love!

1324
01:12:18,487 --> 01:12:20,523
Have you no shame?
Don't you have somewhere to go?

1325
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:22,040
I called the police.
They're on the way.

1326
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:25,125
Show some respect for love.
Ceren, please?

1327
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:28,285
He ran that way!
A paint and run.

1328
01:12:28,607 --> 01:12:29,642
Stop! Don't try to run away.

1329
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:32,076
What were you thinking,
painting like that?

1330
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:35,479
- You need to be more gentle.
- Gentle?

1331
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:37,885
- Ah. Champagne.
- Champagne?

1332
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:44,840
Surprise!

1333
01:12:46,247 --> 01:12:49,045
- What are you doing? Asshole!
- Gözde!

1334
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:51,886
- Damn you.
- What happened? Did he hit you?

1335
01:12:52,007 --> 01:12:54,396
Why are you doing this, Celal?

1336
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,119
Why do you hurt everyone?

1337
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,317
Why are you always trouble?

1338
01:12:58,447 --> 01:13:00,403
I spent a fortune. Getting you
champagne was wrong too.

1339
01:13:00,527 --> 01:13:01,516
Idiot.

1340
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,599
We need to think of something
more original.

1341
01:13:06,687 --> 01:13:09,565
Something that's visually stunning.

1342
01:13:09,687 --> 01:13:11,757
A Russian choir
Something visible from space.

1343
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,606
Acrobats, singers and dancers.

1344
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:17,878
Something with all the surrounding
buildings. An explosion of energy.

1345
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,679
We need something more showy.

1346
01:13:19,807 --> 01:13:20,922
- Lasers.
- Lasers?

1347
01:13:21,047 --> 01:13:24,642
- Lasers. It's a lady thing.
- Right, for epilation.

1348
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:26,684
Women and lasers go together.

1349
01:13:26,807 --> 01:13:29,685
Dearfriends, welcome to
the event this evening.

1350
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:31,280
Come on, it's ready.
- Come on.

1351
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,558
First, I hope your enjoy your meal.

1352
01:13:34,687 --> 01:13:39,841
I'm here to cry out my love for Ceren.

1353
01:13:40,247 --> 01:13:42,203
Yes, the laser show is beginning.

1354
01:13:42,327 --> 01:13:45,205
Look at the supervisor.

1355
01:13:45,527 --> 01:13:49,600
First comes the fireworks.
Light it.

1356
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:51,046
Light it, light it.

1357
01:13:51,407 --> 01:13:53,682
- Celal, don't.
- Ceren, I love you. Three!

1358
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:56,407
Two! One!

1359
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:03,321
It must be the wind.
Why aren't they exploding?

1360
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:05,244
Keep sailing, Captain.

1361
01:14:05,727 --> 01:14:07,922
Good God!

1362
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:11,726
We'll be back with you soon.
Enjoy your dinner.

1363
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,805
Go back to your appetizers.
That's it.

1364
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:22,520
Good moming. You're beautiful today.
Is Ceren here?

1365
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:23,683
Ugh, Celal.

1366
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:26,037
Just a sec. Don't close that.
Don't make me do something.

1367
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:27,282
- Go get Ceren.
- Ceren's not here.

1368
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:28,846
- Where's Ceren?
- She's on vacation.

1369
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:30,844
- On vacation?
- They went to Bodrum.

1370
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,003
"They?" With her mother?
- Nope.

1371
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,042
- With herfather?
- Nope.

1372
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:35,885
- With who then?
- With Baturalp.

1373
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:38,356
- With Baturalp?
- They're on their way to the airport.

1374
01:14:38,487 --> 01:14:40,876
- You can catch up if you run.
- Which airport?

1375
01:14:41,007 --> 01:14:42,759
Sabiha Gökçen, 4:40.

1376
01:14:42,887 --> 01:14:45,879
Damn it.
What the hell are you doing?

1377
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:48,761
What are you doing?

1378
01:15:05,127 --> 01:15:06,685
What do you think you're doing?

1379
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:09,844
Was this your motorbike?
I have to get to the airport.

1380
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:11,400
They're taking away my girlfriend.
I'll bring it back.

1381
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,365
Whose bike are you taking?
Who said you could have it?

1382
01:15:14,487 --> 01:15:17,320
Whose bike are you stealing?
- I'm not stealing anyone's bike.

1383
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:20,120
- I'll bring it back.
- Who said you could? You're stealing.

1384
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:23,040
Why would I steal it? I'll bring it back.
Why'd I steal your crappy bike?

1385
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:24,839
- I'll bring it back.
- What do you mean?

1386
01:15:24,927 --> 01:15:27,395
It's stealing. Who do you think you are?

1387
01:15:27,527 --> 01:15:29,404
You're a jerk-off.
Get off that bike.

1388
01:15:29,527 --> 01:15:30,755
- Why are you cursing?
- Because I'm cursing.

1389
01:15:30,887 --> 01:15:34,118
- Try to understand.
- Understand what? You thief.

1390
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:38,565
- What are you doing?
- Get off that.

1391
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:40,518
- Who head-butts with a helmet?
- Get off.

1392
01:15:40,647 --> 01:15:43,115
- Off what? Off what?
- Get off it.

1393
01:15:43,207 --> 01:15:45,084
Take your motorbike then!
Get lost.

1394
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,926
- Get out of my face.
- All this over a bike.

1395
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:49,759
- Get out of here.
- Jerk-off.

1396
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,037
- Stop showing off.
- Screw you.

1397
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,599
Hi, ma'am.
4:40, Istanbul-Bodrum.

1398
01:16:09,887 --> 01:16:12,082
I can't stand the sight of blood.

1399
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,043
You could have told me
before you fainted.

1400
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,442
You could have said something.
Who's in charge here?

1401
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:20,117
Nuray Hanım, could you please come over?

1402
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:22,317
I'm sorry, sir.
How can I help you?

1403
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:25,405
What is it, sir?
I need to make the 4:40 Bodrum flight.

1404
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:29,361
We don't have a flight like that.
You could take the 9:00 to Antalya.

1405
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:31,200
Why would I fly to Antalya?

1406
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,239
I said Bodrum. Why would I fly to Antalya?

1407
01:16:33,367 --> 01:16:36,006
4:40 Bodrum, check it please.
- Nothing, sir.

1408
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:37,686
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1409
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,282
Then check the computer.
- I'll check, sir.

1410
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:42,762
- What do you want me to check?
- 4:40, Bodrum.

1411
01:16:42,887 --> 01:16:44,366
There's no flight scheduled today.

1412
01:16:44,487 --> 01:16:47,718
- My friends are taking it.
- There must have been a misunderstanding.

1413
01:16:47,887 --> 01:16:50,037
You can't do this to me!

1414
01:16:51,847 --> 01:16:53,758
Try to calm down.

1415
01:16:57,087 --> 01:16:59,203
- Hello, Celal?
- Hello, Gözde?

1416
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:02,046
I'm at at the airport.
They say there's no such flight.

1417
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:04,806
I brought flowers.

1418
01:17:06,127 --> 01:17:09,244
- Why are you laughing?
- Of course there's no flight.

1419
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:12,165
Do you think this is a
romantic comedy?

1420
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:14,967
Where the pilot stops everything
and lets a passenger off?

1421
01:17:15,087 --> 01:17:16,998
And you run toward each other
in slow motion?

1422
01:17:17,127 --> 01:17:19,482
And sweating bullets, you're reunited with
your Ceren, you moron?

1423
01:17:19,607 --> 01:17:22,838
You idiot.
Get me some perfume from duty-free.

1424
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:25,083
Say hi to the pilot.
I kiss your double chin.

1425
01:17:25,327 --> 01:17:29,400
You're in for it now...

1426
01:17:29,847 --> 01:17:32,486
I'm going to bust your nose.

1427
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:38,602
Who'd do a thing like that?
I'll sock you in thejaw and...

1428
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,401
...snap that skinny body in two...

1429
01:17:41,967 --> 01:17:46,438
- You're horrible.
- That's the way to show him.

1430
01:17:56,647 --> 01:17:59,445
Why do I have to talk to her?

1431
01:17:59,647 --> 01:18:01,205
Look, they're coming out.

1432
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,918
There she is. She's coming out!

1433
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:07,197
Ceren!
- Ah, Kubi?

1434
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:08,966
Gözde, go ahead. I'll come.

1435
01:18:09,327 --> 01:18:11,921
Ceren, hi. I like to get to the point.
You know that

1436
01:18:12,047 --> 01:18:14,845
- What's wrong, Kubilay?
- He's in terrible shape.

1437
01:18:14,967 --> 01:18:17,845
Worse than you can imagine.
His life is ruined.

1438
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,839
We've been friends since childhood.
I can't just leave him like this.

1439
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:24,282
But he's an idiot.
What can you do?

1440
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:28,606
Look, Kubi. He's using you too.
Keep out of this.

1441
01:18:28,807 --> 01:18:31,196
It's not like that.
I'm here because I want to be.

1442
01:18:31,487 --> 01:18:34,923
If ourfriendship means anything
to you at all...

1443
01:18:35,047 --> 01:18:37,038
...please, meet with him
for five minutes.

1444
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:39,840
Not outside. You never know
what he'll do.

1445
01:18:39,967 --> 01:18:43,323
We'll go eat, all together.
You can talk everything over.

1446
01:18:44,207 --> 01:18:47,483
Oh, Kubi. I really don't know.

1447
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:50,122
Let me think it over.
Okay?

1448
01:18:50,407 --> 01:18:52,284
- Bye.
- Bye.

1449
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,125
Bon appétit, Ceren.

1450
01:18:57,407 --> 01:19:00,922
It's interesting. Rice and anchovies
have an aphrodisiacal effect on me.

1451
01:19:01,047 --> 01:19:05,199
All my suppressed sexual urges
come out.

1452
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,126
Isn't it true?

1453
01:19:07,447 --> 01:19:10,325
- Who made it?
- I did. I hope you enjoy it.

1454
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:13,245
Ceren's a good cook too.
Aren't you, Ceren?

1455
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:18,919
How is it that everything a man could
want can be found in one woman?

1456
01:19:19,247 --> 01:19:22,205
How could her genetic map
be so perfect?

1457
01:19:22,447 --> 01:19:24,677
You're the last word in womanhood.

1458
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:26,445
- I adore you.
- Really, Celal?

1459
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:29,923
- Let me ask you. Really?
- Really, Ceren.

1460
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:32,641
Get going.

1461
01:19:34,567 --> 01:19:35,841
Time to go, please.

1462
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:38,435
- What is it, Celal?
- An anchovy's caught in my throat.

1463
01:19:40,007 --> 01:19:42,077
Go on inside.

1464
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:47,319
I want to see the room of the woman
who made such a great meal.

1465
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:50,282
Why not?
Let's go have a look.

1466
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:56,645
- Gözde.
- There aren't any surprises.

1467
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:02,878
Are you still upset?

1468
01:20:09,327 --> 01:20:11,124
Do you want some stuffed vine leaves?

1469
01:20:13,127 --> 01:20:15,118
Lettuce?

1470
01:20:18,087 --> 01:20:20,999
- Eggplant?
- I don't want any.

1471
01:20:22,367 --> 01:20:24,358
Mixed pickles?

1472
01:20:26,007 --> 01:20:27,804
Babaganush?

1473
01:20:30,087 --> 01:20:33,443
Okay, Ceren. What I did
was terrible.

1474
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:36,923
I realize that.
I was an ass.

1475
01:20:37,327 --> 01:20:40,763
But I never really wanted to do it.

1476
01:20:40,887 --> 01:20:42,764
I don't want to hurt you
or anything else.

1477
01:20:42,887 --> 01:20:45,276
I love you.
I love you so much.

1478
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:50,681
Everything I feel in my heart
is for you, Ceren.

1479
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:53,526
It's all about Ceren.

1480
01:20:54,407 --> 01:20:56,557
That'sjust the way I feel.

1481
01:20:58,527 --> 01:21:01,803
We go together hand in glove.
We were made for each other.

1482
01:21:02,847 --> 01:21:04,519
Do you understand?

1483
01:21:04,967 --> 01:21:08,960
I feel like I've known you since
the first time I opened my eyes.

1484
01:21:09,487 --> 01:21:11,637
Do you understand? Like
we didn't meet in college.

1485
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:16,045
It's like you've always been
a part of my life.

1486
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:20,118
You know, like...

1487
01:21:20,927 --> 01:21:23,202
...like Serena and Venus.

1488
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:27,762
Like the Klitschko brothers.
Like Siegfried and Roy.

1489
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:30,965
Do you understand?
They understand each other without speaking.

1490
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,763
One makes the tiger disappear, the other
makes it reappear.

1491
01:21:35,127 --> 01:21:37,163
We have something like that.

1492
01:21:38,687 --> 01:21:40,837
Do you understand? I mean...

1493
01:21:43,207 --> 01:21:46,517
Sometimes I buy puzzles.
I like doing them.

1494
01:21:46,647 --> 01:21:48,797
500 pieces. 1000 pieces.
5000 pieces.

1495
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:51,635
Imagine a 5000-piece puzzle.
Really huge.

1496
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:55,123
I keep doing the puzzle,
but I can neverfinish it.

1497
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:59,436
It's missing a piece.
I'm going out of my mind.

1498
01:21:59,807 --> 01:22:01,718
I can't find the piece.

1499
01:22:01,807 --> 01:22:04,560
But you can't complete
the puzzle without it...

1500
01:22:05,127 --> 01:22:10,565
...and that tiny piece is the most
important part of the puzzle.

1501
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:12,280
Do you understand?

1502
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,125
The most precious piece.

1503
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:17,404
If life's a big puzzle...

1504
01:22:17,527 --> 01:22:20,200
...if my life's a puzzle...

1505
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:24,198
...you're the most precious piece
of the puzzle.

1506
01:22:25,047 --> 01:22:29,165
You're the most precious piece
of my puzzle.

1507
01:22:32,967 --> 01:22:37,199
I'm sure everyone has experienced
the same thing.

1508
01:22:37,287 --> 01:22:38,800
Definitely.

1509
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:43,718
Everyone has a Ceren.
Do you understand?

1510
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:48,278
And my Ceren is you.
Do you understand?

1511
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:50,963
- Celal.
- I'm not crying, okay.

1512
01:22:51,527 --> 01:22:53,916
Go wash your face and come back.
Talk to me like a man.

1513
01:22:54,047 --> 01:22:56,038
Don't cry. Please.

1514
01:22:56,327 --> 01:22:57,999
Okay.

1515
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:03,442
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1516
01:23:04,607 --> 01:23:06,484
Is it what I think it is?

1517
01:23:06,927 --> 01:23:08,679
- Are they kidding with us?
- Oh my God.

1518
01:23:08,807 --> 01:23:10,399
Let's boil some water, open the door,
and throw it in.

1519
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:11,926
Don't be ridiculous.
Are we separating humping dogs?

1520
01:23:12,047 --> 01:23:16,040
Let's go in together. You grab
Gözde and I'll grab Kubilay.

1521
01:23:17,647 --> 01:23:19,399
- You're an animal.
- Right.

1522
01:23:19,487 --> 01:23:20,761
Shut up, silly.

1523
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:23,560
We have an announcement to make.

1524
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:26,520
We've decided to get married.

1525
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:29,161
You must bejoking.
Is it the anchovies? What happened?

1526
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:32,962
- It's too soon.
- Gözde, are you crazy?

1527
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:36,363
Yes, I'm crazy.
I'm crazy in love.

1528
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:39,285
Are you sick or what?
Don't make me sorry I brought you.

1529
01:23:39,407 --> 01:23:42,524
- How'd all this happen?
- I was smitten by her eyes.

1530
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:47,163
By her cooking. We went inside.
We humped and humped.

1531
01:23:47,447 --> 01:23:49,438
I saw the light.

1532
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:26,485
Oh!

1533
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:28,526
Oh!

1534
01:24:28,607 --> 01:24:30,359
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

1535
01:24:30,487 --> 01:24:32,284
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

1536
01:24:32,407 --> 01:24:34,557
- I'm having breakfast.
- Is this a breakfast room?

1537
01:24:34,687 --> 01:24:37,076
Is this a sex room?
You have a bedroom.

1538
01:24:37,207 --> 01:24:39,516
Go to your room and do it.
Do I have to watch you?

1539
01:24:39,647 --> 01:24:41,763
I can see your boobs.
Cover up your boobs.

1540
01:24:41,887 --> 01:24:44,560
- Sex-starved.
- Do I have to ask you to have sex?

1541
01:24:44,687 --> 01:24:46,359
We'll make love wherever we want.
We're married.

1542
01:24:46,487 --> 01:24:49,479
If anyone is the third wheel here, it's you.
Don't you get it?

1543
01:24:49,607 --> 01:24:51,837
You shouldn't hang out with
newlyweds for so long.

1544
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:54,640
It's time you started looking for a
place of your own.

1545
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:58,077
You think you're a man now cause you
found that broad? Are you kicking me out?

1546
01:24:58,207 --> 01:25:01,916
That's not what I said. But it's time
you started looking.

1547
01:25:05,007 --> 01:25:08,204
Shame on you.
You should be ashamed.

1548
01:25:08,727 --> 01:25:11,639
You're my Kubilay,
my blood brother...

1549
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:14,446
...and look what you're saying.
How could you?

1550
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,762
I don't believe my ears?

1551
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:20,596
Where can I go? Can I live at my
dad's at my age?

1552
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:22,120
What would the neighbors say?

1553
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:24,556
Go stay with Ceren.
She's here now. Ceren lives alone

1554
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:26,279
- Go stay with her.
- Shame on you.

1555
01:25:26,607 --> 01:25:28,916
- Stop agitating.
- Shame on you.

1556
01:25:29,327 --> 01:25:32,080
- Stop agitating.
- Shame on you.

1557
01:25:36,207 --> 01:25:37,322
Yes?

1558
01:25:37,447 --> 01:25:39,642
Why are you treating me like
a door-to-door salesman...

1559
01:25:39,847 --> 01:25:41,724
...aftersix years together?
- Celal, what is it? What do you want?

1560
01:25:42,087 --> 01:25:44,442
They threw me out.
"Go away," they said

1561
01:25:44,527 --> 01:25:46,597
"Don't come back", they said.
"We're honeymooning,"they said.

1562
01:25:46,727 --> 01:25:49,525
They sneaked up on me in the middle
of the night, stark naked.

1563
01:25:49,647 --> 01:25:53,322
They abused me sexually. They won't
even let me have my morning comflakes.

1564
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:56,519
- Then go stay at a hotel.
- Who'd take me and Kahraman?

1565
01:25:56,647 --> 01:25:58,046
Aren't there any crow-friendly
hotels in Istanbul?

1566
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:00,635
What's it to me? Stay at your parents'.
Why have you come here?

1567
01:26:00,767 --> 01:26:03,076
How can I go back home
after 35 years of age?

1568
01:26:03,207 --> 01:26:06,563
What do I care? Go stay with one of
yourfriends from the bachelor party.

1569
01:26:06,687 --> 01:26:09,247
One of them can take you in.
Go on!

1570
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:10,641
They're all animals, Ceren.

1571
01:26:10,767 --> 01:26:13,156
I'm going through a rough time
and I need some tenderness.

1572
01:26:13,247 --> 01:26:15,522
All I get from them is guy talk,
and all that.

1573
01:26:15,647 --> 01:26:17,638
What I want is tendemess.

1574
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:20,441
Warm skin.
Asoft touch.

1575
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:23,235
A kiss.
Nice boobs.

1576
01:26:23,807 --> 01:26:25,320
- You're disgusting.
- Excuse me.

1577
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:27,961
Get lost! There's no excuse.
You're shameless. Get lost.

1578
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:31,477
I haven't seen you forso long, Ceren.
I've had two wet dreams.

1579
01:26:31,767 --> 01:26:33,598
You're a total pervert.
Really.

1580
01:26:33,727 --> 01:26:35,683
Just a second, Ceren.
I've made a decision.

1581
01:26:35,807 --> 01:26:37,923
I'll consider you my sister until I
cross this threshold.

1582
01:26:38,047 --> 01:26:41,278
- Let me stay, sister.
- You're disgusting. Get lost.

1583
01:26:41,407 --> 01:26:44,399
- Get lost!
- Then I'm not going anywhere.

1584
01:26:44,527 --> 01:26:48,156
I'll live right here.
On a 30-square-centimeter doormat.

1585
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,165
I'll snarl at whoever passes.
I'll eat all your food deliveries.

1586
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:53,602
You can choke on them
for all I care!

1587
01:26:53,727 --> 01:26:55,763
Hold on. You're not slamming
the door that easily.

1588
01:26:56,047 --> 01:26:57,321
- I'm not falling for it.
- Just watch.

1589
01:26:57,407 --> 01:26:59,363
Right in my face.
- Just watch me.

1590
01:26:59,487 --> 01:27:01,398
Slam it then, can you?
Slam it then.

1591
01:27:01,727 --> 01:27:03,638
Just like that, Ceren?

1592
01:27:04,047 --> 01:27:05,924
Ceren?

1593
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:12,719
Stop it, Kahraman.
I'm at the end of my rope as it is.

1594
01:27:19,727 --> 01:27:21,558
You could have given us some water.

1595
01:27:22,007 --> 01:27:23,759
He's thirsty, and so am I.

1596
01:27:23,927 --> 01:27:26,236
At least put a bowl of water
outside the door.

1597
01:27:29,807 --> 01:27:33,038
Whatever, we'll go listen to some music.

1598
01:27:34,287 --> 01:27:37,006
This is an apartment building.
Keep it down, guys.

1599
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:39,436
What are you doing here?
You've hit rock bottom.

1600
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:42,799
Ah, don't ask, guys.
I really have hit bottom.

1601
01:27:42,927 --> 01:27:44,519
She won't let me in.

1602
01:27:44,847 --> 01:27:47,600
- That's terrible. You're locked out?
- Yeah. Like an abandoned dog.

1603
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:50,446
You see that?
Like a little stray dog.

1604
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:52,922
- And he has a bird.
- Should we take him in?

1605
01:27:53,047 --> 01:27:55,242
- Please let me.
- Let him come. We'll have a party.

1606
01:27:55,367 --> 01:27:56,880
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

1607
01:27:56,967 --> 01:27:58,195
- Where's your place?
- Upstairs.

1608
01:27:58,327 --> 01:28:01,000
Right up here?
- Yes.

1609
01:28:13,407 --> 01:28:14,522
What's going on?

1610
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:17,317
Where'd you find him?

1611
01:28:17,447 --> 01:28:20,166
I was young once, but never like this.

1612
01:28:25,527 --> 01:28:28,121
The downstairs neighbor's come.
Sorry about all the noise.

1613
01:28:28,247 --> 01:28:29,965
Celal, what are you doing here?
What are you up to?

1614
01:28:30,087 --> 01:28:32,043
We're having a party.
We're dancing.

1615
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:37,195
Ceren, please take him in.
He's so cute. The little darling.

1616
01:28:37,607 --> 01:28:40,644
And he loves you.
He told us all about it.

1617
01:28:40,767 --> 01:28:43,281
I could eat you right up.

1618
01:28:43,407 --> 01:28:44,920
- Sure.
- Wow.

1619
01:28:45,047 --> 01:28:48,323
Celal, gather your things.
Girls, tum down that music.

1620
01:28:48,447 --> 01:28:50,358
Celal, don't do anything stupid.

1621
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:53,843
Get downstairs. Come to my place.
Tum that music down. I'm going to bed.

1622
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:57,523
Come on.

1623
01:28:57,887 --> 01:28:59,843
Thank God.

1624
01:29:01,487 --> 01:29:03,955
There's no place like home.
I swear it.

1625
01:29:04,087 --> 01:29:05,805
It's so peaceful,
so cozy.

1626
01:29:05,927 --> 01:29:07,485
I even missed the way it smells.

1627
01:29:07,607 --> 01:29:09,802
Hang on a minute.
Just a second.

1628
01:29:10,247 --> 01:29:12,522
I don't want that bird in my house,
okay?

1629
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:14,717
Never. Put him out on the balcony.

1630
01:29:14,847 --> 01:29:17,156
Ceren, how can I put Kahraman
outside in this weather?

1631
01:29:17,287 --> 01:29:19,198
He's a tiny thing with a little soul.

1632
01:29:19,327 --> 01:29:21,966
Celal, it's warm outside. Enough of
your nonsense. I don't want him here.

1633
01:29:22,087 --> 01:29:24,282
That's what I mean. It's too hot.

1634
01:29:24,407 --> 01:29:26,602
He's all black, and the sun will beat
down on him.

1635
01:29:26,727 --> 01:29:30,163
He'll absorb all that sunlight. A beak
is all that will be left of him.

1636
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:32,676
Oh, poorthing. How upsetting.
I don't care. I don't want him here.

1637
01:29:32,807 --> 01:29:34,525
- It's my apartment.
- Fine then.

1638
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:38,161
Okay, Kahraman, we're not staying
where we're not wanted.

1639
01:29:38,287 --> 01:29:39,879
I'll sort things out somehow.

1640
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:44,125
Secondly, just because I let you in
don't try any funny business.

1641
01:29:44,327 --> 01:29:48,366
Any attempted rubbing, petting, pushing
or penetration and...

1642
01:29:48,527 --> 01:29:50,199
...I'll tear it right off.
- I can't do anything?

1643
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:52,198
- Nothing at all.
- Cuddling?

1644
01:29:52,327 --> 01:29:53,680
- No.
- Spooning?

1645
01:29:53,807 --> 01:29:55,001
Never.

1646
01:29:55,127 --> 01:29:58,483
I didn't let you in here because I have
feelings or anything...

1647
01:29:58,687 --> 01:30:01,042
...but because I had to.
To stop the neighbors talking.

1648
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:03,806
The whole building and all the neighbors
will be talking about me.

1649
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:07,124
Don't forget to open the lid when
you use the toilet.

1650
01:30:07,487 --> 01:30:10,126
Take a shower after I leave.
I don't want to see it.

1651
01:30:10,407 --> 01:30:12,398
Don't go anywhere near the kitchen.

1652
01:30:12,527 --> 01:30:15,166
Do what you want. Clean up after yourself.
I don't want to see any of it.

1653
01:30:15,247 --> 01:30:18,364
No coming into my room,
or even the next room over.

1654
01:30:18,487 --> 01:30:20,682
Okay? Sleep or pass out here.

1655
01:30:20,807 --> 01:30:22,001
Just don't touch me.

1656
01:30:22,127 --> 01:30:23,560
God bless you.

1657
01:30:23,687 --> 01:30:25,996
Just give me a greased truncheon
to stick up my ass.

1658
01:30:26,127 --> 01:30:27,640
Celal, you're disgusting.
Here's a blanket.

1659
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:29,166
Get that bird out of here.

1660
01:30:29,287 --> 01:30:31,596
I have a bird for you.
Just you wait.

1661
01:30:31,887 --> 01:30:34,355
You're disgusting. Good night.

1662
01:30:34,687 --> 01:30:37,645
- Princess.
- Celal, get out

1663
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:39,041
- Get out.
- See this?

1664
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,761
You're not allowed in here.
- But just look at this.

1665
01:30:41,887 --> 01:30:43,878
- I don't care.
- Oh, oh, oh.

1666
01:30:43,967 --> 01:30:45,366
I said I don't want it.

1667
01:30:45,727 --> 01:30:47,922
Celal, I don't want it!

1668
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:52,366
I can't believe it.

1669
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:54,399
I really can't.

1670
01:30:54,527 --> 01:30:57,724
I have to go to work.

1671
01:30:58,807 --> 01:31:01,082
What have I done to serve this?

1672
01:31:01,287 --> 01:31:04,404
Get out! Get out, I said!

1673
01:31:41,007 --> 01:31:42,725
You'll love it, Ceren.

1674
01:31:42,967 --> 01:31:46,277
You'll love it, Ceren. Look at the table.
It's a work of art.

1675
01:31:52,087 --> 01:31:54,043
- I made you dinner, Ceren.
- Celal, but I...

1676
01:31:54,207 --> 01:31:57,358
Okay. I know how pleased you are.
Come take a seat.

1677
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:00,802
This impresses all the women.
- I have to go out.

1678
01:32:01,087 --> 01:32:04,079
I promised to go to dinner.
- Who'd you promise?

1679
01:32:04,487 --> 01:32:07,206
They're picking me up. They're here.
Did you make the bed?

1680
01:32:07,327 --> 01:32:09,636
- Where are you going?
- Bye-bye.

1681
01:32:10,087 --> 01:32:11,679
Where are you going?

1682
01:32:12,047 --> 01:32:14,322
Who's picking you up?

1683
01:32:15,007 --> 01:32:17,805
Is it that bastard Baturalp again?

1684
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:21,079
Has Baturalp come to get you?

1685
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:23,084
That bastard Baturalp!

1686
01:32:23,207 --> 01:32:26,199
Aren't you ashamed to hit on
other men's wives and girlfriends?

1687
01:32:26,327 --> 01:32:30,400
There are 24 million people in this city.
Why are you hitting on my girlfriend?

1688
01:32:30,647 --> 01:32:33,798
Bastard! I broke a guitar over your head.
What else should I break?

1689
01:32:34,527 --> 01:32:36,916
Celal, what are you doing?
- Just a second, Ceren. Stand back.

1690
01:32:37,047 --> 01:32:39,117
- Stop it.
- No, Ceren. Get back.

1691
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:42,086
You pushed me over the edge.

1692
01:32:42,367 --> 01:32:45,439
- I've totally lost it.
- I don't believe it. Dad! My dad!

1693
01:32:45,847 --> 01:32:48,441
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, Mehmet.

1694
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:51,035
Enjoy your dinner, Mehmet.
I trust you're well?

1695
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:54,842
Get in. Let's go.
- Good evening.

1696
01:33:42,807 --> 01:33:45,002
Hey! Where are you going?
- My apartment is on fire.

1697
01:33:45,127 --> 01:33:47,641
- My apartment. My boyfriend...
- It's on fire. Don't you see it?

1698
01:33:47,767 --> 01:33:49,519
It's full of smoke.
Where are you going?

1699
01:33:49,647 --> 01:33:51,956
My boyfriend's inside.
- How can you save him?

1700
01:33:52,087 --> 01:33:53,964
Are you going to put out the fire
with your bare hands?

1701
01:33:54,207 --> 01:33:56,562
- Yes, Celal!
- Wait. Hold on a second.

1702
01:33:56,687 --> 01:33:59,997
- Who's your boyfriend?
- Celal. He' a bit heavy. And tall.

1703
01:34:00,127 --> 01:34:02,197
A tall guy twice my size.

1704
01:34:02,327 --> 01:34:05,080
I saw him. I got him out.
Nobody touched him. Don't worry.

1705
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,720
- Is he alive?
- He's alive. Now get out of here.

1706
01:34:06,847 --> 01:34:09,725
Thank God. Bless you.
- For God's sake.

1707
01:34:10,647 --> 01:34:12,842
Why isn't there any water?

1708
01:34:12,967 --> 01:34:14,844
I'm going to stick this in my
mouth and blow myself up.

1709
01:34:14,967 --> 01:34:17,083
I swear I've had it.

1710
01:34:20,527 --> 01:34:21,755
Celal?

1711
01:34:21,927 --> 01:34:24,441
- Get away.
- Spit it all out.

1712
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:27,155
My poor lamb.

1713
01:34:27,247 --> 01:34:30,239
What happened, Celal?
How'd this happen to you.

1714
01:34:30,367 --> 01:34:31,800
I nearly died, Ceren.

1715
01:34:32,127 --> 01:34:34,083
God must have saved me

1716
01:34:34,207 --> 01:34:36,084
After working so hard all day...

1717
01:34:36,247 --> 01:34:38,124
...I nodded off the second my head
hit the pillow.

1718
01:34:38,247 --> 01:34:39,680
Oh, you poorthing.

1719
01:34:40,047 --> 01:34:45,485
Then I heard, "Caw, caw!"
Kahraman woke me up.

1720
01:34:45,607 --> 01:34:47,643
That animal told me to get up
and save my skin.

1721
01:34:47,767 --> 01:34:49,678
Get up, he said.
- I don't believe it.

1722
01:34:52,127 --> 01:34:54,118
That's so touching.

1723
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:02,997
I got up.
There was smoke everywhere.

1724
01:35:03,127 --> 01:35:05,766
I couldn't see a thing.
I couldn't breathe.

1725
01:35:05,887 --> 01:35:08,242
Oh no, it's a nightmare, I said.

1726
01:35:08,367 --> 01:35:11,165
Then a man with a white light
came up.

1727
01:35:11,287 --> 01:35:12,845
A little guy, knee-high.

1728
01:35:12,967 --> 01:35:15,242
It's a miracle, I said to myself.
Follow that man.

1729
01:35:15,367 --> 01:35:17,722
Well, he slung me over his back
and we went out the window.

1730
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:20,607
Now I'm here, breathing oxygen.

1731
01:35:20,727 --> 01:35:23,400
It's unbelievable, Celal.

1732
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:25,804
What's that?

1733
01:35:28,087 --> 01:35:29,361
My lungs are whistling.

1734
01:35:29,727 --> 01:35:32,400
When I saw the apartment on fire,
I was so worried, Celal.

1735
01:35:32,487 --> 01:35:34,842
If anything happened to you...

1736
01:35:35,327 --> 01:35:37,238
...I couldn't go on.

1737
01:35:42,047 --> 01:35:44,322
Darling.
Spit, darling.

1738
01:35:54,687 --> 01:35:56,405
Put on your bathrobe.

1739
01:35:56,647 --> 01:35:58,160
Put on your bathrobe.

1740
01:35:58,287 --> 01:36:00,562
Aren't you ashamed to sit like
that in front of your sister-in-law?

1741
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:03,599
She stuck that thing on your chest.
And a collar around your neck.

1742
01:36:03,727 --> 01:36:07,276
- What kind of couple are you?
- What's wrong with us?

1743
01:36:07,607 --> 01:36:10,167
Your clothes for a start.
Just look at yourselves.

1744
01:36:10,287 --> 01:36:12,676
Okay, it's a fantasy thing.
But she's dressed like the devil.

1745
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,200
I don't know what
you're supposed to be.

1746
01:36:14,327 --> 01:36:16,283
A gardener.
It's obvious.

1747
01:36:16,407 --> 01:36:18,443
- Look at the gardener.
- I don't believe it.

1748
01:36:18,687 --> 01:36:21,724
Whatever.
You can go use our bedroom.

1749
01:36:21,847 --> 01:36:24,236
Why would we use your bedroom?
We have our own room.

1750
01:36:24,327 --> 01:36:26,363
I redecorated your room.
It's a hobby room now.

1751
01:36:26,487 --> 01:36:29,399
That's why I suggested our room.
- Celal, come on. Let's go inside.

1752
01:36:29,527 --> 01:36:31,916
Just a second, Ceren.
I'm not going anywhere.

1753
01:36:32,207 --> 01:36:34,846
I arose from the flames, rebom.

1754
01:36:34,967 --> 01:36:37,401
A tiny fireman gave me
a new lease on life.

1755
01:36:37,527 --> 01:36:39,916
I can't sleep in their room, Ceren.

1756
01:36:40,047 --> 01:36:41,799
Who knows what's in their bed?

1757
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:43,838
There might be a corpse.

1758
01:36:43,967 --> 01:36:45,844
- Enough already.
- There could be a horse's head.

1759
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:48,356
Sheep intestines.
We could find anything.

1760
01:36:48,487 --> 01:36:51,240
A dildo. Avibrator.
Who knows what we'll find.

1761
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:52,641
Okay, Celal.

1762
01:36:52,767 --> 01:36:54,086
They can sleep inside.
We'll stay here.

1763
01:36:54,207 --> 01:36:56,596
Okay. Gözde, we'll sleep here.
Thanks. We'll use the couch.

1764
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:59,036
Fine then. Sweet dreams.
- You too.

1765
01:36:59,247 --> 01:37:00,600
Look
- Ugh.

1766
01:37:01,007 --> 01:37:04,602
They thrust it in our faces.

1767
01:37:04,727 --> 01:37:07,480
It's unbelievable. Really.
Anyway, good night.

1768
01:37:08,207 --> 01:37:10,357
- Where are you going?
- To bed.

1769
01:37:10,447 --> 01:37:12,165
- Sleep here.
- Why should I sleep there?

1770
01:37:12,287 --> 01:37:13,766
- Come over here.
- No, dear.

1771
01:37:13,887 --> 01:37:15,843
- We can sleep here together.
- Celal, no.

1772
01:37:16,167 --> 01:37:18,158
Do what you want then.
I'm not going to keep trying.

1773
01:37:18,287 --> 01:37:20,676
I've been rebom.

1774
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:23,044
- Go tum off the lights.
- You turn them off.

1775
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:24,282
- Tum them off.
- You do it.

1776
01:37:24,407 --> 01:37:25,920
- Tum them off.
- No, you.

1777
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:27,162
- Look.
- Tum them off.

1778
01:37:27,287 --> 01:37:28,959
- Look.
- Tum them off.

1779
01:37:29,327 --> 01:37:32,319
Why won't you turn off the lights?

1780
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,680
Celal. Stop it!

1781
01:37:36,367 --> 01:37:37,959
Sleep over here. There's room.

1782
01:37:38,087 --> 01:37:40,078
I'm coming over to you.

1783
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:47,678
So, is marriage going well?

1784
01:37:47,807 --> 01:37:50,116
What do you mean, well?
It's the best thing I've experienced.

1785
01:37:50,247 --> 01:37:52,920
I wish I'd done it earlier.
- Tell me about it.

1786
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:57,126
Just because you're an old friend
doesn't mean I can tell you everything.

1787
01:37:57,407 --> 01:37:58,283
Of course not.

1788
01:37:58,407 --> 01:38:01,558
Some details can be shared,
others can't. Right?

1789
01:38:01,647 --> 01:38:04,161
- Of course.
- Let mejump right in.

1790
01:38:04,447 --> 01:38:08,122
Marriage is about free sex.
That much I can tell you.

1791
01:38:08,447 --> 01:38:12,122
Your sister-in-law and me
get naked three times a week.

1792
01:38:12,247 --> 01:38:15,159
Completely naked.
All day long

1793
01:38:15,287 --> 01:38:18,199
We take a break only to eat and pee.

1794
01:38:18,527 --> 01:38:24,397
I shouldn't say this, but last week
I slipped it to her something fierce.

1795
01:38:24,727 --> 01:38:26,843
You're tuming my stomach.

1796
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:30,243
I could see you at it.
I'm eating and I feel nauseous.

1797
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:32,722
Marriage has done me good.

1798
01:38:33,447 --> 01:38:35,563
I've got to admit something.
- Go on.

1799
01:38:36,367 --> 01:38:39,882
We're old friends. Who can I tell
if not you?

1800
01:38:40,927 --> 01:38:43,760
Ceren and I have decided to get married.
It's final this time.

1801
01:38:43,847 --> 01:38:44,962
I'm going to propose.

1802
01:38:45,087 --> 01:38:49,478
If you didn't, I'd call
you a jackass.

1803
01:38:49,567 --> 01:38:51,717
I want it so much, you know?

1804
01:38:51,847 --> 01:38:55,157
But I want something different.
Like on the Internet.

1805
01:38:55,487 --> 01:38:59,082
Proposing while parachuting
or underwater.

1806
01:38:59,167 --> 01:39:02,045
I really want something interesting.

1807
01:39:02,127 --> 01:39:04,436
Right. I've got some ideas.

1808
01:39:04,567 --> 01:39:07,684
But I want something
simpler and more permanent.

1809
01:39:08,087 --> 01:39:10,203
We should do it, Kubi.
We should make it succeed.

1810
01:39:10,327 --> 01:39:12,602
Of course we will.
We'll do it. Have no doubts.

1811
01:39:16,127 --> 01:39:17,276
Yes, Ceren.

1812
01:39:17,807 --> 01:39:22,927
In front of the place from which the
Ottomans ruled their 7 nations...

1813
01:39:23,087 --> 01:39:26,841
...here, in front ofTopkapı Palace...

1814
01:39:27,007 --> 01:39:28,838
...I want to express my love for you.

1815
01:39:29,087 --> 01:39:32,841
Ceren, just like that hopeless
seagull up there...

1816
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:37,845
...I found my love under your
wing and in your arms, Ceren.

1817
01:39:38,447 --> 01:39:41,564
Ceren, in this masterpiece in which
I express my love for you...

1818
01:39:42,087 --> 01:39:46,399
...let's start with a reenactment...

1819
01:39:46,607 --> 01:39:48,484
...of the day we met.

1820
01:39:49,087 --> 01:39:51,123
Let's all watch it together.

1821
01:39:52,567 --> 01:39:56,560
Celal and Ceren.

1822
01:40:07,207 --> 01:40:10,040
Watch what you're doing!

1823
01:40:11,127 --> 01:40:13,083
I'm so sorry.
You seem alright though.

1824
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:17,001
Just look at me.
I'm all wet, don't you see?

1825
01:40:17,127 --> 01:40:20,164
Play football somewhere else.

1826
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:24,725
I'm terribly sorry.
How can I make you forgive me?

1827
01:40:25,167 --> 01:40:27,044
Can you get me another milk?

1828
01:40:27,407 --> 01:40:30,285
Of course. I'll go to the stand
and get one right away.

1829
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:32,562
Maybe we'll have a sandwich together.

1830
01:40:32,687 --> 01:40:35,406
There's always a silver lining.
This accident brought us together.

1831
01:40:35,527 --> 01:40:38,564
- My name's Celal. What's yours?
- My name's Ceren.

1832
01:40:38,887 --> 01:40:41,765
Nice to meet you.
You're so beautiful.

1833
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:44,398
See you later.

1834
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:47,123
He seems like a sweet boy.

1835
01:40:47,407 --> 01:40:50,160
There's something deep in his eyes.

1836
01:40:50,807 --> 01:40:54,686
The ball hit just the kind of girl I like.

1837
01:40:55,047 --> 01:40:57,925
And to you I say:
I...

1838
01:40:58,447 --> 01:40:59,926
...love you, Ceren.

1839
01:41:00,247 --> 01:41:04,081
I love you. See,
C "heart" C.

1840
01:41:04,527 --> 01:41:07,837
That's right, Ceren. One of our
biggest problems...

1841
01:41:08,047 --> 01:41:10,003
...was Kahraman.
I want to say something.

1842
01:41:10,127 --> 01:41:13,756
This dear creature I've fed
and looked after for years...

1843
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:16,561
...is now free. Okay, Kahraman.
Sorry about that.

1844
01:41:16,687 --> 01:41:19,520
I've got to set you free.
She doesn't like you.

1845
01:41:19,647 --> 01:41:23,959
Fly straight that way and you'll
reach Manyas Bird Reserve.

1846
01:41:24,087 --> 01:41:26,078
You can do what you want there.
I'm releasing him.

1847
01:41:28,047 --> 01:41:30,356
Just one last kiss.

1848
01:41:31,087 --> 01:41:33,043
Ah!
- Celal.

1849
01:41:34,367 --> 01:41:37,086
Get back! Take my hand.

1850
01:41:37,367 --> 01:41:40,359
Kahraman! Kahraman! Celal!

1851
01:41:41,247 --> 01:41:43,556
What happened?

1852
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:48,239
Ceren, I think I have now...

1853
01:41:48,847 --> 01:41:51,486
...proven how much I've changed.

1854
01:41:51,807 --> 01:41:53,559
My love for you...

1855
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:57,083
...is the most important thing...
so I set Kahraman free...

1856
01:41:57,407 --> 01:42:00,922
...and was attacked,
as you just saw.

1857
01:42:01,287 --> 01:42:02,925
You saw it with your own eyes.

1858
01:42:03,447 --> 01:42:08,157
Even at the risk of losing my eyes...

1859
01:42:08,847 --> 01:42:10,758
...I declared my love to all Istanbul.

1860
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,600
And now...

1861
01:42:13,447 --> 01:42:15,517
...last of all

1862
01:42:15,767 --> 01:42:18,281
...I want to say I love you.
I love you.

1863
01:42:18,567 --> 01:42:21,081
I love you!

1864
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:24,282
I have a proposal.

1865
01:42:24,927 --> 01:42:27,805
Will you marry me?

1866
01:42:28,167 --> 01:42:31,079
I thought it over.
It's my final decision.

1867
01:42:31,367 --> 01:42:34,006
I'm absolutely sure.

1868
01:42:34,687 --> 01:42:38,282
Ceren, here in front of everyone...

1869
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:40,995
...looking into your eyes,
I want to say it.

1870
01:42:41,807 --> 01:42:43,877
Will you marry me?

1871
01:42:46,807 --> 01:42:48,957
Thank you. Just a second.

1872
01:42:50,127 --> 01:42:51,924
Yes, but on one condition.
- Tell me.

1873
01:42:52,047 --> 01:42:54,242
I get to have a bachelorette party.

1874
01:42:54,487 --> 01:42:57,877
That's awful. You've comered me.

1875
01:42:58,127 --> 01:42:59,355
Only if you agree.

1876
01:42:59,487 --> 01:43:01,796
All right then. Do what you want.

1877
01:43:01,927 --> 01:43:04,487
I'm only kidding.
Yes!

1878
01:43:04,927 --> 01:43:07,122
We'll share a home

1879
01:43:07,647 --> 01:43:10,639
you for me
me for you

1880
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:14,037
as created by God.

1881
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:17,398
Come say "yes" and let's be happy.

1882
01:43:17,647 --> 01:43:20,764
We'll share a home

1883
01:43:21,047 --> 01:43:23,561
you for me
me for you...

1884
01:43:23,767 --> 01:43:25,485
...as created by God.

1885
01:43:37,847 --> 01:43:39,405
Is everything ready?

1886
01:43:39,727 --> 01:43:42,639
Right, the rocket shots are here.

1887
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:45,845
- That a boy.
- Just a second. I want to say something.

1888
01:43:46,607 --> 01:43:49,041
Get your shots, everyone.

1889
01:43:49,167 --> 01:43:51,078
Friends, you see.

1890
01:43:51,887 --> 01:43:53,366
Kubi got married.

1891
01:43:53,927 --> 01:43:56,316
You're still single.
This guy got married.

1892
01:43:56,447 --> 01:44:00,520
We all joked about it.
But now it's my tum.

1893
01:44:01,447 --> 01:44:04,280
We chased after our hearts.
We chased after our loves.

1894
01:44:04,847 --> 01:44:09,045
We did the right thing, but a little
voice is still saying...

1895
01:44:09,247 --> 01:44:10,396
"Don't do it, don't do it".

1896
01:44:10,687 --> 01:44:13,520
But I will. I will.
Because I love Ceren.

1897
01:44:14,927 --> 01:44:17,395
Cheers.
I hope it works out for us all.

1898
01:44:17,527 --> 01:44:18,437
Knock it back.

1899
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:24,965
- This is great.
- These rockets change everything.

1900
01:44:25,087 --> 01:44:27,476
There's one more thing.
I have one last request.

1901
01:44:27,567 --> 01:44:29,239
My last request as a bachelor.

1902
01:44:29,447 --> 01:44:31,802
The bachelor party we were
unable to have here...

1903
01:44:32,007 --> 01:44:35,158
...will be held in Aksaray, just like Çiko's,
one week after the wedding.

1904
01:44:35,327 --> 01:44:37,682
Let's organize it. I'll put Ceren
to bed andjoin you.

1905
01:44:37,807 --> 01:44:38,796
- Okay?
- Okay.

1906
01:44:38,927 --> 01:44:40,201
- Great idea.
- We've got to do it.

1907
01:44:40,327 --> 01:44:42,761
- We'll definitely do it.
- The same bunch, and the belly dancers.

1908
01:44:42,847 --> 01:44:45,077
- Will belly dancers come?
- Of course.

1909
01:44:45,327 --> 01:44:48,603
And those same girls.

1910
01:44:59,287 --> 01:45:02,006
You bet they'll come!

1911
01:45:05,887 --> 01:45:07,764
Right!

1912
01:45:10,207 --> 01:45:12,084
Right!

1913
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:14,886
Kahraman's come.

1914
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:17,283
I don't believe it.

1915
01:45:17,607 --> 01:45:20,440
That unlucky beast did
it right on our marriage license.

1916
01:45:20,567 --> 01:45:22,683
It's nothing, Ceren.
Don't worry.

1917
01:45:22,807 --> 01:45:26,083
I'll wipe it off.
- Don't let it touch my veil.

1918
01:45:27,287 --> 01:45:29,847
It's fate, fate.
It means prosperity.

1919
01:45:29,927 --> 01:45:33,317
- Celal.
- It's nothing, darling.

1920
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:00,646
3. 2. 1. Action.

1921
01:46:00,927 --> 01:46:02,280
Picture.

1922
01:46:02,407 --> 01:46:05,080
I'll come like so...

1923
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:07,683
Just picture it.

1924
01:46:08,247 --> 01:46:09,805
Drassed like so.

1925
01:46:10,087 --> 01:46:12,965
Drassed lake so.

1926
01:46:15,807 --> 01:46:18,799
Ta-da. With my bare hands, I'II...

1927
01:46:21,087 --> 01:46:23,442
I swear I'll take a poop,
lower my drawers and do it right here.

1928
01:46:23,847 --> 01:46:25,519
Did you kiss or didn't you?

1929
01:46:25,967 --> 01:46:28,356
I'll lower my drawers,
and squeeze one out right here.

1930
01:46:28,647 --> 01:46:31,844
I swear I'll do it. Don't laugh.
- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

1931
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:34,476
- You weren't on the bike when I got here.
- Hey!

1932
01:46:36,367 --> 01:46:37,641
Keep going.

1933
01:46:38,087 --> 01:46:40,521
Come over here.
- Smack me softly.

1934
01:46:41,007 --> 01:46:43,680
Can I try it once?
- Try it.

1935
01:46:44,087 --> 01:46:45,679
Just like that.

1936
01:46:45,927 --> 01:46:48,839
He goes into the kitchen all dressed up.
He takes a shower.

1937
01:46:48,927 --> 01:46:50,963
He sprays aftershave all over.

1938
01:46:51,127 --> 01:46:53,118
Like a real gentleman...

1939
01:46:53,607 --> 01:46:55,563
He chops everything into pieces.

1940
01:46:56,007 --> 01:46:58,077
Throws it into the frying pan to cook.

1941
01:46:59,487 --> 01:47:01,125
Aubertine?

1942
01:47:01,687 --> 01:47:03,757
Aubertine?

1943
01:47:04,887 --> 01:47:06,161
Aubertine?

1944
01:47:06,287 --> 01:47:09,199
I don't want anything.
I don't want any aubertine.

1945
01:47:09,367 --> 01:47:11,437
They said they wanted to enjoy
their sex lives to their hearts' content.

1946
01:47:11,527 --> 01:47:13,597
They threw me out naked.

1947
01:47:16,007 --> 01:47:18,316
Thank you so much. You may as well
put a couple of hooks in the ceiling...

1948
01:47:18,447 --> 01:47:20,915
...and hang me up by my nipples.

1949
01:47:22,807 --> 01:47:24,923
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to sleep here, Celal.

1950
01:47:25,127 --> 01:47:26,276
Let's sleep together here.

1951
01:47:26,487 --> 01:47:29,001
- Don't be silly. Why should I sleep there?
- Come sleep with me.

1952
01:47:30,847 --> 01:47:32,565
- Let's sleep here together.
- Don't be silly.

1953
01:47:32,647 --> 01:47:33,762
Come here.

1954
01:47:33,847 --> 01:47:35,439
Oh, Celal.

1955
01:47:36,767 --> 01:47:38,644
- I'm going to change my mind.
- I'lljoin you.

1956
01:47:38,927 --> 01:47:43,197
Should I come here?
Homs are honking.

1957
01:47:43,407 --> 01:47:46,285
Truck drivers are celebrating.
Homs are honking.

1958
01:47:50,247 --> 01:47:52,397
Don't laugh. Let's do the scene again.

1959
01:47:52,687 --> 01:47:54,757
Don't laugh.

1960
01:47:56,087 --> 01:47:59,363
Stop it. Don't laugh.

1961
01:48:00,847 --> 01:48:01,996
Once again.

1962
01:48:02,087 --> 01:48:04,601
He made me laugh.

1963
01:48:05,567 --> 01:48:06,602
Once again.

1964
01:48:07,927 --> 01:48:09,360
You don't need to press so hard.

1965
01:48:22,807 --> 01:48:23,557
Cut.

1966
01:48:23,647 --> 01:48:27,526
# Rise, sun
# Give me new breath

1967
01:48:29,007 --> 01:48:33,717
# rise, sun
# Give me new desire

1968
01:48:34,887 --> 01:48:39,039
# rise from the same place
# but don't set in the same place

1969
01:48:40,567 --> 01:48:45,243
# keep rising, sun
# give me a new love

1970
01:48:46,407 --> 01:48:50,923
# rise, sun
# give me new breath

1971
01:48:52,127 --> 01:48:56,678
# rise, sun
# give me new desire

1972
01:48:57,887 --> 01:49:02,165
# rise from the same place
# but don't set in the same place

1973
01:49:03,607 --> 01:49:08,237
# keep rising sun
# give me new love

1974
01:49:20,807 --> 01:49:25,517
# be my light
# Illuminate a new path for me

1975
01:49:26,367 --> 01:49:30,918
# warm me
# put color in my pale face
