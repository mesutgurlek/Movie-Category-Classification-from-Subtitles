00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,017
<i>That's what I'm here for.</i>

6
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,566
No, I got it.
I got it, I got it.

7
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,102
I got it. Thank you.

8
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,173
You're very helpful, okay?
Yeah, yeah, and cute.

9
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,708
- Who is it?
- It's Ross.

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,745
- Are you by yourself?
- Yeah, I'm by myself.

11
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:48,972
You sure?

12
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,912
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm by myself.

13
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,054
Yeah, that's it.
Just stay right there.

14
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,290
Get in here. Hurry up.

15
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,929
- How much do you need?
- What you gave me last time was cool.

16
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,830
- How much you want?
- Whatever you got.

17
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:10,992
You know what?

18
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,068
I lost my shit. I have to find it,
so if you don't mind relaxing a little bit?

19
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,836
- No, I can come back.
- No, no. It's okay.

20
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,445
- You sure?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,776
It's great to see you. Why don't
you sit down and talk to...

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,315
To Nikki. Talk to Nikki.

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,153
Nikki, this is Ross.
Ross, this is Nikki.

24
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,481
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,626
You know Frisbee over there.

26
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:34,953
What?

27
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,358
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

28
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:43,359
And you just stay, relax, just sit down
and let me find my shit, okay?

29
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,736
So...

30
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,912
...what you looking at?
- I just need a little bit.

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,981
- What do you mean? Half or something?
- I don't need that much.

32
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,618
I don't even have that much money.
I just need a dime.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,620
- Oh, I got it.
- I got it.

34
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,019
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,226
- Who is it?
- Giggles.

36
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,886
LA Sadgirl.
From Circus Liquors.

37
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,228
- I'm busy right now.
- You're busy? Can we stop by later?

38
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,962
What part of busy don't you understand?
I don't got anything. Goodbye!

- <i>Pinche cabrón</i>!
- <i>Pinche enano.</i>

40
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:28,645
If Spider doesn't get his shit together,
I can probably help you out.

41
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,542
I got it!

42
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,745
No, don't answer my phone.
Don't answer my phone!

43
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,480
Hello?

44
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,192
No. He's unavailable at the moment.

45
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,729
You'll have to call back later.

46
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,859
Much, much later. Later.

47
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,730
Who is it?

48
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,373
It's just me, Spider.

49
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,975
Hey. Go away, fat boy!

50
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:02,578
- I said, go away, fat boy!
- Okay, okay. I'll see you later.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,419
- Mike, who called on the telephone?
- Why don't you sit down...

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,558
...and talk to your friend Nikki.

53
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,586
- Hey, Cookie.
- What's up?

54
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,024
Oh, shit. Damn.

55
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,701
- Shit. What am I gonna do, Nikki?
- Spider Mike...

56
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,568
...who called on the telephone, please?

57
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,972
Spider Mike went
to Circus Liquor earlier.

58
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,703
Maybe he dropped the dope...
Spider?

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,577
Did you ride your bike to Circus Liquor?
You did?

60
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,547
Okay. That's only a block
and a half away.

61
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,085
Why don't you stop freaking out
and backtrack.

62
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,246
- I bet you dropped the shit.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,450
- Yeah.
- I bet you dropped it on the way back.

64
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,619
You were on your bike,
and you just dropped it.

65
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,555
You know, you're right!
Yeah!

66
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,828
- Yeah, you dropped it.
- Yeah!

67
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,766
- He dropped it.
- I did. I dropped it.

68
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,405
I love this dude.

69
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,473
Suck my cock!

70
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,341
Fuck, I love this guy.

71
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,011
Michael? Who called
on the goddamn phone?

72
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,087
I don't know, you fucking asshole!

73
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:19,880
Holy shit!

74
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,755
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- You!

75
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,099
What the hell is the matter with you,
you little slut?

76
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,928
Genghis C<i>***</i>!

77
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,927
Spider, you son of a bitch!

78
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,096
Don't you fucking hit me
with shit again!

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,103
Look, everybody just stay sitting down.
Nobody goes out...

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,337
...and nobody comes in.
You understand?

81
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,710
I saw a lot of cop cars
out there earlier.

82
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,748
A lot of cop cars.

83
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,716
There were a lot of cops
out there earlier.

84
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,288
If you look...
If you look...

85
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,186
Where?

86
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,654
- I don't see anything, man.
- No, if you just look...

87
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,887
- I don't see anything, man.
- No?

88
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,758
- There's nobody there.
- They were there.

89
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,526
Where are they if they're there?

90
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,570
- I don't know.
- Because there's nobody there, man!

91
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:10,004
Little fuckhead.
There's no piggy scare, you stupid...

92
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,004
You fuck!

93
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,545
Fucking relax, all right?
Just stay sitting down, goddamn it!

94
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,376
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking phone!

95
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,548
Nobody moves!

96
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,321
So, Ross. Girlfriend frustrated?
Little unsatisfied?

97
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,398
Can't you keep it hard?
Need a little lift?

98
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,998
- I'm not seeing anyone.
- Who was that April chick...

99
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,572
...waiting in your car when you were
here a week ago?

100
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,409
April and I hook up occasionally,
but she's not my girlfriend.

101
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,276
My girlfriend is out of town,
in the city.

102
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,216
She got a cool corporate job offer
this summer, so she's up there.

103
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,086
Wait. Like, April...

104
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,124
Like, naughty girl, kind of nice girl,
blondie stripper April?

105
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,592
- That April?
- Yeah. How do you know her?

106
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,033
Hello?
Nikki, it's for you.

107
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:16,198
Hey, baby.
Spider spaced our shit off again.

108
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,876
If he doesn't find the shit, he'll have
to cough up another 500 bucks.

109
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:25,609
Just keep your eye on him. I don't
trust that little fag anymore. Yeah.

110
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,878
- How's my baby doing?
- I'm okay, baby.

111
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,718
I just can't wait to get back
to the room, though.

112
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,627
I can't wait to lay
a yard of dick on you, honey.

113
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,763
I love you, baby.

114
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,394
If it's the same April
I think it is...

115
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,729
...then we work together at Jiggles.

116
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,269
Yeah, same April.

117
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,774
Cool.

118
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,180
Those are nice sunglasses.
Let me try those.

119
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,980
Here.

120
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,816
You try mine.

121
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,151
They look nice on you.

122
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,690
Sometimes I wonder if Spider
really loses the shit...

123
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,768
...or if he's trying to dick us.

124
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,202
- Dick you?
- Dick my boyfriend, really.

125
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,306
You'd never dick me.

126
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,173
Would you, Ross?

127
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,113
No. No. I'm sorry.

128
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,550
- No.
- You're tense.

129
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,844
- I just want to get hooked up.
- I understand.

130
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:40,118
That really pisses me off. Spider better
find some fucking eyeballs quick.

131
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,319
You know this is the third time
he's spaced our shit off?

132
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,485
Kill, kill!

133
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,844
Did you find it? Did you find the shit?

134
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,538
That's it, man. That's it.
Everybody get out. Come on.

135
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,878
- I'll call you as soon as I figure this out.
- Ross stays.

136
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,576
Please, everybody get out.

137
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:12,281
Hold on. I just have one more monkey.
I really gotta kill this monkey.

138
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,258
If you say monkey one more time,
I'm gonna shove my hand up your ass...

139
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,454
...and shut your mouth
permanently. Got it?

140
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,496
Now get the fuck out of here.

141
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,566
- He asked me to leave...
- I know.

142
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,430
What are you doing?
He's the last one!

143
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,564
He was the last one!

144
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,743
Fine, man. I'll go to Main Street
and score my shit.

145
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,107
Yeah, get your little chicken feed.

146
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,613
I'll go to Main Street
because they have good shit.

147
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,718
You like that little chicken feed?
Is that what you want?

148
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,415
Little chicken feed, huh?

149
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,463
You're a fucking asshole!

150
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,734
Hey! Hey!
What happened?

151
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,167
Where have you been?
Did you find it?

152
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,806
- I don't know where it is!
- Why not?

153
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,442
If I did, I would have had it on me.

154
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,306
If that was the case,
wouldn't I have walked in with it?

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,076
- This is the third time you lost the shit.
- That's so fucking unfair!

156
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,084
You're always blaming me.
You always knock me down.

157
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,779
Maybe if you'd put me up,
I wouldn't be such a fuckup!

158
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,515
Fine!

159
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,789
Fucking...

160
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,159
It's okay.

161
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,494
Fucking shithead! Loser!

162
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,928
Fuck! Don't call me a loser, Cookie!

163
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,094
Loser!

164
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,574
Frisbee, sex and travel, man.
I told you to sex and travel.

165
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,182
- Take a fucking hike, you understand?
- It's me.

166
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:49,151
Oh, hey, man. Hey, man.
Look, I'm really fucking sorry, man.

167
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,586
I haven't got anything.
Why don't you just split?

168
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,488
Fucking loser. Loser! Loser!

169
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,626
Hey, baby. It's me.

170
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,824
Loser.

171
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,207
You see, your friend out there,
she said that...

172
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,536
That she could hook me up
with her own stash.

173
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,042
What is with you and Nikki?

174
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,875
If she hooks you up with some
of her own personal stash...

175
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,108
...it's not gonna be
her own personal stash.

176
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,157
Yeah. There's this guy here
named Ross, and he's got a car.

177
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,691
- What kind?
- Volvo.

178
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,658
- And what color?
- Brown.

179
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,823
Bring him by, and tell that insect
I said to chill the fuck out.

180
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,526
Spider, he says,
"Chill the fuck out!"

181
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,934
This guy's got the knowledge, man.

182
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,769
He's the man.
Few people have what this guy has.

183
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,570
He's like a gold mine.

184
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,508
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

185
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
Bye.

186
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,916
- Everything cool? Can we do this?
- Yeah. You ready?

187
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:04,257
You better get back here and fuck me,
bastard, if you want any kind of dinner!

188
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,397
You better get your skinny ass
back here!

189
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,263
I guess it's time to go
make up with Mama, huh?

190
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,332
Sounds like a good plan.

191
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,532
- You know where I live, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,049
- This one right here?
- Right. Park right over there.

193
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,781
Okay, wait right here.
I'll be right back.

194
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,560
Wait here, hon.
Don't leave.

195
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,630
Baby. Hi.

196
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,045
Hey.

197
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,579
- What's up?
- How you doing?

198
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,415
- Here's for bringing the girl back.
- Oh, shit. Thanks.

199
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,293
- She get your number?
- Yeah, I gave her my number.

200
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:13,125
- We'll call you when we need you.
- Thank you so much. You just call.

201
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,291
Bye. I'll see you later.

202
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,669
<i>Ross? It's your mother. I'm coming</i>
<i>in a couple of weeks to visit.</i>

203
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,209
<i>Call so we can make some plans,</i>
<i>okay? Love you. Bye</i>- <i>bye.</i>

204
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,364
<i>Ross? Hi, it's April.</i>
<i>I'd love to see you.</i>

205
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,027
<i>I'm dancing today.</i>
<i>Stop in if you can find the time.</i>

206
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,593
<i>Hey, it's me, Amy.</i>

207
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,131
<i>Happy belated birthday.</i>

208
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,101
<i>I didn't send you anything,</i>
<i>because you owe me $450.</i>

209
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,900
<i>Come on, Ross, you've owed</i>
<i>this to me for over a year.</i>

210
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,507
<i>Anyway, I didn't call to bitch. Just</i>
<i>to say, mail me the money, all right?</i>

211
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,579
<i>You have my address.</i>

212
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,683
<i>Come on, take care of it.</i>
<i>Take care of yourself. Bye.</i>

213
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:24,367
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave</i>
<i>a message and I'll call you back.</i>

214
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,844
Hey, baby.

215
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,448
I just love your smell, honey.

216
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,901
<i>It's April. I'd love to see you.</i>
<i>I'm dancing today...</i>

217
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,000
<i>Ross. Ross.</i>

218
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,761
<i>Ross.</i>

219
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,956
<i>Let's see you guys</i>
<i>give it up some.</i>

220
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,192
<i>There's no finer specimen</i>
<i>than the female...</i>

221
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,772
Hey. April's over at the bar.

222
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,974
- You must be holding.
- My place.

223
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,441
- Yeah?
- <i>Hey, Volvo.</i>

224
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,804
We have a little situation
here with the dog.

225
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,538
- Honey, is he coming?
- Can you...

226
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,205
- <i>... give Nikki a ride?</i>
- Yeah.

227
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,612
I'll be right over.

228
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,152
It'll take me about...
About 15 minutes.

229
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:35,317
- He's on his way.
- You better untie me if you're leaving.

230
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,058
Now, I've gotta go out
for a second.

231
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,030
Ross, you have to untie me.

232
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,398
- I don't have to untie you.
- I have to be at work.

233
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,239
I'll be back before you have to go
to work.

234
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,898
What are you doing?

235
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,875
I'm actually gonna come back
with some shit. Okay, baby?

236
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,313
You know how good
you were last night?

237
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,547
You were real good.
Shut up! Please.

238
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,954
Look at me. Look at me.

239
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,116
Okay, look.

240
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,328
Just stay here.

241
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,265
For crying out loud,
where the hell is he?

242
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,101
Just, this is really important, okay? Bye.

243
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,102
Hey, you want a little song maybe?

244
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,769
We have your favorite, okay?

245
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,882
Okay, ready?

246
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,384
I'll be back.

247
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,973
Ross, come in quick!
Get in here quick!

248
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,068
- Would you look at Taco?
- That dog's green.

249
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,476
He's dying, Ross. We have
to get him to the vet right now.

250
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:04,979
Oh, Jesus.

251
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,618
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Come on!

252
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,775
What happened?

253
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:12,947
She'll calm down. Just take the dog
to the doggy hospital.

254
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,454
Ross, come on, let's go!

255
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,563
What happened to the dog?

256
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,825
A little too much
secondhand smoke.

257
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,128
Ross? Please!

258
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,895
Maybe we should open a window.

259
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,965
Come on, motherfucker!

260
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,445
Volvo boy, just take the dog
to the damn hospital...

261
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,173
...and shut the door on your way out.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

262
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,581
- No, my baby. No, Taco.
- What was going on?

263
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,123
He's the fucking cook, okay?
He makes the shit.

264
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,454
How do you breathe in there?
I almost passed out.

265
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,291
- Could you hold Taco, please?
- Jesus Christ, Nikki!

266
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,830
You're fine. Just hold him.

267
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,026
- He smells like shit!
- I have to do a rail.

268
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,229
- On the fucking dash?
- I need to do a rail right now.

269
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,670
What the fuck am I gonna
tell the vet, Ross?

270
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,035
Okay.

271
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,494
Hi. Hi.

272
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,891
Somebody has to help him right away.

273
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,965
We'll rush him right back
to Dr. K, but first we'll need...

274
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,899
...the initial examination fee
of $54, ma'am.

275
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:37,531
I'm sorry, it's policy.
We take cash, credit cards or checks.

276
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:51,884
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave</i>
<i>a message and I'll call you back.</i>

277
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,925
Hey, Amy, it's Ross.
How are you? I'm doing really good.

278
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,330
Oh, are you the doctor? Hi.

279
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,065
Hi, thank God.

280
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,105
- Dr. K, this is...
- Taco.

281
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,502
- Here. Can you just...?
- So. So, so, so, so...

282
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,038
I got a job...

283
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,913
...and I'm... I'm working for a chemist.

284
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,915
And he's working me really hard,
and I haven't slept.

285
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:25,588
- What seems to be the problem?
- I really don't know.

286
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,927
I need you to call me when you get this.
I really need you to call me, okay?

287
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:34,430
Can you please fix him?
Because I'm really worried, okay?

288
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,235
- We'll just keep him overnight.
- Thank you.

289
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,633
Okay, I love you.
Okay, bye. It's Ross.

290
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,540
- Okay. Oh, I love you too, baby. Bye.
- We'll keep him overnight.

291
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,978
Sorry. Thank you. Have a good day!

292
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,399
Frisbee, honey?

293
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,911
Sweetie? Could you come
get me something to eat?

294
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,110
Do you hear me? Frisbee, honey?

295
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,957
Frisbee, honey, what are you doing?
Could you get Mommy a soda?

296
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,522
When I get back, there better be
a joint in my drawer.

297
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,658
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

298
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,012
It's Ross, honey. Let him in!

299
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,144
- Honey?
- What?

300
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,481
Turn the fucking music down, please!

301
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:13,861
It's Ross. Turn down the fucking music
and let... Never mind.

302
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,564
- Never mind!
- What?!

303
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,441
You don't even give a flying fuck
about Taco, do you?

304
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,512
Asshole.

305
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,676
How'd it go?

306
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,818
Vet said he wants to keep
the dog overnight.

307
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,046
Didn't look very good.
You should really open a window.

308
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,416
- Yeah?
- Did you touch her?

309
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,391
What do you mean?

310
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,891
- You know goddamn well what I mean.
- No, I don't.

311
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,431
She got a nice-looking body,
doesn't she?

312
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,797
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

313
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,598
You know goddamn well...

314
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,502
- Okay.
...what I'm talking about.

315
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,680
Hey, look at this.
Wow, look at this shit.

316
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,545
Goddamn! Look at this.

317
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:11,188
Look at it. Damn, look at that.
Look at this part right here.

318
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,950
Look at that. That's cruel shit.
Look at that shit, man.

319
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,590
Actually, maybe the road stops here.
I can't give you that ride.

320
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,823
I need a ride.

321
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,198
Ross has gotta run me down
to the truck stop.

322
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,702
Maybe take a cab. Here.

323
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,371
I'll take a cab.

324
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,068
Goddamn, baby, you look hot.

325
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,905
What do you care?

326
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,748
Baby!

327
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:46,655
- She's a fine-looking woman, huh?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, great.

328
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,349
No, I mean... Hey, it's cool.

329
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:58,764
- What do we need at the truck stop?
- I gotta get some ingredients.

330
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,857
So anyway, I heard that he was
carrying some of these fixings...

331
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:23,323
...for that metalphetamine stuff,
whatever the hell they call it.

332
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,292
Goddamn druggies!

333
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,489
I mean, I was never into that.
I can't understand how they do that.

334
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,328
But anyway,
so he was traveling down I-5...

335
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,767
...and he was probably speeding.
He usually was.

336
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,168
He's going too fast,
and then, all of a sudden...

337
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,639
...after this big curve,
you just couldn't find him.

338
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,802
I mean, he's just off on the road
and everything...

339
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,175
...and it was so dark,
and so I heard...

340
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,681
...that they followed the sound
of his music.

341
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,819
From the radio.
It was playing so loud...

342
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,650
...and he was just pacing back and forth
and pacing back and forth, and...

343
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,156
And he was just gushing with blood.

344
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,627
- But he said he was okay...
- Lady, got any more of these fuckers?

345
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,197
Oh, yeah. We got...
They sell like crazy.

346
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,960
We always keep an extra case
stashed under here.

347
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,333
Now I gotta order another one.

348
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:13,239
I'm new. If you could just hold on,
I got to designate me a reorder.

349
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,072
What are you gonna do
with all those?

350
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,278
Lady, how much do I owe you?

351
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,445
$ 135.

352
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,555
What do you need all those for?

353
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,257
Well, I was thinking maybe
I'd take a little trip to Russia.

354
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:33,591
They don't sell them over there,
and they got a little emergency going.

355
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,995
A lot of tired drivers, you know?

356
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,601
Do their thing, you know?
So I thought I'd be a nice guy and just...

357
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,404
That all right with you?

358
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,100
That's a nice Christian thing to do.

359
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,711
- You have a real good day.
- You have a real good day too.

360
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,347
Bye.

361
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,278
That's a dollar.

362
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,385
Thank you. Have a good day.

363
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,906
Did we get enough ingredients?

364
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:29,078
It's never enough.
It's enough to get back to work.

365
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,619
What's the longest you've
ever stayed up on this shit?

366
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,821
- About 11, I don't know, 12, 13 days.
- Fuck, man.

367
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,228
- That's it.
- That's a lot of days.

368
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,898
- Do you shave your balls?
- Let's go by the market.

369
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,970
I wanna get some beer.

370
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:55,613
I told you bitches how many times?

371
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:56,739
I told you bitches how many times?

372
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,884
I'll cut one of your tits off.
You go to Spider Mike's...

373
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,019
...you'll wish you never fucked with me.

374
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,517
Spider Mike's shit sucks.

375
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,054
White boys don't know how
to cook that shit.

376
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,355
Angel, we looked everywhere
for your nowhere ass.

377
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,825
We had to go to that
Wonder Bread's house.

378
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,486
He wasn't holding nothing.

379
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,822
He wouldn't even open
the fucking door.

380
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,833
- You know where I hang.
- All right, we won't go there.

381
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,971
- Just leave.
- Yeah, get out of here.

382
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,697
I'll cut Spider Mike
if I catch you in his place.

383
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,436
You better go. You better get out,
or I'm gonna call the cops!

384
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,341
- We're gonna call the fucking cops.
- Okay, okay. I'm going. I'm going.

385
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,549
- I forgot something.
- No.

386
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,879
Come here for a second.

387
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:37,952
- Come here for a second.
- No.

388
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,612
Something I gotta tell you.

389
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,420
You're lucky that's all I do!

390
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,859
Hey, <i>Seòor el</i> Fucking <i>Camino.</i>

391
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,857
Who the fuck are you?

392
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,913
Goddamn.

393
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,643
You all got any Cools?

394
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,149
Give me a pack of Cools.

395
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,221
I'll take the beer. Got any
sunglasses in the lost and found?

396
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,721
- Here.
- What do I owe you?

397
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,416
Take them quick before
his posse comes.

398
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,998
- Sexy cowboy.
- All right. Thanks.

399
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,657
- Take it. Take care.
- You all have a good one.

400
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,270
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Sexy.

401
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,032
- Bye.
- Bye.

402
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,123
So how many more stops
we have to make?

403
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,425
We gotta go to the porn shop.
Get some fuck videos.

404
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,236
I just really need to make
a phone call at some point.

405
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,933
Just keep driving, lover-boy.

406
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:50,719
All right, look for videos that got
blond chicks with long hair...

407
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,880
...big titties and small asses.

408
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:59,018
And the small ass, man, that takes
priority. Unless the tits are perfect.

409
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:03,657
If the tits are perfect,
then we go with the tits.

410
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,299
- How about this one?
- No, man.

411
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:10,066
That's the perfect example
of what I don't like. You see that?

412
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,972
That's a loose ass. There's nothing
I hate more than a loose ass.

413
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:23,719
You know I take the p<i>****</i>
seriously. Let me tell you.

414
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:30,088
You gotta take the p<i>****</i> seriously.
I mean, there's a priority for a tight ass.

415
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:34,891
But if it's hairy, I go for the tits.

416
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:39,826
But if the tits are hairy,
hey, it's right back to the p<i>****</i>.

417
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,869
But you've gotta speak
to that p<i>****</i>, son.

418
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,669
You know, really talk to it.
You make a vow to it.

419
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,510
Now, no nation has
ever been so ready...

420
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:56,551
...to seize the power and the
freedom of the p<i>****</i> as our own...

421
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:00,248
...and we must all care for that p<i>****</i>.

422
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:05,225
Today, we do more
than just celebrate the p<i>****</i>.

423
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,991
We re-dedicate ourselves
to the very idea of p<i>****</i>.

424
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:15,269
I mean, friends, ask not
what the p<i>****</i> can do for you...

425
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,135
...but what can you do for the p<i>****</i>.

426
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,642
Ain't that right, Volvo?

427
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,687
Here we go.

428
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:37,024
This is a long one.
This one's got bonus scenes.

429
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:43,524
Hundred and twelve girls,
522 penetrations.

430
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,068
Chinese guys with huge cocks,
chicks with dicks.

431
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,207
Now, hey, that's a fucking video.

432
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,207
Hey, buddy boy.

433
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,111
How much for the masterpiece?

434
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,647
$29.99.

435
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,882
- Want a bag?
- Whatever.

436
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,892
Have a good one.

437
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,197
We need a phone.
I need to make a fucking call.

438
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,172
- Come on. Use the phone at the club.
- We're going to the club?

439
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,417
What do you think?
We got the right place?

440
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,287
Man, I don't know. You're driving.
You got the directions.

441
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,162
Stop bitching about that.

442
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,301
- I'm sorry.
- Just quit riding me, old man.

443
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,100
- I'm not fucking old.
- Just don't make me look bad...

444
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,210
...with this camera crew, all right?
- <i>Hey, remember...</i>

445
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,176
<i>... we're on a live feed.</i>

446
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,714
Guys, we're gonna hold off
for a couple of minutes.

447
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,961
<i>Real cops. Real people.</i>
<i>Real trouble.</i>

448
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,632
Looks like we got our guy here.

449
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,035
All right. We got him.

450
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,047
Hang on.

451
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,608
Is that the chef?

452
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,620
She doesn't fit the description.
I think it's the fucker on the bike.

453
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,654
It doesn't matter.

454
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,889
- Yeah, guys.
- <i>Hey.</i>

455
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,259
- We gotta move in.
- <i>We're right behind you.</i>

456
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,239
- We received several tips.
- And numerous phone calls.

457
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,780
We believe that a large amount
of methamphetamine is being...

458
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,714
...manufactured at this residence.
- At this location.

459
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,184
- We gotta move in.
- Come on. Come on.

460
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,216
- Open the goddamn door. Come on.
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

461
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,453
- Get the fuck down!
- Bitch! Bitch!

462
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:03,965
Hands on top of that motherfucking
mullet now! Drop the cheese puffs!

463
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,598
- He's over here!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

464
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,333
Freeze! Shit! Fuck.

465
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:17,069
- Fucking shit, man.
- Up in the air! Up in the fucking air!

466
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,308
Don't you look at me!
Don't you fucking look at me!

467
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,955
I gotta make that call.

468
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,428
Beer.

469
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,608
Nikki is her name, sex is her game.

470
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,646
To not put your hand in your pocket
and get some dollars...

471
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,410
...and take a lap dance
would be a great shame.

472
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,220
Let's hear it for Nikki.

473
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:19,336
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave</i>
<i>a message and I'll call you back.</i>

474
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,087
<i>Hey, it's Ross. I'm out.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

475
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,663
Hey, April, it's Ross.
April, I know you can hear me.

476
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,063
I'm so sorry I forgot about you.

477
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,603
<i>I'm here right now at the club.</i>
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

478
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,366
Hang tight, baby.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

479
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,074
Fuck!

480
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,845
- Ross, thank you.
- No problem, Nikki.

481
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,149
- Bye.
- See you.

482
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,452
Okay, Volvo boy,
I've gotta get back to the office.

483
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,425
So Nikki'll call you when we need you.

484
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,225
Have a good night.
Have a good one.

485
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,033
Bye.

486
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,704
Bye, guys.

487
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,146
I'm sorry. I know I fucked up.

488
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,621
Look, baby, please
don't be pissed, okay?

489
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:54,020
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

490
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:58,897
I got caught up, and it took much longer
than I thought it would. I apologize.

491
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,039
I'm gonna take this off. Will you
please not yell? Will you please not yell?

492
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,668
- I'm gonna talk to you.
- You motherfucker!

493
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:10,302
You have no idea
what I've been going through!

494
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:15,248
You've no idea where I've been. I've
been alone. Will you listen to me?

495
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,011
No crying, no cry...

496
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:22,255
- I lost $200 because of you.
- Please be quiet. Now.

497
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,362
- Hey, smurf.
- Hi.

498
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,692
- What's going on?
- I'm watching television.

499
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,598
- I'm sorry I kept it on so loud.
- Pretty funny show, yeah.

500
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:38,868
It's pretty cool. Check it out. It's on
Channel 4. I'll see you later. Bye.

501
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,148
What's the plan, Stan?

502
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,087
What am I thinking?

503
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:58,718
- Honey, you don't have a plan.
- No, I got a goddamned plan.

504
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,759
First we're gonna get this batch
over to Spider.

505
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:06,892
Then we're gonna get our money.
Then I'll pick up your little dog...

506
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:11,096
...and then I'm gonna fuck
your little ass proper.

507
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,410
- His name is Taco.
- Who?

508
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,877
And you bet your ass
we're gonna pick him up.

509
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,339
Yeah, hey. You got any girls?

510
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:50,538
Listen, they gotta have nice titties,
nice big titties. Small ass.

511
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,477
- <i>It's for the motel, right?</i>
- Yeah.

512
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,378
- <i>We've got one for you.</i>
- All right.

513
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,848
<i>You got it.</i>

514
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,129
Tag!

515
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,864
- You're it, partner.
- Tag?

516
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,863
Like the game you used to play
when you were a little kid.

517
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,334
It's easy.

518
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,378
- It's your turn to tag somebody now.
- Tag?

519
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,344
We need two names from you.

520
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,007
Then we will go easy on you
and your mother.

521
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,812
- My mother?
- Lf you agree to help us...

522
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,685
...she'll be in front of her television
by cocktail hour, okay?

523
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,292
- Cocktail hour?
- Fucking echo going on in here.

524
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,452
- Do you hear it?
- You gotta help us now!

525
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,961
Okay, partner?

526
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,292
You gotta play the game!

527
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,662
- Understand?
- Look, look, look, look.

528
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:49,499
It's not even my shit.
It's not my shit. It's my mom's shit.

529
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:52,073
- I'm holding it for my mom.
- Come on, Frisbee.

530
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,869
You ain't working
with us here, dude.

531
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,313
Look, we've confiscated your bike,
okay? We've got your porn, your...

532
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,315
- Fucking CDs.
- Your music.

533
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,216
- You ain't got a job.
- You'll never get your stuff back...

534
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:10,757
Unless you cooperate and...

535
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:15,324
- Play the game.
- The game?

536
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,533
The fucker drives a fucking Lexus.
He's not gonna ride my ass for free.

537
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:21,903
The fucker drives a fucking Lexus.
He's not gonna ride my ass for free.

538
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:25,940
Get your shit together, or I'm going
to Dial-A-Bun! No, you listen to me!

539
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:30,739
Why don't you fucking listen to me?
I want my cash up-fucking-front!

540
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:34,017
Honey? Did you order over
some bimbo bitch?

541
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,244
- She's at the door.
- Just open the goddamned door.

542
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,750
- Damn.
- You were right.

543
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:44,360
I was totally stressed out about Taco.

544
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,861
I'm thinking maybe we could
try out the new batch...

545
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:54,026
...and get a little nasty.
- That's my girl. Come over here.

546
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,035
Do you know I have a really bad...?

547
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,300
Look at that onion, baby.

548
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,077
- Get the goddamned door.
- I am.

549
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:07,274
No cash or no fucking ass, all right?
Now get your shit together.

550
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,477
Hold on. You know, I have a really
bad yeast infection.

551
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,383
I'm still fucking working, okay?

552
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,148
Hold on.

553
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,258
Are you gonna let me in?

554
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,786
Honey, what the fuck
are you looking at?

555
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,625
Your fucking whore-bitch face, bitch!

556
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,934
Fuck! You know what?
I'm not doing it.

557
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,436
I just got a fucking door
slammed in my face, all right?

558
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,645
Goddamn.

559
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:42,483
- What's the problem?
- You don't give a fuck about Taco.

560
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,780
And you sure don't
give a fuck about me.

561
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,952
All you care about is
your stupid, precious batch of fuck.

562
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:54,521
And maybe, just maybe, getting your
fucking rocks off every now and then.

563
00:48:54,698 --> 00:49:00,466
Goddamn it, don't start in with
your psycho bullshit here, all right?

564
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:04,437
You wanna go back to Las Vegas with
them Gucci-wearing motherfuckers?

565
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:08,099
- You want me to go to Vegas?
- I don't give a fuck. Go to Florida...

566
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,508
...with them rich sugar daddies
of yours.

567
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:14,742
Just get your little white ass
and get the fuck out of my face!

568
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,252
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you. Go back to your mother.

569
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,480
That fucking c<i>***</i>.

570
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:23,558
I'd rather be anywhere in the whole
fucking world other than this room...

571
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,458
...waiting for you to blow up the
whole goddamned place! Fuck you!

572
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,962
Fuck you!

573
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,465
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I can't stand this shit anymore!

574
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,967
I can't believe you...

575
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:38,369
...called a bitch up here, ordered her
up like a goddamned piece of pizza!

576
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,203
Goddamn it, it was for you!

577
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,139
Fucking did it for me?

578
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,338
- What'd she look like anyway?
- Fuck you!

579
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,188
- Hello?
- Hey, Volvo boy, I need another ride.

580
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,521
I don't know. What do you need?

581
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:03,223
The shit hit the fan over here
pretty good. Can you get over here now?

582
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,834
- How soon?
- I need you now!

583
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,808
Are you leaving?

584
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,110
- I gotta go.
- Ross, untie me, please.

585
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:23,946
- No, no, no.
- No.

586
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:27,355
I'll be right back. I wouldn't hurt you.

587
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:31,551
April, now just calm down, okay?
You know I wouldn't hurt you.

588
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,764
They need me again.

589
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,568
I'll be right back. Do you hear me?

590
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,305
Stop it!

591
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:49,069
I'll be right back. I don't wanna do
this. I have to do this, okay? Fuck!

592
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:04,384
- Did Ross say how long he'll be?
- Hopefully soon.

593
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,851
I can't wait for him
to get his ass out here.

594
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,425
So I guess...

595
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,957
...it's over. We're finished.

596
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,566
We're through, right?

597
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,599
Well, you might be through.
I ain't never through.

598
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,670
Bye.

599
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:32,940
- Bye? Where are you going?
- I'll be in the car.

600
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,580
Where's she going?

601
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,956
- She's going wherever you take her.
- Wherever I take her?

602
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,117
Run this over to Spider.

603
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,993
Take her, please, wherever the fuck
she wants to go.

604
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,793
- What the fuck's going on around here?
- Nikki can't handle her shit.

605
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,870
She's been partying
with the candy for 10, 11 days.

606
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,101
And then the bitch crashes
and starts freaking out.

607
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:05,240
She'll split for a day or two, then
she'll come back. She's just spun.

608
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,678
This is for you.

609
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,788
This is the Hawaii.

610
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,422
So I gotta pop by Spider's
and drop this shit off.

611
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:25,193
You can either come with or I could
take you somewhere, whatever is best.

612
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,233
It's that fucking bastard.

613
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,895
How can somebody
be such a selfish, insensitive...

614
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,200
...fucking motherfucking bastard?

615
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,138
He never cared about anything!

616
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,973
The only time he was nice to me
was when I first met him.

617
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,274
When, of course,
I've never done speed before.

618
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,576
And he was nice
to Taco to boot, okay?

619
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,912
Fucking fuck-face fucker.

620
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,262
It's Nikki and Ross.

621
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,005
Hey, come on in. Come on.

622
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,646
- Got something for me?
- Yeah.

623
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,145
Why did Taco have to go to the vet?

624
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,310
So how is he doing?

625
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,923
- I mean, he didn't die?
- Fuck, no!

626
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:26,127
- Come on, come on. Come on, man!
- Okay, Spider, this is it.

627
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:31,025
- He'll be all right, right?
- Right. He'll be fine.

628
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,294
He's gonna be great.
He is.

629
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,540
- Here you go, all you.
- All me?

630
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,780
I'm hoping Ross brings me
to the vet in the morning.

631
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,316
Then everything's gonna be
just perfect.

632
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,781
- That's good.
- Good shit, huh?

633
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,983
Goddamn!

634
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:12,665
Looks like the peanut-butter dank
we used to get back in the day, man.

635
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,310
What's the real deal between you
and Nikki? What's she doing with you?

636
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,346
So why are you with Ross?

637
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,951
- It's too hot.
- Because I have a car.

638
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,114
- I've been helping her out with my car.
- He brings me places.

639
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,284
- Special stuff I left behind.
- Helping her out, taking her around.

640
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:35,158
- He wants to drive me around.
- Yesterday, the dog got sick.

641
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,321
It was fucked up.

642
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,730
The dog got sick, but we got that
cleared up. I've been going ride...

643
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:43,430
Going on rides with him
and helping him out. I just...

644
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,065
Oh, shit, Cookie!

645
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,207
Don't. No, no, no.

646
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,779
Don't do that.
Don't smoke it like that.

647
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,381
It gives you Alzheimer's, doesn't it?

648
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,778
Give her a ride in my car,
and I'm gonna run errands.

649
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,012
Just came here to...

650
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,319
Right now I'm on my way
to the bus stop...

651
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,962
Yeah, yeah, I understand, man.

652
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,290
I understand. Yeah.

653
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,302
Amy.

654
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:23,507
- I just thought maybe we could...
- Really? Oh, come on.

655
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,279
You know I hate fucking hippies, man.

656
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,111
You know why I hate hippies?
Because I was downtown...

657
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:34,052
...and this kid just comes running out
and gets hit by a bus, right?

658
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,284
And the bus just crushes him
and crushes him...

659
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,395
...and runs over him, and the kid's
just squiggling on the ground.

660
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,489
Amy.

661
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,936
And blood is coming out of his ears,
and he's just laying there...

662
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,869
...and then this hippie dyke chick
comes out with crystal...

663
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,531
...and she rubs it all over him.

664
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,439
I wish that I had more energy.

665
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,901
Amy.

666
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,016
And the kid is just laying there,
and he's choking on his own blood.

667
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,311
It's like, "Come on,
you dumb, stupid chick.

668
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:06,148
What are you doing with your crystals?
He needs a doctor."

669
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:09,519
- I wish I could sleep forever, man.
- I wish. I wish.

670
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:14,190
You know, I've seen some crystals
do some pretty trippy shit, man.

671
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,298
Really?

672
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,358
I was out with one of my girlfriends
once in Vegas...

673
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:20,901
Amy.

674
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,340
And we were hanging out,
and we picked this guy up.

675
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,408
I think he was a Mexican.

676
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,374
I wish I was black.

677
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,173
And we both fucked him.

678
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,371
Amy.

679
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,016
Anyways...

680
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,448
...she got crabs really bad.

681
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:42,051
And I was wearing this crystal around my
neck all night long, and I never got them.

682
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,954
- Magic crystals.
- Amy.

683
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,453
No, Nikki, Nikki.
What happened was...

684
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:52,325
...that your friend fucked him first,
and the crabs jumped onto her bush...

685
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:56,336
...before they got a chance to get
onto yours. That's what happened.

686
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,667
You got lucky you got sloppy seconds.

687
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:04,179
There's no such thing as
magic-crystal-hippie-crap bullshit.

688
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:08,973
Ross?

689
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,312
Ross?

690
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,785
Did you ever get crabs, Ross?

691
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,548
Amy.

692
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,991
Amy.

693
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,626
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you.

694
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,125
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

695
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,389
- Just... One... Wait.
- Okay.

696
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,126
- Ross, I'm ready.
- I gotta make a phone call.

697
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:01,361
Spider, do you think I can make
a phone call, use your phone?

698
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:05,103
There's no phone. No phones, man.
We don't have a phone. Doesn't work.

699
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,572
- Okay.
- Come here, you.

700
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,575
Oh, God.

701
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,576
Boy, I'm really hammered.

702
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,578
- I'll see you soon.
- See you real soon.

703
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,115
- Take good care of her, okay?
- I will. Definitely.

704
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,161
I don't know, guys. This...
It looks really obvious.

705
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,127
This thing pokes out right here
and everything. I don't...

706
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,096
They're gonna notice something.

707
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:34,134
Hey, Frisbee, don't worry.

708
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,994
Cookie, I'll call you.

709
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,573
Weetis. I love it.

710
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,576
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you too, man.

711
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,577
- Great.
- I hope he's okay.

712
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,816
All you gotta do
is keep your clothes on.

713
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,351
I mean, we're working
together on this. All right?

714
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,485
It's fine, pal.

715
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,885
Hey, hey. Hold on. Hold on.

716
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:02,231
We got two suspects
leaving the premises.

717
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,430
Hey, Frisbee...

718
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,660
...is that Spider Mike
and what is it, Cookie?

719
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,428
That?

720
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:14,006
No, no. I don't know them.
I mean, I don't know who they are.

721
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:19,080
- You wouldn't tell us a story, would you?
- No, no, no, no.

722
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,375
It's okay. I'm not lying.
No, I don't...

723
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:26,386
- lf you lie, you lose.
- Yeah. If you lie, pal, it's game over.

724
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,989
I don't know those people.
I don't know who they are.

725
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,684
Get the license plate.
They just took off.

726
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:36,657
No, you don't need to get the license
plate. It's all right. It's okay.

727
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:40,769
Frisbee, all you fucking gotta do
is keep your clothes on...

728
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,905
...and everything is gonna be just fine.

729
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:47,298
You just go in there like
nothing's changed, you hang out...

730
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:51,038
...you make a buy, you just walk out.
It's easy as that, chief.

731
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,648
No. You don't know Spider. He's...

732
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,979
- Fuck! This isn't gonna work!
- Give me your hand.

733
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,480
Give me your hand.

734
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,882
Chill. Just chill. Yeah.

735
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,522
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

736
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,992
That's power.

737
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,760
- We got your back.
- You're doing the right thing.

738
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,025
We're proud of you.

739
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,870
You're not gonna try
to take a dump now, are you?

740
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,440
I feel like I can finally go.

741
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,407
It's been so long
since I've taken a dump.

742
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:25,046
Jesus Christ, come on!

743
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:29,109
Come on, I haven't been this hard
in a long time. Come on!

744
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:33,210
Fucker.

745
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:56,404
<i>Hello?</i>

746
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,444
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yeah, hello.

747
01:01:58,614 --> 01:01:59,876
Yeah.

748
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,418
Can you just help me come
really fast?

749
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,216
What? You want me
to put something on?

750
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,489
All right.

751
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,790
Let me see what I got here.

752
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,899
Yeah, I think I got something.

753
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,435
I got something perfect.

754
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:27,008
I got something that's gonna be clean
and practical. You're gonna like this.

755
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:37,377
Jesus Christ, come on!
Put your mouth on it.

756
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:40,181
I'm gonna put my man-glaze
all over your f<i>******</i>.

757
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:47,059
- What is he doing? Jesus!
- <i>You guys can hear me, right?</i>

758
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,425
<i>Can I hear you back?</i>
<i>I can't hear anything.</i>

759
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,466
Don't look at the car all the time.
Just go in.

760
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:55,900
- Oh, Christ!
- Jesus! What the fuck is he doing, man?

761
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,498
<i>I'm okay.</i>

762
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,305
Oh, yeah. Come on, lick my ass.
Come on.

763
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,970
Oh, fuck.

764
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,211
God!

765
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,026
Baby, come on.
Come on, don't be mad.

766
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,965
- <i>You've got me so wet.</i>
- Yeah, come on, baby.

767
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,265
Come on, baby.
Come on, open up the door!

768
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,567
I'll let you lick me where I pee.

769
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,403
Oh, yeah, do it.

770
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,677
I'm gonna f<i>***</i>!

771
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,977
- Oh, fuck!
- Who are you talking to?

772
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,711
Oh, goddamn!
Oh, you're so f<i>******</i>.

773
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,548
- Are you on the phone?
- Oh, shit!

774
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,883
What the fuck is he doing?

775
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,360
Oh, yeah. Come on, take it, baby!

776
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,756
What the hell is he doing?
Quit looking at us.

777
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,103
Open the fucking door!

778
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:05,069
<i>You can hear me? Yeah?</i>

779
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,209
- Is he stupid?
- Yeah.

780
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,434
I'm going to knock.

781
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,068
I can't do this.

782
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:14,046
Get inside the house!

783
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,714
Okay. Okay.

784
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,083
Is Spider here?

785
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,319
Come in.

786
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,929
- Come on.
- I'm in.

787
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,964
F<i>***</i> me. F<i>***</i> me. F<i>***</i> me.

788
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,260
How you doing, Frisbee?

789
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,727
Come on.

790
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,064
Sit right down. Sit down.

791
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,899
- Oh, you look so good!
- I do?

792
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:44,407
- <i>Shit! Fuck! I'm coming!</i>
- Come for me, baby.

793
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,480
Yeah, baby. Fuck, I'm gonna come.

794
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,709
- Come on, fuck me! Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?

795
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,582
- Come on, do it to me. Do it to me.
- <i>Come on, say my name!</i>

796
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:55,121
Come on, say my name. Yeah!

797
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,725
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no. I...

798
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:00,094
- <i>I was</i>... <i>I should see Spider.</i>
- Frisbee?

799
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,252
Hello?

800
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,921
He's fucking this up. Come on!

801
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:05,964
You step away from her.

802
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,429
Don't I turn you on, huh?

803
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,768
- Come on, take me. Yeah!
- Cookie! What the fuck?

804
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,570
No. I'm going to...
I should talk to Spider.

805
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,905
What the fuck is that?

806
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,546
- <i>It's nothing.</i>
- God, he's fucked!

807
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:22,281
- God!
- What's wrong with your piece? Relax.

808
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,352
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck? Michael!

809
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,756
- What the fuck?
- Hello?

810
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,023
- It's my new Walkman.
- What is that?

811
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,753
- It's just my new Walkman.
- Fuck!

812
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,990
- You cheating little shit!
- Hello?

813
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,633
Where are the cops, Frisbee?

814
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,827
Trying to steal my girlfriend?
Is that what you're trying to do?

815
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,869
Michael! What the fuck
are you wearing?

816
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,439
- Shut up!
- Help!

817
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,906
- Get the fuck in here!
- You got a wire on you, man?

818
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:49,305
You bringing the cops here?

819
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,139
This is where we go in!

820
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,879
- All right, I just...
- Hold on.

821
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,606
The fuck...

822
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,147
- What the fuck was that?
- What the fuck is that?

823
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:05,451
Oh, my God, it's the cops!
They're coming!

824
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:30,641
- How can you do this to us, man?
- Put the fucking gun down, man.

825
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,721
Move your hand from your fucking balls.
I'm gonna shoot one ball!

826
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,255
I'm gonna take one of your balls.
Let me get one. Come on!

827
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,756
No! Put the gun down, man!

828
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,857
Let me get one of your balls!
Come on!

829
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,260
Holy shit!

830
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,497
Shit! That's gotta hurt, man!

831
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,503
Freeze! Don't fucking move!

832
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,608
I didn't shoot him.
I didn't shoot him.

833
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:55,866
God!

834
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,111
Shut your mouth,
and keep your hands in the air.

835
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,948
- What the fuck are you wearing, man?
- You fucking shot me!

836
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,311
- Now, that's gotta hurt.
- Fuck!

837
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,548
I hope you die, you fuck!

838
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:10,217
You shut the fuck up!

839
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,149
I'm sorry.

840
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:02,901
Hey, honey, you're back for me,
aren't you?

841
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,146
Fuck you, pussy boy.

842
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,798
Fucking asshole!

843
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,846
Come on, man, let me put
my clothes on. Come on, you fuck.

844
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:43,845
Fuck your cornholio good,
you fucking scummy asshole!

845
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,817
I'm gonna fucking die!

846
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,217
Okay, yeah, right, no.
I just got word.

847
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:52,326
There's a hotel room of the Las Palmas,
it's up in flames.

848
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:54,554
They got the perp at a porno shop.

849
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,624
I can't feel my legs!

850
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,334
Who the fuck is that freak
down at the Las Palmas Motel?

851
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,870
I'm cold, man.

852
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:09,207
I'm talking to you. Who the fuck
is that freak down at the motel?

853
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,810
- I don't fucking know.
- Take your fucking hands off me!

854
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,781
All right, cover me.

855
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,957
Hey, I love you, man.

856
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,862
Fucking pigs!

857
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,932
I'm so burned...

858
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,162
...I can't close my eyes.

859
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,862
I take little naps...

860
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:42,276
...like 10 to 15 minutes.
Just, like, a little shutdown time.

861
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,674
I mean, I still don't ever sleep, but...

862
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,577
- That works for you?
- Helps a little bit. Yeah.

863
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:52,813
- So where are you going anyway?
- I'm going down. Down to Vegas.

864
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:57,422
- I got, like, friends and family there.
- That's good.

865
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,871
He's in the back.

866
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,587
Oh, goddamn.

867
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,989
Getting fucked in a porn shop.

868
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:46,668
<i>I'm going to see my son.</i>
<i>My son, my son, my son.</i>

869
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,276
I'm going to see my son.

870
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:50,667
Jacob.

871
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,076
I'm going to see my son, Jacob.

872
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,242
Your what? You have a son?

873
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,848
- Here. You want a little bit right now?
- Yeah, yeah.

874
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,251
Here, here.

875
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:06,655
Yeah! Wide awake!

876
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,594
Where's the kid?
Is he with your mom?

877
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,562
He's 3 years old.

878
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:15,135
He doesn't live with my mom,
because my mom's a fucking c<i>***</i>.

879
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:18,868
- You'll be okay, Nikki. You'll be cool.
- You think so?

880
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:19,939
Yeah, man.

881
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:31,184
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be okay.

882
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:32,479
You're gonna be okay.

883
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,181
The state took him away.

884
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,849
It's weird because stuff happens, and
you don't notice it while it's happening.

885
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,791
Life is sort of passing by.

886
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,204
I held him once.

887
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,739
I held him once.

888
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,910
Yeah, he felt so nice in my arms.

889
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,842
And then they took him away.

890
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,709
I'm gonna hold him again.
I'm gonna hold him real tight.

891
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:04,250
I'm gonna hold him
so tight that no one...

892
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,285
...could take him away
from me ever again.

893
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,916
Hey, Volvo, bring on your balls.

894
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:16,291
<i>You said you'd take care of this.</i>
<i>I really need the money.</i>

895
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,330
<i>Take care of it.</i>
<i>Take care of it.</i>

896
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,832
You know what's cool?
My girlfriend, Amy, and I...

897
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,995
...we're so attracted to each other,
so in love with each other...

898
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,640
...and she really misses me.

899
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,867
I can tell from the voice
on her answering machine.

900
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,238
She really misses me,
and I love her so much.

901
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,107
It's really great.
We're so attracted to each other.

902
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:35,672
Amy, I love you!

903
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,414
I'm gonna be a really great mother.
You think...?

904
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,187
You sick motherfucker!
Sick! Sick! Sick!

905
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,089
You know my girlfriend?
I miss my girlfriend, Amy, so much.

906
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,455
So...

907
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,731
- Amy's the best.
- I'm gonna be a great mom.

908
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,426
I'm gonna be the greatest mom...

909
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:59,065
Amy and I are so good together.

910
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,443
Wide awake.

911
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,580
- Do you want a little bit?
- Yeah, yeah.

912
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:07,841
I need another line.

913
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:09,950
- You know what the best part is?
- What?

914
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,578
- I'm not hooked.
- I know.

915
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,287
I can stop at any time.

916
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,223
<i>Everything's gonna be wonderful.</i>

917
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,656
I am so excited.

918
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:46,312
Hey, you got busted like a bitch, boy.

919
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,683
I'm not Spider Mike right now, okay?

920
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:52,523
I shot him in the balls, though, huh?
How about that?

921
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:56,061
I shot him right in the balls,
that Judas fucking bastard, man.

922
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:59,064
You bring people into your circle,
bring them into your house...

923
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,168
...and they walk all over you, right?

924
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,165
- Not like you. You're my friend, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, whatever.

925
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,332
Well, someone must like you,
you lucky son of a bitch.

926
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,842
Let's go.

927
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,311
- Cop, you're gonna let me out too, right?
- Oh, sure.

928
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,483
What do you mean, "Yeah, sure"?

929
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,854
- Cook, come on, get me out, man.
- See you later, cockroach.

930
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,957
Come on, Cook. Come on, man.

931
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,288
We're friends. Don't leave me here.
Cook, come on.

932
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:30,061
Yeah, well, thanks. Thanks a lot,
you fucking old bastard.

933
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:31,722
Piece of shit.

934
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,391
What about me, man?
Nobody thinks about me, right?

935
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,073
You tied her up?

936
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,076
I can't believe it.

937
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,512
- How long?
- Four days.

938
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:47,808
- What?
- I don't know.

939
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,315
No, maybe...
It was maybe three days. Three...

940
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,546
Four days. Fuck!
I don't know! Fuck!

941
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:57,556
I've heard some cruel shit in my day,
but that is some pretty fucked up shit.

942
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:58,715
I know.

943
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,419
- I thought you were a normal guy.
- I am a normal guy.

944
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,087
No.

945
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,907
Hey, look! Look, girl, it's that guy.
Check him out.

946
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:20,944
- He looks like shit!
- No way, girl. He looks nice.

947
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:24,313
Listen, man, I want to thank you
for bailing me out.

948
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,545
Don't mention it, and I mean that.

949
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,917
So where are you at?
What are you doing?

950
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:32,083
<i>I'm a couple hours south of you.</i>
<i>I'm on my way now.</i>

951
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,692
You like him, don't you?

952
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:38,633
I turned another goddamned
motel into an ashtray.

953
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,470
Barbecued it, huh? Attaboy!

954
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,000
So, what's this?

955
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:51,134
You're on your way?
Is this my two hours' notice?

956
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,762
- April?
- Ross, where's Nikki?

957
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,239
I dropped her off at the bus station
about a half-hour ago.

958
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,777
She's probably halfway
to Vegas or something.

959
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,845
Good. We need to take a ride.

960
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:30,246
Fuck, man, I can't do that right now.
My room's fucked. I haven't slept...

961
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,616
You need a ride somewhere,
asshole? Well, you know what?

962
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,484
<i>Ross is giving me a ride today.</i>

963
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:39,115
Okay? We're gonna go to the bus
station, we're gonna pick up Taco.

964
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:42,627
Oh, baby needs to buy some more
chemicals? Poor, poor, poor baby.

965
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:44,493
Poor little baby. Call a taxi.

966
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,032
Loser! Loser! You lose!

967
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,101
- Fuck, Nikki.
- I'm sorry.

968
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,133
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry, man.

969
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:57,836
Listen, you little motherfucker,
don't you ever fucking lie to me again!

970
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:02,040
I know, I'm sorry. She was staring at me,
giving me the evil eye. I don't know...

971
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,377
Listen to me.

972
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:08,012
I want you to drop that crazy bitch off
right now and meet me at the market.

973
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,487
I just wanted to tell you...

974
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:12,388
No, just meet me
at the goddamned market! Bye.

975
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,822
You wanna fuck him, don't you?

976
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:19,557
I can smell the snail trails
all over the store.

977
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,726
Fuck you!
You always talking shit like that.

978
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,714
Listen, can I use your backroom?

979
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,616
- Yeah. It's right back there.
- Go ahead.

980
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,459
- You like him, eh?
- Shut up. Stop bothering me.

981
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,254
You're always bothering me.

982
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:48,726
One guy looks at me too...

983
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:56,137
My baby! Ross, look.

984
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,667
I missed you so much.

985
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,809
- Yes, you did.
- Hi, Taco.

986
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:04,912
Looks like a perfectly healthy
green dog.

987
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,705
This is great.

988
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,319
Come on, sweet pea.

989
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,690
- Las Vegas, huh?
- We're gonna go to Vegas.

990
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,526
- Oh, I wish he was there.
- That would be good, right?

991
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:29,933
- So Las Vegas is how long by bus?
- It's a seven-hour bus ride.

992
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,938
Well, around seven hours.
Not so bad.

993
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:36,506
- Oh, I don't have any cash.
- Here, sir.

994
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:42,950
- I had a really good talk, you know?
- I had such an amazing time. Thank you.

995
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,053
Ross, if you ever make it
out to Vegas...

996
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,484
...you have to call me.
Do you pinkie promise?

997
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:51,854
- I pinkie... I pinkie promise.
- Thank you.

998
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:54,427
Because I don't know if I'm ever
gonna come back here.

999
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,294
- Really?
- Yeah.

1000
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:59,961
You know he wasn't mad at you, right?
He wasn't.

1001
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,763
- Come here, baby.
- That's not real.

1002
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,442
I like you even though
you're not a normal guy.

1003
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,307
I like you even though
you're not a normal girl.

1004
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,176
So let's just say goodbye.

1005
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,513
I just wanna say that I enjoyed
all this time that I spent with you.

1006
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,154
- Really?
- Yeah.

1007
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,386
Okay.

1008
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,618
Come here.

1009
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,162
Be safe.

1010
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,794
Well...

1011
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,970
- Good luck with Amy.
- Well, good luck in Las Vegas.

1012
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:17,541
- Just be yourself, okay?
- Thank you.

1013
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,441
All aboard, please.

1014
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:22,011
- Bye.
- Bye.

1015
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:54,214
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave</i>
<i>a message and I'll call you back.</i>

1016
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:58,918
Hey, Amy, it's Ross. I called before,
but it was busy, so I'm calling again.

1017
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:02,113
You know, I really need to talk to you,
so if you're there, pick up.

1018
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:06,485
I wanted to talk to you because
I haven't heard your voice...

1019
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:08,993
...and so I wanted to talk to you.
So please...

1020
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:12,224
...if you'd give me a call,
that'd be wonderful, and I love you.

1021
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:17,167
It's your machine,
and pick up if you're there.

1022
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:21,537
All right, it's Ross. I'll call back. Okay.

1023
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:42,257
- Have you seen...?
- He's in the backroom.

1024
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,159
- Chilling out.
- Back there?

1025
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:46,698
Yeah, back there.
You guys keep it quiet, okay?

1026
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,426
- Yeah.
- All right.

1027
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:00,880
Did you get the girl and the little dog
to the bus stop?

1028
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:04,348
- Yeah. She split?
- She's gone.

1029
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,152
She said she might come back.

1030
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,017
Hey, they always spin their way back,
you know?

1031
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,248
What do you want?

1032
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,985
I thought I saw that guy.
Where is that <i>pinche puto</i>?

1033
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:16,927
I don't know, but you better leave.
He could still be close by.

1034
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,867
- Can I have a beer?
- Oh, fuck, yeah.

1035
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:30,404
- Did he leave? He better watch himself.
- Holy fuck!

1036
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:31,670
That's fucking April!

1037
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,641
I bet you that fucking bitch
is afraid, huh?

1038
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:37,216
And she's with
my fucking dyke neighbor!

1039
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,149
Get out of here!

1040
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:42,722
Hey, fuck you!

1041
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,819
- You don't need nothing?
- We don't need nothing from you.

1042
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,655
Who you gonna get it from then, huh?
Spider Mike?

1043
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,627
<i>The</i> pinche maricón
<i>was raided last night.</i>

1044
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,061
He got raided?

1045
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:55,168
I told you once already, just leave.
You better leave...

1046
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,032
...or there'll be trouble.
- Right.

1047
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,537
- Take your cigarettes and just go.
- Fuck the smokes!

1048
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:02,206
What I want is respect
from you bitches!

1049
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,470
Respect is earned, mud flap.

1050
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:09,140
Screaming at these women
is no way to earn any respect.

1051
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:13,545
These aren't women.
These are my fucking bitches, bitch!

1052
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:25,826
Man, look at that. Some of them dykes
are pretty goddamn good, huh?

1053
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,095
- You girls okay?
- Yeah.

1054
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:34,001
I don't like resorting to violence,
but men, they're evil.

1055
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:36,336
They need healing.

1056
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,437
- Here's for the beer.
- Okay.

1057
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,248
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

1058
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,385
Hey, want a bump?

1059
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:49,246
- Yeah, I need that right now.
- There you go.

1060
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,261
So Spider got busted.

1061
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,366
Yeah and that little faggot, Frisbee,
was wearing a goddamned wire.

1062
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:12,069
Get me out! It's bad! It's gone bad!

1063
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:13,612
Holy shit!

1064
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:17,281
Spider broke a cap off,
nailed him right in the nuts.

1065
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:20,644
Oh, shit!

1066
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,221
- Is he dead?
- No, he lived.

1067
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,328
That's gotta hurt.

1068
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,231
Jesus Christ, that's gotta hurt.

1069
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,630
- Is Cookie all right?
- She got busted.

1070
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:39,432
So where we going?

1071
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:41,740
Let's go to the city.

1072
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,935
The city? I don't... I can't, man.

1073
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:46,103
I can't go. I haven't slept in days.

1074
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:50,342
I'm too fucking high. The car is
on empty. I'm on E here. I just...

1075
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:53,510
- Why do we need to go to the city?
- Listen, pussy boy...

1076
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,417
...you're broke. I'm broke.

1077
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:00,425
My old lady split. Your old lady took off
with some fucking dyke.

1078
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,621
- So?
- So we gotta get some money.

1079
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:05,197
We gotta go there.

1080
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,527
That's where they got
dope and what we need.

1081
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,535
And when we go there,
then I'll take care of you, all right?

1082
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:12,636
No, that's cool.
No, we should go there...

1083
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:15,037
...because my real girlfriend,
Amy's, there.

1084
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:18,145
We're supposed to hang out,
so it's actually kind of perfect.

1085
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,974
We'll go to the city.

1086
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,914
I gotta stop and make a call.

1087
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,849
Goddamn it, pay-phone boy.
We're just up the road a bit.

1088
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:01,852
Just keep on driving.

1089
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:15,696
All right, wait here. I'll be right out.

1090
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,880
Four hundred diamond chips.
I've counted them.

1091
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:35,248
Given to me by a Hell's Angel.
I think his name was Charles.

1092
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:39,752
Hi! We've been waiting for you.
Where've you been?

1093
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:42,089
Okay, both of you, out of here.

1094
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,564
Out of here. Out of here. Out of here.

1095
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:53,766
Are you alone?

1096
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:56,875
I got a little helper with me, a little kid.

1097
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,209
Kid?

1098
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,242
Are you into that? Kids?

1099
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:07,283
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave</i>
<i>a message and I'll call you back.</i>

1100
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,685
<i>Hey, Amy, it's me.</i>

1101
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:12,356
I'm gonna be at the park
in about 20 minutes...

1102
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:14,290
...and I really wish you'd talk to me.

1103
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,990
Okay. Well, here's a little something.

1104
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:20,828
Nice.

1105
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:23,266
- That's good.
- And here's another.

1106
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:26,201
- Nicer.
- That's even better.

1107
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:29,368
I want you to know I have changed.

1108
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:33,412
I'm really, you know, trying to be good,
and I have your money.

1109
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:39,144
So I love you, and maybe
you'll come, okay? Bye.

1110
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:44,116
Everything you'll need, you'll find
in that jug, that can and that case.

1111
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,458
Okay.

1112
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,338
- Nice.
- Nice.

1113
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:02,268
- Okay, girls.
- Goodbye, lover-boy.

1114
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,269
Mark.

1115
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,678
Take a lesson, you two.

1116
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:13,787
That's a real man. Oh, yes!

1117
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:16,217
I love him.

1118
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,817
Okay, where to?

1119
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,257
I'll make you a deal.

1120
01:28:56,331 --> 01:29:00,392
Six months' worth of dope.
Just give me a ride where I gotta go.

1121
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:03,435
Sounds good. Is it okay if I go
and see my girlfriend?

1122
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,094
I gotta see Amy first.

1123
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:06,365
Yeah, let's go.

1124
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,941
All right.

1125
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:58,980
Where's my money?

1126
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:01,954
Money.

1127
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,490
- There's plenty more where that's from.
- That's it?

1128
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,560
- Yeah.
- Impressive.

1129
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:09,355
Now you only owe me 350.

1130
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:13,461
Yeah, well, I got a job, you know,
now, and I'm working really hard.

1131
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:16,535
You know, I just...
God. Can I hold you just for a second?

1132
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:18,899
- Are you on crank?
- No!

1133
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,131
You're spun, aren't you?

1134
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,503
- No, I'm working hard!
- I can't deal with this!

1135
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:25,669
- No, I can't... What?
- I can't deal with this.

1136
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:28,379
What are you talking about?

1137
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:29,914
- I got a life now, okay?
- Look...

1138
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:31,984
Don't touch me!

1139
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:37,591
I'll call you.

1140
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:42,085
Fuck!

1141
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:07,810
I'm crashing pretty hard right now.
I'm really tired.

1142
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:11,324
That's not good.

1143
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:32,409
I remember a time,
I'll tell you, I was about...

1144
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:37,313
I was little. I don't know, 4, 5 years old,
something like that.

1145
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:42,854
We had this old dog
that had a litter of puppies.

1146
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:44,855
And I walked
in the bathroom one day...

1147
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:49,360
...and my mother was standing there,
kneeling down.

1148
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:52,760
The dog had a litter, about eight,
and my mother was bending over...

1149
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:57,530
...and she was killing each one
of these little puppies in the bathtub.

1150
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:01,599
And I remember, I said, "Why?"

1151
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:09,473
She said, "I'm just killing
what I can't take care of."

1152
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:16,885
Then my mama said to me...
She looked at me, she said:

1153
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:21,555
"I wish I could do that to you."

1154
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:27,490
Maybe she... Maybe she should've.

1155
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:29,465
Yeah.

1156
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:40,000
