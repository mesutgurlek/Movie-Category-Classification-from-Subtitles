1
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,726
You heard 'bout the legend
ofJesse James

2
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:00,312
And John Henry
just to mention some names

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,857
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend
in the South today

4
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,486
A man called Bandit
from Atlanta, Ga.

5
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,280
Every gearjammer
knows his name

6
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:13,658
They swear he got asphalt
a-runnin'in his veins

7
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,620
A foot like lead
and nerves like steel

8
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:20,415
He's gonna go to glory
ridin' 18 wheels

9
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,250
Oh, boy

10
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,712
He left Atlanta back in '63

11
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,590
Haulin'him a load
up to Tennessee

12
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,760
He hit Mount Eeale
in a drivin'rain

13
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:34,721
So hard he couldn't even see
the passin' lane

14
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:38,016
Well, he started down the grade
when he lost a gear

15
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,561
He hit them brakes,
found he had no air

16
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,481
The Mount Eeale grade
is steep and long

17
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:48,318
And everybody that seen it
thought the Bandit was gone

18
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:49,903
All gone

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,448
Well, his truck jack-knifed
turned completely around

20
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:56,535
He was comin' down backwards
'bout the speed of sound

21
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:59,579
A lot of folks seen him
and they all say

22
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:02,833
He had his head out the window
yellin', "Clear the way!"

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,877
Well, he got to the bottom
safe and sound

24
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,880
Everybody asked Bandit
how he made it down

25
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:12,009
He said, "Folks, when the truck
picked up too much speed

26
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,929
"I just run along beside it
and drug my feet"

27
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,224
Ya heard the legend
ofJesse James

28
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,518
And John Henry
just to mention some names

29
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:25,147
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend
in the South today

30
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:28,859
A man called Bandit
from Atlanta, Ga.

31
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,528
Every gearjammer
knows his name

32
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,656
They swear he's got asphalt
a-runnin'in his veins

33
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:38,035
A foot like lead
and nerves like steel

34
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,371
He's goin' up to glory
ridin' 18 wheels

35
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,374
Ah, tell me, boy

36
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,546
Talk to me, guitar

37
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,227
Hey, Kirk. How ya doin'?

38
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,647
Tod Engels. How are ya?

39
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:13,362
- This your rig, son?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,947
Open it up. Let's see the manifest.

41
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:29,252
Well, placin' you under arrest
for transportin' alcoholic beverages

42
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,838
across state lines
without the proper permits.

43
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,341
And that means you,
you dumb cowboy.

44
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:38,178
You know truckin' Coors beer
east of Texas is bootleggin'.

45
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:42,015
- This here's Georgia, son.
- Just a friendly bet.

46
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:44,643
These two old boys put me up to it.

47
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,895
Now, when ya gonna learn?

48
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:51,650
Big and Little Enos Burdette make that
same bet with every gearjammer they can.

49
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,777
I say he ain't gonna go
for your game.

50
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:58,532
Son, from what I've heard, the biggest
thing about the Bandit is his ego,

51
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:04,121
and I figure that plus a lot of my dollars,
and he'll try anything, legal or not.

52
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:08,875
(ANNOUNCER) They've put on quite a show
for us today, haven't they, friends?

53
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:14,506
Yes, sir, you have seen some of
the finest gearjammin'in all of this country.

54
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:19,803
Remember, these are the boys that take
the long hauls They really did it today.

55
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,560
- Hoss... Where might I find the Bandit?
- I ain't seen him.

56
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:28,854
- Over there behind his rig.
- Who wants to see him?

57
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,856
- Who's askin'?
- I'm askin'.

58
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:35,193
'Cause I'm the guy payin' him $25 a day
so all his loyal fans can look at him.

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,113
Do it.

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,160
I'm buyin' your attraction
for a half an hour.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,960
Egotistical son of a bitch.

62
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,507
A guy that paints his truck like this would go
to a minister's funeral dressed in feathers.

63
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:02,888
(BIG ENOS) See, son? Old legends
never die. They just lose weight.

64
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:07,184
Seems like a legend and an out-of-work
bum look a lot alike, Daddy.

65
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:11,396
(BIG ENOS)
Bandit, me and my son are here.

66
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,487
Oh, I love your suits.

67
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:23,367
It must be a bitch gettin' a size
68 extra-fat and a 12 dwarf.

68
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:28,538
I came to make a deal. What's he get
if he wins this truck rodeo thing?

69
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:31,666
- (BANDIT) lf? I
- $5,000, Daddy.

70
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,379
- Chicken-shit money.
- Just what the hell you want, anyway?

71
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:40,050
You to get out of this dumb-ass rodeo
and accept a real challenge.

72
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:50,560
(BANDIT) Gettin' to Texarkana and back
in 28 hours, that's no problem.

73
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:55,107
- It ain't never been done before, hotshit.
- Watch your language, little lady.

74
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,651
The problem is that Coors beer.

75
00:05:57,818 --> 00:06:02,280
You take that east of Texas
and that's, uh... that's bootleggin'.

76
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,200
I believe you're just a little bit scared.

77
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,453
Great psychology. Why don't you say
somethin' bad about my mother?

78
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,873
- Your mama is so ugly...
- Look, you make this run for me.

79
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,584
These Peterbilts are worth $80,000.

80
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:20,257
That comes to about three grand
an hour if you make it in 28 hours.

81
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:22,718
How about that for a challenge?

82
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:25,470
- Dad, I don't believe that that's necess...
- Never mind.

83
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,181
Wait a minute. Why do you
want that beer so bad?

84
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:30,976
Because he's thirsty, dummy.

85
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:34,771
You see, I got a boy runnin' tomorrow
in the Southern Classic

86
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:38,108
When he wins,
I wanna celebrate in style.

87
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:42,571
- How much style?
- Well, I got a few friends and me.

88
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,448
400 cases.

89
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:48,660
- 400 cases...?
- Well?

90
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:52,789
- Well, let me see your cash.
- Big Enos's word is gold.

91
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,127
All right show him the cash.

92
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,546
- Go ahead, Little.
- Shit.

93
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:05,302
Let's see. There's 400 cases of beer,
I'll need the cash for that.

94
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:08,472
No problem. Go ahead, boy.

95
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,725
New car. Gotta have a new car
to block for the truck.

96
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:18,231
- OK. Go ahead, boy.
- I'd like to kick his ass just once.

97
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:20,359
Speedy car.

98
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,946
Speedier than that.

99
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,948
Go ahead.

100
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:50,097
- Hello, darlin'.
- Hi, Uncle Bandit.

101
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,307
- Which one of the house apes are you?
- Kate.

102
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:54,810
He's droppin' 'em like flies, isn't he?

103
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,021
Well, well, well. Hello, beautiful.

104
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,816
- How about 'gorgeous'?
- You can't have him.

105
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,860
Obviously you can. What are you
tryin' to do, start another race?

106
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,489
Look, you got Cledus in jail once.
Leave us alonel

107
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,950
- Hi, Uncle Banditl
- He ain't your damn unclel

108
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:15,372
I always recognise youl You know why?
You always kick me in the ballsl

109
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,333
Damn it, Banditl Look at mel

110
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,005
I find it hard to look at you, Waynette,
especially with those things in your hair.

111
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:25,632
Makes me think you're listening
to a radio station in Savannah.

112
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:29,553
You can't go in there and bother Cledus.
Heyl This is my homel

113
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,972
- Cledus.
- Nol

114
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,851
I know in the past
I may have done you wrong.

115
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:39,062
- Right?
- Right.

116
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,359
However, in the future, Cledus,
I will never, ever do you wrong again.

117
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:47,029
- Right?
- Right.

118
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:54,161
We have a big chance, a big chance
to make a run for some big bucks.

119
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:59,291
- 80,000 of them.
- Really?

120
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,628
- Are we gonna kidnap the Pope or somethin'?
- How'd you guess?

121
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:08,633
No. We're just gonna run over to Texarkana
and pick up 400 cases of Coors

122
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,511
and bring it back in 28 hours.

123
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:14,097
Whoal I got a flash for you.

124
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:17,059
That's called bootleggin',
and that's against the law.

125
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:20,854
Who gives a turkey when the Snowman
and the Bandit are runnin' the booze?

126
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,648
- No one can stop us.
- Hold it right there.

127
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,735
There ain't gonna be no more
Snowman and Bandit.

128
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:32,074
Because I've got to go in the morning
to Conyers and pick up a load of manure.

129
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,160
- Shitty job.
- Can I ask you a question?

130
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,037
Sure. Ask me.

131
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:40,207
What the hell do we wanna go to
Texas for and haul beer back here?

132
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,459
For the good old American life.

133
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:46,129
For the money, for the glory
and for the fun.

134
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:49,549
Mostly for the money. You know
what we're gonna do with the money?

135
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,344
- What?
- We're gonna buy a new rig.

136
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:55,931
- You're crazy, you know that.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:59,768
- How much money did you say it was?
- $80,000.

138
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:02,145
$80,000?

139
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,189
- Hm.
- Waynettel

140
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:08,652
Now, Bo, I'm tellin' ya,
Fred here ain't gonna be no problem.

141
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:13,031
- I can see he'll be a major asset.
- Besides, he's one hellacious watchdog.

142
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,576
- Well, let's get goin'.
- Whoa. Hold it a minute.

143
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:20,122
I got to ask you a question.
Sit right there, Fred.

144
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:23,458
You mean to tell me
we're gonna drive from here

145
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,004
to Texarkana, Texas,
and back to here in 28 hours?

146
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,715
It's only 900 miles there
and 900 miles back.

147
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:33,468
Well, for your information,
that ain't never been done, not in no rig.

148
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:37,806
'Cause you and I never done it in no rig.
You gotta stop thinkin' so negative.

149
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,892
'Course we can make it.
We ain't never not made it yet, have we?

150
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,812
- Well, no.
- You see? There you are.

151
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:47,149
Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see all right.

152
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:51,653
I see our asses in a sling
if we get caught that's what I see.

153
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:58,160
Heyl Ho-ho-hol

154
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:01,913
Well, God Almighty,
would you look at thatl

155
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,000
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Honey, hush.

156
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:10,130
I don't guess we're gonna be ridin'
in the truck together this time?

157
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,924
No, son. I'll be drivin' this one
and blockin'.

158
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:15,761
You'll be drivin' the truck.
This is Bandit One and that is...

159
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:18,221
...Bandit Two. Together again.

160
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:22,809
- Like Fred and Ginger and Lester and Earl
- That's right. But we got a problem.

161
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,772
You know them Smokeys
got them CBs in the car now.

162
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:30,817
I haven't worked that out yet,
but I'm thinkin' about it.

163
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,278
I got an idea.
Why don't we do this?

164
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:37,532
If I say go to channel 21, forget it.
We ain't goin' to 21, we're goin' to 19.

165
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:41,453
- 21 is 19?
- If I say go to channel six, forget it.

166
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,414
- We go to three.
- I go to three. Perfect.

167
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,542
- If I say go to channel two, we go to one.
- Two is one.

168
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,961
- That'll confuse everybody.
- That'll confuse 'em.

169
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:53,465
On the other hand,
if we stayed on the odd channels,

170
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:56,593
switched every time and started
in the basement, that'd work, too.

171
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,306
- That'd do it, too, wouldn't it?
- Well, yeah, that'd work too, I guess.

172
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:04,601
- Let's haul ass.
- OK.

173
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,284
(FRED BARKS)

174
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:30,377
Breaker One. This is the Bandit.
Is the Snowman out there?

175
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:33,046
- Am I hittin'ya, son?
- Mercy sakes.

176
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:36,216
You put about eight and a half on me,
blowin' my windows out. Bring it on.

177
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:41,013
I'll be within earshot.
You keep it wound up to around 90.

178
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,766
- Hey, Bandit. Me and Fred's got a question.
- What do you and Fred want?

179
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:48,437
How come we're doing this?
They said it couldn't be done.

180
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,606
- That's the reason.
- That's good with Fredl

184
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:05,620
We've got a long way to go
and a short time to get there

185
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:09,374
I'm westbound
Just watch ol'Bandit run

186

Keep your foot hard on the pedal,
son, never mind them brakes

187
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:17,090
Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make

188
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,136
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
and there's beer in Texarkana

189
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:25,599

He's hot on your trail

196
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,895
And he ain't gonna rest
till you're in jail

197
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:14,231
So you've got to dodge him
you've got to duck him

198
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,358
You've got to keep
that diesel truckin'

199
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,903
Just put that hammer down
and give it hell

- Big town, ain't it?
- I wonder what they do for excitement.

221
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:38,500
They probably sit around
and watch the cars rust.

222
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,920
- Damn it, it's locked.
- We're about an hour ahead of schedule.

- Come back.
- I hate to say I told you so.

Don't lose your head, son.
We still got a lot of boogiein' to do.

247
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,030
Put the pedal to the metal.
I'm 10-10 on the side.

For sure. Me and Fred,

Where are we going?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

254
00:19:41,475 --> 00:19:45,520
- We are a bride in search of a wedding.
- No.

255
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:51,193
There is a wedding in search of a bride.
Let me put it another way.

256
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,405
Think of it as a wedding posse
in search of a bride.

257

- You understand that cowboy?
- Yeah.

- These are my shoes.
- Oh, yeah.

00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,212
- And these are my legs.
- Yeah.

261
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:15,425
- What are you gonna do with them?
- With the shoes or the legs?

262
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:19,179
Last time I saw legs like that
they had a message tied to 'em.

263

What do you mean? These are
great little legs. I'm a professional.

264

Well, in that case,
you shouldn't be dressed in white.

- Dancer.
- Oh.

266
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:37,614
Well, cowboys love fat calves.

267
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:42,119
- They're not fat.
- They're bigger than mine.

268
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:46,081
- Do we really wanna talk about legs?
- One of us does.

269
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:52,212
Otherwise we wouldn't have gone...
What are we doing now?

270
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:56,049
Well, I am getting my clothes, you fool.

271
00:20:56,883 --> 00:21:00,053
Good idea. Why don't you
slip into somethin' comfortable?

00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:07,102
Are we really going 110?
We're going 110I

273
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:11,314
Why do you wear that cowboy hat?
Because you think it looks dazzling on you.

274
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,110
I'd no idea this dress
would be so hard to get out of.

00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,953

You punks look tuckered out, too.

280
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:37,317
That's an attention-getter.

281
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:42,239
- Now, a lady in a weddin' gown.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,034
- Get in a car?
- Yes, sir.

- See who was drivin'?
- N-no, sir.

- Y-yes, sir. Georgia plates.

287
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:06,972
All right. Now, you boys
just stay here and watch the car.

288
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,434
There might be some vandals around
who wanna steal somethin',

289
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,770
so you boys just stay here
and keep your hands on the car

00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:17,649
until one of my aassociates arrive.

291
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:24,573
And don't go home, don't go to eat,
and don't play with yourself.

292
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,909
It wouldn't look nice on my highway.

293
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:34,291
Oh, you can think about it,
but don't do it.

294
00:23:49,348 --> 00:23:52,017
Hey, man, he's gone.
Let's get outta here.

295
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:56,229
Shitl You do what you want.
I'm stayin' right here.

296
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:04,488
28 years old and... Oh, goodness,
what's this? I'll tuck it right in.

297
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:08,075
I was down here dancing
in a home appliance show.

298
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:11,328
- I danced around three trash mashers.
- Talk to me, my boy.

299
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:15,582
I had this costume that lit up.
I only short-circuited once.

300
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:20,295
- Where did you get that seat cover, son?
- This ain't no seat cover.

301
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:24,132
- I was standing in the parking lot...
- I'm sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia.

302
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:29,054
I met this guy... These can't be my pants.
God, he was good-looking.

303
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:31,556
- And he had this hat on...
- Funny, ain't she?

304
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:36,812
I think he was from Texas or something,
and I thought "Why not marry the guy?"

305
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,027
Nobody walks out
on a pretty weddin' I set up.

306
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,780
I'm gonna get that girl
and set everything straight.

307
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:52,536
She insulted my town.
She insulted my son.

308
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:58,875
- Look, what if we...
- Shut upl She insulted my authority.

309
00:25:00,252 --> 00:25:05,841
And that's nothin' but pure and simple
old-fashioned Communism.

310
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:09,594
It happens every time one of those
dancers starts poontangin' around...

311
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:11,805
with those show-folk fags.

312
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:14,766
Halfway down the aisle I said to myself,

313
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:17,477
"Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
His mother doesn't even have any teethl"

314
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:20,814
I jumped in this car, and it blew up
on the side of the road,

315
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,109
and I ended up in this goddamn airplane.
What do you do?

316
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:27,404
I don't remember.

317
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:32,075
- Oh, are we on the air?
- Sort of, yeah.

318
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:37,205
You think I'm... nuts, don't you?

319
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:39,791
No, I don't think you're crazy.

320
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:44,504
I picked up three brides yesterday,
just like you, very subdued.

321
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:47,966
Hey, what... what's goin' on up there?

322
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:51,053
- Come back, Bandit
- Bandit?

323
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:57,225
- Is that your name or your profession?
- That's my handle. Bo's my real name.

324
00:25:57,392 --> 00:25:59,895
- What's your name?
- Carrie.

325
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:03,732
Is she wearing a wedding dress?

326
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:07,819
She was.

327
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:11,531
What's she wearin' now?
Come back.

328
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:14,618
Hey, you got peanut butter
or somethin' in your ears?

329
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:19,081
Tell me what that woman's got on...

331

No coozie's gonna leave me
at no church.

332
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:29,216
Decoratin' up a whole town
at a cost of $40.

333
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,927
Right.

334
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:38,934
I can see her now,
runnin' back up that aisle...

335
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:42,354
No, she was dancin'
back up the aisle,

336
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:45,524
her knockers bouncin'
all over the joint.

337
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,819
Let go of that wheel.

338
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:52,864
Why, her ass was wigglin', too.

339
00:26:57,536 --> 00:27:01,206
Why so fast?
You're late for a big bowling date?

340
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:02,916
Cute.

341
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:10,507
- So, tell me about yourself.
- What do you wanna know, my sign?

342
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:14,720
- What do you do besides drive fast?
- Have fun.

343
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:18,265
- Is this fun?
- Drivin'?

344
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:23,312
- Driving, talking to me.
- They're both a challenge.

345
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:29,818
- You've got a great profile.
- Yeah, don't I? Especially from the side.

346
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:32,863
At least we finally agree on something.

347
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,408
Yeah. We both like half my face.

348
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:45,959
Hey, would a cop taking a leak
on the side of the road interest you?

349
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:49,796
Yes, it would.

350
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:55,719
- He's taking a 10-100.
- At least it's better than a 10-200.

I'm runnin' blocker for 400 cases

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,235
Holy shitl

356
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:59,408
I don't believe this.
Funny, I don't remember that turn.

357
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:03,870
- Bandit, where the hell are you?
- I'll be back on the highway in a second.

358
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:06,289
All right, good buddy.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

359
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:24,057
- Them things are fabulous.
- I think I just went 10-100.

360
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:28,437
- Well, it's better than 10-200.
- That's true.

361

the better I like it.

- You lucky devil, you got him.

00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:55,338
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm on a two-lane blacktop.

How's our time doin'?

00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:06,308
Oh, how are we doin' on time?
About 25 minutes ahead of schedule.

367

- I'm about four miles ahead of you, turkey.

for you. Come on.

Well, what's your handle, son,

You're gonna have to make your own lane,
'cause you definitely got oncoming traffic

(BANDIT)That's not good.

It would be better with a whole bridge.

We jumped over that bridgel

and then I'll get right back on the job.

I bet they wish they were you

Lamar, you're rotten
to the core, you know that.

731
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:29,728
About as rotten as that food
you've been poisonin' me with...

732
01:03:29,895 --> 01:03:33,273
- How many do you want?
- I don't know. Fix the same thing.

733
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,692
Just cook the onions this time.

- Pretty good. You, Snowman?

Oh, pretty good,
considering the shape I'm in.

Say hello to Waynette.
Looks like old Fred's gettin' fat.

Yeah, tell me about it. It damn sure
ain't from eatin' the food at this joint.

738
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,212
- Tell me about that.
- I know it.

739

By the way, where did you get
all them warthogs back there?

Damn if I know. They slid
in here a little while ago.

- Could I ask you something?
- Sure.

748

Do you think we have
anything in common?

749

Besides being chased around
the country in that feckuckteh car?

- Waylon Jennings? No.
- No.

When you tell somebody somethin',

760
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:18,211
it depends on what part of
the United States you're standin' in...

761
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:21,006
as to just how dumb you are.

762
01:05:25,469 --> 01:05:29,056
Mr Bandit, you have a lyrical way
of cutting through the bullshit.

763
01:05:29,222 --> 01:05:33,769
And you have a unique way with
the English language, Miss Frog.

- Don't you take that hat off for anything?
- Sure.

767
01:05:49,826 --> 01:05:52,996
I take it off for one thing,
and one thing only.

768
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:57,918
And you live much too hard

Bandit, you're the joker

- If we were lost on a desert island together...
- Yes?

771
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:11,431
Do you think we'd get along
and talk and... things?

772
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:14,518
Sure.

773
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:16,603
Yeah, we'd get along.

774
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:22,359
It'd never be boring, I can tell you that.
It would never be boring.

775

They call you the Bandit...

- No. Honey, we'll be home in a little while.

Yeah, I gotta go... Bye.

- Yeah, that's my dog. Yeah.
- Well, he just bit me.

- Fredl Come here, Fred.
- I said... He just bit me.

01:07:24,463 --> 01:07:27,007
- Put the son of a bitch out of his misery.
- Let's roast him.

787
01:07:27,174 --> 01:07:29,968
- That's not a bad idea.
- Eat him.

788
01:07:30,135 --> 01:07:35,015
I don't think Fred bit you, mister.
Fred absolutely don't like grease.

was with an acid-rock singer...

named Robert Crumly.

841
01:12:59,631 --> 01:13:05,304

And?

he kept it in the family.

come by and pay up in person?

- Go to bed. For a week.

Good idea.

863
01:14:28,428 --> 01:14:32,641

at the diner, Arlene?
