1
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,051
10,000 pages.

2
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,532
My life and loves.

3
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,854
That's just about
one woman for every page.

4
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,814
God, I'm tired.

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,731
But there is one story
I haven't put down.

6
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,211
Francesca.

7
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,888
That's a story
which isn't mine to tell, really.

8
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,971
So keep it to yourself.

9
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,933
- For how long?
- I don't know how long.

10
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,774
- It's a man, and you're a whore.
- I'm an actress.

11
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,169
What's the difference?

12
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,729
Giacomo.

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,254
You be good for your grandmother.

14
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,212
- Now, you know I love you very much.
- Mama.

15
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,249
Listen to me.
Look out there.

16
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,856
Know one day you'll come back to Venice

17
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,535
and I'll return for you.

18
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,850
I promise.

19
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,491
I promise.

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,694
She means when I am dead.

21
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,848
It's not her fault.
It's in the blood.

22
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,297
A heat for love. Irresistible.

23
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,696
Irresistible.

24
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,537
Sophia, my love!

25
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,419
My husband.

26
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,494
Your husband is the luckiest man in Venice
and doesn't know it.

27
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,491
And it's lucky he's not in Venice.

28
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,858
Sweet darling,
I love you like no other.

29
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,170
You are my dreams come true.

30
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,093
Please, please make love to me again.

31
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,694
Casanova, tell me I'm the only one.

32
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,613
Of course. I always do.

33
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,773
- Darling, I'm home!
- My husband!

34
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,856
I know Casanova well.
It's just like him.

35
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,296
- Has the iceman come yet?
- Yes.

36
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,655
And he comes again tomorrow.

37
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,738
Don't believe what people say.

38
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,017
I don't conquer. I submit.

39
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,890
I've never sought glory as a lover.

40
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,814
Well, what then,
Signor Casanova, do you seek?

41
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,009
A moment that lasts a lifetime.

42
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,296
So, tell me.

43
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,089
This unusual order of nuns you belong to.

44
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,968
Is it a very strict order?

45
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,173
Very. No

46
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,570
jewels or nice clothes before sundown

47
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,969
and back in our cells by...

48
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,934
- Heavens! Is that the time?
- You don't have to go.

49
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,931
I must.
It's been delightful. Only...

50
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,534
Only...

51
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,454
How do I know you're really Casanova?

52
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,211
Yes! Yes!

53
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,215
Casanova.

54
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,973
- The Inquisition is here looking for you.
- No.

55
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,573
Forgive me.

56
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,772
Quick. If they catch you,
they'll hang you.

57
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,379
Giacomo, wait.
Tell me I was the one.

58
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,371
You are the one.

59
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,253
- You won't forget me, will you?
- No, I could never.

60
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,378
- Casanova. For you.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,455
- Where is Casanova?
- I've taken a vow of si...

62
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,817
Eternal damnation.
For one night with Casanova.

63
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,532
Seems fair.

64
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,691
We've got him.

65
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,931
Come on.

66
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,610
...hours of study by respected thinkers
of our time, including myself.

67
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,496
I'm not old-fashioned in this matter.

68
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,495
I do not say a woman's place
is at the hearth and in the bed.

69
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,970
What I do say...
Of course it is their place.

70
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,329
What I do say
is let them be educated at home.

71
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,729
On the higher planes
of science and philosophy,

72
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,698
women serve only to distract us,

73
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,897
to bring us down
to our earthly appetites.

74
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,532
So I say no woman shall ever
set foot inside this university.

75
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,214
Let my opponent take the floor.

76
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,331
And now Dr Giordano of Padua.

77
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,379
- Too late, gentlemen.
- Silence!

78
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,133
Let me show you
who is bringing whom down to earth.

79
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,290
A woman is air and fire
and lightness and strength.

80
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,019
Like this little vessel

81
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,898
that would rise up to heaven
were it not held down by ballast -

82
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,857
bags of sand.

83
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,579
The dead weight of men
with their heads full of sand.

84
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,777
Only a woman would argue
by this demonstration of a toy.

85
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,492
It would never strike the superior intellect of
a man, or I'll eat my words.

86
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,096
Eat these briefs, signor, for these are the
words of the philosopher Bernardo Guardi,

87
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,250
who was said to live in this very city.

88
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,218
Bernardo Guardi. That madman.

89
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,894
Wait until the Inquisition
catches up with him.

90
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,652
Call him a madman,

91
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,779
but he has more understanding of women
than any man in this room.

92
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,579
And I'll wager he has better luck
with them in bed as well.

93
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,139
Strumpet.

94
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,336
There he is! Over there!

95
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,493
Stop him!

96
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,578
Hold him!

97
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,855
Gentlemen, my apologies.

98
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,578
You see?

99
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,220
The dead weight of men.

100
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,939
But I didn't know
what was happening. He...

101
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,931
He bewitched me.

102
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,534
He said he was the Holy Ghost.

103
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,452
And it's happened before.

104
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,210
You are charged with
debauchery, trespass, heresy.

105
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,610
To wit: fornication with a novice.

106
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,338
Well, she was hardly a novice.

107
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,208
For which the punishment is death
by hanging, tomorrow at dawn.

108
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,298
And this time your admirers in high places
won't be able to help you.

109
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,575
Excuse me, Inquisitor.
The doge.

110
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,935
Dalfonso.

111
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,256
Prince, we were just talking about you.

112
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,568
What brings you here?

113
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,130
- I have a special interest...
- I have a special interest.

114
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,299
This time the prisoner has been
condemned on the evidence of a nun.

115
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,975
A special interest in your witness.

116
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,132
- Sister Beatrice?
- I need a word.

117
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,811
For God's sake,
don't you know who she is?

118
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,018
- Who?
- Cardinal Lopresta's mistress in waiting.

119
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,058
He entrusted me with safeguarding
her virginity for him alone.

120
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,098
She's leaving for Rome today.

121
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,729
Your witness
is Cardinal Lopresta's sister, Beatrice.

122
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,779
His sister? Oh, God!
Those Romans.

123
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,215
Think about it, Father Dalfonso.

124
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,579
Who's going to get the blame
for dragging her into the Casanova affair?

125
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,299
Take your time.

126
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,098
Me?

127
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,174
Signor Casanova, this seems to be
another case of mistaken identity.

128
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,370
You are free to go.

129
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,219
You know I'm your friend,
but I'm being threatened by Rome.

130
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,451
Venice, I'm afraid,
is perceived as a hotbed of...

131
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,692
Well, as one enormous hot bed

132
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,331
with silk sheets and heretical books
under the mattress.

133
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,813
The people here are given over to
physical pleasure and scepticism.

134
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,256
Do not abuse my sympathy
for you, Casanova.

135
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,212
I'm expelling you from Venice.

136
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,736
Your Excellency, I worship beauty.
There's no harm in that, is there?

137
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,539
- Worship it in Paris, London.
- I can't leave Venice.

138
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,578
- Why?
- I'm waiting for someone.

139
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,336
- She may let you down.
- No. She promised she'll come one day.

140
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,536
You don't understand.

141
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,532
I'm expelling you from Venice
for your own good.

142
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,690
- Unless...
- Unless what?

143
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,135
Unless you find yourself a respectable wife.

144
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,893
A good woman from a good family
will give you protection.

145
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,935
A wife?

146
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:56,048
It will soon be the time of <i>Carnevale</i>
when authority winks at our indiscretions.

147
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,177
- You're bad enough during Lent.
- But Carnival's in a few days.

148
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,889
You better not waste any more time then.

149
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,971
- Meanwhile, you're on good behaviour.
- A wife?

150
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,971
- No scandals...
- Getting married?

151
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,813
...duels, drunken escapades.

152
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,449
Morning, Lupo.

153
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,976
- We were worried about us.
- You were right to be.

154
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,370
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations. To whom?

155
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,372
Don't know yet.
Any callers?

156
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,338
Landlord, tailor, wine merchant,
usual creditors.

157
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,809
Look at the state of us.
Where have you been all night?

158
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,538
It's like being married already.

159
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,976
Can you get me some fresh clothes?
We have some shopping to do.

160
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,410
- The Contessa Morelli-D'Aosta.
- Yes, yes, yes. Oh, but, no, she snores.

161
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,288
Yes, I remember.
Lady Veronique Costello.

162
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,495
- Heavenly.
- Yeah.

163
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,777
- Duchess of Urfe.
- Yes.

164
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,535
- But didn't she poison her husband?
- Did she? I don't remember that.

165
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,931
Ah, Giulietta Badalamente.

166
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,456
Sadly, she hasn't
poisoned her husband yet.

167
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,417
Perhaps if we told us
what we're looking for.

168
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,731
I don't know. Beauty, modesty.

169
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,334
- Purity.
- All that.

170
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,649
Lupo. We have had a vision.

171
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,493
Still spying on your virgin?

172
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,299
She'll never look this way
if you don't make yourself known.

173
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,974
The whole town's talking about it.

174
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,698
It's just appalling.

175
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,329
You think those men liked hearing
they're no good in bed?

176
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,775
If they wanted that,
they'd go home to their wives.

177
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,658
Francesca, arrogance
in a woman is not attractive.

178
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,129
She's not arrogant.
She's just angry.

179
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,415
- Fruit, sir?
- Don't defend your sister.

180
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,856
It's true. She knows
she's smarter than most men,

181
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,932
which makes men pretend to be superior,

182
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,376
which makes her angry,
which is seen as arrogance.

183
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,009
Giovanni, come away from the window.
Our neighbours'll think you're a gargoyle.

184
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,853
No, Vittorio. Over there.

185
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,536
Francesca, this is a very important week as
you well know. You have responsibilities.

186
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,249
In a few days, thanks to you,
I won't be poor any more.

187
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,137
Much thanks to your father

188
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,930
who had the foresight to betroth her
to his rich cousin's eldest son in Genoa.

189
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,979
Listen to this.
"Mystery transvestite at university

190
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,096
overturns laws of gravity,

191
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,091
conjures devil from the air,

192
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,091
nearly starts fire."

193
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,811
God. Can't they get anything right?

194
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,894
Be thankful. I told you I'd not permit another
scandalous display at the university.

195
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,768
- There's too much at stake.
- Mother, I don't want to marry him.

196
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,297
- Please. I'll be damned if I do.
- Well, if you won't, I will.

197
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,414
That's funny, is it?

198
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,253
Well, I'm damned to be widowed
and gathering dust.

199
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,092
Mother.

200
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,931
Well done.

201
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,215
I know why you're like this
about your fiancé.

202
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,370
- Why I'm like what?
- Come on.

203
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,020
You're always slipping away in secret.

204
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,773
And you're thin.

205
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,739
It's obvious
you've already got a secret lover.

206
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,976
Well, don't tell.

207
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,016
Hello. A gift for your daughter.

208
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,217
I don't know what to say.
Thank you. It's magnificent.

209
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,098
But you don't know my daughter
and she doesn't know you.

210
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,569
Yes. But I know her reputation,
Signor Donato.

211
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,094
And everybody knows yours,
Signor Casanova.

212
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,853
I've always wondered
what you look like.

213
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,852
Quite ordinary, I can see that.

214
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,659
Well, how can I put this?

215
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,494
Victoria is that rare thing -
a Venetian virgin.

216
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,811
Yes, one hears of them,
but invariably it turns out that...

217
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,655
I am sorry. Do go on.

218
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,095
Thank you.
She's led a very protected life.

219
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,535
Never has an impure thought
crossed her mind.

220
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,609
Of course not.

221
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,852
She's never been alone in a room with a
man, or even seen a man without his coat.

222
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,453
I've made sure of that.

223
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,328
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
to ensure her happy innocence.

224
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,095
- She should be in a nunnery, but...
- Heaven forbid.

225
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,092
- Exactly. One hears things.
- Yes.

226
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,014
On the other hand,
there is you, Signor Casanova,

227
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,853
the most notorious lover
of women in Venice,

228
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,979
reputed to have the longest list
of conquests ever known.

229
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,609
A virtuoso of the intimate caress.

230
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,691
The maestro of multiple...

231
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,138
- What was that?
- I will come to love her, Signor Donato.

232
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,451
It's out of the question.
Your idea of love is sensuality,

233
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,579
to reduce women to quivering puddles of...

234
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,378
Victoria!

235
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,333
Are you all right?

236
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,776
I want him. I want him.
Please, please, Papa.

237
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,896
I'll never be happy without him.

238
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,336
- Congratulations. We're engaged.
- We are a marvel.

239
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,015
- I mean, actually getting married?
- Yes.

240
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,898
You have sullied my glove.

241
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,778
I mean, love. My love.

242
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,735
- I'm sorry. What did he just call us?
- We didn't sully it. It came out of nowhere.

243
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,210
Thank you.
You've sullied my love.

244
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,858
Victoria Donato is my fiancée.

245
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,339
- Is she?
- Yes.

246
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,572
- In the sense that I'm going to marry her.
- Well, she never mentioned that.

247
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,696
Of course she didn't.
I haven't asked her yet.

248
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,610
Wha...?

249
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,655
Here, sir.

250
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,698
What, are you two
working together now? Lupo.

251
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,372
San Cremori at dawn.

252
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,894
Listen. We decline to fight you, dear sir.

253
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,699
- You coward.
- We happen to be on good behaviour.

254
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,658
You have no right to decline
to defend your honour.

255
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,378
It's our honour, so we have the right.

256
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,054
He who gets slapped has his rights.
Those are the rules.

257
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,653
See?

258
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,895
- Now, what did we do that for?
- I don't know.

259
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,339
San Cremori at dawn.

260
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,695
May I know of whom
I have the honour to be killing?

261
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,169
Lupo Salvato.

262
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,057
Thank you.

263
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,132
- Don't forget your glove.
- Thank you.

264
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,051
Surely we don't mean...

265
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,099
What's this "we"?
You slapped him. You fight him.

266
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,851
I see you're not laughing now.

267
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,817
Come on!

268
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,014
The apple is very distracting.

269
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,058
It's all right. I'll fight him.

270
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,449
I can be Lupo Salvato.

271
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,137
Bastard!

272
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,528
Signor Salvato.

273
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,491
Oh, dear.

274
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,293
This gentleman is here to explain
the terms of the duel and to see fair play.

275
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,099
- Very good.
- Your attention, please, gentlemen.

276
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,331
Stay behind the line until I give the word.

277
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,414
If one trips or falls, the other puts up
his sword until I say "continue".

278
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,455
Yes.

279
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,215
If a sword breaks,
your second hands you the spare sword.

280
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,495
- Do we have a spare sword?
- Yeah, we do.

281
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,378
First blood ends the duel.

282
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,093
Master!

283
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,372
Move. Go on.

284
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,092
Master!

285
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,810
It's the old switch game.

286
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,016
You'd have killed him.

287
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,409
And you are?

288
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,936
Francesca Bruni.
He's my brother.

289
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,175
- I'll take that, sir.
- Sorry, Signor Salvato.

290
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,820
I should think you would be sorry.

291
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,049
- It was all a case of mistaken identity.
- Mistaken identity?

292
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,849
Giovanni got it into his head
you were courting Signorina Donato.

293
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,851
- Did he?
- It's all over Venice.

294
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,728
The famously virginal Victoria Donato is
gonna marry the infamous rake, Casanova.

295
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,653
- Do you know him?
- Casanova. The philosopher,

296
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,096
who devotes his life to the perfection
of experience? Yes, I know him.

297
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,377
No. Casanova the libertine
who devotes his life to seducing women.

298
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,419
Well, we're obviously
talking about the same person.

299
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,890
There must be something deeply wrong
with a man like that, don't you think?

300
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,814
Something missing in his life.
True love, perhaps.

301
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,619
All love is true in different ways.

302
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,649
To say "I love falsely" is as self-
contradictory as saying "I believe falsely".

303
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,091
You are a philosopher, too.

304
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,774
I've spent countless hours
alone with Casanova,

305
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,933
pondering the ways of love and
how it makes us at one with the angels.

306
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,294
And with the beasts.

307
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,940
I will not debate with you
if you take the side of a man

308
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,569
whose idea of love
demands a female sacrifice every day.

309
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:20,257
I've no sympathy for women who think no
better of themselves than to be a plaything.

310
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,936
You tell your friend from me that what
he imagines to be love is, in fact, self-love.

311
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,773
And self-love is self-doubt.

312
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,339
- Well said.
- Yes.

313
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,810
By the philosopher Bernardo Guardi.
You should read him, Signor Salvato.

314
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,414
- Clearly.
- Give me a man who is man enough

315
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,095
to give himself just to the woman
who is worth him.

316
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,537
If that woman were me,
I would love him alone and forever.

317
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,935
Goodbye, Signor Salvato.

318
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,298
If fighting continued, one of us
would have had good cause to be sorry.

319
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,494
The one still standing, I think.

320
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,929
Francesca Bruni.

321
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,215
- I want my money!
- Next week, without fail.

322
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,530
- You said that last week!
- I was a week early.

323
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,418
- Go to hell.
- I'll see you there. Thank you so much.

324
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,254
Honestly. Why, the nerve!

325
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,332
Can you believe this man?
I mean

326
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,695
does he know who we are?

327
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,772
He should be honoured
to be owed money by the likes of us.

328
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,738
- Lupo.
- What?

329
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,495
I've made a terrible mistake.

330
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,449
- You have?
- Yes.

331
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,451
I have to find her.

332
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,698
Master, I'm a little confused.

333
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,453
- I thought we'd made our decision.
- Yes, I know.

334
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,177
Francesca!
He's arriving tomorrow.

335
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,296
Your fiancé.

336
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,097
She has a fiancé.

337
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,411
Well, so do you.

338
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,697
- Giovanni.
- Good day, Mario. How are you?

339
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,296
- I'm sorry.
- Giovanni, more disgrace.

340
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,454
- Allow me.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

341
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,371
Mama, this is Signor Salvato.

342
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,890
I understand you've had an unpleasant
encounter with my son this morning.

343
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,417
It was nothing more strenuous
than a morning's constitutional.

344
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,571
Come along.

345
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,618
Sorry.

346
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,612
- Your sister has a fiancé?
- She's in love with Casanova.

347
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,816
- Who is?
- Victoria.

348
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,492
- My love. Remember?
- Oh, yes.

349
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,458
- Engaged to Casanova.
- Yes.

350
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,929
Well, you'll have to beat him
at his own game.

351
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,649
But how? I'm up against
a world-class seducer.

352
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,937
- Hello.
- So? What would Casanova do?

353
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,211
- I don't know. What would Casanova do?
- Well, to start, he wouldn't mope around.

354
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,689
- No, I suppose not.
- Misery is not attractive.

355
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,294
If you want to be loved,
you have to be worth loving.

356
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,975
That's the first rule.
And second

357
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,938
be the flame, not the moth.

358
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,618
- The flame, not the moth.
- Yes.

359
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,089
It's my tongue.
Got very loud.

360
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,338
So, your sister, is she happy
with this new fiancé of hers?

361
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,490
No. She's never met him.

362
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,617
- Really?
- Besides, she has a secret lover.

363
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,408
- A secret lover?
- Yeah.

364
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,972
- Who?
- Well, I don't know. It's a secret.

365
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,216
Anyway, she's always
sneaking off in the... See?

366
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,211
I'm sorry.

367
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,051
Lupo, there she is.

368
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,373
Casanova.

369
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,734
We are buying Victoria's trousseau.

370
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,370
Only three days to go before the wedding.

371
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,892
Casanova.

372
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,451
No intercourse before the wedding.
I'm a traditionalist.

373
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,458
I mean social intercourse, of course.

374
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,210
Paolo. Paolo, let us off.

375
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,613
A secret lover.

376
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,215
He's going to bang her to pieces.

377
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,778
From Rome.

378
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,420
The Inquisitor's office.

379
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,697
"A cesspit of heresy and fornication."

380
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,419
Surely not...
Oh, they mean us.

381
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,610
127 complaints against Signor Casanova.
Do we know him?

382
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,933
You'll see there are suspicions Casanova
enjoys the protection of this very office.

383
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,772
That's absolutely rid...

384
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,179
It's either his neck or it's ours.

385
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,929
It better be his.
Get me my notebook.

386
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,972
Oh, dear.

387
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,820
She's completely worn him out.

388
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,971
I found his name.

389
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,253
He's a writer.

390
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,219
<i>"The Subjugation of Women</i>
by Bernardo Guardi."

391
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,532
No wonder. He's entered her head
and her heart as well.

392
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,772
"Here we live in the midst of masculine
domination and what be the result?"

393
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,135
"Half the population
is missing from the feast?"

394
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,055
"You have no right to property
and government, nay, not an opinion...

395
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,815
"If ever a man wants to have
a woman fall in love with him,

396
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,256
all he need to say...

397
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,220
"All he need to say is,

398
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,452
'I have too long dominated
the conversation. What are..."'

399
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,532
...your thoughts on the matter?
What are your thoughts?

400
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,339
- Meat? I'm the tailor!
- So you are. Forgive me.

401
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,773
Thank you, sir.

402
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,932
What are...
What are your thoughts on the matter?

403
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,329
My thoughts?
Well, I'd say...

404
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,571
No, Lupo. I'm...
Could I have some tea?

405
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,809
Of course.

406
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,336
Mother, my fiancé is turning up tomorrow.
What shall I do?

407
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,536
It's simple. Do your duty.

408
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,057
Is it my duty to marry a man
that I don't know just because he's rich?

409
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,213
Yes, it is. Your duty to your father
who had your best interest at heart.

410
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,849
Marriage is a safe haven, my darling.

411
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,170
And love?

412
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,171
Love?

413
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,935
Love is something else.

414
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,533
It's the weather being good every day,

415
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,250
because wind and rain
are just another kind of good weather.

416
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,854
That's love.

417
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,773
Perhaps when you see him,
you'll fall in love with your husband.

418
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,693
He's not my husband yet.

419
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,739
If you go against your father's wishes,
we'll continue living in debt,

420
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,334
at the mercy of everyone we owe.

421
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,934
- But if you honour the betrothal...
- The contract.

422
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,580
The betrothal

423
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,614
then our troubles will be over.

424
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,088
It's between you and your conscience.

425
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,097
Amen.

426
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,454
- Signor Salvato.
- I do come here to make confession.

427
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,850
- What are you doing?
- What am I here to confess?

428
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,659
Well, let's see.

429
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,254
Jealousy.

430
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,217
Pride.

431
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,975
Covetousness.

432
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,971
Despair.

433
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,371
And you?

434
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,016
I came to prepare my soul for marriage.

435
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,935
You're troubled, Signorina Bruni.

436
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,013
My troubles are nothing to you, signor,
and little enough to me.

437
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,977
To be bartered in marriage
is no small thing,

438
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,574
especially for a woman
of independent mind.

439
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,017
I see my brother's tongue wags again.
In future he can fight his own duels.

440
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,819
- You can't come in.
- It's all right. I'm a doctor.

441
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,333
You're not Casanova?

442
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,809
No. I can prove it
if you'll show me your chest.

443
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,051
- Are you often in church?
- I followed you.

444
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,695
Surely it is your friend Casanova
for whom fiancées add spice to the pursuit.

445
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,169
If you knew him,
you wouldn't be so quick to condemn him.

446
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,332
If you understood women,
you would not be so quick to defend him.

447
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,652
Love is not an affair of a night or a fortnight.

448
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,256
And true love doesn't grow
with the number of lovers. It wastes away.

449
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,934
- Where's your instrument?
- I'll get it out in a minute.

450
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,057
But you can't blame those
who seek love wherever they can.

451
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,294
Perhaps it's merely the murmur of the flesh
that hasn't known the flutter of the heart,

452
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,053
meant for an evening but not a lifetime.

453
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,337
But can't that still be love all the same?

454
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,014
It seems you're trying
to woo me, Signor Salvato,

455
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,489
by offering to make me
a notch on your bedpost.

456
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,619
Come now, we are speaking of Casanova,
and I am a different man.

457
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,136
You see, Casanova couldn't understand

458
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,656
that of all the ways love can be true, there...

459
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,049
there is one way.

460
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,255
And that way is the sum of all the others.

461
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,615
Now, I've too long
dominated the conversation.

462
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,533
What are your thoughts on the matter?

463
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,859
- What did you just say?
- What?

464
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,580
- I'm in hell.
- I'm busy.

465
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,016
Another note to your lover?
I'd tell him it's all over if I was you.

466
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,534
Go away.
I'm marrying Papprizzio.

467
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,578
- What did I do?
- Somebody came here

468
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,174
who wanted to read your latest pamphlet
before publication.

469
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,057
- What?
- Did you show someone my work?

470
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,577
I didn't show anyone anything, on the
memory of your father, whom I served well.

471
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,457
Until he fired you for stealing.

472
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,370
- Where's the manuscript?
- I took it to the printer's like I always do.

473
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,418
You write, I get it printed under my name,
I take the commission.

474
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,936
Everyone's happy except the priests.

475
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,490
- These new shoes, Guardi?
- Church gave them to me. They don't fit.

476
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,854
Don't lie.

477
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,738
This is an addition to page five.
Take it to the printer's.

478
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,938
Nobody came. Nobody bribed me.
Would I be sober if they had?

479
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,179
That's him.

480
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,056
- Here. Add this to chapter one.
- Thank you.

481
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,813
Guardi says, "Why should women lace
themselves out of their natural shape?"

482
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,414
- Casanova.
- Signorina.

483
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,014
I left my window open.

484
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,649
My darling, I have so many windows
and so little time.

485
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,457
Burn our corsets.

486
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,339
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Forgive me. It was an involuntary...

487
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,058
Please let me help you.

488
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,610
"In the heart of every woman,
there is room for a pet."

489
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,260
"Dogs and cats provide
solace and affection."

490
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,379
"How rare is the man who knows
that the pet of choice for today's woman

491
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,170
is the intelligent and noble pig!"

492
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,455
- A pig?
- I'll pay for the damage. I'm well-endowed.

493
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,532
If you get my... I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

494
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,209
Will you tell your lady
that Signor Salvato is here with a gift?

495
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,656
My mistress says the pig cannot come in.

496
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,176
But the animal we'll take.

497
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,455
I have news about the fiancé.
His name is Papprizzio.

498
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,418
He's from Genoa.
He's arriving at noon.

499
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,218
He's rich.

500
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,293
Of course he is.

501
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,533
Everything's turning
against us these days, Lupo.

502
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,652
- How much do we owe?
- About 1500 lira.

503
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,338
Lay out our second-best suit, Lupo.

504
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,056
Who owns this tub?

505
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,649
I do, sir.

506
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,652
And I'm Pietro Papprizzio,
merchant of Genoa.

507
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,379
- And what's your cargo?
- Lard.

508
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,451
- Lard?
- Finest in the world.

509
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,418
- Tell him, Fulvio. Tell him.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,297
Tub of lard.

511
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,055
Do you mean to tell me you've never
heard of my lard? We'll have to fix that.

512
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:19,170
I want to see one of these posters on every
canal, street, water corner by morning.

513
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,978
- Understand?
- Sign here.

514
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,898
Signor Papprizzio?

515
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,655
- At your service, sir.
- On the contrary, I'm at yours.

516
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,972
The family of your fiancée sent me here to
greet you and to send you to your palazzo.

517
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,496
But palazzo?
I have a reservation at the Hotel Grifasi.

518
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,969
They didn't tell you?
The Grifasi is closed.

519
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,812
- Really? Why?
- Lupo.

520
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,936
- Rising damp, sir.
- Rising damp, indeed.

521
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,569
Palazzo, eh?
Well, lead on.

522
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:55,456
- My servant shall see to your baggage.
- I think you have everything under control.

523
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,090
The first thing I'm going to do

524
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,058
is call upon my betrothed

525
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,371
after I make myself presentable, of course.

526
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,099
Yes. And how long does that usually take?

527
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,693
"Casanova bought a pig."

528
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,250
"Casanova took the pig
to the Bruni house."

529
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,215
Clear it. Everything.

530
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,736
I'll take that.

531
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,091
Your Grace.

532
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,051
<i>Inquisitore</i> Dalfonso,
I am Bishop Pucci.

533
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,335
Oh, Bishop...

534
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,890
I have been instructed to relieve you
of your duties here in Venice.

535
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,052
To say that the pope is less than happy
with your rate of progress

536
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,893
is an understatement
of monumental proportions.

537
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,369
You and your entire staff

538
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,851
have been reassigned
to open a mission among the natives of

539
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,855
the equatorial region.

540
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,329
What kind of natives?

541
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:37,017
Let us just say, shall we,
they have a great hunger for religion.

542
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,730
So this place belonged
to the libertine Casanova, eh?

543
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,972
Yes, but he ran out on his debts, so

544
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,972
we got the villa at a very reasonable price.

545
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,130
Really? How reasonable?

546
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,414
Lupo?

547
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,650
- 1,600 lira.
- Yes.

548
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,415
- Get a receipt.
- Of course.

549
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,214
Do I get a bath for my 1,600 lira?

550
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,373
"Casanova bought a pig?"

551
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,373
"Casanova took pig to Bruni house."

552
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,009
"Casanova met with Papprizzio
at dockside."

553
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,695
"Took Papprizzio to his house."

554
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,694
Is there anybody here
who can explain this?

555
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,250
You sent them all away to be eaten.

556
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,174
Well, then we shall have to do
some footwork ourselves.

557
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,173
Papprizzio?
The pork fat mogul from Genoa?

558
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,609
We're here to discover
heresy and criminal licentiousness.

559
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,136
If there's bacon involved,
I dread to imagine the depths of depravity

560
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,688
we're going to find here in Venice.

561
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,455
I'm surprised,
but I have a good feeling about this city.

562
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,498
- Do you?
- There's a massive market for lard here,

563
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,096
and I plan to use a good old bit
of Genoan know-how to penetrate it.

564
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,217
- Good thinking.
- Handbills, newspapers.

565
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,691
- That's just what Venice is missing.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

566
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,898
- You have to keep an eye for that servant.
- What? He's gone out.

567
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,609
- He's gone out where?
- How am I supposed to know?

568
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:30,934
I've arranged a trinket for my beloved -
a little wedding present for my bride-to-be.

569
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,056
Would you like
an advanced demonstration?

570
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,653
Yes, please.

571
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,248
- It's very...
- That's wonderful. Exquisite.

572
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,059
Really. Yeah.

573
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,051
Who is it?

574
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,250
Was that him?

575
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,897
How am I supposed to know that?

576
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,728
What are we looking for?

577
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,893
I don't know.
Something. Anything.

578
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,252
I found the house, sir.
Signora Bruni and her daughter

579
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:43,253
request the pleasure
of your company for tea.

580
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,217
Good. Good.

581
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,815
The chartreuse then, I think, Fulvio.

582
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,731
Right away, Master.

583
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,655
I'm certainly looking forward to seeing her.

584
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,810
Hope that she's

585
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,811
not disappointed by me.

586
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,498
Hope that she doesn't think I'm...
I don't know.

587
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,539
What's the... What's the word?
The expression I'm looking for?

588
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,135
- Rotund?
- Excuse me. What did you say?

589
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,656
Would sir require
a small snack before tea?

590
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,656
Well, do you see that trunk
shaped vaguely like a salami?

591
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,812
- Yes.
- It's filled with salami.

592
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,691
- There you are.
- Yes.

593
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,931
- Now, very impressive.
- Thank you.

594
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,376
- The choice of lime is very slimming.
- You're too kind.

595
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,735
I must be off.
Didn't I have an appointment?

596
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,378
What? Oh. The publisher.

597
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,291
That was it.
To see how my new book is doing.

598
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,529
You're a writer.

599
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,850
- I've been known to scribble a bit.
- Bravo.

600
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,376
My master's a famous writer
of love and how to please ladies.

601
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,178
You've heard of Bernardo Guardi...

602
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,455
- Lupo, hush.
- But he's a friend.

603
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,132
- I'm so sorry.
- Bernardo Guardi?

604
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,530
- I can't believe it.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

605
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,418
You, sir, are Bernardo Guardi?

606
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,613
That's my nom de plume.
But you must swear to tell no one.

607
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,134
I swear.
On my honour, sir.

608
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,219
My solemn vow.
Bernardo Guardi.

609
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,289
Fulvio, this will need some thinking about.

610
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,099
Yes, it does.
It's my great honour, sir.

611
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,735
Look at me.

612
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,289
I am.

613
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,453
Now look at that.

614
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,779
Yes, in truth, it is not an exact likeness, no.

615
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,489
Yeah. In Genoa, we call it advertising.

616
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:53,334
Yes. Fine. But so what of it?
If she loves you as you are...

617
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,130
She's never seen me.

618
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,773
- Not even a glimpse.
- Really?

619
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:04,456
Yes. Oh, dear, Master Guardi.
Take me under your tutelage, I beg you.

620
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,010
I'll pay you handsomely.
Whatever you like, I'll pay it.

621
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,533
You want me to tutor you?

622
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,215
I want you to transform me.
Transform me.

623
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,417
My dear man, but you have but an hour
until you must you meet her.

624
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,968
I don't want to go.
You can't make me go.

625
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,176
As it happens,
my new book, which isn't out yet,

626
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,057
deals with the outer man.

627
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,893
You see, the relation between the physical
and the spiritual is little understood.

628
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,736
Except by me, of course.

629
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,898
- Master Guardi.
- Yes?

630
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,335
Can you make me look like that?

631
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,938
- Yes, I can.
- Oh, God.

632
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,329
But it will take courage.
It will take time.

633
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,298
- Long confinement to this villa.
- Courage. Yes.

634
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,814
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

635
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,609
Fulvio. I will send my servant Fulvio
to the house of Bruni with a note.

636
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,897
- No need. I will pass that way myself.
- Oh, excellent.

637
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,369
Can we start? I want to start right now.

638
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,415
Lupo.

639
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,376
Lovely.

640
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:19,218
Giovanni! Signor Papprizzio
is expected at any moment.

641
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,018
Signor Salvato.

642
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,254
Vittorio, tell Signor Salvato
I am not at home.

643
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,373
Now, how strange.
I'm sure that I was invited to tea.

644
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,657
- You were?
- We're not having tea.

645
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,575
Forgive me.
I must have forgotten an invitation.

646
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,529
- You told my servant, I believe.
- We were expecting Francesca's fiancé.

647
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,417
Indeed. And here he is.

648
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,659
Ladies, forgive me. It is time I presented
myself under my true colours.

649
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,375
Signorina Bruni,
my name is not Salvato.

650
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,170
You see before you
your most devoted and fortunate fiancé,

651
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,094
Pietro Papprizzio,
all the way from Genoa.

652
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,612
Signor Papprizzio.

653
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:21,614
All the young women I met back in Genoa
concealed their true natures from me,

654
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,090
dazzled by dreams of an empire of pork.

655
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,849
They looked at me
and they saw a mountain of lard.

656
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,692
No, no, no. Not at all.

657
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,533
If anything, you need fattening up.

658
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,578
I don't like thin men.
Francesca's father was enormous.

659
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,938
Nevertheless, I remained true
to the fiancée that I'd never seen.

660
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:46,495
But I wanted to make sure before I declared
myself she likewise had kept herself for me

661
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,890
and hadn't been seduced by the first
charmer that came along with a...

662
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,333
Pig.

663
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:58,535
Perhaps you are the charmer
you warned me against, signor.

664
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,258
I'm engaged to be married,
and so far all I know about you is...

665
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,332
Perhaps you remember sending me this.

666
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,935
"To Pietro Papprizzio
from Francesca Bruni,

667
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,659
with my hopes."

668
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,571
Perhaps I should've brought
the other letters you wrote me.

669
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:40,052
The only desire I have
is that you'll come to love me.

670
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:46,329
And if you cannot or if there is someone
else for whom your heart beats in secret,

671
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,297
I shall release you from your engagement.

672
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,610
There isn't! There isn't.

673
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,258
His Eminence, Bishop Pucci.

674
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:06,010
- Perhaps I've come at a bad time.
- No. No, Your Excellency. We're delighted.

675
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,217
I should have sent word,
but since I've just arrived in Venice

676
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,055
and as your husband, the late ambassador,
was so regarded by the Holy See,

677
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,256
the pope was anxious to be remembered.

678
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,735
Allow me to introduce
my son-in-law-to-be Signor Papprizzio.

679
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,536
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Bishop.

680
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,134
- My daughter Francesca.
- My dear.

681
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,610
What is the pope's most feared inquisitor
doing in Venice, Bishop Pucci?

682
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,655
Francesca...

683
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,335
No, no. I'm delighted
that my reputation precedes me.

684
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,980
The Vatican sent me
to deal with moral problems.

685
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:45,009
- What kind of moral problems, Bishop?
- The usual. Fornication, heresy.

686
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,012
How exactly does
the Church define heresy?

687
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,250
Francesca!

688
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,537
I hardly think heresy
is a fit conversation for a young lady.

689
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,453
Why? Can't we be heretics?

690
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:01,534
I think my fiancée, Bishop Pucci,
wishes to learn more from you perhaps.

691
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,858
If you please.

692
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,171
Very well.

693
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,851
Heresy is an affront
to the teachings of the Church.

694
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,649
It is a rebellion against
our mores and our morals.

695
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,369
More to the point,
and you will understand this,

696
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,657
since you are a woman
and understand women's ways,

697
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,777
hence the concept of "whim",

698
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,174
heresy is whatever I say it is.

699
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,974
For example, that writer fellow,
Bernardo Guardi, he is a heretic.

700
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,652
And why is that?

701
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,049
Vittorio, where is the tea?

702
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,815
Guardi's words
cause women to feel dissatisfied

703
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,653
- and men to doubt their manhood.
- Really?

704
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,416
If you are an admirer of this Guardi fellow,
I have some very sad news for you.

705
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,013
He's written out.

706
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,937
My colleagues are scouring
the streets for him as we speak.

707
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,649
I'm so sorry.

708
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,291
- Bishop, will you take tea?
- Thank you, no. I have people to see.

709
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,135
Signorina Bruni.

710
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,691
May I have the honour
of accompanying you to the carnival ball?

711
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,575
But I've done nothing wrong.
