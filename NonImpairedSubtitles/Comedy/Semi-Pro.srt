1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:04,449
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:09,319
# Baby, who's ready to lick me sexy? #

3
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:16,664
# Baby, we're naked
and we're humpin' sexy #

4
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:19,570
# Love me sexy! #

5
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:29,210
# Come on, girl. Yeah #

6
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:32,047
# It's me, Jackie Moon #

7
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,713
# Give me that look, that's right #

8
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:37,951
# Let's get sweaty,
let's get real sweaty #

9
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,824
# I'm talkin' rainforest sweaty #

10
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,762
# I'm talkin' swamp sweaty #

11
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:48,564
# Let's fill the bathtub full of sweat,
all right #

12
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:54,336
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

13
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:59,710
# Baby are you ready to lick me sexy? #

14
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:04,081
# Baby, wake up, we're naked #

15
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:07,450
# And we're humpin' sexy #

16
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:08,818
# Come on, girl #

17
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:13,451
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

18
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:14,721
# Love me sexy #

19
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:18,219
# Baby, are you ready
to lick me sexy? #

20
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,357
# Lick me sexy #

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,392
# Take off your shoes
and suck me sexy #

22
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:26,098
# Suck, suck,
suck, suck, suck me sexy #

23
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:29,870
# Baby, we're naked
and we're humpin' sexy #

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,208
- # Whoo! #
- # Humpin' sexy #

25
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,907
# I wanna do a little thing wit' you #

26
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:37,712
# I wanna do a little thing
wit' you #

27
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:40,743
# When I say "love me"
you say "sexy" #

28
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:42,379
# Love me #

29
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:45,789
- Sexy.
- Oh, yeah, Flint Tropics crowd!

30
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,488
Get it goin'.
It feels good, doesn't it?

31
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,895
I see some ladies up there
who wanna love me sexy.

32
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:54,765
Jackie Moon soaking up
a robust round of applause...

33
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:59,033
as he finishes up his
once-popular song, Love Me Sexy.

34
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm Dick Pepperfield joined,
as always...

35
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:03,838
by former Tropics forward
Lou Redwood.

36
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,970
Yeah, I might suit up tonight.

37
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:08,242
Sometimes I still dream of glory, Dick.

38
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,682
Well, sometimes dreams
can turn into nightmares, Lou.

39
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,808
What's your problem?

40
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,014
And now, the starting lineup...

41
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:20,891
for your Flint, Michigan Tropics!

42
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:26,763
At Ball Girl, measuring 34-23-34...

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,768
she hopes to be
an astronaut one day...

44
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:30,599
I don't think she can do it.

45
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:35,267
Put your hands together for Melinda!

46
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:37,674
Go Tropics!

47
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,144
From South Bend, Indiana...

48
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:42,910
this guy has a heart of gold,
his brother's a retard.

49
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:46,112
He reads to him
and paints him pretty pictures...

50
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:48,950
Scootsie Doubleday!

51
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,253
Scootsie Doubleday
taking the court now.

52
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,122
Yeah, his brother
is really retarded.

53
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,148
Ronnie Doubleday.

54
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:57,027
He has all three
major kinds of retardation.

55
00:02:57,063 --> 00:03:00,863
This guy is single
and disease-free, no V.D. at all...

56
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,892
but you could be the lucky girl
to give it to him!

57
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:05,268
Six foot five!

58
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,739
Twiggy Munson!

59
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:08,968
Of course he's disease-free.

60
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,840
What chick wants to be with a guy
that's hung like a twig?

61
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,742
Well, that's not true.
I've heard a lot of women say...

62
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:14,178
that they actually prefer a small penis.

63
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:16,876
Show me one gal who says that
and I'll show you a liar.

64
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,407
I'll introduce you to
Mrs. Pepperfield later on tonight.

65
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:20,714
Oh, Jesus, here we go.

66
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:21,948
Your man in the middle...

67
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:23,250
seven foot two...

68
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,191
from a weird country called Lithuania.

69
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,353
He's ugly as shit.

70
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:33,162
- Vakidis!
- Go, daddy!

71
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,427
- This fella scares me.
- Yeah!

72
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,958
That little kid from the Jackson Five,
he scares ya too.

73
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,470
Oh, mark my words, Lou...

74
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,700
there's something creepy
about that young man.

75
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,367
Bobby Dee, where's Clarence?

76
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,001
- Nobody's heard from him.
- Come on, Tropics!

77
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:45,409
Bee Bee!

78
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:46,878
You're startin'.

79
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:49,108
From Peoria, Illinois...

80
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:50,480
this guy,
what can I say about him?

81
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:53,509
He's got the hottest girl in the world,
I'm not kiddin'.

82
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,952
Cannons, people.

83
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:56,580
Big ol' boobies.

84
00:03:56,623 --> 00:04:02,493
The luckiest man in Flint...
Bee Bee Ellis!

85
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,292
Well, it's true about
what they say about Bee Bee's wife.

86
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,458
She has got a tremendous set of boobs.

87
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:07,932
To me, they're too large.

88
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,434
Oh, they're perfect.

89
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:12,927
I don't know, they... To me
she looks structurally unsound.

90
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,100
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

91
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:20,772
At six foot five,
a solid, meaty 215 pounds...

92
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:24,045
your pregame announcer,
your owner, your coach...

93
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:27,178
your pop singing sensation,
but most importantly...

94
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,551
your power forward...

95
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:33,389
yours truly, Jackie Moon!

96
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:35,891
All right!

97
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:37,794
Jackie Moon
always gives himself...

98
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,799
a fantastic introduction.

99
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,130
- Yeah, why not, Dick?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

100
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,261
It's his team, his money and
his tunnel of beautiful ball girls.

101
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:47,330
Oh, speaking of money, Lou,
did you get paid this week?

102
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,363
No.

103
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:50,103
You lose weight, Father Pat?

104
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,132
Fuck off, Jackie.

105
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:55,045
All right, guys, huddle up.
Vakidis!

106
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:57,208
What is he doin'?
You know what? Fuck it.

107
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,684
Listen, I promised these fans
a show tonight, all right?

108
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:02,279
Twiggy, if you get a dunk tonight
try to break that backboard, all right?

109
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,949
- We'll get that on the news.
- All right.

110
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,288
Let's bring it in,
it's showtime, right? Let's get...

111
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,850
Tropical!

112
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,362
Go Tropics!

113
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:12,759
Right here, right here, right here!

114
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,562
I don't like it.

115
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:15,863
Back! Back!

116
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:18,564
Clear!
Yep, that feels good. That feels...

117
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:21,199
- Danny, what are ya doin'?
- Nothin'. Eatin' nachos.

118
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:22,606
You get 'em from the concession stand?

119
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:25,304
- Nah, I brought 'em from home.
- What?

120
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,835
No, no, no, no, no.

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,313
Oh, come on!

122
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:29,508
- What?
- Travel!

123
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:31,676
He brought nachos from home.
Tryin' to run a business here.

124
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,618
- You can't call that.
- Jackie, you gotta dribble...

125
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:34,642
if you're gonna move.

126
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,949
What are you talkin' about?

127
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,854
- Basketball rules.
- Fine.

128
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:40,291
I got season tickets.
I can do whatever the hell I want.

129
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:41,987
Oh, yeah?
Well, I can do this.

130
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,324
And this.

131
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:47,561
And that!

132
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,192
Let's go, Trops!

133
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,894
We are well underway
and the big question, Lou...

134
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:56,636
where is Tropics' leading scorer,
Clarence "Downtown" Malone?

135
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,871
I agree, it's completely
unprofessional, Dick.

136
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:00,880
Lou, can I ask you
to please put out your cigarette?

137
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:03,041
No, I like to smoke when I drink.

138
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:09,510
All right, fans, let's hear it for
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone!

139
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:15,751
Go Clarence!

140
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,422
That's my son.

141
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,490
Downtown wastes no time
tagging out Bee Bee Ellis...

142
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,467
and Munson passes him the ball
immediately.

143
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:25,369
Downtown dribbles the ball through
his legs... I love it when he does that.

144
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:27,373
He's making mincemeat
of his defender here.

145
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:28,806
Downtown!

146
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:31,106
If you want it!
If you... Only if you want it!

147
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,271
You don't want it, I can feel it.
You don't want it, OK.

148
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,440
That's right, Nets.

149
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:38,451
You're not gonna stop it.
Believe me, we don't stop it in practice.

150
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,509
- Let's do it!
- Come on, come on, come on!

151
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:41,110
- Go!
- You got it.

152
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:43,446
He tosses a three...

153
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,855
And, yes!

154
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:46,950
- Wow! That was quite a shot.
- Pounce!

155
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:48,688
Yeah!

156
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,729
At halftime, it's the Nets 62...

157
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,291
Flint Tropics 43.

158
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:59,066
All right, everybody,
let's hear it for Tropical time...

159
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:01,232
and let's hear it for Busch Bavarian.

160
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:07,035
If you're gonna drink a beer, you
might as well make it Busch Bavarian.

161
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,878
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to welcome this man...

162
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:14,979
who's gonna attempt the impossible...
the $10,000 free throw...

163
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,148
from the other side of the court.
The Moon shot.

164
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,556
- Right on.
- All right. Tell everybody...

165
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:21,492
- what's your name?
- Dukes.

166
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,052
- All right, Dukes.
- Dukes!

167
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:25,121
- Dukes, where ya from?
- Flint, Michigan...

168
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:26,529
and I never missed a game!

169
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,391
Go!

170
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,163
Dukes is homegrown.

171
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:33,661
I think you're on a little somethin'
that's homegrown maybe, huh?

172
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,264
We're havin' fun.

173
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:36,775
Dukes, what do you do for a livin'?

174
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:40,102
Nothin' right now.

175
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:41,306
OK.

176
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:42,336
Layin' low.

177
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:45,744
Dukes is excited!

178
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:46,945
So am I.

179
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:49,921
Come on, let's go, people.
Let's get it goin'.

180
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:53,915
Cheer this guy on
as he prepares for the impossible.

181
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,451
Well, we've got
an especially dirty hippie here...

182
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,521
down on the court tryin' to sink
an impossible shot.

183
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:01,033
This is human drama at its best.

184
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:04,559
He's just focusing, taking a moment
to concentrate. That's OK.

185
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:07,596
Concentrate all you want.

186
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,342
- Come on, Dukes!
- All right.

187
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,113
- No!
- Yes!

188
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,048
Holy shit, I'm a miracle!

189
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:21,384
Yeah!

190
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:23,548
Father Pat, he stepped on the line.
He stepped on it.

191
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,614
- No, no, it was legal.
- No, no...

192
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:25,885
he stepped on the line,
You were lookin' at it. Come on.

193
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,187
Jackie, he made the shot.

194
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:29,194
Who the hell has $10,000?

195
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:30,991
Relax, the beer company'll pay him.

196
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,123
They're not really a sponsor,
it just sounded professional.

197
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:37,130
Look at this guy. He's so hopped up
on goofballs and grass...

198
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,728
he's got no idea what's going on.

199
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,500
Holy crap.

200
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,007
Tropical!

201
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,909
Hey, congratulations to Dukes!

202
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:51,679
He just won a giant check
that says $10,000.

203
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:53,379
Cool!

204
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,785
Look at the size of that thing!

205
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:57,346
Go have yourself a ball!

206
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,223
Second half, comin' up next!

207
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,317
Damn it!

208
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,924
- # Hi #
- # Hello #

209
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,596
# Get the funk outta my face #

210
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,438
# Get the funk
outta my face #

211
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:18,137
# Get the funk outta my face #

212
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:20,941
# Get the funk outta my face #

213
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,939
# You don't like my music
You don't have to use it #

214
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:30,012
# Funking is a thing
that all of us release #

215
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:31,614
# You don't have to get it #

216
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:34,320
# All you do is let it #

217
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,761
# Then you'll know
exactly how to groove #

218
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:43,058
#... More, more, more #

219
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:47,232
# Now he's back home doing 9 to 5 #

220
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:50,674
# Living his gray flannel life #

221
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,905
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, guys, everything good?

222
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:55,140
- Keep the drinks flowin'.
- You got it.

223
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:59,210
# More, more, more #

224
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:02,119
# Gitchi, gitchi, ya ya da da da #

225
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:11,056
You're a sexy town, Flint.

226
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,421
Look at you, I love it.

227
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,991
I swear, if this Plexiglass
wasn't dividing us right now...

228
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:22,372
I'd make sweet, tender,
slow, hot love...

229
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:23,932
to each one of you,
that's a guarantee.

230
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:28,777
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

231
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:29,839
# Love me sexy #

232
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,577
# Baby, are you ready to lick... #

233
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:33,175
- #... me sexy? #
- I'm tellin' ya, man...

234
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:35,653
that's the word on the street
and the shit is messed up.

235
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:36,848
It's a dang shame.

236
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,983
I can't go back to working
at that car wash. No.

237
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:42,494
I know there's some team out there
that can use the services of...

238
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:44,894
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone,
you hear me?

239
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:48,560
I dig you, brother, but I heard
the problem ain't just here in Flint.

240
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,626
It's the whole league that's goin' under.

241
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,297
Hey, guys, what's shakin'?

242
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,306
What's shakin'?
Whole league goin' down...

243
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,707
- that's what's shaking.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

244
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:00,645
I don't know who you're talkin' to
but business is boomin'.

245
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,014
Jackie, come on, man, it's us.
You ain't got to jive us, man.

246
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,814
I'm not jivin' you.
I've never jived you my whole life.

247
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:09,845
Jackie, come on, you're jivin' us now
by sayin' you don't be jivin' us.

248
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:12,119
OK, well, this time I'm tellin' the truth.

249
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,147
Right.

250
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:17,329
Now if I give you the lowdown on
somethin', can you keep a secret?

251
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:18,352
- Yeah.
- Course.

252
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:22,959
Tomorrow mornin', I'm drivin'
to Indianapolis for a league meeting...

253
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:27,437
possibly talking...

254
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,304
- merger.
- A merger?

255
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,367
Flint Tropics in the NBA.

256
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,672
- The NBA?
- Us mergin'?

257
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:35,237
I'm Jackie Moon,
I take care of you guys, right?

258
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:36,805
I mean, you can just think of me
as Bambi's mother.

259
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,113
I make sure nothing
bad'll happen to you.

260
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:40,915
Drink up, this is a big night.

261
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:42,386
- Hey, drinks on me.
- Big night.

262
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:47,017
Bambi's mother got shot, right?

263
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,050
Yeah, first scene.

264
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:52,587
I remember that the credits
were still rollin' and everything.

265
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:57,060
Who the fuck is Bambi?

266
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:11,808
Merger. Merger.

267
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:12,909
Merger.

268
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,544
Jackie Moon. Jackie Moon.

269
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:15,747
America.

270
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:16,880
Let's go.

271
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,982
Let's do this.

272
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:21,152
Don't worry, Mom,
I won't let you down.

273
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:24,254
I'll keep this team alive.

274
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,428
And our TV stations are complaining
about all the fighting.

275
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:35,065
Let's try to keep the fights in the tunnel
or out in the parking lot.

276
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:38,042
We have one more
piece of business to go over.

277
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm sure you've all heard the rumors,
and they are true...

278
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:44,215
the ABA will be merging
with the NBA...

279
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,377
at the end of this season.

280
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:50,150
Yes. Yes.

281
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:54,092
I did it.

282
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,593
I'm a real owner.

283
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:58,961
- Please, Jackie, let go.
- I did it.

284
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:00,590
All right, let's...

285
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,930
not get too excited.

286
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:04,198
Yes!
Give me ten, Norton!

287
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:05,932
Everyone can eat shit!

288
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:09,135
A big bag of shit!

289
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:11,735
I'm the greatest man in the world!

290
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:15,974
The NBA has agreed
to our financial demands...

291
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,607
- but there is something else...
- You were right, Mom.

292
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,742
Destiny.

293
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:22,345
I'm so happy
I can't even feel my arms!

294
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:24,322
OK, Jackie, listen to me. Jackie?

295
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:26,120
- Hey, Jackie?
- Yes?

296
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:29,958
Four teams will be absorbed
into the NBA next year.

297
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,930
The rest of the league
will terminate operations.

298
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,489
Exactly. You know it.

299
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:37,331
Wait.
Wait, what did you say?

300
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,737
The Nets, the Spurs,
the Pacers and the Nuggets...

301
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:42,536
are gonna play in the NBA next season.

302
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:45,373
- The rest of us are gonna dissolve.
- Dissolve?

303
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,345
What's "dissolve"?

304
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,177
Is that even a word?

305
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:51,774
Yes, it is a word...

306
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:54,342
and financially it means
you'll cease to exist.

307
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:55,945
Let's don't get emotional about it.
Just...

308
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,455
No!

309
00:13:58,591 --> 00:13:59,990
No!

310
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:01,687
OK.

311
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,991
All right, you're being...
Well, Jackie. Jackie...

312
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,464
You... Don't bite yourself.
Come on.

313
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,832
Jackie, we agreed to a very large sum.

314
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,463
I don't want a large sum, OK?

315
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:15,269
I want my team.
Come on, you guys...

316
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:18,573
you're not gonna just sit there
and take the money, are you? Huh?

317
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,808
What do the Nets have
that I don't have?!

318
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,316
The Nets have a huge fan base.

319
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:26,648
They got a brand-new stadium.

320
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:29,519
Solid economic growth package
with great tax incentives.

321
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,588
Come on, Alan, that's bullshit!

322
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,854
The NBA's gonna
take four teams, Jackie.

323
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:39,194
This is a good deal.

324
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:46,831
Best four teams should go.

325
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:51,208
He's right.
The season isn't over yet.

326
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,541
Hey, you know what? Yeah,
everybody should have a chance.

327
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,773
That's the fairest way.

328
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,975
Aw, gee whiz...

329
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,984
that sounds like so much fun...

330
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:00,679
fair and all.

331
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,312
But come on, guys...

332
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:04,516
I mean, look at what
we're dealing with here.

333
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:07,685
This guy plays power forward
for his own team, so...

334
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:09,194
But he has a point.

335
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:12,026
Why not make the terms of
a merger performance-based.

336
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:13,053
- Exactly.
- Huh?

337
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:14,191
- What he just said.
- Yeah.

338
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:15,928
I move we vote
on the terms of the merger.

339
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,731
- I second.
- And what he... what that guy said.

340
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,135
But... What both those guys said.

341
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:22,368
God damn it, Bob! I'm about to reach
over there and tear you a new asshole!

342
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:23,466
Don't be a jackass.

343
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,443
- It makes sense.
- Fuck you, Bob! We talked this out!

344
00:15:25,478 --> 00:15:27,036
I don't see a need
for that kinda language.

345
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:28,706
Now, if you wanna go outside
right now...

346
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:31,444
I'll take both of you fuckers out
right damn now!

347
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:32,917
We're not gonna fight,
we're gonna vote!

348
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,715
- Let's vote!
- Let's vote...

349
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,051
and then we'll fight!

350
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,056
Come on, guys...

351
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,990
you should be juiced right now.

352
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,586
This is a chance to become
a real NBA franchise.

353
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:43,925
Man, get outta town.

354
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,261
Ain't no way in Sam Hill
we gonna make it to fourth place.

355
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:47,526
- Nope.
- Yeah, Jackie...

356
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,329
we have a horseshit record right now.

357
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:52,269
Yeah, well, we just need to start
hittin' our threes, OK?

358
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,932
That's not the problem, Jackie.
The problem is...

359
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:56,339
we suck.

360
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,073
Scootsie, you did not deserve that.

361
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,807
- I know.
- I apologize.

362
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:04,747
Stop that shit, man.

363
00:16:04,784 --> 00:16:07,981
We do not suck, OK?

364
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,511
I been doin' a lot of thinkin'.

365
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:14,617
Decided to add someone to our team
to add some real firepower, OK?

366
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,094
I think this guy
could give us a new spark.

367
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,756
Now, don't get mad.

368
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:21,430
- At point guard...
- At point guard?

369
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,094
...five-ten...

370
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:25,729
I traded away our
washing machine to get him.

371
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,762
He punches in bunches.

372
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:30,799
Ed Monix!

373
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:35,511
Toilet's clogged.

374
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:38,346
Hell, no.
You traded for Monix?

375
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:39,908
Yeah.

376
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:41,715
This guy's an old warrior, come on.

377
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:42,846
Yeah, he old.

378
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:45,015
He can shoot the basketball.

379
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:47,116
Most importantly,
he actually agreed to come here.

380
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,990
So?

381
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:54,364
It's a thrill to be in Flint.
Smells Tropical in here.

382
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,994
Now, look, I know
just about everyone...

383
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:59,527
in this locker room has been
punched in the face by this guy...

384
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:00,766
at some point in time.

385
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:03,104
And maybe even one of us has...

386
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:06,839
had his collarbone broken... twice.

387
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:07,868
Sorry, Twig.

388
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:09,437
Thanks, Ed.

389
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:11,780
Hey, how are your mom and sister?

390
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:14,445
It's been about 12 weeks
since I porked 'em.

391
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:19,049
Let's not talk about porking
of the moms and the sisters...

392
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:22,026
because we only have
one rule on this team.

393
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:23,688
What is that rule, Twiggy?

394
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:24,787
E-L-E.

395
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,525
That's right, E-L-E.

396
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:28,032
And what does "E-L-E" stand for?

397
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,364
"Everybody Love Everybody".

398
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:31,892
"Everybody Love Everybody".

399
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,336
Right there up on the wall.

400
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:35,135
Got that, Monix?

401
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:36,539
- Nope.
- Great.

402
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,907
'Cause this isn't just
a basketball team...

403
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:41,378
this is a lifestyle.

404
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,675
Welcome aboard, Monix.

405
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,012
Thank you.
Good to be here.

406
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:45,880
All right.

407
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,910
Oh, if you see a possum...

408
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:51,422
try to kill it, OK?

409
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:53,015
It's not a pet.

410
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,228
Welcome back to Tropics Weekly.

411
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,064
The ABA has announced...

412
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:07,436
that the top four teams will merge
with the NBA after this season.

413
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,462
Seizing the opportunity...

414
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:12,910
owner/player/coach Jackie Moon
has already made the first move...

415
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:15,470
acquiring Ed Monix
from the Kentucky Colonels.

416
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:16,708
Yeah!

417
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,376
I'm a pretty aggressive owner.

418
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:21,944
When I heard Kentucky needed
a washing machine, I looked at ours...

419
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:23,784
even though we need ours.

420
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:25,813
I said, "I gotta pull the trigger on this."

421
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,416
- Hey, honey!
- It seemed appropriate.

422
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,189
- Guess who got traded to Flint?
- Who?

423
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:31,389
Monix!

424
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:35,262
Why the hell would he
want to come to Flint?

425
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:38,297
I have no idea.

426
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:39,634
Who cares, right? I mean...

427
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:43,503
He's got an NBA ring
and he's playing for the Tropics.

428
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,009
Can you believe that?

429
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:47,239
No, I can't.

430
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:51,178
I'll get it.

431
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,448
It's like, if you watch a porn movie,
doesn't mean you got laid.

432
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:57,649
No, no. In fact,
it often means the opposite.

433
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,022
Monix was an All-American
at Michigan State...

434
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,219
then went on to...

435
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:02,652
- Hey.
- Hey.

436
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:03,684
You look great.

437
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:04,718
Why are you here?

438
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:08,357
Got traded. Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,527
I mean, why are you here?

440
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,302
Can we talk?

441
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,831
- Monix!
- Hey.

442
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,864
- What's up?
- Yeah.

443
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,468
That ol' jump shot of yours
ain't broke yet, is it?

444
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,172
Not yet.

445
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:23,443
Man... hey!

446
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:24,471
Great backdoor cut...

447
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:27,041
for the lay-up against the Amigos
last Friday night, man.

448
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:29,919
Yeah. That's the way
basketball should be played!

449
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:30,979
- Yeah.
- Up there.

450
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:34,254
- Yeah...
- Too slow!

451
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,193
Hey, can you give us
a second, please?

452
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:39,561
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks, Kyle.

453
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,992
You're his favorite player.

454
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:46,061
I'd feel more comfortable
if he hated me.

455
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:50,542
Listen, I hope you didn't agree
to this trade because of me.

456
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,942
What if I did?

457
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:57,813
Then you'd be stuck
in Flint, Michigan for no reason.

458
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,874
You know what?

459
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,646
You said you wanted to leave basketball
at the top of your game.

460
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,085
When are you gonna quit?

461
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:06,080
I'm at the top of my game.
I'm very close to the top.

462
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:13,722
I just got traded for a fuckin' washing
machine. What am I talkin' about?

463
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:16,291
Good night, Ed.

464
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:21,135
Thanks for the pep talk.

465
00:20:26,612 --> 00:20:30,343
Ed Monix is a tenacious defender,
and he can hit the big shots.

466
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:33,681
- When he's not drunk.
- Which is never.

467
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:36,313
Look, there's nothing in the rulebook
that says you can't play drunk.

468
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:37,720
No, actually, there is.

469
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:39,747
Remember those 30 rebounds
against San Diego?

470
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:40,918
Yeah.

471
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,790
- I don't remember 'em.
- Oh, no.

472
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,386
- Amaretto stone sours.
- Yes.

473
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,920
- I will never believe that.
- All game long.

474
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,761
- No way.
- I mixed 'em!

475
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,394
- Doesn't leave the table.
- Yeah.

476
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:52,427
Look, guys, you ain't gotta worry.

477
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:55,907
'Cause tomorrow when I get this cast
taken off, I'll be back on the team...

478
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,501
and I will be rainin' down some threes!

479
00:20:58,544 --> 00:21:02,207
Cornelius, you're a good friend,
but that arm hasn't properly healed...

480
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:05,239
and I've told you 100 times
you're never gonna play for the Tropics.

481
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:06,546
You're a terrible athlete.

482
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:10,851
Come on, man! I'm a excellent athlete.
Look, I broke this arm playin' for you.

483
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:14,017
No, you broke it
playing with me in the driveway.

484
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,253
You can't even make a lay-up.

485
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:17,660
I'm an injured player, man.
I should be on the bench.

486
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,527
No, you're not on the team.

487
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:21,965
Well, in my fantasy life,
I'm on the team.

488
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,730
Well, let's just keep it that way, right?

489
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,295
My God. What the fuck is that?
It's incredible.

490
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,772
It's called fondue.

491
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:31,435
- Fon what?
- Fondue.

492
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:35,504
Three different cheeses, melted.
That's what you're tasting.

493
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:38,072
Gorgonzola, muenster and cottage.

494
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:40,085
It's the latest thing
from Sweden, apparently.

495
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,418
Well, I'm not surprised by that.
The Swedes are so inventive, aren't they?

496
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:44,615
- They are.
- Yep.

497
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:47,420
They are my favorite producers
of pornography.

498
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:49,757
They make an excellent fuck picture.

499
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:53,731
Well, I think I'll excuse myself
from this conversation right now.

500
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,666
- To the men's room.
- Stop it!

501
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:56,861
To make your wiener sing.

502
00:21:56,902 --> 00:21:58,893
Boner machine.

503
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:00,700
I am not a boner machine, now.

504
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:02,639
Swedish porn saved my life in 'Nam.

505
00:22:02,674 --> 00:22:04,232
- OK.
- Great, here we go.

506
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:06,506
- C'mon! Fuck you guys!
- Let me get my violin.

507
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:07,534
Swedish porn was the only thing...

508
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:09,672
that kept my mind off Charlie
when I was in the shit.

509
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:12,980
Is the shit in Ann Arbor? 'Cause
that's where you were during the war.

510
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:15,350
- He really believes it.
- You were never in 'Nam...

511
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:18,720
- Nope.
...you jive turkey.

512
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:31,326
You just call me a jive turkey?

513
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,633
No. No, he did not.

514
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:39,906
- He called you cocksucker.
- Yeah.

515
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:41,003
- Yeah.
- Right, Cornelius?

516
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:42,877
Yeah, yeah.
I just called you cocksucker.

517
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:45,475
I'm pretty sure that
you called me a jive turkey.

518
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:49,715
No, no. Now, Lou,
nobody called anyone a JT.

519
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:52,246
Jive turkey is a little over the line,
my man!

520
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,758
Look, we're all here.

521
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,056
We all heard what was said
and we're in agreement.

522
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:58,028
- Cornelius said cocksucker.
- Yes.

523
00:22:58,063 --> 00:22:59,052
- Right?
- Yeah.

524
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:02,726
- He just said you suck cock.
- That's all he said about you.

525
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:06,898
Now, come on. Dig into that fondue,
you little cocksucker.

526
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:10,398
- We like playing games, don't we?
- We do, we're playing one right now!

527
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:14,640
I'm gonna show you guys
this game that I learned...

528
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,274
- when I was in fucking 'Nam!
- No, no, no, no!

529
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:18,715
Lou. Lou.

530
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,911
Who's the jive turkey now?

531
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,722
Gun's not loaded!

532
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,126
- You son of a bitch!
- It's not loaded!

533
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,221
It's not loaded!

534
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:35,392
You shoulda seen your goddamn face!

535
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:37,994
There's no bullets in there!
I never load it!

536
00:23:38,036 --> 00:23:40,732
The gun was not loaded.

537
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,774
I'll see you fuckers in hell!

538
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:51,444
<i>Jackie, Love Me Sexy
is the worst song I've ever heard.</i>

539
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:57,545
Watch this! I did call you jive turkey.

540
00:23:58,423 --> 00:24:01,051
He did!

541
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:05,928
I got one. Hey, Lou, I know
you slept with Mrs. Pepperfield!

542
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:10,599
We're saying nutty things
'cause they're not true.

543
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:13,503
- My! Yeah.
- Especially that. More than the rest.

544
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,235
- He's jonesing you.
- It never happened.

545
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:18,209
- Hey. Bond.
- She's not ugly.

546
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:20,609
- James Bond.
- There it is.

547
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:24,013
- How do you like your martini, sir?
- Stirred, in a half-carafe.

548
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,480
- He shoots himself.
- He shoots himself in the wiener.

549
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:40,665
- Everybody OK?
- I think so.

550
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:43,293
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

551
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:47,697
We just literally dodged a bullet.

552
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,299
We sure did!

553
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:52,003
- We certainly...
- Except for Cornelius.

554
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,147
I did get shot!

555
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:01,276
- My God.
- Wow!

556
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:05,115
# Mr. Big Stuff #

557
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:06,818
# Who do you think you are? #

558
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:09,884
# Mr. Big Stuff #

559
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:13,125
# You're never gonna get my love #

560
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:14,530
# Now because you wear #

561
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:16,329
Vakidis, open the window, will ya?

562
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:17,665
Yes, right on.

563
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:21,670
Did you give Bobby Dee a hand job?

564
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:23,470
Yes, right on.

565
00:25:23,508 --> 00:25:25,203
Hey, Monix...

566
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:27,177
what were the Celtics like?

567
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:28,907
Well, they were fast.

568
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:32,383
Fast? Man. Clarence should play
for the Celtics, then. That boy can fly.

569
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,180
Downtown,
that's all he ever talk about.

570
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:36,244
"I'm goin' to the NBA, I'm goin'
to the NBA." Every day he say that.

571
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:38,848
No, I don't.
Why don't you just shut up, man?

572
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,690
Say, Monix, why don't you let us
see that championship ring, man?

573
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:45,720
Don't think nobody here
ever seen a championship ring before.

574
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:46,924
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:48,660
- Yes!
- Yo, man, let me see it!

576
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,100
Holy balls.

577
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:54,003
My God, look at this right here.
"Champion" in sparkling gold.

578
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,802
Man, why are you wearing that
on your neck?

579
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:58,105
If I had a ring like that,
I'd have it on my finger every day...

580
00:25:58,143 --> 00:26:00,168
so the honeys could see it.

581
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:01,907
I'm not quite as flashy as you.

582
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:04,541
I just like wearing it
around my neck, that's all.

583
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,244
- That's cool, man.
- I hear that.

584
00:26:06,284 --> 00:26:08,718
He should be embarrassed.

585
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:12,249
Embarrassed?

586
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,259
He sat through every playoff game.

587
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:18,091
Then he gonna walk around us
with all the shine...

588
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,189
like he some kind of hero or somethin'.

589
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:22,632
Come on, Clarence.
You're just actin' jealous.

590
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:29,540
Whatever. I ain't never rode the bench
and then go call myself a champion.

591
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:33,305
Somebody need to snatch that ring
off his sorry neck.

592
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:34,835
- You wanna snatch it? Come on.
- l...

593
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,041
- Be my guest.
- I don't think your knees can take it.

594
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:40,779
Hey! Hey, I got a ring up here too.
Mine says love.

595
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:44,478
Think about that.

596
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:49,758
Everybody love everybody!

597
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:51,194
Come on!

598
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:53,663
Eleven more hours to go.

599
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:03,839
This way, this way.
Let's go, Tropics. Keep it alive.

600
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,503
Keep it alive, right here!
Throw it in the blender.

601
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:07,910
No! Changed my mind.
Right back, though.

602
00:27:07,946 --> 00:27:09,709
- OK. OK.
- Right back to you. Give it back again!

603
00:27:09,748 --> 00:27:11,147
- You got it.
- No, right back.

604
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:12,980
- No?
- Yeah. Yeah.

605
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:15,282
- Sure?
- Yeah. Right back. Come on, now. No.

606
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,117
Right back, reset.
Throw it to Papa.

607
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:18,179
- No, right back out.
- All right.

608
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:19,747
- Right back. Right back.
- Here you go, Jackie.

609
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,053
- Back to you. Right back, though.
- You're right. OK.

610
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:22,082
Shoot!

611
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,287
- All right, right on.
- Clear. Yeah.

612
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,761
- You ready?
- No, right back.

613
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:26,263
- No?
- Yeah. OK, clear.

614
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:27,287
- All right, I'm goin'.
- My turn.

615
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:29,664
Yeah, I'll bet my alleged son
he won't make this.

616
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:31,896
Jackie Moon finally making a move...

617
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:35,805
- and it is worth the wait!
- All day long!

618
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:37,900
- Traveling!
- No, no, no, no! One and a half steps!

619
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:42,880
- Come on, Jackie. You walked.
- Suck my cock! I'll murder your family!

620
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,346
- You're gone, Jackie Moon!
- What? What?

621
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:47,874
Jackie Moon is ejected from the game.

622
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,114
- What did I say?
- You said, "S my C."

623
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:55,784
And one lucky fan
will go home with a game ball.

624
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:56,987
That's your head next time.

625
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:58,359
You're a big baby, Jackie.
You cannot tell me to S my C.

626
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,489
Jackie Moon and the referee
really going at it here.

627
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,466
- I didn't say anything.
- You said, "S my C."

628
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,662
- I barely raised my voice.
- I should call your mother.

629
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:07,001
You need a phone to heaven to do that.

630
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:09,029
- Maybe your ma didn't go to heaven.
- Oh, dear.

631
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:11,702
Oh, my. Oh, no.

632
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,636
OK. Everyone off the floor.
Let's go. Tropics, let's go.

633
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:15,873
Why... No, Jackie.

634
00:28:15,914 --> 00:28:19,509
It appears a line has been crossed
by Father Pat of all people.

635
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:21,849
- Look, Jackie, I'm sorry.
- Stop the broadcast.

636
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:25,687
Jackie Moon is pulling his team
off the court.

637
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:27,783
You forfeit this game, Jackie,
if you keep walking.

638
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:31,489
- That's fine.
- You threatened to kill my family!

639
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,498
God damn it, Pat.
What the hell's wrong with you?

640
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:37,491
Don't get on your high horse, Redwood.
Thank you, Dick, for staying.

641
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:41,370
And that will do it from St. Louis,
where the score is inconclusive.

642
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,704
Good night.

643
00:28:43,742 --> 00:28:45,369
- Dick.
- That's it.

644
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,934
We go to church together.

645
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:48,741
Not anymore.

646
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,716
# Hey, Flint Tropics, welcome back,
give the Amigos a heart attack #

647
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:53,945
I tried, Jackie.

648
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:56,044
They won't take it.

649
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,816
Look, I don't know
what your bank is telling you.

650
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:00,552
This is a real check.
I signed it myself.

651
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:02,856
It's written in glitter, man.

652
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:06,990
Can't you just, you know, like,
write me a regular-size check?

653
00:29:07,032 --> 00:29:09,967
Maybe you should try a different bank.
A big bank.

654
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,231
- Bigger bank?
- That has a big check department.

655
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,862
- That's what I'd do.
- OK.

656
00:29:13,905 --> 00:29:15,566
- Right? All right.
- Yeah.

657
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,905
Scootsie, he is takin' you to town!

658
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:20,036
Get him, Twig. C'mon!

659
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,069
There we go.

660
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:25,207
- All right, guys. Hey, listen up.
- Hey, hey.

661
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,277
Let's go. Eyes up here.
Turn that contraption off. Come on.

662
00:29:29,888 --> 00:29:32,584
Look, just got off the phone
with the Commissioner.

663
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:35,422
He convinced the board
to pass another merger rule.

664
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,090
We gotta average 2,000 fans per
home game for the rest of the season.

665
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,792
- Two thou every home game?
- Damn. What?

666
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:45,030
Commissioner says they're not gonna
take a franchise that doesn't have fans.

667
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,834
- He's being a real dick.
- Good Lord, Jackie Moon.

668
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:53,607
Winning these games is gonna be hard,
but 2,000 fans? Impossible, man.

669
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:56,739
It's OK, Scootsie.
'Cause I got a plan. All right?

670
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:59,716
Now, you all know
we're the ABA game of the week, right?

671
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:03,414
Could be a lot of television cameras
out there, so we just gotta be tiptop.

672
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,252
So, what's the plan?

673
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,655
I brought a secret weapon.

674
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:08,921
It's gonna make us
look extra cool on TV.

675
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,621
What the hell is that?

676
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:12,892
It's eyeliner, dummy.

677
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:15,429
Now who's first? Monix?

678
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:20,771
Yeah. Just let me get a fresh Maxi Pad
out of my purse.

679
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:26,507
Looks like Jackie Moon has brought a
trick from Broadway to the court tonight.

680
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:29,944
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap.

681
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:31,175
Point of no return.
Go back. Go back.

682
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:33,116
Horse in the trailer.
Nowhere to go.

683
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:35,278
Hey. Look at my eyes.
No, look at my eyes.

684
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,880
Are you scared? Tropical storm.
Eye of the hurricane.

685
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,653
I'm gonna hypnotize you.
I'm not gonna blink. I'm not gonna blink.

686
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:43,354
- Look at me.
- Where you goin'? Where you goin'?

687
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:46,523
Jackie tips the ball away.
Twiggy picks it up and takes it in.

688
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:49,397
- Two points, Tropics.
- Way to go, Twiggy!

689
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,299
Make sure the camera gets your eyes!

690
00:30:51,336 --> 00:30:55,295
- This team is on fire early in the game.
- They're flamin', all right.

691
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,241
Nice lay-up.
Nice lay-up, Twiggy.

692
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:01,734
- Who's got character now?
- My confidence is sky-high right now.

693
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:05,079
What's with Vakidis?

694
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:08,579
What the hell's wrong with Vakidis?

695
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,555
Shit! Your eyeliner's running.

696
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:13,887
Yeah. Yours is kinda smoky too.

697
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:15,222
All right, everyone.
Try not to sweat if you can.

698
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,285
Hell, no. This shit
burnin' already, man.

699
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:19,388
- Yeah, it kinda is.
- Goddamn.

700
00:31:19,431 --> 00:31:20,523
I'm going to the bench, man. Move!

701
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:21,589
- What's happening?
- Shit!

702
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:23,726
The Tropics seem to be
disabled in some way.

703
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:25,929
God, it burns.

704
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:29,099
Do they test this on animals
or is that just a lie?

705
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,165
Feels like I got cat piss in my eyes!

706
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,234
Just open your eyes with your fingers,
guys. It's really nice.

707
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:34,836
Cock sandwich, that hurts!

708
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,176
- Fuckin' idiots.
- That feels really good.

709
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,774
Monix, where's your makeup, buddy?

710
00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:42,150
Hey, how come it says Monix on
your jersey when your name's Pussy?

711
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:44,121
- I was curious about this...
- Fuck you, Petrelli.

712
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:46,385
- Hey, hey, Monix!
- Get your hands off me!

713
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:49,518
- Get back here! You little bitch!
- We're on TV!

714
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:52,189
- I don't give a shit!
- Commissioner's watching.

715
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,290
- You wanna kill the merger? C'mon.
- Everybody relax.

716
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,166
Looks like a little gentleman's
disagreement on the court. Nothing big.

717
00:31:58,203 --> 00:31:59,670
No, these girls aren't gonna fight.

718
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:02,571
No, but a little bit of a delay
in play for a moment here.

719
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:05,269
What about during commercial?

720
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,108
Yeah, I like it. Yeah, it's good.

721
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:11,582
- Father Pat, timeout.
- Timeout, white!

722
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:15,313
It's a timeout on the floor, with 9 minutes
and 16 seconds left in the first.

723
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:16,980
The Tropics two, the Amigos six.

724
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:20,458
And we'll be right back
after these messages from Shasta.

725
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:22,050
And, clear.

726
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:23,560
Somebody hit somebody!

727
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,689
Here we go.

728
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:32,661
- Come on!
- Get him!

729
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:36,834
This is a good old-fashioned
bare-fisted brawl here on the court.

730
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:38,934
My goodness.

731
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:43,402
Look at the Russian bear go.
Throwing people around like rag dolls.

732
00:32:43,448 --> 00:32:48,147
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

733
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:51,087
Look at Monix take it to Petrelli. I wish
the people at home could see this.

734
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:52,111
I could hurt someone.

735
00:32:52,157 --> 00:32:56,218
New Red Apple Soda with a great taste
and tingle they're still looking for.

736
00:32:56,261 --> 00:32:58,729
# Why can't we be friends? #

737
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:00,754
# Why can't we be friends? #

738
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,666
- # Why can't we be friends? #
- Get him! Get him!

739
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:06,295
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

740
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:09,738
Honestly, Dick, I could watch this all day.
This is terr... Look at Father Pat!

741
00:33:09,774 --> 00:33:12,038
Father Pat is getting
the worst of a lot of this.

742
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,544
Stop!

743
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,478
- # Why can't we be friends? #
- And we're back in three...

744
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:18,175
- # Why can't we be friends? #
...two, one...

745
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:21,812
Welcome back
to your ABA game of the week.

746
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:23,844
I'll tell you, the spirit
and camaraderie of this league...

747
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:25,981
is on full display here tonight, Lou.

748
00:33:26,024 --> 00:33:28,959
Yeah, yeah, you got that right, Dick.

749
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:29,982
Lou!

750
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:33,964
Come on, Jack! They won't come back
in here no more!

751
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:36,057
- Then I just kicked him!
- Man.

752
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:39,332
- Still got it, J.
- Now, that is how you play basketball.

753
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,895
- That's right.
- You hear those fans? They loved it!

754
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,202
- Man!
- Right on.

755
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:45,436
Monix, you got Petrelli's ass!

756
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:48,446
I mean, I was out there grabbin' balls.
I think I grabbed some of your guys' balls.

757
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,469
Damn!

758
00:33:49,514 --> 00:33:51,641
- That was you on my nuts?
- Yeah.

759
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:53,776
You got the softest hands in the world.

760
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:57,811
All right, this is what we do.
Tae kwon do sessions every practice.

761
00:33:57,856 --> 00:34:00,154
In fact, we don't need...

762
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:03,683
Does anybody here wanna talk
about the fucking game?

763
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:05,093
God, this guy's a bummer.

764
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,792
Did anyone look at the scoreboard?

765
00:34:07,832 --> 00:34:10,494
How about we run some plays
in the second half, Jackie?

766
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:14,062
Look, Monix, I'm not an X's and O's guy,
right? I'm not a tactician.

767
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:16,972
I'm a motivator
in the classic sense of the word.

768
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:20,637
You know, Lombardi,
Charles Lindbergh...

769
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:23,772
that nun over in India, like those people.

770
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,943
I get people to do great things!

771
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:31,285
And we just had an incredible,
team-unifying moment...

772
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:33,950
by punching other guys in the face.

773
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:34,981
And it felt good...

774
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:38,223
and now we're gonna continue that
on the court in the second half...

775
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:39,753
with baskets, though.

776
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,595
We need a game plan, Jackie.

777
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:45,660
So he the expert. He should know.

778
00:34:45,703 --> 00:34:47,193
He done seen the game
from every angle...

779
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:48,500
- sittin' on the bench.
- Damn!

780
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,772
Hey, guess what? The Celtics weren't
just all-stars, they were a team. A team!

781
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:57,270
As opposed to a bunch of selfish
assholes tryin' to look cool every night.

782
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:58,976
I mean, call us what you want to...

783
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:02,578
but we ain't never sat around
and pretended like we some champions.

784
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:09,287
Yeah, you got a little ring and all,
but you personally, you ain't won shit.

785
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,598
Clarence, I want you to have this ring...

786
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:19,001
as a token
of what you will never achieve.

787
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:22,063
Champion or not,
at least I played the game.

788
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:23,937
And I got news for you, Clarence...

789
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:27,877
for all your flash,
you are never gonna play in the NBA.

790
00:35:27,912 --> 00:35:30,972
You are pissing your career away.

791
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:33,677
And one day,
you're gonna look back on your life...

792
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:38,712
and you're gonna realize that you never
even learned how to play basketball.

793
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:01,706
Jeez!

794
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:03,737
What the hell?

795
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:06,945
Shit.

796
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:08,976
Get your hands in the air.

797
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,459
Monix, bail's been set.

798
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,561
Lynn, can I ask you a favor?

799
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:27,537
You mean besides
bailing your ass outta jail?

800
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:29,369
Lynn, no one can drain it like you.

801
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:33,867
I think I drained all I can out of there.

802
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:36,072
- That hurt?
- Not really.

803
00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:38,480
- How about that?
- Yeah.

804
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:39,915
Good.

805
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:46,516
Listen. This is long overdue,
but I wanna apologize.

806
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:49,759
For what?

807
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:55,130
For, you know, back then
we had some problems.

808
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:58,897
Did you wanna apologize
for cheating on me?

809
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,301
Twice.

810
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:02,931
Hey, I cheated on you once.

811
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:06,410
There just happened
to be two girls there.

812
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:09,641
- Still not funny?
- Still not funny.

813
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:13,006
And where's the necklace I made you?

814
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,420
Monix, it was the high point
of your career.

815
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:20,014
I didn't deserve that ring, Lynn.

816
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:23,926
I hardly played.
I was never the guy to hit the big shot.

817
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:26,691
Wanna know why
things didn't work out between us?

818
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:27,720
Yeah.

819
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:32,225
You hate yourself so much
it's impossible to love you.

820
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:36,331
Kinda brutally honest.

821
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:41,777
Did we have some fun?

822
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:43,144
You're kind of fun.

823
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:45,945
Didn't we?

824
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:48,383
Sometimes.

825
00:37:55,727 --> 00:37:59,128
- What are you doing?
- There he is.

826
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:02,564
- Been lookin' all over for you.
- Like it. Sweaty.

827
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,330
See ya later, Ed. 'Scuse me, guys.

828
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,701
Excused.

829
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:10,139
Doin' your girl in the locker room?
Classy.

830
00:38:10,174 --> 00:38:14,133
- What are you guys doin' here?
- We want you to coach the team.

831
00:38:15,747 --> 00:38:18,011
- What?
- You know the game better than Jackie.

832
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:22,145
I'm flattered, but I don't think
Jackie would be too happy about this.

833
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:25,747
Come on, don't worry about Jackie.
I mean, I got this.

834
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,621
OK, Tropics, hustle up.

835
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:30,885
Five, six, seven, eight.

836
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:34,955
One and two and three and four,
and turn like you mean it.

837
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,296
Arch that back, Bee Bee.

838
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:38,734
I like it. Good rotation.

839
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,998
Beautiful, seahorses.

840
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:41,334
Leg kick, Scootsie.

841
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:44,273
Nice! And freeze it.

842
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,143
And then we start the game.

843
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:51,170
Now, when I say freeze it...

844
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:53,775
you guys gotta freeze it, OK?

845
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:56,783
- Hey!
- Hey.

846
00:38:56,821 --> 00:38:58,379
You're back. All right.

847
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:01,517
We got a extra costume
right over there for you.

848
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:06,292
I'm not here to do whatever this is.
What is this?

849
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:12,132
What is this? Come on, man,
this is the future of basketball, OK?

850
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,765
This is entertainment.
You'll get it. You'll catch on.

851
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:24,144
Look, Jackie. Now, don't get mad,
but some of us got together...

852
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:26,742
and we aksed old Monix
if he'd teach us a little bit.

853
00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:28,877
Wait, what do you mean, teach us?

854
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,687
I teach you guys things.
Like expert choreography and stuff.

855
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:35,783
No.

856
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:39,524
We wanna give Monix
a chance to coach, Coach.

857
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:43,526
What's goin' on here?

858
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,196
What is this?

859
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:49,537
Clarence?

860
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:54,671
This is a mutiny.

861
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:58,315
You guys all in on this?

862
00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:05,112
You motherfuckin' cocksuckers.

863
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:07,283
All of you.

864
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:12,494
I have dedicated my life
to this team, OK?

865
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,896
I have given you guys my soul!

866
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:19,868
I mean, who bought you
those boots last Halloween?

867
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:22,372
That would be you, Coach.
You bought us those boots.

868
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:23,395
I bought 'em!

869
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:25,102
I really liked them boots.
They were nice.

870
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:27,303
They're really nice boots.

871
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,937
Yeah, we love ya.

872
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,144
But Monix just knows
the X's and O's, baby. That's all.

873
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:36,085
Come on, come on,
don't turn your back on us.

874
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,748
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen.

875
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:44,490
How about this, I'll be the offensive
and defensive coordinator...

876
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:47,623
and you can still be head coach.

877
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:52,232
And you're the best promoter.
We gonna need fans, right?

878
00:40:53,337 --> 00:40:55,134
Do you guys really think
I'm a good promoter?

879
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:58,073
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know you are, man.

880
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:01,101
- I'm probably the best in the league.
- Yeah, that's what they say.

881
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:02,510
- Top three.
- Yup.

882
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,412
- Right up there.
- Yeah.

883
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:06,211
OK.

884
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:14,285
If we play unselfish, fundamental
basketball, we can make a run at this.

885
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:20,190
By unselfish, I mean we sprint up
the court on every fast break...

886
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:23,928
not because we might get a dunk and
get your dick sucked after the game...

887
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,335
but because sprinting might pull
the defense out of position...

888
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:29,703
Wait, wait, wait, wait. So what's goin' on
with the blow jobs again?

889
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,970
Yeah, 'cause I vote
we keep them blow jobs, Jack.

890
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:35,877
- Yeah. All in favor?
- Come on, let the man talk.

891
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,608
Thank you, Clarence.

892
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:40,845
Now, till we start playing
like a real team...

893
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,489
we're gonna practice without the ball.

894
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:49,021
That's a waste.

895
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,528
OK, let's run the offense!

896
00:41:52,964 --> 00:41:55,762
- Without a ball?
- Yeah, without the ball, Clarence.

897
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,098
Let's go, everybody get in position.

898
00:41:58,135 --> 00:42:02,071
- Patch that ball up, Scootsie.
- Come on! Hustle!

899
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:04,131
OK, Clarence, flash through the lane.

900
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:06,871
- Hustle, Clarence!
- Come on, come on.

901
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:07,900
Ball, ball, ball!

902
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,607
We been runnin'
the same play all day.

903
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:12,741
Yeah, can we maybe try
play number two?

904
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:16,014
No! I want you to be brain-dead,
gentlemen!

905
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:20,080
'Cause someday you're gonna be
too tired or too nervous to think.

906
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:23,525
And when you are,
this is the play that I'm gonna call.

907
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:26,257
We need to be able to run
this play in our sleep.

908
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:28,857
I'm a rover, Coach.
I'm just gonna go rover.

909
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:31,493
No, don't just go rovin'.
Run the play, Jackie Moon.

910
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:33,093
I'm creatin' a diversion, though...

911
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:35,867
- by runnin' in circles over here.
- Don't lose your mind, Jackie Moon.

912
00:42:35,906 --> 00:42:37,874
We are runnin' this until we puke.

913
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:40,900
- Well, basically, we have.
- Yeah, I'm pretty beat, Coach.

914
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:43,243
"Until we puke"
is not a figure of speech.

915
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,214
We are literally going to puke.

916
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:46,944
What does he mean by "literally"?

917
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:53,454
I wish you were still
a washing machine!

918
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:57,086
Get up and run, Coach!
You're gonna puke like everybody else!

919
00:42:57,128 --> 00:43:01,394
I can't puke, Monix!
I've never puked in my life, ever!

920
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:02,660
You're lying to me.

921
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,397
I've been sick before, I've just never
puked. Swear on my mother's grave.

922
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:10,066
What about when you were a baby?
Babies throw up all the time.

923
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:13,668
My mom said I never did it. I swear.

924
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:16,813
She said I was fascinating.

925
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:21,216
In fact, the local PBS wanted to do
a documentary on me.

926
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:24,817
Have you ever been punched
in the jejunum?

927
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,755
No, what's a jejunum?

928
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,986
It's part of the small intestine.

929
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:30,721
I don't think so.

930
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:35,164
I mean, I've been punched in the armpit
before, and in the wrist twice.

931
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:39,926
Coccyx, and in the back of the knee.

932
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:44,066
Both eyes, and I've been punched
right in my tracheal...

933
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:05,259
Let that out.

934
00:44:06,397 --> 00:44:08,695
Go ahead, Jackie. Just let it go.

935
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:12,868
Hey, hey, hey.

936
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:18,869
Get ahold of yourself, Jackie!

937
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:22,709
Let go! Hold it in, Jackie!
Hold it in!

938
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:24,772
Get off me, God damn it!

939
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:26,180
Jackie!

940
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:35,717
We are seeing a very different Tropics
basketball team than we're used to...

941
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,022
aren't we, Lou?

942
00:44:37,061 --> 00:44:39,393
Playing with a lot of energy
and a lot of confidence.

943
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,522
They're movin' the ball well.

944
00:44:40,564 --> 00:44:43,761
It looks like they're gonna win this game.
The only question is, by how much?

945
00:44:44,902 --> 00:44:46,563
Jangel has the ball now.

946
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:49,038
My gosh, a loose ball on the court
and Clarence dives for it?

947
00:44:49,073 --> 00:44:50,062
Timeout!

948
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,904
That's something we have not seen
before. And a timeout is called.

949
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,307
Timeout, white!

950
00:44:53,344 --> 00:44:55,778
- Hey. Good playin' out there, Jackie.
- Thanks.

951
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:58,281
- Way to go, man.
- Yeah.

952
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:00,840
The crowd is really excited tonight.

953
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:02,182
They know what's at stake, Dick.

954
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:05,586
Yup, gettin' their home team
into the NBA.

955
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:07,022
No, I'm talking about free corn dogs.

956
00:45:07,057 --> 00:45:09,582
That's right.
It's free corn dog night.

957
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:11,117
Fellas, it's lookin' great.

958
00:45:11,162 --> 00:45:12,925
We're 30 seconds away
from takin' this thing.

959
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:17,229
Yeah, he's right. Let's try to win,
but not win by too much.

960
00:45:17,268 --> 00:45:20,066
Wait, we don't want to win by too much?

961
00:45:20,104 --> 00:45:21,332
What the hell are you talkin' about?

962
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:23,602
- Corn dogs.
- What?

963
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:25,199
See, if we score 125 points...

964
00:45:25,242 --> 00:45:27,733
that mean we gotta give everybody
in here a free corn dog, all right?

965
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:30,008
Yeah, sorry, Monix.
We don't even got corn dogs.

966
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:32,447
Corn... I don't care,
we're takin' it to 'em, all right?

967
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:34,417
Hey, we're up by seven, OK?

968
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:37,181
Can't we just take it easy?
Run the clock out?

969
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:38,620
We're talkin' a lot of corn dogs!

970
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:40,248
I don't give a shit
about the corn dogs, all right?

971
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:44,387
We play hard every second. We run
the offense. Everybody got that?

972
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:46,089
- Right on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

973
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,564
You got that, Jackie?

974
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,397
- OK, bring us together, man.
- One, two, three.

975
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:54,131
Let's get Tropical!

976
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:58,403
OK, it looks like we are going
to return to the game. Monix...

977
00:45:58,442 --> 00:45:59,636
- Hey, Monix.
...has the ball.

978
00:45:59,677 --> 00:46:01,907
You wanna just throw it to me? I can
get it to Clarence. That might be easier.

979
00:46:01,946 --> 00:46:03,345
Jackie, move!

980
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,814
Ball, ball, ball, ball,
ball, ball, ball! Ball!

981
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,478
- Nice, Monix!
- Monix inbounds to Clarence.

982
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,384
OK. Come on, Clarence,
take your time.

983
00:46:10,421 --> 00:46:12,150
Come on, Nets, play some defense.

984
00:46:13,257 --> 00:46:15,157
You wanna go for the double team?
Might be a good time.

985
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:16,921
Double team, double team.

986
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:19,054
I won't do anything
if I get the ball, I promise.

987
00:46:19,096 --> 00:46:22,588
He'll go with his right. He loves
his right one. He likes the right hand.

988
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:24,100
- What are you doin'?
- Clarence drives.

989
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:26,295
Dishes off to Scootsie.

990
00:46:26,337 --> 00:46:29,636
But look at this, Jackie Moon
blocks his own teammate's shot!

991
00:46:29,673 --> 00:46:31,732
A loose ball on the court,
Vakidis gets it.

992
00:46:31,775 --> 00:46:34,938
No!

993
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:55,957
God damn it, Vakidis!

994
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,695
Learn fuckin' English!

995
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:03,769
Corn dogs, Jackie!
Corn dogs for all these people.

996
00:47:03,807 --> 00:47:08,244
The Tropics win,
and this crowd is going crazy.

997
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:10,474
Crazy for corn dogs.

998
00:47:10,514 --> 00:47:15,451
And Jackie Moon gives us
a victory lap right out the door!

999
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:16,646
# Get up and dance to the music! #

1000
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:18,052
Now, Scootsie, rotate up top.

1001
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,455
Vakidis, flash to the high post.

1002
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:25,019
No, to the high post, Vakidis.
Help him.

1003
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:26,791
Good.

1004
00:47:31,335 --> 00:47:33,064
- At guard...
- # Dance to the music #

1005
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:34,798
...formerly known as Clarence Withers...

1006
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:38,137
- and "Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone...
- # Dance to the music #

1007
00:47:38,175 --> 00:47:39,802
...and Sugar Dunkerton.

1008
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:41,743
- # Dance to the music #
- He's tryin' out his new name tonight.

1009
00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:43,872
Put your hands together for...

1010
00:47:43,914 --> 00:47:47,008
- # Dance to the music #
...Coffee Black.

1011
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:48,746
Coffee Black!

1012
00:47:48,786 --> 00:47:51,482
# Dance to the music #

1013
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:55,253
# You might like to hear
the horns blowin' #

1014
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:58,750
# Cynthia on the throne, yeah! #

1015
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:04,765
Now let's do it again. Jab.

1016
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:06,793
Swing, back.

1017
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:08,566
Good.

1018
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:09,902
That's it.

1019
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:20,682
# Dance to the music #

1020
00:48:21,885 --> 00:48:24,718
# Dance to the music #

1021
00:48:25,556 --> 00:48:27,615
# Dance to the music #

1022
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:32,326
Here they come, the Flint Tropics
Ball Girls cheerleading squad,

1023
00:48:32,363 --> 00:48:34,923
keeping the crowd energized
through the timeout.

1024
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:36,125
They've just got such big...

1025
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,066
- What?
- Hearts.

1026
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:39,763
- Yes.
- Big, bouncy, jiggly hearts.

1027
00:48:39,803 --> 00:48:41,293
Well, hearts don't really bounce...

1028
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:44,330
so now I think you're talking
about something else, Lou.

1029
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:47,268
- # Say it! Get up! #
- Yeah!

1030
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:51,509
Downtown brings the ball up forward and
passes to Monix at the top of the key.

1031
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:53,709
Behind his back to Doubleday.

1032
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:55,218
Scootsie goes for the three-pointer...

1033
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:56,913
and it is good!

1034
00:48:58,222 --> 00:48:59,780
Are you actually havin' fun out here,
Monix?

1035
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:01,848
Hey, don't tell anybody.

1036
00:49:12,669 --> 00:49:15,763
# Dance to the music #

1037
00:49:16,473 --> 00:49:18,941
# Dance to the music #

1038
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:20,136
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

1039
00:49:20,177 --> 00:49:22,668
# Dance to the music #

1040
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:43,558
Well, if it isn't
the toast of Flint, Michigan.

1041
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,536
Shouldn't you be out signing
autographs somewhere or somethin'?

1042
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:54,568
- Will you marry me?
- Shut up.

1043
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:56,704
I'm crazy about you.
You know that.

1044
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,146
Do I?

1045
00:49:58,182 --> 00:50:00,514
You came to one of our games.

1046
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:03,543
Don't think I didn't see you
hiding in the upper deck.

1047
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:08,081
- So?
- So let's do this, Lynn. You and me.

1048
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:11,788
You know, like back in the day.

1049
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:16,323
You know? I mean not then, because
I was an asshole. Better, right?

1050
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:18,231
For real this time.

1051
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:23,068
I need you.

1052
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,301
Yo, Monix!

1053
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:31,474
What's up, man?
Hey, check out the jersey. I'm you!

1054
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:33,745
Yeah.

1055
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:37,445
- Hey, Kyle?
- Yeah.

1056
00:50:37,488 --> 00:50:39,251
Can you do me a big favor?

1057
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,315
Can you go get me a tube of Bengay?

1058
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:47,353
Are you kidding me?
I'd be honored, man. I'll leave right now.

1059
00:50:47,397 --> 00:50:48,386
What do you think you're doing?

1060
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:49,558
- Hey, Kyle?
- Yeah!

1061
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,125
Listen, don't... Kyle?

1062
00:50:52,169 --> 00:50:53,966
- Yeah!
- Don't go to the pharmacy.

1063
00:50:54,004 --> 00:50:57,531
I need one of those big tubes like
you get at Luger's out on Route 59.

1064
00:50:57,574 --> 00:50:59,940
I'm already gone, big man!

1065
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:08,179
Hey, Lynn.
Forgot my stupid wallet.

1066
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,658
That's it.

1067
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,463
Yes.

1068
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,732
# Baby, keep on #

1069
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:32,133
# Come on, baby,
keep on doin' it #

1070
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:35,441
# Right on #

1071
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,777
# Right on doin' it #

1072
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:41,980
# You got it together #

1073
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,043
# Baby, keep on #

1074
00:51:43,086 --> 00:51:45,145
# Oh, you got it together, baby #

1075
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,384
# Right on #

1076
00:51:47,424 --> 00:51:48,584
# Keep on doin' it #

1077
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,560
# And I'll give you,
baby, all that I get #

1078
00:51:52,963 --> 00:51:55,227
- Kyle.
- # Keep on #

1079
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:59,668
- Fuck!
- Monix!

1080
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:01,068
You old dog.

1081
00:52:01,104 --> 00:52:02,969
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Nothin', man.

1082
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:06,237
I'm just sittin' here watching...
and stuff.

1083
00:52:06,276 --> 00:52:07,607
I'm outta here.

1084
00:52:07,644 --> 00:52:11,136
Come on, man, don't be like that.
It's all cool.

1085
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:14,947
No, man. No, believe me, it's not cool.

1086
00:52:14,985 --> 00:52:16,714
I'll call you.

1087
00:52:16,753 --> 00:52:18,414
OK.

1088
00:52:21,692 --> 00:52:23,284
He was talkin' to me.

1089
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:25,255
Yes, ladies and gentlemen...

1090
00:52:25,295 --> 00:52:27,923
Jackie Moon has outdone himself
with this promotion...

1091
00:52:27,965 --> 00:52:31,731
as he prepares to jump
over 47 feet of Ball Girls.

1092
00:52:31,768 --> 00:52:34,601
- # Rollercoaster #
- # Say, what? #

1093
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:38,267
The fact that Jackie's
never been on roller skates before...

1094
00:52:38,308 --> 00:52:40,105
appears to have done nothing
to diminish his confidence.

1095
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:43,010
- # Rollercoaster #
- All right, folks.

1096
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:44,308
Here comes...

1097
00:52:44,348 --> 00:52:47,613
- # Rollercoaster #
...Jackie!

1098
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:50,313
Here he comes down the ramp.

1099
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:53,755
- He is airborne!
- Shit!

1100
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,725
- No!
- Lord!

1101
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:03,056
- Jackie's up!
- # Rollercoaster! #

1102
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:05,701
- Great job!
- # Rollercoaster! #

1103
00:53:05,736 --> 00:53:07,863
And everyone survives!

1104
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:09,804
That was exciting!

1105
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:13,236
- # Of love #
- That's an adrenaline rush.

1106
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,266
# Rollercoaster #

1107
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:17,906
Next time I'm gonna jump
even more girls.

1108
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:22,385
- What?
- The Commissioner just called again.

1109
00:53:22,419 --> 00:53:25,320
- Commish?
- He's drivin' up here on Monday.

1110
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:27,721
- He's comin' to Flint?
- Yes, he's comin' to Flint.

1111
00:53:27,758 --> 00:53:30,249
Shit. Crap.

1112
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:35,155
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1113
00:53:35,198 --> 00:53:38,395
You know, Jackie, we need
2,000 fans in those stands.

1114
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:41,268
We can't fake it this time.
We gotta do somethin'.

1115
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:42,863
Look, it's no problem.
I'll take care of it.

1116
00:53:42,906 --> 00:53:45,170
Yeah? We've tried everything.

1117
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,732
Look, I said I'll handle it, OK?

1118
00:53:46,777 --> 00:53:49,439
- I'll think of somethin'.
- All right.

1119
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:51,208
Back in 30 seconds.

1120
00:53:51,248 --> 00:53:54,012
- How's your wife doin'?
- She's doing just super.

1121
00:53:54,051 --> 00:53:55,348
- She's gorgeous. Yeah.
- Really...

1122
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:57,580
- Thank you, I think. I mean...
- I'd be...

1123
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,112
...hands off.
- I'll try.

1124
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,351
- OK.
- No guarantees.

1125
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:02,915
Really?

1126
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:04,620
I'd like a guarantee.

1127
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,128
Are we back, Chuck?
We're back.

1128
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:08,631
OK. Welcome back
to Tropics Weekly.

1129
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:11,600
I'm joined by owner/player/coach
Jackie Moon.

1130
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:13,933
Jackie, it is always an honor
when you can drop by.

1131
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,460
Always enjoy our time together,
Dick Pepper.

1132
00:54:16,606 --> 00:54:17,595
Dick Pepperfield, actually.

1133
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:18,630
Now, Jackie...

1134
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:22,975
amazingly, you're two wins away
from getting your team to the NBA.

1135
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:26,813
How do you intend to match up
to the Squires' strong inside game?

1136
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,317
It's a great question.

1137
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:33,415
Tomorrow, after the game,
I, Jackie Moon, will wrestle a bear.

1138
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:36,221
Well, that's something...

1139
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:38,750
but defensively, as a team,
how do you...

1140
00:54:38,795 --> 00:54:40,763
That's tomorrow night,
one night only...

1141
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:43,391
watch Dewie the Wrestling Bear
attack me...

1142
00:54:43,433 --> 00:54:45,492
and he's killed people in public before.

1143
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:47,127
Well, OK, that is some entertainment...

1144
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,798
and you are known for
your creative promotions, Jackie, but...

1145
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,467
You're not gonna
want to miss this, folks...

1146
00:54:51,508 --> 00:54:54,204
and if you're a small child, you creep
into your mama's bedroom at night...

1147
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,075
and you lift about 40 bucks...

1148
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:57,375
- outta your mom's purse...
- No, no, no.

1149
00:54:57,414 --> 00:55:00,872
...and you walk down to Flint
Fairgrounds Coliseum, eight o'clock!

1150
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:04,045
There ya have it. Jackie Moon,
thanks so much for joining us.

1151
00:55:04,087 --> 00:55:06,749
Dewie's insane!
He could rip my head off!

1152
00:55:09,192 --> 00:55:13,595
I'm Dick Pepperfield, reminding you
there will be another night.

1153
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,689
Good night, Flint.

1154
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:18,860
Jackie, are you really
gonna wrestle a bear?

1155
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:22,565
- Dick, you're the best.
- And we're clear.

1156
00:55:22,606 --> 00:55:25,166
- Let's go get some pussy.
- Gosh, I don't know.

1157
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:27,836
- Really?
- Yeah.

1158
00:55:27,878 --> 00:55:30,176
- I shouldn't. You know, I shouldn't.
- But you want to.

1159
00:55:30,213 --> 00:55:34,274
Yes, I said I cannot say no to you. We
are gonna get some pussy, aren't we?

1160
00:55:34,317 --> 00:55:36,148
It's gonna be fun.

1161
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:39,950
Come on!

1162
00:55:40,724 --> 00:55:42,555
I'm scared, Clarence.

1163
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:46,653
It's a baby bear.
It's trained and everything.

1164
00:55:46,696 --> 00:55:50,325
I don't care. I'm terrified of those things.
I'm freakin' out.

1165
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:51,857
Come on, get it together.

1166
00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:54,735
I'm startin' to feel really dizzy.

1167
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,068
Break his neck! Come on!

1168
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:58,336
- Wanna call it off?
- No! No.

1169
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:00,866
OK.
I gotta give these people a show.

1170
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:03,175
- Are you guys ready?
- Uh-huh.

1171
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:05,977
- You have to give me your safe word.
- No, I don't need a safe word.

1172
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:10,476
OK, I'll tell you what, if you feel
like you're in danger, just say...

1173
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:12,911
spumoni.

1174
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:15,686
No, I don't need spumoni, OK?
Let's get this show on the road.

1175
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:18,122
Bobby Dee.

1176
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:26,193
- Let's go!
- Go... Go... Go ahead, man.

1177
00:56:28,572 --> 00:56:30,904
What are you afraid of?

1178
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,099
Hey.

1179
00:56:34,778 --> 00:56:36,939
We're both wearing red.

1180
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,211
- Sorry, I'm not ignoring you. I'm just...
- That's stupid, Jackie!

1181
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,775
...trying to deal with him right now.

1182
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:44,184
How long you been
working with the bear?

1183
00:56:44,221 --> 00:56:46,212
Just like a day or so.

1184
00:56:46,256 --> 00:56:47,655
What?

1185
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:50,524
But I've been working with cats
for like 12 years.

1186
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,427
So I'm very familiar with animals.

1187
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:55,431
Great.

1188
00:56:55,465 --> 00:56:57,126
- C'mon!
- Hey, Dewie.

1189
00:56:58,101 --> 00:57:00,729
Fuck that shit!

1190
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,101
I'm outta here. Spumoni.

1191
00:57:02,138 --> 00:57:05,301
No, nope. No, no.
You can't quit now. We just started.

1192
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,839
We got to give these people
a show, man.

1193
00:57:08,879 --> 00:57:10,312
- Yeah, you're right.
- That guy's a pussy!

1194
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:13,805
Test him out.
I'm just gonna be right over here.

1195
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:16,752
- Do something!
- Come on, Dewie.

1196
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:18,754
You're just nothin' but a dumb bear.

1197
00:57:18,788 --> 00:57:21,120
Smack, smack. Yep.

1198
00:57:23,426 --> 00:57:26,054
Crazy fists. I'm comin' with crazy fists.

1199
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:30,658
Yeah. This is fine,
he's not doing anything.

1200
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:37,804
Flint, can you dig it?

1201
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:39,832
Jackie Moon Flint...

1202
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:41,969
Shit!

1203
00:57:46,983 --> 00:57:49,383
Dewie!

1204
00:57:49,419 --> 00:57:50,477
Spumoni!

1205
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,454
One round. No spumoni!

1206
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:54,320
Fuck you, Clarence! Spumoni!

1207
00:57:54,357 --> 00:57:55,847
Dewie, no!

1208
00:57:56,927 --> 00:57:59,657
Bobby Dee, help! Shit! Spumoni!

1209
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:12,033
Watch my hair! Watch my hair!

1210
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:15,841
The only thing I care about
is my hair! Watch it!

1211
00:58:15,879 --> 00:58:18,347
Dewie! My hair!

1212
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:21,214
Spumoni! Spumoni!

1213
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,111
How many times
do I gotta say spumoni?

1214
00:58:25,155 --> 00:58:27,953
- Somebody's got to do something.
- I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

1215
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:30,551
Don't worry, Jackie!
I'm coming, Jackie.

1216
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,255
I'm comin', Jackie.

1217
00:58:38,301 --> 00:58:40,861
Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights!

1218
00:58:42,072 --> 00:58:43,801
Good.

1219
00:58:44,474 --> 00:58:48,103
Nobody move. Nobody move.

1220
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:52,307
Where are you, precious?

1221
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:54,977
Dewie?

1222
00:58:55,018 --> 00:58:57,987
Everyone just remain seated.

1223
00:58:58,021 --> 00:59:00,216
I think he left.

1224
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:01,245
Dewie?

1225
00:59:04,427 --> 00:59:06,327
Everybody panic!

1226
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:10,356
My God, there's a bear
loose in the Coliseum!

1227
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,527
There will be no refunds!

1228
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:15,663
Your refund will be escaping
this deathtrap with your life!

1229
00:59:15,705 --> 00:59:18,265
If you have a small child,
use it as a shield!

1230
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:20,003
They love the tender meat.

1231
00:59:20,043 --> 00:59:23,501
Cover your sodas, Dewie loves sugar.

1232
00:59:25,015 --> 00:59:28,917
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Commish.

1233
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,715
What do ya think?
Packed house, right?

1234
00:59:31,755 --> 00:59:34,451
I need to speak with you
and the rest of the team, Jackie.

1235
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,790
OK. Locker room? All right.

1236
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:41,456
This whole merger thing
has been really complicated.

1237
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:45,958
It's taken a lot of my time
out of my life, away from my family.

1238
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:51,207
Look, even if you beat the Spurs
on Saturday...

1239
00:59:52,642 --> 00:59:55,577
the Tropics won't be going
to the NBA next year.

1240
00:59:55,612 --> 00:59:57,443
Come on, man.

1241
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,072
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

1242
00:59:59,115 --> 01:00:02,915
The expansion committee had
an emergency meeting in Manhattan...

1243
01:00:02,952 --> 01:00:07,412
and they decided that Flint
just isn't a big enough media market.

1244
01:00:07,457 --> 01:00:10,688
Well, tough shit!
We done made it this far.

1245
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:11,716
And rules is rules.

1246
01:00:11,761 --> 01:00:14,628
Guys, it's over.

1247
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:16,655
There's nothing I can do.

1248
01:00:19,202 --> 01:00:23,468
Jackie, I'm man enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

1249
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:27,910
I never thought you'd pull it off.
But you did.

1250
01:00:30,613 --> 01:00:32,171
Good luck.

1251
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:34,381
Right.

1252
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:39,320
Jackie, this is the type of deal
you can work around, ain't it?

1253
01:00:40,523 --> 01:00:44,015
Yeah, you Jackie Moon. I mean,
you can just make a phone call, right?

1254
01:00:46,162 --> 01:00:49,131
Sorry, guys. I let you down.

1255
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,192
I'm nothin' but a big phony.

1256
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:55,500
Man, don't talk like that.
You ain't no phony.

1257
01:00:56,406 --> 01:01:00,502
<i>Yes, I am. You know my song
Love Me Sexy?</i>

1258
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,669
Of course, yeah.

1259
01:01:01,711 --> 01:01:04,475
Yeah, everybody loves that song, man.
It was number one in the country.

1260
01:01:04,514 --> 01:01:05,845
I stole it.

1261
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:07,816
No.

1262
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:09,751
It's true.

1263
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:13,916
My mom wrote it on a napkin three
weeks before she died, and I stole it.

1264
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:19,224
That song bought me this franchise
and everything I have in the world...

1265
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:22,561
but it's all fake.

1266
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:27,328
Well, look, you can write another
song. I know it's in your bones. Right?

1267
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:30,828
<i>Don't be crazy. I can't write a song
as brilliant as Love Me Sexy.</i>

1268
01:01:30,874 --> 01:01:32,808
You're right.

1269
01:01:32,842 --> 01:01:35,208
I just wish I could puke this all away.

1270
01:01:38,014 --> 01:01:40,346
Monix, can you punch me
in the jejunum?

1271
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:43,216
Monix?

1272
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:50,721
# Qu ser, ser #

1273
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,591
In a new merger-policy shift...

1274
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:56,656
it seems the Tropics will not
be playing for an NBA berth after all.

1275
01:01:56,699 --> 01:01:59,190
Saturday's matchup
against the first-place Spurs...

1276
01:01:59,235 --> 01:02:02,432
will be the Tropics'
final basketball game.

1277
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:04,599
And in an act of great sacrifice...

1278
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,303
Jackie Moon has helped
Tropics' superstar, Coffee Black...

1279
01:02:07,343 --> 01:02:09,140
realize his NBA dreams...

1280
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:10,203
by trading him to the Spurs.

1281
01:02:10,246 --> 01:02:14,979
Clarence baby, you made it!
You made it, Clarence, you made it!

1282
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:17,384
Yes.

1283
01:02:19,455 --> 01:02:22,481
# Qu ser #

1284
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,294
# Qu ser #

1285
01:02:25,628 --> 01:02:28,096
# Girl #

1286
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:33,594
# Qu ser #

1287
01:02:34,737 --> 01:02:40,334
For Lou Redwood, I'm Dick Pepperfield
reminding you there will be another...

1288
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:44,039
No, actually we're down to our last night.

1289
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:46,470
Shit.

1290
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:57,155
Sup, chief?

1291
01:02:57,193 --> 01:02:58,820
Hey.

1292
01:03:04,901 --> 01:03:06,562
What are you doing here?

1293
01:03:09,372 --> 01:03:11,237
If you ain't heard, I got traded.

1294
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:12,935
Yeah.

1295
01:03:12,976 --> 01:03:15,342
Coffee Black headin' to the NBA.

1296
01:03:16,446 --> 01:03:18,607
Big time.

1297
01:03:18,648 --> 01:03:21,845
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know,
man, this year, you coaching us...

1298
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:23,113
the way you did it,
you really made us feel...

1299
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:25,814
No, no, no, no.

1300
01:03:25,855 --> 01:03:27,117
Don't.

1301
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:29,051
OK.

1302
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:35,754
Let me ask you somethin', Monix.

1303
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:37,425
Yup.

1304
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:39,128
You already played for the NBA.

1305
01:03:40,036 --> 01:03:42,732
Your knee is gone...

1306
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:46,333
you couldn't give a damn about the
merger, you were gonna retire anyway.

1307
01:03:46,376 --> 01:03:48,776
What's the question?

1308
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:51,507
What you playin' for?

1309
01:03:56,352 --> 01:03:58,980
I just wanna sit here
and have a beer in peace.

1310
01:03:59,022 --> 01:04:00,319
Yeah?

1311
01:04:05,895 --> 01:04:07,226
All right.

1312
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:11,831
I just thought you'd wanna hear that.

1313
01:04:11,868 --> 01:04:13,631
Have a good one.

1314
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:31,281
# Baby, are you ready
to lick me sexy? #

1315
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:32,310
Jackie, where you at?

1316
01:04:32,355 --> 01:04:35,847
# I'm a big faker
and I stole this song-ly sexy #

1317
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,562
# I wanna kill myself-y sexy #

1318
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:48,695
# I'm gonna get an extension cord
and hang myself sexy #

1319
01:04:48,738 --> 01:04:51,605
Buddy. What are you doin'?

1320
01:04:53,176 --> 01:04:56,339
Right now I'm urinating on myself.

1321
01:04:58,247 --> 01:05:02,183
Listen, Jackie, I never thanked you.

1322
01:05:02,218 --> 01:05:05,654
- For what?
- For helpin' me find basketball again.

1323
01:05:10,126 --> 01:05:13,095
Now what is it... Don't eat that.

1324
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:15,859
- What is that?
- Pancake.

1325
01:05:15,898 --> 01:05:19,527
- Has that been there?
- It's been here a while.

1326
01:05:19,569 --> 01:05:23,596
Listen, Jackie, I think
you should call a team meeting.

1327
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:25,129
Why?

1328
01:05:25,174 --> 01:05:28,871
'Cause you're still the leader
of the Tropics. Can you do that?

1329
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:33,938
OK.

1330
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:36,779
You're a good man.

1331
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:39,720
Should we...

1332
01:05:39,756 --> 01:05:42,452
I hate to see this go to waste.
This little bit.

1333
01:05:42,492 --> 01:05:46,519
It won't go to waste.
Save that for the next guy.

1334
01:05:49,499 --> 01:05:51,399
If I could have
everyone's attention, please.

1335
01:05:51,434 --> 01:05:53,231
Well...

1336
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:57,069
I just wanted to take one last time
to say thank you to all of you...

1337
01:05:57,106 --> 01:06:01,770
for all your hard work
as part of the Flint Tropics.

1338
01:06:04,013 --> 01:06:08,609
My teammates, it was an honor
to be on the court with you.

1339
01:06:08,651 --> 01:06:10,676
You guys are the best.

1340
01:06:12,255 --> 01:06:15,816
Even you, Vakidis.
Goddamn dumb son of a bitch.

1341
01:06:16,526 --> 01:06:19,154
You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

1342
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:23,191
To the Tropic Ball Girls...

1343
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:24,893
I always thought I was gonna sleep
with a couple of you...

1344
01:06:24,934 --> 01:06:27,528
but that didn't happen.

1345
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:32,170
That'll teach me to procrastinate.

1346
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:36,767
Bobby Dee,
you're like a son I never had.

1347
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:41,877
The son who's exactly
the same age as me.

1348
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:45,319
Well, kinda... You're like
a half-son, half-friend.

1349
01:06:45,354 --> 01:06:47,720
Friend. A son-friend.

1350
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:52,922
No, don't talk. You'll just make it worse.
I don't want to cry and wet my pants.

1351
01:06:55,531 --> 01:06:59,558
I'm not makin'
a whole lot of sense right now.

1352
01:07:01,437 --> 01:07:02,529
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

1353
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:05,200
- Can I say a couple words?
- Please.

1354
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:07,232
Thanks.

1355
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:14,781
So we all know
that Clarence got traded...

1356
01:07:14,817 --> 01:07:18,776
and we all know this game
doesn't really matter anymore, right?

1357
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:20,721
I've been thinking...

1358
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:25,891
We made it our mission
to win fourth place.

1359
01:07:26,896 --> 01:07:31,560
You know, fourth place is still out there
waiting for us to take it.

1360
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:34,866
And we're this close.

1361
01:07:35,638 --> 01:07:40,871
Now I tried to pretend that
it didn't matter if we won fourth or not.

1362
01:07:41,911 --> 01:07:43,902
The truth is...

1363
01:07:47,517 --> 01:07:52,386
I never wanted anything
more in my whole fucked-up life.

1364
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:55,318
This game does matter.

1365
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:56,347
It matters...

1366
01:07:56,392 --> 01:08:01,955
because this is the last real game of
basketball any of us is ever gonna play.

1367
01:08:01,998 --> 01:08:03,693
Ever.

1368
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:09,235
Saturday night, I say we leave it
all out there on the floor...

1369
01:08:09,272 --> 01:08:12,537
because there is nothing else
for us to save it for.

1370
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:18,705
Clarence or no Clarence,
NBA or no NBA...

1371
01:08:21,284 --> 01:08:23,081
this is for us.

1372
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:31,149
Yeah. Let's do this.

1373
01:08:31,794 --> 01:08:34,695
Jackie Moon, I believe you have
one more game to promote.

1374
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:37,164
- That's right.
- Damn right.

1375
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,794
- Gentlemen?
- Let's bring it in.

1376
01:08:39,835 --> 01:08:41,393
- Ladies?
- C'mon.

1377
01:08:41,437 --> 01:08:44,600
- Yeah.
- Let's go, Tropics.

1378
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,336
- Let me hear you say, "Fourth place!"
- Fourth place!

1379
01:08:47,677 --> 01:08:49,304
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1380
01:08:49,645 --> 01:08:51,237
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1381
01:08:51,581 --> 01:08:53,515
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1382
01:08:53,549 --> 01:08:56,541
Look, the Spurs may be
the number-one team in the league...

1383
01:08:56,586 --> 01:09:00,022
but come Saturday night
they're gonna have to prove it.

1384
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:01,523
Turtleneck.

1385
01:09:01,557 --> 01:09:05,391
Mr. Moon, since this game
doesn't actually count...

1386
01:09:05,428 --> 01:09:07,089
what exactly is your motivation?

1387
01:09:07,129 --> 01:09:12,362
On Saturday, we're gonna be playing
for the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

1388
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:13,925
White pants.

1389
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:16,302
Yeah, I don't know if I understand
what you mean by Megabowl?

1390
01:09:16,339 --> 01:09:18,534
It's a Megabowl.
What's not to understand?

1391
01:09:18,574 --> 01:09:19,632
This is history in the making.

1392
01:09:19,675 --> 01:09:24,510
You're gonna wanna tell your grandkids
and their grandkids and their grandkids.

1393
01:09:24,547 --> 01:09:27,141
And when they look back
in the annals of history...

1394
01:09:27,183 --> 01:09:29,117
they're gonna be talkin'
about three things...

1395
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:32,643
discovery of fire,
invention of the submarine...

1396
01:09:32,688 --> 01:09:34,178
and the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

1397
01:09:34,223 --> 01:09:36,020
Right, but still the game doesn't count.

1398
01:09:36,058 --> 01:09:40,757
The trophy's 12 feet high.
And it is glorious. I've seen it.

1399
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:42,923
Yeah, and when
we win the game...

1400
01:09:42,965 --> 01:09:44,728
that big gun's gonna shoot off.

1401
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:47,395
The cannon doesn't actually fire.
It's a relic.

1402
01:09:47,436 --> 01:09:48,960
We're gonna win the Megabowl.

1403
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:51,667
Saturday! Eight o'clock!

1404
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:53,368
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!

1405
01:09:53,709 --> 01:09:57,611
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!

1406
01:09:58,514 --> 01:09:59,503
Fourth place! Fourth place!

1407
01:09:59,548 --> 01:10:03,143
The Tropics seem to have captured
every heart in this town of underdogs.

1408
01:10:03,185 --> 01:10:05,119
People have poured in
from around the state...

1409
01:10:05,154 --> 01:10:08,715
to root for this first Megabowl
championship.

1410
01:10:08,758 --> 01:10:10,692
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- It's a wonderful night for Flint...

1411
01:10:10,726 --> 01:10:13,422
and a wonderful night
for the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum.

1412
01:10:14,664 --> 01:10:17,997
Now, Flint will be playing
without Coffee Black, their top scorer...

1413
01:10:18,034 --> 01:10:23,939
as the Spurs have traded for several
new players from around the ABA.

1414
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:28,470
I was excited to be here
till I saw your face, Coffee.

1415
01:10:39,955 --> 01:10:43,652
Why's it so quiet in here?
Somebody say somethin'!

1416
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:47,254
Monix, what time is it?

1417
01:10:48,631 --> 01:10:49,620
It's time.

1418
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:06,007
It is a sold-out crowd here
at the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum...

1419
01:11:06,048 --> 01:11:08,846
as the Tropics walk onto the court.

1420
01:11:08,884 --> 01:11:11,614
I tell you what, Dick,
this makes a lot of sense...

1421
01:11:11,654 --> 01:11:15,021
this heroes' welcome
for this Flint Tropics team.

1422
01:11:15,057 --> 01:11:17,218
This is extraordinary.

1423
01:11:17,259 --> 01:11:19,557
Jackie Moon is Flint's favorite son...

1424
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:22,291
and he has done more for this city...

1425
01:11:22,331 --> 01:11:25,664
than any human being
who's ever lived on this planet.

1426
01:11:25,701 --> 01:11:30,297
With the possible exception
of Henry Ford...

1427
01:11:30,339 --> 01:11:33,672
Jackie Moon has done a lot for this city,
you're right about that.

1428
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:48,421
Good tip to the Spurs.
Behind the back.

1429
01:11:48,457 --> 01:11:50,789
And wow! A little "How do you do?"
from Markie.

1430
01:11:50,826 --> 01:11:53,090
That's a pretty impressive start
for the Spurs.

1431
01:11:53,129 --> 01:11:55,962
Running roughshod over the Tropics.

1432
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:01,160
Vakidis passes to Doubleday.

1433
01:12:01,203 --> 01:12:02,761
Rejected.

1434
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:05,468
Scootsie passes to Jackie.

1435
01:12:05,508 --> 01:12:07,271
Out to Twiggy, and...

1436
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:09,300
Stolen by Rebenkoff.

1437
01:12:09,345 --> 01:12:10,437
He pulls up for a dagger...

1438
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:12,379
and ouch, three points.

1439
01:12:12,415 --> 01:12:14,212
Yeah!

1440
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:18,778
Yeah, I don't feel good about this.
I may not have brought enough Scotch.

1441
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:21,488
Shit!

1442
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:26,253
It's hard to say where the Tropics
are falling down worse tonight...

1443
01:12:26,295 --> 01:12:28,092
on defense or on offense.

1444
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:31,566
And with Coffee Black on
the Spurs bench, the Tropics look lost.

1445
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,465
You're goin' in, Coffee Black.

1446
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:36,369
Coach, I've got back spasms.
I can't do it.

1447
01:12:37,139 --> 01:12:39,403
Lutz, you're in.

1448
01:12:42,945 --> 01:12:44,310
Jackie! C'mon. Jackie, Jackie!

1449
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:46,007
Moon to Ellis.

1450
01:12:46,048 --> 01:12:47,242
Ellis to Munson.

1451
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:49,547
Munson to Monix.

1452
01:12:49,585 --> 01:12:52,281
Three points! Monix responds!

1453
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:57,418
But it will take more than one fancy
three to defeat these mighty Spurs.

1454
01:12:58,894 --> 01:13:02,352
This is easily the worst half
of basketball the Tropics have played...

1455
01:13:02,398 --> 01:13:04,161
since Monix took over as coach.

1456
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,863
- Yeah, it's a shit-fuckin'-sandwich, Dick.
- Let's watch the F-bomb, Lou.

1457
01:13:07,903 --> 01:13:09,427
With time expiring in the first half...

1458
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:12,373
Monix splits the screen
with a pass to Moon.

1459
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:14,308
He goes up strong...

1460
01:13:14,343 --> 01:13:15,332
Gets taken out by Petrelli.

1461
01:13:15,377 --> 01:13:18,676
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
get taken out quite that hard before.

1462
01:13:18,714 --> 01:13:21,512
- This looks serious.
- Damn.

1463
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:23,211
Monix, you gotta hit him in the nuts!

1464
01:13:23,752 --> 01:13:26,619
Father Pat breaking up what
could have been total pandemonium.

1465
01:13:26,655 --> 01:13:29,590
Come on. Jackie? Jackie.

1466
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:32,492
- Come on, back to the bench.
- Jackie?

1467
01:13:32,528 --> 01:13:34,086
He's got a pulse.

1468
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:37,055
Let's get the stretcher.

1469
01:13:37,099 --> 01:13:39,932
- We don't have a stretcher.
- Jackie sold it.

1470
01:13:39,969 --> 01:13:41,630
- All right, well, let's get him up.
- Yeah, come on.

1471
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,069
Let's get him in the locker room,
guys. Hurry.

1472
01:13:43,105 --> 01:13:44,299
Come on, come on.

1473
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,174
Jackie's teammates doing just
an awful job of stabilizing his spine...

1474
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,075
as they carry him off the court.

1475
01:13:50,112 --> 01:13:52,273
Come on, Jackie.

1476
01:14:14,837 --> 01:14:15,826
Yeah!

1477
01:14:15,871 --> 01:14:17,395
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

1478
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:18,428
- Coffee!

1479
01:14:18,474 --> 01:14:20,965
You walk away from this team,
you will never play in the NBA.

1480
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,978
That's my son! That's my son!

1481
01:14:23,012 --> 01:14:25,606
- Go, Clarence! Go, Clarence!
- You hear me, Coffee?

1482
01:14:25,648 --> 01:14:29,015
Look at this. Coffee Black
is walking over to the Tropics.

1483
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:31,849
This crowd is going crazy!

1484
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:38,319
Come on, Jackie, wake up.

1485
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,555
Jackie, come on,
it's me, it's Bobby Dee.

1486
01:14:40,596 --> 01:14:42,655
Wake up. Come on, open 'em up.

1487
01:14:42,698 --> 01:14:45,690
- Hey, you got any smelling salt?
- I think we do.

1488
01:14:46,702 --> 01:14:48,363
- Get up.
- Jackie.

1489
01:14:48,404 --> 01:14:50,235
- Come on, Jackie.
- Snap out of it. Hey.

1490
01:14:50,272 --> 01:14:52,604
Come on, baby.

1491
01:14:52,641 --> 01:14:53,801
Jackie.

1492
01:14:57,313 --> 01:14:58,644
Mom.

1493
01:15:00,983 --> 01:15:03,781
- I miss you, Mama.
- I miss you too, honey.

1494
01:15:03,819 --> 01:15:07,653
- Come on, little fella. Jackie.
- Jackie.

1495
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,681
Clarence, what are you doin' here?

1496
01:15:09,725 --> 01:15:13,388
What it look like?
I'm wit' y'all. He a'ight?

1497
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:16,660
Are you outta your mind?
You wanna lose your NBA contract?

1498
01:15:16,699 --> 01:15:21,159
<i>I don't care nothin' about that, man. This
is our season and we gonna finish it.</i>

1499
01:15:21,203 --> 01:15:22,966
So you're gonna blow the deal for this?

1500
01:15:23,005 --> 01:15:25,769
- Fourth place, right?
- Right.

1501
01:15:25,808 --> 01:15:27,901
- Let's get Tropical.
- Right on.

1502
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:30,104
Come on, buddy. Come around.

1503
01:15:31,113 --> 01:15:32,876
Now, I want you to go forward...

1504
01:15:32,915 --> 01:15:36,214
and tell the others
what I have told you here today.

1505
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:37,980
Do you understand me, son?

1506
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,386
Yes, Mama. You're so kind.

1507
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,085
I'm sorry I stole your song.

1508
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:46,026
I forgave you for that a long time ago.

1509
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:49,326
Jackie, it's time you forgave yourself.

1510
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,493
I don't wanna leave this place.
It's so fluffy.

1511
01:15:53,535 --> 01:15:57,369
Now hurry up,
and don't forget what I said.

1512
01:15:57,406 --> 01:15:59,533
OK. Bye!

1513
01:16:00,676 --> 01:16:02,974
Bye, Mama. Bye.

1514
01:16:03,012 --> 01:16:04,843
Bye.

1515
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,576
Hey... I threw up, Mom.

1516
01:16:07,616 --> 01:16:10,210
I know you did, sweetie.

1517
01:16:10,252 --> 01:16:12,516
I threw up all by myself.

1518
01:16:15,257 --> 01:16:16,724
- That's workin'.
- Here we go. Come on, Jackie.

1519
01:16:16,759 --> 01:16:18,818
A little eye flutter. Hello, fella!

1520
01:16:18,861 --> 01:16:20,488
- Hey there!
- Mornin', sunshine.

1521
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:21,723
We missed ya.

1522
01:16:21,764 --> 01:16:23,493
This just in.

1523
01:16:23,532 --> 01:16:26,695
It sounds like Jackie Moon is up
and around the Tropics locker room.

1524
01:16:26,735 --> 01:16:31,229
Then fake the pass and go straight
to the basket. Twiggy, how hard is it?

1525
01:16:31,273 --> 01:16:33,400
He keeps throwin' elbows.
What do you want me to do?

1526
01:16:33,442 --> 01:16:35,876
I want you to stand up to him,
ya pussy.

1527
01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:39,278
Monix, wait. I gotta tell
these guys somethin'.

1528
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:42,376
I had a dream.

1529
01:16:42,418 --> 01:16:45,012
I had a dream I was in heaven.

1530
01:16:45,054 --> 01:16:47,648
And my mother spoke to me.

1531
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,419
She was wearing
this flowing white gown...

1532
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:53,292
and she showed me
a brand-new way to score a basket.

1533
01:16:53,328 --> 01:16:56,161
She called it the alley oop.

1534
01:16:57,132 --> 01:17:03,367
She spoke to me and she said,
"With this gift, you will win fourth place."

1535
01:17:10,412 --> 01:17:13,006
We are back in action here
at the Megabowl.

1536
01:17:13,048 --> 01:17:16,347
Coffee Black is playing for the Tropics.

1537
01:17:16,385 --> 01:17:17,818
Jackie makes the start here.

1538
01:17:17,853 --> 01:17:21,550
In fact, it looks like
he's running the offense.

1539
01:18:02,397 --> 01:18:03,694
What was that?

1540
01:18:03,732 --> 01:18:06,166
I'm sorry, I don't know
what just happened.

1541
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:10,831
A very unusual series of moves
just made the ball go in.

1542
01:18:13,509 --> 01:18:15,033
Damn.

1543
01:18:15,077 --> 01:18:18,706
Yeah, I don't know why, Dick,
but I just got an erection.

1544
01:18:23,886 --> 01:18:26,184
Foul. No, two fouls.

1545
01:18:26,221 --> 01:18:29,247
Foul?! I didn't touch anybody.

1546
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:31,316
Look, Jackie, people can't just
go flyin' in the air like that.

1547
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,760
Please. My mom
wouldn't cheat in my dreams.

1548
01:18:33,796 --> 01:18:36,094
- What?
- She's an angel!

1549
01:18:36,131 --> 01:18:38,099
Heaven wants us to win this game!

1550
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:40,567
- I'll burn your house down!
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1551
01:18:40,602 --> 01:18:43,435
It can't be a foul without
touchin' another player.

1552
01:18:43,472 --> 01:18:46,908
And it can't be traveling without
first establishing a pivot foot.

1553
01:18:46,942 --> 01:18:48,842
- That's right.
- It's two points, Father Pat.

1554
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:50,242
It is two points.

1555
01:18:54,016 --> 01:18:57,315
- All right, I'm gonna allow it.
- That's the gospel.

1556
01:18:57,352 --> 01:18:59,547
Two points, Flint.

1557
01:18:59,588 --> 01:19:00,953
Are you outta your mind?

1558
01:19:00,989 --> 01:19:03,082
- He was floating. Is this ghost ball?
- It's legal, Coach.

1559
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:04,615
- It's legal, Coach.
- What the hell is that?

1560
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,525
Yeah!

1561
01:19:06,562 --> 01:19:08,894
It worked, Jackie!

1562
01:19:08,931 --> 01:19:10,592
Thanks, Mama!

1563
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:14,325
Things are getting interesting
here in the second half.

1564
01:19:14,369 --> 01:19:17,429
It's the Spurs' ball
as Rebenkoff makes a shot.

1565
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:18,871
Misses it.

1566
01:19:18,907 --> 01:19:20,807
Rebound Tropics.

1567
01:19:23,312 --> 01:19:24,301
There it is again.

1568
01:19:24,346 --> 01:19:27,782
Clarence leaping and forcing the ball in
a downward direction through the net...

1569
01:19:27,816 --> 01:19:29,909
off of a high arching pass.

1570
01:19:29,952 --> 01:19:31,249
- It's a great play.
- It sure is.

1571
01:19:31,286 --> 01:19:36,019
Hold on. I'm just being told
that this is called an alley oop!

1572
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:37,616
Yes, that is easier to say.

1573
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:39,286
Twig!

1574
01:19:40,295 --> 01:19:41,819
Monix passes to Jackie.

1575
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:42,990
Jackie lobs to Clarence.

1576
01:19:43,031 --> 01:19:44,931
And then, yes! Another alley oop.

1577
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:46,730
The Spurs don't know what's hit 'em.

1578
01:19:46,768 --> 01:19:49,032
I love the alley oop.

1579
01:19:52,674 --> 01:19:53,902
Yes! Yeah!

1580
01:19:55,377 --> 01:19:57,902
# I wanna take you higher #

1581
01:20:00,182 --> 01:20:02,412
# I wanna take you higher #

1582
01:20:02,451 --> 01:20:03,475
Here comes the alley.

1583
01:20:03,518 --> 01:20:05,645
And there goes the oop!

1584
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:17,054
Timeout, white.

1585
01:20:17,099 --> 01:20:20,330
In all my years of radio,
I've never seen anything like this.

1586
01:20:20,369 --> 01:20:23,497
The Tropics have fought their way back
from a huge deficit...

1587
01:20:23,538 --> 01:20:27,133
and now with 12 seconds left
in the history of this franchise...

1588
01:20:27,175 --> 01:20:31,043
they are down by two,
and, man, you can feel the tension.

1589
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:33,377
OK, guys, listen up.
They've made adjustments.

1590
01:20:33,415 --> 01:20:36,179
We can't keep runnin' the alley oop.
They're keying on Clarence.

1591
01:20:36,218 --> 01:20:38,448
So we're not gonna run the alley oop.

1592
01:20:38,487 --> 01:20:41,115
- What the hell we gonna run, then?
- The puke.

1593
01:20:41,156 --> 01:20:42,350
The puke?

1594
01:20:42,391 --> 01:20:45,485
Don't tell me you've forgotten it.
I seared it into your brains.

1595
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:49,122
- This will work, OK? The puke.
- Right on.

1596
01:20:49,164 --> 01:20:51,098
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.

1597
01:20:51,133 --> 01:20:54,193
Good call. "Let's get Tropical" on three.
One, two, three.

1598
01:20:54,236 --> 01:20:56,363
Let's get Tropical!

1599
01:20:56,405 --> 01:20:57,895
We're down to the last play.

1600
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,305
Monix inbounds to Jackie.

1601
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:01,332
Jackie passes right back to Monix.

1602
01:21:01,376 --> 01:21:03,173
Monix back to Jackie.

1603
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:05,736
The Tropics have gotta
make a move here, Dick.

1604
01:21:05,781 --> 01:21:08,181
Yeah, they need to find a way
to the hole and fast.

1605
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:11,481
Monix finds Bee Bee.
Back door to Jackie. He goes up strong...

1606
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,614
- Fouled hard by Petrelli!
- Eat shit, Petrelli!

1607
01:21:14,656 --> 01:21:16,317
Don't you know
how to play basketball?

1608
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,221
Father Pat struggles to keep order...

1609
01:21:20,262 --> 01:21:22,753
between these two tough,
competitive teams.

1610
01:21:22,798 --> 01:21:26,757
All right. Black. Four-two.
With the body. Two shots.

1611
01:21:26,802 --> 01:21:29,965
- Come on, Jackie!
- Jackie will shoot two free throws here.

1612
01:21:30,005 --> 01:21:33,441
His team down by two,
with two seconds left on the clock.

1613
01:21:33,475 --> 01:21:37,241
All right, gentlemen.
Relax on the first one, we got two here.

1614
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:39,509
Come on, Jackie.

1615
01:21:39,548 --> 01:21:43,279
Don't worry, guys. I got these.
I'm very good at free throws.

1616
01:21:43,318 --> 01:21:47,584
Seriously, free throws are probably
the best facet of my game.

1617
01:21:50,559 --> 01:21:53,289
What the hell are you doin', Jackie?

1618
01:21:53,328 --> 01:21:55,853
What, you never see me
shoot free throws before?

1619
01:21:55,897 --> 01:21:58,365
He's shootin' granny style.
Let 'im do his thing.

1620
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,890
Always has.

1621
01:21:59,935 --> 01:22:01,926
Shit.

1622
01:22:02,938 --> 01:22:04,462
Here we go.

1623
01:22:06,074 --> 01:22:10,238
Jackie Moon holding the fate of Flint
in his fingertips.

1624
01:22:10,278 --> 01:22:13,042
- He kisses the ball for good luck.
- Sweet sugar.

1625
01:22:16,852 --> 01:22:18,820
It's good!

1626
01:22:18,854 --> 01:22:22,153
- Yes!
- Never doubted you, Jackie. Come on.

1627
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:24,385
The Tropics need one more
to stay alive.

1628
01:22:24,426 --> 01:22:28,192
Watch the lines. Move on the release.

1629
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:30,198
One more, Jackie.

1630
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:51,704
Flint wins the Megabowl!
Flint wins the Megabowl!

1631
01:23:52,047 --> 01:23:54,948
Flint wins the Megabowl!

1632
01:23:55,684 --> 01:23:58,312
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- # Just move on up #

1633
01:23:58,353 --> 01:24:00,218
Go Tropics! Go Tropics! Go Tropics!

1634
01:24:00,255 --> 01:24:02,519
# And keep on wishin' #

1635
01:24:03,525 --> 01:24:06,926
# Remember your dreams
are your only schemes #

1636
01:24:06,962 --> 01:24:09,226
# So keep on pushin' #

1637
01:24:11,299 --> 01:24:14,097
Who's number four?
Who's number four?

1638
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:17,264
- Yeah, Scoots!
- God. We really did it.

1639
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:20,832
Just a moment.
Just a moment, please. Don't...

1640
01:24:23,311 --> 01:24:26,371
- What are you doin'?
- # Just move on up #

1641
01:24:26,414 --> 01:24:29,406
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- # And peace you will find #

1642
01:24:29,751 --> 01:24:31,116
Fourth place! Fourth place!

1643
01:24:31,453 --> 01:24:35,082
- # Into the steeple of beautiful people #
- Fourth place! Fourth place!

1644
01:24:35,123 --> 01:24:36,988
# Where there's only one kind #

1645
01:24:41,263 --> 01:24:42,560
Yeah!

1646
01:24:42,597 --> 01:24:43,586
- Hey, Coffee.
- What?

1647
01:24:43,632 --> 01:24:48,592
I've changed my mind. I think we could
use that alley oop of yours in the NBA.

1648
01:24:49,604 --> 01:24:52,072
Thanks, Coach! Mama!

1649
01:24:52,107 --> 01:24:54,769
The NBA!

1650
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,969
- Hey!
- Yeah, baby!

1651
01:24:57,012 --> 01:24:59,606
- Way to go!
- Thank you.

1652
01:24:59,648 --> 01:25:02,811
# Move on up #

1653
01:25:02,851 --> 01:25:04,580
# And keep on wishin' #

1654
01:25:04,619 --> 01:25:08,111
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1655
01:25:08,156 --> 01:25:11,319
- We did it! Yeah!
- Yeah!

1656
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:12,348
- Jackie!
- Hey!

1657
01:25:12,394 --> 01:25:15,022
- Congratulations on the Megabowl!
- Thank you.

1658
01:25:15,063 --> 01:25:16,860
- Whatever that is.
- It's very exciting!

1659
01:25:16,898 --> 01:25:18,798
- Yeah.
- You're a hell of a promoter!

1660
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:19,857
Yeah.

1661
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:22,870
Listen, I'm gonna be working
with the Commissioner of the NBA...

1662
01:25:22,904 --> 01:25:24,872
and I want you to join me.

1663
01:25:24,906 --> 01:25:28,103
Me in the NBA?! Really?

1664
01:25:28,143 --> 01:25:31,476
My God, thank you.
Can I bring my son-friend with me?

1665
01:25:31,513 --> 01:25:33,845
- Jackie, you don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

1666
01:25:33,882 --> 01:25:36,316
Mark my words,
as long as I'm alive, you'll both...

1667
01:25:38,486 --> 01:25:41,421
Everybody panic!

1668
01:25:41,456 --> 01:25:44,823
It's just like the Titanic,
but it's full of bears!

1669
01:25:48,063 --> 01:25:49,826
# Yeah #

1670
01:25:49,864 --> 01:25:51,764
# Hey #

1671
01:25:53,735 --> 01:25:55,930
# When you wish upon a star #

1672
01:25:58,306 --> 01:26:00,672
# Your dream
will take you very far, yeah #

1673
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:05,271
"Dear Dukes. I'm sorry it took so long,
but in this bag is 10,000 dollars, cash."

1674
01:26:05,313 --> 01:26:08,214
No way. Really?

1675
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,275
Actually, it's only 2,300.

1676
01:26:10,318 --> 01:26:13,651
I'll be payin' you the rest
right after they finish my merger buyout.

1677
01:26:13,688 --> 01:26:17,146
Let's get Tropical. Jackie R. Moon.

1678
01:26:17,192 --> 01:26:19,524
# In the sky so very dear #

1679
01:26:19,561 --> 01:26:21,722
Bitchin'. Bitchin'.

1680
01:26:21,763 --> 01:26:23,958
- # You're a shinin' star #
- Let's get Tropical!

1681
01:26:23,999 --> 01:26:26,399
# No matter who you are #

1682
01:26:26,434 --> 01:26:28,834
# Shinin' bright to see #

1683
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:32,465
# What you can truly be
What you can truly be #

1684
01:26:47,889 --> 01:26:50,153
# Shining star come into view #

1685
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:56,990
# Shine its watchful light on you, yeah #

1686
01:26:57,032 --> 01:27:01,025
# Gives you strength to carry on, yeah #

1687
01:27:01,069 --> 01:27:05,403
# Yeah, make your body
big and strong #

1688
01:27:06,408 --> 01:27:11,277
# You're a shining star
no matter who you are #

1689
01:27:11,313 --> 01:27:15,545
# Shining bright to see
what you can truly be #

1690
