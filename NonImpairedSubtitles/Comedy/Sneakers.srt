157
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:06,126
Mr. Brice.

158
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:43,999
Help me out?

159
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:46,041
Spare a quarter?
Help me out.

160
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:48,736
The government's
taken away my home.

161
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:51,746
Talk to him.

162
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:02,613
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

163
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:06,388
I could've joined the N.S.A., but
they found out my parents were married.

164
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:08,396
Ha!

165
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:12,127
Hey, hey, we're all friends
here, right? Easy, easy.

166
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:16,297
- Want some coffee or something?
- No.

167
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:20,172
- Buddy, is that Janek's file?
- Yeah, Janek's file.

168
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:22,904
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

169
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:25,105
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

170
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:28,548
Specializes in large number theory,
prime numbers, factoring.

171
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:30,551
- Cryptography.
- Very good.

172
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,747
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

173
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:35,757
Way out of profile
for a guy like that.

174
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:39,852
It's our job to be curious, so we traced
the money. Guess where it comes from?

175
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,659
- I know you're not gonna say Russia.
- Yeah.

176
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:46,599
Give me a break. We won, they lost, you
know? It's been in a couple of papers.

177
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,967
Yeah, we still spy on them.
They still spy on us.

178
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:51,336
We intercepted
a fax last week. Here.

179
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:54,934
Making some kind of box,
a little black box.

180
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,174
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

181
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,443
- Security technology--
- Sensor techniques, who knows?

182
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:05,715
It may be nothing or it may be
something. And we need to know.

183
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:09,189
Your job is to find that little
black box. Let us take a look at it.

184
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:11,249
- Yeah.
- No way.

185
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:14,763
Sorry, Marty. We don't have
a lot of choice here.

186
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,096
- Do it yourself.
- We can't.

187
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:21,103
By law, we're not allowed or equipped
to do this kind of operation.

188
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,698
- Then get the F.B.I.
- Yeah, right, the F.B.I.

189
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:29,505
The F.B.I. can't work for us without
approval from a congressional committee.

190
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:31,637
- We don't have the time.
- So, why me?

191
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:35,582
- Frankly, because we--
- Yeah, frankly.

192
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:39,985
Marty, sit down, please.

193
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,990
Frankly, because it's kind of illegal.

194
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:46,585
You've stayed underground more than 20
years. You know how not to get caught.

195
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:48,596
We know you can keep
your mouth shut.

196
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:51,258
Job pays $175,000,
payable on delivery.

197
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,134
You can distribute it among the poor,
if you like.

198
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,469
- Pass.
- We also clean up your record.

199
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,475
Quash the outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

200
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:04,445
Your pal, Cosmo, got 12 years. That was
without flight to evade prosecution.

201
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:07,914
We all know what happened
to him in there.

202
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:14,955
If I say no?

203
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:17,356
Don't say no.

204
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:21,624
What good would you do
anybody in prison?

205
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:26,031
[ Crease ] I don't believe this.
You lied to us all these years.

206
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:28,262
- Even lied to us about your name.
- Sorry, okay?

207
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:33,172
I'm sorry, but when you're wanted by the
feds, you don't go telling everybody.

208
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:36,678
We're not everybody, Martin,
we're your partners. You tell us.

209
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:40,476
Fine. Exactly why was it
you had to leave the C.I.A.?

210
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:47,020
We all have our little secrets,
don't we?

211
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,717
Look, you guys have
a decision to make.

212
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:53,956
This is not a test. The penetration
is live, the target is unaware.

213
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:58,489
Sneaking a foreign intelligence service
that might kill us is not what we do.

214
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:02,526
The probable level of security
is very low.

215
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:06,666
But if you guys don't want to take that
chance just to keep me out of jail...

216
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,710
fine, I understand, don't do it.

217
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:14,409
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

218
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,418
- I don't care if you go to jail.
- Me neither. I'm in.

219
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:22,685
Uh, could we maybe just go back
to the "they might kill us" part?

220
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:26,421
If I thought that was likely, I wouldn't
bring this to you. But there is a risk.

221
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:32,058
- It pays $175,000!
- I'm in.

222
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:42,972
You guys'll be chalk outlines
without me. All right, what do we need?

223
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:45,570
[ Martin ] Okay. We start
with a very light surveillance.

224
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:48,583
Level three. First sign
of baby-sitters, we back off.

225
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:51,176
Now, this guy's giving a lecture
tomorrow at U.C. In the afternoon.

226
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:54,051
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

227
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,489
Okay, let's do it.

228
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,925
[ Crease ] For the lecture, you wanna
take Whistler or do you want me?

229
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:03,954
Uh, no, that's okay,
I thought I'd ask Liz.

230
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:14,965
[ Piano ]

231
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,533
Who's this?

232
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,205
Sort of an old friend.

233
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,944
Practice!
Practice, practice!

234
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:02,987
- Hi.
- We're not getting back together.

235
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,288
- Did I say anything?
- You will.

236
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:06,919
I'm here on business, Liz.

237
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:10,796
Bishop, you don't have a business,
you have a club. It's a boy's club.

238
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,462
You have a little clubhouse,
you probably have a secret handshake.

239
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,527
Liz, I need your help.

240
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:19,199
I will not be dragged back
into your world.

241
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:23,506
I have a new group of gifted children,
and I like the fact they're under 30.

242
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:25,570
Excuse me.

243
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:28,411
There's a mathematician named
Gunter Janek. You know him?

244
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,418
I've read him.
Now go away.

245
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:34,889
- He's giving a master lecture at 3:30--
- How nice for him.

246
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:38,017
- I thought I'd buy you dinner after.
- I am not going out with you.

247
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:42,393
This isn't a date, dummy. This is
a scientific exploration, a tutorial.

248
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:46,127
I need you...

249
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,601
to explain it to me.

250
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,364
Read a book.

251
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,934
They found me, Liz.

252
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,173
The government found me.

253
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:02,775
They offered me a deal.
If I take their offer...

254
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:05,513
they clear my record
and I can get my name back.

255
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,055
You and I are not
getting back together.

256
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:21,068
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

257
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,795
Pick me up at 3:00.

258
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,342
Yes!

259
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:32,138
While the number field sieve is
the best method currently known...

260
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:37,584
there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

261
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,056
- This guy's good.
- Shh.

262
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:46,724
...over the rationals, and hence
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

263
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,754
Using the Artin map,
we might induce homomorphisms--

264
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:54,792
- You seeing anybody?
- Shh.

265
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,738
These maps could then be used to combine
splitting information from all the Zs.

266
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:03,039
This isn't just about large
number theory. It's about cryptography.

267
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,443
Oh? You mean codes?

268
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:08,813
I mean unbreakable codes.

269
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:13,878
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions...

270
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:15,856
and allow us to acquire...

271
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:20,452
the solution in a dramatically
more efficient manner.

272
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:24,057
- Are you seeing anyb--
- Shh.

273
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:25,828
Such an approach is
purely theoretical.

274
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:28,166
So far, no one
has been able...

275
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:32,333
to accomplish
such constructions...

276
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:35,537
yet.

277
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,102
The numbers are
so unbelievably big...

278
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,944
all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

279
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:44,110
But maybe, just maybe...

280
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:48,816
- there's a shortcut.
- I'll bet you anything he's found it.

281
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:52,292
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

282
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:54,352
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools.

283
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,889
May be able to see things
in other numbers that we can't.

284
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,367
- Martin.
- Uh.

285
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,961
Martin, how wonderful
to see you.

286
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,405
- Hi, Greg. How are you?
- Is it not fabulous?

287
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:10,673
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

288
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:14,079
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

289
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:17,710
At least I, l-- Oh!
Goodness, can it be?

290
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:19,811
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

291
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:22,379
- Elizabeth!
- She's dying to talk to you too, Greg.

292
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:25,824
Excuse me.
Elizabeth.

293
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:28,522
Elizabeth.

294
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:32,590
- Hello, Greg.
- Elizabeth and Martin.

295
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:36,160
My heart leaps like gazelle
to see you back together again.

296
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:38,672
Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

297
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,937
No? Oh, what a pity.

298
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,036
Wait. I have smashing idea.
Martin!

299
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,138
Martin!

300
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:50,378
Kiev String Quartet plays
at the consulate on Thursday night.

301
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:53,853
You will be my guests.

302
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:57,016
- I wouldn't know how to repay you.
- Heh, heh.

303
00:23:57,092 --> 00:24:00,960
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends...

304
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:04,487
perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

305
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:08,264
- [ Liz ] Gregor, you are shameless.
- See you Thursday night.

306
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:10,566
What?

307
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:12,597
Ah, new title.

308
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:16,872
- [ Greg ] Cultural attache.
- Unbelievable!

309
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:21,143
Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

310
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,650
I'll bet.

311
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:29,282
[ Liz ] I don't care what anybody says
about the new world order.

312
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:31,292
I don't trust that guy.

313
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,158
Who, Greg?
He's harmless.

314
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,197
Let the number itself
tell us.

315
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,333
If you'll excuse me...

316
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:47,934
- I have some work.
- You're gonna follow him, aren't you?

317
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,444
- Liz, l--
- It's okay. I'll get a cab.

318
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:52,446
Can I call you?

319
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,483
Just be careful.

320
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,305
Janek just got
in the elevator.

321
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,970
- Going up.
- [ Carl ] We will be ready for him.

322
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:27,140
- How's the audio?
- [ Whistler ] Good. Mother's close.

323
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:30,981
[ Crease ] He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

324
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:33,146
[ Martin ] What, no parachute?

325
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:36,713
[ Carl ] All righty.
Entry and lights on.

326
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:40,592
- Describe it.
- Looks like a workroom.

327
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:45,622
A bench with a soldering gun, two spools
of wire and a magnifying lamp.

328
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:49,797
[ Whistler ] Yeah, sounds like
he's making somethin'.

329
00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:52,897
- Then a desk.
- Mmm-hmm.

330
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:57,240
Telephone, lamp,
answering machine.

331
00:25:57,312 --> 00:25:59,337
A jar of pencils,
but no little black box.

332
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:02,383
It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

333
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:05,852
He's logging
on the computer.

334
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,857
[ Martin ] Oh, this is good.

335
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:14,259
He's gonna type in his password
and we're gonna get a clear shot.

336
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:17,821
[ Knocking ]

337
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:26,437
Oh! Dr. Rhyzkov, good evening.

338
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:31,002
Hey, let's get an I.D. on Dr. Rhyzkov.
She was with him this afternoon.

339
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,912
She was trying to tell him something
and it was making him--

340
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:36,884
[ Rhyzkov Moaning ]
Oh, Gunter. Oh, Gunter.

341
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:40,752
Let's do what we did
in Mexico City.

342
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:43,382
Huh. I didn't know you could
do that in Mexico City.

343
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:46,359
- Mr. Bishop, mind if I take a look?
- Carl.

344
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:51,263
- Grow up.
- [ Moaning ]

345
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:55,997
- Let me see.
- Oh, Gunter.

346
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:59,871
Oh, Gunter.

347
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,875
Oh, Gunter.

348
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:04,537
Elena, really!

349
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:09,073
I must finish my work.

350
00:27:10,852 --> 00:27:15,016
Okay, back to work.

351
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,581
Nope, here we go.
Now we're gonna get our password.

352
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:21,084
I leave message here on service
but you do not call.

353
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:23,154
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:27,600
- Get out of the way. She's in the way.
- [ Moaning ]

355
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:31,935
- I don't believe this.
- [ Janek ] I'm sorry.

356
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:36,273
It's just, I have this work.

357
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:39,939
I give you something
to work, baby.

358
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:43,576
Okay. Just for a little while.

359
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:50,523
[ Rhyzkov ] Oh, Gunter.

360
00:27:50,592 --> 00:27:54,756
- [ Martin ] What's goin' on?
- Oh, nothing.

361
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,355
Elena, really!

362
00:27:57,432 --> 00:28:01,334
I must finish my work.

363
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:05,737
I leave message here on service
but you do not call.

364
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:08,037
[ Mother ] Maybe there's a frame or two
where she doesn't block it.

365
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:10,806
I'll blow it up.

366
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:13,370
- Hey.
- Hey. Who's Rhyzkov?

367
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:17,646
Dr. Elena Rhyzkov, visiting
professor from Czechoslovakia...

368
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:20,882
senior research fellow
in astrophysics.

369
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:21,320
[ Martin ] Bingo.

370
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:25,816
[ Crease ] Setec astronomy,
whatever that is.

371
00:28:25,894 --> 00:28:29,295
[ Rhyzkov ] I leave message here
on service but you do not call.

372
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:32,458
- [ Janek ] I'm sorry.
- [ Mother ] There.

373
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:37,471
- W, G--
- Looks like the H.

374
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:38,528
- Where do you get H?
- Next to the L.

375
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:42,202
- Come on. Do it again.
- H isn't next to the L.

376
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,181
[ Rhyzkov ] I leave message here
on service but you do not call.

377
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:54,848
Message here on service
but you do not call.

378
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:57,858
[ Mother ] Okay, that's definitely W, G.

379
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:00,157
Definitely not.
No, that's a "V."

380
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:01,685
She's in the way.

381
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:06,029
Fellas, Janek's little black box
is on his desk...

382
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:08,035
between the pencil jar
and the lamp.

383
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:12,836
Whistler, I hate to tell you this,
but you're blind.

384
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:17,242
Play the tape back again.

385
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:22,443
- But you can't see anything.
- Don't look. Listen.

386
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:25,509
Play it back.

387
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:29,023
[ Rhyzkov ] I leave message here
on service but you do not--

388
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,820
He's got a service.

389
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:36,728
[ Whistler ] What's he need
an answering machine for?

390
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,029
[ Martin ]
There's our little black box.

391
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,109
[ Mother ] Okay, boss.

392
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:53,307
This LTX-71 concealable mike is part
of the same system that NASA used...

393
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:56,407
when they faked
the Apollo moon landings.

394
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:58,975
The astronauts broadcast
around the world from a soundstage...

395
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:01,488
at Norton Air Force Base
in San Bernardino, California.

396
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:05,856
So, it worked for them,
it shouldn't give us too many problems.

397
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:08,760
Thanks.

398
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,027
- [ Man ] You have a delivery?
- [ Carl ] I should have the invoice.

399
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,933
[ Man ] No delivery is scheduled.
They didn't have anything on record.

400
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:18,302
- [ Carl ] I got the invoice--
- [ Martin ] Did my wife leave a cake?

401
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:20,739
- There's no cake here.
- Party for Marge on the second floor.

402
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,301
- She was supposed to drop a cake off.
- I don't know about it.

403
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:26,313
There she is,
late as usual.

404
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:31,216
It states here that I am to deliver 36
boxes of Liquid Drano to this address.

405
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:35,120
I don't care what that says. You're not
on the list, you can't get in.

406
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,593
- I might lose my job.
- That's not my problem. Now beat it.

407
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:41,856
I can't reach my card.
Could you buzz this, please?

408
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,024
- Just buzz it. I can't reach my card.
- Wait one minute.

409
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,968
We're late for the party on the
second floor. Push the goddamned buzzer.

410
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:51,164
- [ Buzzing ]
- Thanks.

411
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:21,868
Anybody remember how to defeat
an electronic key pad?

412
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:26,339
Don't even joke about that, Martin.
Those things are impossible.

413
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:29,309
Think I'm joking?
Looks like they just put it in.

414
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:32,141
Oh, boy.

415
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:38,985
This might help. Old buddy of mine,
was in Desert Storm, sent it to me.

416
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:43,184
'Course, he was
on the other side.

417
00:31:43,258 --> 00:31:45,954
[ Martin ] Come on, Crease. There's got
to be a way around these things.

418
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:48,928
All right, all right.

419
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,601
This might work.

420
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:58,935
Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,601
Ba-- Yeah. Right.

422
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:05,134
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.

423
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:09,013
Ri-- Yeah.

424
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:12,952
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

425
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,823
That worked.

426
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:48,145
Got it.

427
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:51,920
- Gunter? You're not--
- God, no. Here you go. Nice to see you.

[ Muffled Screams ]

- Who the hell is that?
- Battle stations.

430
00:32:57,332 --> 00:32:59,300
Monitor the audio.
Grab the mike.

431
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:02,734
- Okay.
- [ Snorting ]

432
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:04,931
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, do not scream.

433
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:07,804
- [ Whimpering ]
- I promise, nothing will happen to you.

434
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:11,437
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

435
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:16,250
Who-- Who are you?

436
00:33:19,454 --> 00:33:21,922
- He's a P.I.
- Private investigator.

437
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:26,188
- I'm a private investigator.
- But why?

438
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:30,027
- Who hired you?
- Huh?

439
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:33,625
- Who hired you?
- Mrs. Janek.

440
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:37,034
There is not Mrs. Janek.

441
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:41,508
- Oh!
- Yeah?

442
00:33:41,576 --> 00:33:43,874
You got us stumped.

443
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:49,679
Oh, yeah? Who do you think paid for
your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

444
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:54,484
[ Gasping ]

445
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:57,923
That was good.

446
00:33:57,992 --> 00:33:58,959
Velma, Velma Janek.

447
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:02,588
She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings...

448
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,691
vast real estate holdings:
farms, banks, shopping malls.

449
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:08,702
Two shopping malls.

450
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,297
She supports Gunter but figured he
was cheating. That's why she hired me.

Bastard liar!

- I'll kill him!
- Oh, no, no, no!

No, no, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

Get a hold of yourself.
Uh-mmm.

- You gotta not tell him you know.
- Hah!

00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:29,954
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

457
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:32,482
You don't know anything
about a wife.

458
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:36,054
Oh! You just give me
one good reason why.

459
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,497
All right,
I'll give you a reason.

460
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:44,027
Give you a really good reason.

461
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:46,699
It's just what she
would want you to do.

It's just what she
would want you to do.

It's just what
she wants you to do.

Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

Here, look, I might lose
my license for this...

but my client is
a vindictive, bitter woman.

And she's using y-- me
to get to h-- you.

then just keep on loving him.

And never let him know that you know
what he thinks you don't know you know.

- Yes, yes I can. I can.
- Okay, good.

For five long years

492
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,793
I thought you were my man

493
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:50,262
But I found out

I'm just a link
in your chain, oh

495
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:57,900
But the key meeting
took place July 1, 1958...

496
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:00,304
when the Air Force brought
this space visitor to the White House...

497
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,240
for an interview with
President Eisenhower.

498
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,677
Ike said, "Give us technology, we'll
give you all the cow lips you want."

499
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:09,012
Don't listen to this man.
He's certifiable.

500
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,017
Your husband knows
about cattle mutilations.

501
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:14,646
He's ex-C.I.A. He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

[ Carl ] Understood, understood.

00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:19,691
One thing I don't quite get,
though, is...

504
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:22,389
was you and Cosmo,
you were taking all these chances...

505
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:27,958
all these big chances,
what for?

506
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:32,062
We were young.
And there was a war on.

507
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:37,509
- It was a good way to meet girls.
- Not bad.

508
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:40,308
How come you didn't get caught?

509
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,089
I went out for pizza.
Then I went to Canada.

510
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:52,683
I was lucky. He wasn't.

511
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,354
[ Whistler ] Did he ever forgive you?

512
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,424
I hope so.
He died in prison.

513
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:11,444
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

- We've never been to Europe together.
- That's right.

And we are going.

- Athens. Oh, and Scotland.

- And Tahiti.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

- Mother?
- Well, you know...

520
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:37,432
I've never actually had a really cool
car that I could fit comfortably into.

521
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:40,440
So I think I'm gonna
buy me a Winnebago...

522
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:45,070
with a big kitchen,
water bed, big kitchen.

524
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,015
[ Altered Voice ] I'd like to have
a deep relationship...

525

with a beautiful woman who melts
from the very first time our eyes meet.

We're not getting paid
that much, Carl.

Well, you know,

Oh, peace on earth,

- [ Mrs. Crease ] Yes.
- [ Mother ] Right on.

- [ Liz ] All right.
- [ Martin ] Hear, hear!

- [ Martin ] Yes, it is. Yeah.

- Scrunchy is not a word.
- Scrunchy is a word.

- Right now your face is scrunchy.

We gotta take it as a word.

00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:07,424
I really think you should
leave that thing alone.

548
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:10,487
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to
see something. Don't worry, Don.

- How are they spelling Setec?
- S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,405
Special extraterrestrial?

551

- Earthling counter.
- Oh!

Is that right?
Two, four, five.

And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around...

00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:37,184
and looks at me
like right dead in my eye.

- What?

Setec astronomy.

557
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,191
I just love it when
a man says that to me.

558
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,201

mean anything.

- No.
- No.

That'll do. Punch it in.

00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:21,147
Okay. We won't get in.

588

- Don't screw around with that thing!
- Wait, Crease.

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,841
- [ Whistler ] Carl, what else you got?
- National power grid?

00:44:57,985 --> 00:45:00,852
Okay.

Oh, my God.

[ Mother ] How is this possible?

606
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:51,136
Cryptography systems are based
on mathematical problems...

607
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:54,140
so complex they cannot
be solved without a key.

608
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:58,144
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key...

609
00:45:58,212 --> 00:46:01,613
- and he hard-wired it into that chip.

Scheduled for demolition

It housed the Federal Trade Commission,

Been vacant for a month.

No, I do not believe you.

01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,808
The whole network is protected by
a very powerful encryption system...

768
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:37,809
so the government
cannot read it.

769
01:02:37,877 --> 01:02:41,074
But if the feds
get Janek's box--

770
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:46,378
Disaster. Therefore, we must have it.

771
01:02:47,887 --> 01:02:51,653
- To protect the organization.
- Yes.

No, I don't buy it.

[ Whispering ] We were going
to change the world, Marty, remember?

776
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:24,582
Did you ever get around to actually
doing it? No, I guess not.

777
01:03:24,657 --> 01:03:28,286
- Well, I think I can.
- Really.

778
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:30,295
Yes.

779
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:37,029
What's wrong with
this country, Marty?

780
01:03:37,103 --> 01:03:39,594
Money.
You taught me that.

781
01:03:39,672 --> 01:03:43,073
Evil defense contractors had it;
noble causes did not.

782
01:03:43,142 --> 01:03:47,636
Politicians are bought and sold like
so much chattel. Our problems multiply.

783
01:03:47,714 --> 01:03:51,377
Pollution, crime, drugs, poverty,
disease, hunger, despair.

784
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:54,545
We throw gobs
of money at them.

785
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:57,987
The problems always get worse.
Why is that?

786
01:03:58,057 --> 01:03:59,991
Because money's
most powerful ability...

787
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:03,495
is to allow bad people to continue
doing bad things at the expense...

788
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:05,121
- of those who don't have it.
- I agree.

789
01:04:05,164 --> 01:04:08,793
- Who did you say you were working for?
- That's just my day job.

790
01:04:08,868 --> 01:04:13,862
While in prison, I learned everything
in this world, including money...

791
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,034
- operates not on reality--
- But the perception of reality.

792
01:04:20,747 --> 01:04:24,774
Posit: People think a bank
might be financially shaky.

793
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:27,012
Consequence: People start
to withdraw their money.

794
01:04:27,053 --> 01:04:29,385
Result: Pretty soon,
it is financially shaky.

795
01:04:29,422 --> 01:04:32,516
- Conclusion: You can make banks fail.
- Bzzt.

796
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:35,959
I've already done that.
Maybe you've read about a few?

Small countries?

801

I might even be able to crash
the whole damn system.

802
01:04:51,744 --> 01:04:55,703
Destroy all records of ownership.
Think of it, Marty.

803
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:59,616
No more rich people, no more
poor people, everybody's the same.

Isn't that what we said
we always wanted?

Cos, you haven't gone
crazy on me, have you?

to change the world, Marty?

You are crazy.

a Russian consular officer.

The following day, those prints will
be run through an F.B.I. computer...

we would not get in trouble...

did not.

The F.B.I. says the fingerprints
found in the embassy car...

of a government researcher...

in Palo Alto.

Great. Now that we're accessories

All the more reason to turn ourselves

in the voice on the other end.

01:53:04,801 --> 01:53:07,292
Just...
give me the box, Marty.

1379
01:53:07,337 --> 01:53:10,272
- I thought you couldn't kill me, Cos.
- I missed on purpose!

1380
01:53:10,307 --> 01:53:14,334
- Give me the box.
- Take the damn thing! I don't want it.

1381
01:53:14,377 --> 01:53:17,175
You win, I lose.
That's what you want, isn't it?

1382
01:53:17,213 --> 01:53:21,047
- Say it! Say it!
- Yes.

1383
01:53:25,588 --> 01:53:27,522
I'm sorry, Cos.

1384
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:29,455
- You could have shared this with me.
- I know.

1385
01:53:29,492 --> 01:53:32,017
- You could have had the power.
- I don't want it.

1386
01:53:32,262 --> 01:53:34,389
Don't you know the places
we can go with this?

1387
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:38,663
- Yeah, I do. There's nobody there.
- Exactly.

1388
01:53:39,035 --> 01:53:42,129
The world isn't run by weapons anymore,
or energy or money.

1389
01:53:42,172 --> 01:53:46,472
It's run by ones and zeroes, little bits
of data. It's all just electrons.

1390
01:53:46,509 --> 01:53:48,773
I don't care.

1391
01:53:48,812 --> 01:53:51,508
I don't expect other people
to understand this...

1392
01:53:51,548 --> 01:53:54,108
but I do expect you
to understand this.

1393
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:56,880
We started this journey together.

1394
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,980
It wasn't a journey, Cos.

1395
01:54:00,023 --> 01:54:02,321
It was a prank.

1396
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:07,126
There's a war out there,
old friend, a world war.

1397
01:54:07,163 --> 01:54:09,188
And it's not about
who's got the most bullets.

1398
01:54:09,232 --> 01:54:11,359
It's about who controls
the information:

1399
01:54:11,401 --> 01:54:14,529
What we see and hear,
how we work, what we think.

1400
01:54:14,571 --> 01:54:17,699
It's all about
the information.

1401
01:54:17,741 --> 01:54:21,507
If I were you,
I'd destroy that thing.

1402
01:54:21,544 --> 01:54:24,445
Don't go.

1403
01:54:28,184 --> 01:54:31,312
Don't go.

1404
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:39,690
You do what you have to do, Cos.

1405
01:54:39,763 --> 01:54:42,391
But if you want to stop me...

1406
01:54:42,465 --> 01:54:45,696
you'll have to pull the trigger.

1407
01:54:46,669 --> 01:54:49,763
You.

1408
01:55:40,356 --> 01:55:43,519
[ Crease ] I can't believe
we actually made it back.

1409
01:55:43,593 --> 01:55:48,030
I can't believe we did the greatest
sneak in history and can't tell anybody.

1410
01:55:48,064 --> 01:55:51,033
You know what I can't believe?
Tomorrow's Thursday!

1411
01:55:51,067 --> 01:55:54,127
- Not one word.
- All of you, step over here.

1412
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:56,934
Hands over your head. Move!

1413
01:55:56,973 --> 01:55:59,441
Move!

1414
01:56:01,544 --> 01:56:04,035
[ Man ] Mr. Bishop.

1415
01:56:10,854 --> 01:56:15,154
I'm Bernard Abbott,
National Security Agency.

1416
01:56:16,059 --> 01:56:18,926
We spoke on the phone.

1417
01:56:18,995 --> 01:56:23,364
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1418
01:56:26,236 --> 01:56:28,898
It's interesting,
don't you think, you guys...

1419
01:56:28,972 --> 01:56:31,805
that the N.S.A. is here?

1420
01:56:31,875 --> 01:56:34,776
I thought the F.B.I. was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1421
01:56:34,844 --> 01:56:36,641
Absolutely.
This is outside...

1422
01:56:36,679 --> 01:56:38,704
the N.S.A.'s jurisdiction.

1423
01:56:38,748 --> 01:56:42,980
Unless the N.S.A. didn't want anybody
to know about Janek's little black box.

1424
01:56:43,019 --> 01:56:46,511
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

1425
01:56:46,589 --> 01:56:49,149
He said our codes were based
on an entirely different system...

1426
01:56:49,192 --> 01:56:54,892
than the Russian codes, so this box
really wouldn't work on them.

1427
01:56:54,931 --> 01:56:58,492
The only thing it would really be
good for is spying on Americans.

1428
01:56:58,568 --> 01:57:01,469
Sure, with a box like that they
could read the F.B.I.'s mail.

1429
01:57:01,538 --> 01:57:05,133
- Or the C.I.A.'s.
- Or the White House's.

1430
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:08,302
No wonder they don't want to
share with the other children.

1431
01:57:08,378 --> 01:57:11,438
What do you want,
Mr. Bishop?

1432
01:57:13,917 --> 01:57:16,545
Clear up my record.

1433
01:57:16,619 --> 01:57:20,077
- Get outta my life.
- I don't have much choice, do I?

1434
01:57:20,156 --> 01:57:24,889
Not unless you wanna read
about it in "Newsweek."

1435
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:28,590
- Deal. The box.
- [ Mother ] Not so fast.

1436
01:57:29,966 --> 01:57:33,458
- I want a Winnebago.
- What?

1437
01:57:33,536 --> 01:57:36,096
Fully equipped,
big kitchen, water bed...

1438
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:38,436
AM-FM, CD, microwave.

1439
01:57:38,508 --> 01:57:40,339
This is not a
car dealership, pal.

1440
01:57:40,376 --> 01:57:44,369
He wants a Winnebago.

1441
01:57:47,083 --> 01:57:49,483
All right,
a Winnebago.

1442
01:57:49,552 --> 01:57:52,817
Thank you.
Burgundy interior.

1443
01:57:52,889 --> 01:57:56,655
- Now the box.
- [ Crease ] Ahem.

1444
01:57:56,726 --> 01:58:00,560
Uh, I have never taken
my wife to Europe.

1445
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:03,793
I'm sorry to hear it.
Give me the box.

1446
01:58:03,866 --> 01:58:06,198
You will buy me two...

1447
01:58:06,236 --> 01:58:09,034
round-trip, first-class
tickets to Athens...

1448
01:58:09,072 --> 01:58:12,769
Lisbon, Madrid
and Scotland.

1449
01:58:12,809 --> 01:58:16,745
- Don't forget Tahiti.
- And Tahiti.

1450
01:58:16,779 --> 01:58:19,247
- Tahiti is not in Europe.
- [ Carl ] Excuse me.

1451
01:58:19,282 --> 01:58:22,740
When you get the box,
then you give us geography lessons.

1452
01:58:22,785 --> 01:58:26,118
Until then,
this man goes to Tahiti.

1453
01:58:26,155 --> 01:58:29,215
Fine! Tahiti!

1454
01:58:30,493 --> 01:58:32,427
[ Martin ] Carl?

1455
01:58:32,495 --> 01:58:38,161
The young lady with the Uzi,
is she single?

1456
01:58:38,234 --> 01:58:41,260
[ Martin ] Carl. Excuse us.

1457
01:58:43,273 --> 01:58:47,607
This is the brass ring.
You gotta think bigger thoughts.

1458
01:58:47,677 --> 01:58:50,737
I just want
her telephone number.

1459
01:58:52,348 --> 01:58:54,509
Please.

1460
01:58:56,953 --> 01:58:59,251
- How about a lunch? You can chaperon.
- No.

1461
01:58:59,322 --> 01:59:04,350
- I will not do this.
- Hey, Abby, come on.

1462
01:59:04,427 --> 01:59:07,157
- The F.B.I.'d give him twins.
- No!

1463
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:10,859
[ Girl ] Wait a second.

1464
01:59:10,933 --> 01:59:15,529
You can have anything you want,
and you're asking for my phone number?

1465
01:59:15,605 --> 01:59:17,539
Yes.

1466
01:59:19,375 --> 01:59:22,310
273-9164...

1467
01:59:22,378 --> 01:59:26,405
area code 415.

1468
01:59:26,482 --> 01:59:28,643
- I'm Carl.
- I'm Mary.

1469
01:59:28,718 --> 01:59:31,084
I'm going to be sick.

1470
01:59:31,154 --> 01:59:33,884
- [ Abbott ] Are we done here?
- [ Martin ] Not yet. Whistler.

1471
01:59:37,026 --> 01:59:40,655
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1472
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:43,221
- This is ridiculous.
- He's serious.

1473
01:59:43,299 --> 01:59:45,460
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1474
01:59:45,535 --> 01:59:49,733
We are the United States Government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1475
01:59:49,806 --> 01:59:53,367
You're just gonna
have to try.

1476
01:59:53,443 --> 01:59:56,412
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

1477
01:59:56,479 --> 01:59:59,346
Thank you very much.

1478
01:59:59,415 --> 02:00:01,383
That's all I ask.

1479
02:00:03,653 --> 02:00:05,883
How about you?
What do you want?

1480
02:00:05,955 --> 02:00:08,321
Oh, I'm fine.

1481
02:00:11,994 --> 02:00:14,690
May I have the box?

1482
02:00:23,606 --> 02:00:25,574
You know it doesn't work.

1483
02:00:25,641 --> 02:00:28,633
It never did.

1484
02:00:28,711 --> 02:00:31,271
That's not important, is it?
What's really important is...

1485
02:00:31,314 --> 02:00:34,545
that none of this ever happened.

1486
02:00:34,617 --> 02:00:36,949
This box doesn't exist.

1487
02:00:37,019 --> 02:00:40,352
I never saw it before.

1488
02:00:40,423 --> 02:00:44,018
Remember that.

1489
02:00:52,802 --> 02:00:55,134
Bishop?

1490
02:00:55,204 --> 02:00:58,935
All you did was say
it was broken.

1491
02:00:59,008 --> 02:01:04,105
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

1492
02:01:06,315 --> 02:01:07,839
Nope.

1493
02:01:08,551 --> 02:01:10,917
In a surprise announcement,
the Republican National Committee...

1494
02:01:10,953 --> 02:01:13,717
has revealed it is bankrupt.

1495
02:01:13,756 --> 02:01:17,556
A spokesman said they had plenty
of money in their accounts last week...

1496
02:01:17,593 --> 02:01:20,858
but today they just don't know
where the money has gone.

1497
02:01:20,897 --> 02:01:22,865
But not everybody's going begging.

1498
02:01:22,899 --> 02:01:26,528
Amnesty International, Greenpeace
and the United Negro College Fund...

1499
02:01:26,569 --> 02:01:28,867
announced record earnings
this week...

1500
02:01:28,905 --> 02:01:33,239
due mostly to large,
anonymous donations.
