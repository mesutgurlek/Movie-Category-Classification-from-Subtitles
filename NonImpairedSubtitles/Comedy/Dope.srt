<i>I just read that money</i>

Soon the world

products using Bitcoins.

3
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,285
It's like
a complicated math equation.

4
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:35,188
        So, one day we're gonna
        buy things with numbers
        from a math equation?

5
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,690

28

Yo, hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

            So maybe.

35

    Yes, he is.

38
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:47,493
<i>For most geeks,</i>

39

Hey, them last shoes
you gave me, man,
I was feeling them.

69
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:33,425

Yeah, I was liking those.

70

73
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,532
Oh, yes.

00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,901
Come up out those right now.

75
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,170
Right now, nigga!
You speak English?

76
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,905
Do I gotta beat
the shit out of you again
and take them?

77
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,041
        Damn.

78
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:56,010
This nigga's speaking African

don't speak what we speak.

79
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,144

Hey, hey. Hold up, hold up.
Get your fuckin' hands
off me, man!

Don't think I won't
beat your ass, Marquis!

87
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,532
I came up with your daddy.
You better ask him about Stacey.

88
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,734
And see what's what
around this motherfucker!

89
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:30,770
                Let's go, man.

90
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:34,973
I'm gon' get the other one,
you little, bitch-ass nigga.

91
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:36,607
                Go, man.

92
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:52,020
Malcolm, when I see stuff
like this personal essay,

93
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,555
I think you're not taking
the process seriously.

94
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,591
        I'm-- I'm taking it
        seriously, Mr. Bailey.
        I promise.

95
00:07:57,593 --> 00:08:00,060
        I'm talking about
        something that I love.

96
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,929
I mean,
it's well-reasoned, supported
with historical data,

97
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,398
            it shows creativity,
            critical thinking.

98
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,001
If Neil deGrasse Tyson
was writing about Ice Cube,
this is what it would look like.

99
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,269
I suggest you go
in a different direction.

100
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,505
Write something personal
about<i> you.</i>

101
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:17,306
Your family, your life.

102
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:24,878
    I mean, I-- I could write
    about the typical...

103
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,781
    "I'm from a poor,
     crime-filled neighborhood,

104
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,583
    raised by a single mother,
    don't know my dad"
    blah-blah.

105
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:33,017
                It's cliché.

106
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,186
            This here, this--
            this is--

107
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:38,721
            This is creative.
            This shows
            that I'm different.

108
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:41,356
    This is the kind of essay
    that Harvard wants
    from their students.

109
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:43,791
Malcolm, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

110
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:46,659
You're pretty damn arrogant.
You think you're gonna
get into Harvard?

111
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,862
Who do you think
you are? Hmm?

112
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,097
You go to high school
in Inglewood.

113
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,734
To the admissions committee,
your straight A's,
they don't mean shit.

114
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,970
If you're really serious
about this exercise and you're
not just wasting my time,

115
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,705
    or yours,

116
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,908
then it's gonna be about
your personal statement,

117
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,378
your SAT scores,
your recommendations...

118
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,813
and most importantly
your alumni interview tomorrow.

119
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,482
    - Are you ready?
    - I'm ready.

120
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,851
You'd better be.

121
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:18,653
I just found out
you're interviewing
with Austin Jacoby.

122
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:24,191
He's from Inglewood too,
so he'll be able to relate
to your circumstances.

123
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:26,226
        Jacoby Check Cashing?

124
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,394
                Harvard? Really?

125
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:33,732
I'm sorry. They don't all
go on to be president.

126
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:42,206
<i>On this day,</i>

127
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,841
<i>their usual route home</i>
<i>is blocked by a Blood gathering.</i>

128
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:46,909
<i>They were shooting a video</i>
<i>for their YouTube channel.</i>

129
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:56,383
Well, where do you want to go?

130
00:09:56,385 --> 00:10:00,086
Some nigga really needs
to invent an app like Waze
to avoid all these hood traps.

131
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:04,422
<i>The only way to get home</i>
<i>is down 104th Street.</i>

132
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:06,590
<i>But that's where</i>
<i>the dope dealers are...</i>

133
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,626

<i>try to steal their bikes.</i>

<i>bad and worse choices.</i>

                        Yo, man.

139
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:38,783
I be seein' you and your
little friends with y'all
flattops and MC Hammer pants,

140
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:42,319
    riding around in this shit,
    looking like y'all came out
    of a DeLorean or some shit.

141
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,858
You know, the '90s was like
the golden age of hip-hop.

142
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:53,128
Everything from
<i>It Takes a Nation of Millions...</i>

143
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,763
to<i> The Blueprint</i>
was killing it.

144
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:58,665
I guess me and my friends
just wish we grew up back then.

145
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,401
            <i> It Takes a Nation</i>
             came out in '88.

146
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,269
    <i> Blueprint</i> came out 2001.

147
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,704
        What the fuck are you
        talkin' 'bout right now?

148
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:08,406
Technically, um--

149
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:13,444
But, you know,
the spirit of the music
was definitely still '90s.

150
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:16,346
I mean,<i> It Takes a Nation,</i>
<i>Straight Outta Compton...</i>

151
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,014
<i>Paid in Full</i>
was ahead of their time.

152
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:20,583
And then you got
Snoop, Biggie, Wu-Tang.

153
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,785
They took the game
to the next level.

154
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:25,487
<i>Blueprint</i> was kind of like
the punctuation mark.

155
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,122
        Let's not forget,
        the '90s also gave us...

156
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:30,424
    Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer...

157
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:33,126
        and we can't forget
        about the Fresh Prince.

158
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:37,295
Everything in the '90s
wasn't great, but--
                    Oh, shit.

159
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,397
But you gotta admit
"Summertime" was a classic.

160
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,199
            What's your name,
            little nigga?

161
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,434
Uh, it's Malcolm.

162
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:47,503
Look here, Malcolm.
I want you to do a favor for me.

163
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:51,874
    You see
    that green apartment there
    in the middle of the block?

164
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:57,179
    There's a nice little piece
    over there.

165
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,880
    I want you to go up to her
    and tell her that Dom
    wants to talk to her.

166
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,649
Uh, th-that's-- that's it?

167
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,450
            Yeah, nigga.
            Can you handle that?

168
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:08,352
Uh... y-yeah.

169
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,920
        Get to pedalin', nigga.

170
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:14,924
    Drop that up here.

171
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,161
Yeah.

172
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,614
You gonna say something
or just stare at me?

173
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:46,017
                Um, Dom says...

174
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,253
        that he would like you
        to come over
        and talk to him.

175
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:54,357
Well, why don't you tell Dom
that if he wants to talk to me,

176
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,759
he can come over here
and be a fucking man...

177
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,594
and not send a little kid
to talk for him?

178
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,463
Tell him just like that.

179
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,265
            She said that shit?

180
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:08,836
And that Dominique
was way cooler
before he became Dom.

181
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:14,674
And, um, that if you think
that she cares about your
dope money, sh-she doesn't.

182
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:18,910
Listen, tell her that
I'm throwing a birthday party
at Verse tonight...

183
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:21,645
    and I would really enjoy
    the pleasure of her company.

184
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,613
                Go ahead, nigga.

185
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,853
    You should, uh--
    You should work inside out.

186
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:35,456
        Do the stuff
        in the brackets first
        and then square the sum.

187
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,631
                    Yep.

188
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,334
Okay. Thanks.

189
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:54,105
                    Oh! Uh...

190
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:58,375
        Dom says he's throwing
        a birthday party
        tonight at Verse.

191
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,110
Mm-hmm.

192
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:03,980
        He said he'd really love
        the, uh-- the pleasure
        of your company.

193
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:06,949
That nigga did not say that.

194
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:09,484
                He did. I s--

195
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:11,052
                I swear. He--

196
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:12,987
Lord.

197
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,624
Well, I'll go if you go.

198
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,559
I'll save you a dance.

199
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,263
<i>You are going.</i>

200
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,398
                <i> We</i> are going.

201
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,467
She metaphorically
showed you her pussy
and said, "Come and fuck me."

202
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:35,003
Jib, um, this is Dom
we're talking about.

203
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:38,006
We're not going to
a drug dealer's birthday party.

204
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:40,241
That's-- You're trippin'.

205
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:42,176
        We're in our
        senior year, bitches.
        Okay?

206
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:46,946
    - It is time we started
      expanding our horizons.
    - No.

207
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:50,282
Call your mom
and tell her you're-- you're
studying late at my place.

208
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:52,150
            Come on. Dig? Huh?

209
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,718
Look, it's better than what
you normally do at night, so--

210
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,026
        Mm-hmm.

211
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,664
Looking beautiful. Oh!

212
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,866
One, two and<i> tres.</i>

213
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,268
Been working on my Spa--
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

214
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,104
- What you doing?
- You let them in without
  checking the list.

215
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,805
- What's up?

216
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,374
Okay, let me educate you
real quick.

217
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:24,710
I am the gatekeeper,
I'm the grandmaster,
the authority...

218
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:28,380
in keeping
a proper nigga-to-ho ratio.

219
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:30,648
You understand
what I'm saying?

220
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,651
So unless you little niggas
got some pussies, I'm gon'
need y'all to get the fuck--

221
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:36,186
- I have one.

222
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:39,055
I know y'all some bitches,
but you ain't gotta say
you got pussies.

223
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,157
She-- She's a girl.

224
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,125
    What?

225
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:46,561
This little nigga's a bitch!

226
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:49,463
Like-- Like<i> Boys Don't Cry</i>
like a motherfucker.

227
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:52,032
Remember when
we was seein' that shit?
Yeah, I remember that.

228
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,067
        Nigga, what the fuck.
        Let us in.

229
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:57,136
Oh, well, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's 21 and older.

230
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:59,537
I'm gon' need some ID,
some verification.

231
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,506
    - Uh--
    - Oh.

232
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:05,808
Wait.
Y'all don't have no IDs?

233
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:10,913
Aw! Sorry! I'm gon' need y'all
to get the fuck off.

234
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:12,848
Come on.
Get the fuck off.

235
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,651
There's a Baskin-Robbins
down the street.
Enjoy yourselves.

236
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:20,154
Hey, man, don't this dude
look like the dude
that danced in Santa Monica?

237
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:22,455
- Breakdance?
-          Don't he look like--         What the fuck.

238
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,657
You're coming in, right?

239
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:33,263
Get the fuck outta here, man!

240
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:34,931
Get the fuck outta here, man.

241
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:38,167
Old Coolio-looking motherfucker.
Hey, baby. You're looking good.

242
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,868
Thank you.

243
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,504
Digs. Digs. Digs. Jib. Jib.
Come on, come on.

244
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,842
Hey. Hey, w-wait-- Hey!

245
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,847
Yo, yo, yo. It's cool.
    It's cool. Let 'em in.

246
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,616
        Look, I ca--
        I can't let you do that.

247
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,852
        These kids are underage
        and I cannot lose
        my license tonight.

248
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,354
                    Not tonight.

249
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,290
    I don't mind having
    this discussion with you.

250
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,959
    I actually enjoy
    the thoughtful exchange
    of ideas.

251
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,494
    And you do bring up
    a valid point.
    Know what I'm sayin'?

252
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:14,530
But see, you put me
in a bit of a spot, nigga.

253
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:17,699
'Cause I can't have you
back-talkin' me
in front of my niggas...

254
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,534
without at least
fuckin' your ass up.

255
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:21,235
You feel me?
    You don't have to do that.

256
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:24,304
I kinda do though.
I don't want to.
It's my birthday and shit.

257
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:27,240
But there's principles
to this shit,
and I'm a principled man.

258
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:30,643
- They in, Dom. It's all good.
- I know they got in.
  That's my point.

259
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:35,080
But I got this nigga telling me
what he can't let me do
and shit. Like I give a fuck.

260
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:37,715
Man, if I let this shit slide,
we got what they call
a slippery slope.

261
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,717
You know what
a slippery slope is, nigga?

262
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,219
            No. I don't--
            I don't know
            what a slippery--

263
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:44,087
Anyone?

264
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,255
            Do it got anything
            to do with skiing?

265
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:48,557
Nigga, sit your ass down, man.

266
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,825
I know using your brain
is a challenge and shit.

267
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,561
    You use skis on a slope--
You might fuck around,
give yourself a concussion.

268
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,996
It's a small event that leads to
a chain reaction of events...

269
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:57,764
with unintended consequences...

270
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,466
that were unforeseen at the time
of the inciting event.

271
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,872
    See, this is
    a smart little nigga
    right in here, bro.

272
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:10,440
    You probably got one of them
    "photogetic" brains
    or some shit, huh?

273
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,876
You mean photographic memory?

274
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:17,012
- Nigga, what I just say?
- I mean, yeah, y-you said it.

275
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,014
I'm reiterating that--

276
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,083
        I'm still a little shaky
        on the concept.

277
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:25,052
    Basically, if I let
    this nigga slide, man,

278
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,254
then I'm going to have
the next nigga coming along,

279
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,522
thinking they can
pop off and shit,
you know what I'm sayin'?

280
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:30,956
And so on and so forth.

281
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:34,358
- Damn!

282
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,195
    - Oh, shit.
    - Hey, little nigga,
      you coming in?

283
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:41,331
        Yo, it's cool.
        You coming in, Malcolm?

284
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:47,703
Nigga, come on.

285
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,576
        Yeah.

286
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:58,812
    Nigga, school's out.
    What the fuck you doing
    with a bag on?

287
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:00,914
Hey, throw this behind the bar
for my little homey.

288
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,783
        Yo, let me
        get a round of shots.
        Cheers.

289
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:32,352
    Hi.

290
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:39,424
So, are you gonna ask me
to dance or what?

291
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,910
I think you said
something about me...

292
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:08,345
being man enough
to come talk to you.

293
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:11,348
Can I have this dance, Nakia?
It's my birthday, you know.

294
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,882
                    Hey, uh--

295
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:16,351
        We were dancing, man.

296
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:21,188
    Kids say
    the darndest things,
    don't they?

297
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,758
    See, this is what happens
    when you don't
    spank your children.

298
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,601
                Anyways--
Why do you have to
talk to him like that?

299
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,108
    - You look nice tonight.
    - Dom.

300
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:10,127
Boom!
Damn, nigga, that was ill.

301
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:13,196
This nigga doesn't know
what hit him.
Check this nigga out.

302
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,631
He's walking
his jihad dog and shit,
scratching his nuts.

303
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:19,567
        Yahtzee, nigga.
        Ooh, this shit crazy.

304
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:23,970
    Yo, man, straight up,
    I really used to think
    Obama was a bitch, man.

305
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:25,871
Drones though, nigga?

306
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:28,473
    That's some gangsta shit.
    I need one
    of those motherfuckers.

307
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,242
This shit ain't funny.

308
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:33,410
It's fucked up
if you really think about it.

309
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:36,446
            How, nigga?
            He killing all them
            Al-Qaedas and shit.

310
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:38,748
Nigga, that ain't all
that gets killed.

311
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,083
And that nigga's saying
he can drone-strike
Americans too.

312
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,652
They killed an American
working with them niggas
in Yemen.

313
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,921
Man, he was a terrorist, dawg.
So it's like set trippin'.

314
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:48,722
            You can't decide
            to be a Blood...

315
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,890
            and then get mad
            if the Crips try to
            kill you and shit.

316
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,758
Man, all I'm saying is...

317
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,827
this shit started somewhere
like Pakistan or some shit.

318
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:58,496
And before you know it,
they'll start saying
that<i> we're</i> the terrorists.

319
00:22:58,498 --> 00:23:00,731
They're gonna have planes
riding all around Inglewood,

320
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:03,500
droppin' bombs on Crenshaw
and shit, man.

321
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:06,002
            Ah, slippery slope.
                Exact, nigga.

322
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:09,638
        Shit, I wish a nigga
        would try to fly drones
        in my hood.

323
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,740
        - Fuck that.
        - Hell yeah.

324
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:15,243
<i>I wish I would see</i>
<i>one of them motherfuckers</i>
<i>in Inglewood, man.</i>

325
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:18,246
<i>For real.</i>
<i>Don't let them niggas</i>
<i>come to my hood.</i>

326
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:19,981
    What you got there?

327
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,782
        - Ah!
        - Whoo!

328
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:24,484
Breakfast Club, nigga.
Molly Ringwald.

329
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,919
        So, this the latest
        and greatest shit, huh?
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:29,454
Pure as a nun's pussy.
Know what I'm sayin'?

331
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:31,856
This ain't like that
ghetto shit y'all niggas
been fucking with either, man.

332
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,958
This is that A-1 shit.

333
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,560
A.J. say you ready
to move out the D-league
and move up to the NBA.

334
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:04,248
- Oh, shit.
-           Jesus!

335
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,018
Get the fuck out of here!
Let's move. Go!

336
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:15,656
        Nakia! Nakia.

337
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,930
Are you all right?
                Yeah, I'm fine.

338
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,434
Malcolm!

339
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,939
            Shit.
            Come on. I drove.

340
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,821
        Thanks for helping me.

341
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,924
            Most of those niggas
            just saw me
            and stepped over me.

342
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,059
Luckily for you,
I'm not one of those niggas.

343
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,861
                Oh, really?

344
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:03,630
    - What are you, then?
    - I don't know.

345
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,399
I'm just--
I'm black as fuck, right?

346
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:13,037
Uh, I guess I'm just used to
hearing that, uh,

347
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:18,008
niggas don't listen to this,
niggas don't do that,

348
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,945
niggas don't go to college
unless they play ball
or whatever.

349
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:27,248
It's just time to accept it.
I'm just not one
of those niggas.

350
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:30,851
    Well, me neither then.

351
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:33,486
'Cause I'm going to college.

352
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:35,821
Just gotta get my GED first.

353
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:40,191
That's what
you were studying for.
                Mm-hmm. Yeah.

354
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:44,294
If I pass, I'll go to El Camino
or Santa Monica or something.

355
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:46,596
        Transfer to Dominguez
        or Northridge.

356
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:51,266
Well, you shouldn't
sell yourself short.

357
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,202
        You could do better.

358
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:58,104
        You hardly know me.
        So how can you say that?

359
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,572
        I can just tell.

360
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,941
You shouldn't settle
for what's expected.

361
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:08,109
        Like Dom, right?

362
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,712
I--

363
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:13,647
I didn't say that.

364
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:15,749
Don't try and be slick.

365
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:18,251
                You're trying to
                block him.

366
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:22,087
So, you two--

367
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,355
    Y-You guys--
            It's complicated.

368
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:26,490
But trust me,
he's got nothing on you.

369
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:30,293
    You probably got all
    the girls lined up asking
    you to prom and shit.

370
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:38,833
You making fun of me?
                    N-No.

371
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:41,468
                I'm sorry.

372
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:45,504
                Hey, I didn't go
                to my prom.

373
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:48,340
        You didn't go
        to your prom?
                    Seriously.

374
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:52,977
        I had one guy ask me--
        Anthony Davis-- and he
        fucking stood me up.

375
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,714
I didn't even care
about missing prom.

376
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,350
I was more mad about not going
to Six Flags the next day.

377
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:04,319
All my friends had dates.
I didn't want to go alone.

378
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,491
Would you want to
go to prom with me?

379
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:19,064
    I mean, I--

380
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:23,300
I know that
I'm not complicated or--
But--

381
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,669
    It's just with studying
    and all,

382
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:28,838
    I don't think
    I'll have time.

383
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,608
    But thank you.

384
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,479
What if I helped you study?
And what if you passed the GED?

385
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:42,516
Would you go with me then?

386
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,352
    I'll think about it.

387
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:50,887
        Okay.

388
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,925
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

389
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,993
            Oh, shit.

390
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:02,062
                Three words.
                Did you fuck?

391
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:05,998
                You're a pussy,
                nigga.
Come on, man.

392
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,233
She let me feel her titties
and finger-bang her.

393
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:10,268
                    Bullshit.
No, I'm dead-ass
serious.

394
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,903
Smell my fingers.
            I don't smell shit.

395
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:14,738
                    Just cream.
You never smelled pussy
before.

396
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,406
        Wait. I have.

397
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:18,107
I don't smell shit.

398
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,175
See, she don't
smell shit either.
'Cause you only know your pussy.

399
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:22,343
Exactly!

400
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:24,845
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.
- Whoa, whoa.

401
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:27,681
Wait a minute.
You two go back through,
one at a time.

402
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,149
One at a time.

403
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:31,518
What's getting into you?
Come on.

404
00:28:36,324 --> 00:28:38,223
            Hey, hey. Calm down.

405
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:43,527
Go. Everybody else wait.
Turn around, go back.

406
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,396
We gotta do pat-downs.
The machine is broke.

407
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,573
    Oh, shit.

408
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,984
    Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

409
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:12,952
        Yo, yo, yo.
                    Oh, shit!

410
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:15,187
What's wrong? What?

411
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,689
                Oh, shit.

412
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:20,858
            Fuck! Is that real?

413
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,361
Boy, how'd you get this shit?
I have no fucking clue, Jib.
No fucking clue.

414
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,862
What do you mean
you don't have a fucking clue?

415
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,732
    I have no fucking clue
    where that gun came from.

416
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,266
                Or the drugs.

417
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:35,402
Drop your weapons!

418
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:43,607
    Get the fuck outta here.
    Let's move. Go!

419
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,377
        Last night at--
        at the fucking party.

420
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:50,413
        At the party.
        Dom put that shit
        in my bag. Had to be.

421
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,549
        Well, we gotta
        get rid of it then.
        You know? Dump it, or--

422
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:56,218
Or take it to the police.
Yeah. Let's take it
to the police.

423
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,887
                Are you joking?

424
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:02,190
    You want three niggas
    to take a bag full of dope
    and a gun...

425
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,091
                to the fucking
                police station?

426
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,760
            Like, "Here you go"?
N--

427
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:10,764
And-- And you don't expect Dom
to find out who snitched?

428
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:13,399
- Well, what do you
  wanna do with it?
- Yo, that's a lot of weight.

429
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:16,235
It's like 20, 30 keys.
I don't know.

430
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:18,670
- It's a lot of shit, right?
- I don't know, Dig.

431
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:20,772
        I don't know anything
        about this shit.

432
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:24,075
All I know is Jeezy paid LeBron
and Jay paid Dwyane Wade.

433
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:26,577
What?
    He was talking about dope?

434
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:33,115
                Shit.

435
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:35,117
        I-I-I-I answered it.

436
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,352
                You did what?
I don't want that shit.

437
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:39,487
Shit.

438
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,991
- Hello?
-     <i> Who the fuck is this?</i>

439
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:50,461

<i>Now, who the fuck is this?</i>

442
00:30:58,135 --> 00:31:00,402

        <i> Find an iPhone.</i>

<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>

500
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:04,349
    Somebody called me earlier
    saying I need to bring him
    the sandwich.

    that I needed to bring it
    to him after school.

504
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:17,193

    Yo, McFly, I want you

<i>I don't know</i>
<i>who the fuck called you.</i>

508
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:28,970
There's two possibilities.

509
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:31,405
Either the motherfucker
in the El Camino is POPO--

510
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,573
As soon as you give him
the package,
he gon' arrest you.

511
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,808
<i>Or that motherfucker's</i>
<i>the snitch.</i>

512
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,477
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>he'll take the package,</i>
<i>kill you,</i>

513
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:40,745
<i>then I'm headed to Chino</i>

515
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:47,917
<i>Do not take that backpack</i>

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,052
I'm gonna text you
this address.

517
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,588
Go there, ask for A.J.
Tell him it's about
the Boys Club.

518
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,324
<i>Give him the package.</i>
<i>Tell him it's from me.</i>
<i>You hear me?</i>

519
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:58,859

Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

523
00:35:08,702 --> 00:35:11,269
Go! Let's go! Come on!

524
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:17,272
Go, Jib!

525
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:26,746
- Get the fuck back over here!
- Oh, shit!

526
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:29,949

00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:43,527
Yo, man, what the hell happened?
Who the fuck was that?

530

                    Dom!

532
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:50,433
That nigga called me
and said that the nigga that
called earlier isn't with him.

533
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:52,101
Well, then who is he?

00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:56,071
Oh, shit.

Oh, shit.

536
00:35:57,774 --> 00:36:00,173
How the fuck did they find us?
Yo, let's go.

537
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,516
            Jib! Dig! Bus!

538
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:24,227
There. Right here.
Right ahead.

539
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,861
It's that bus.
It's that bus.

540
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:30,031
Right there. Right there.
They on that bus!

541
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,800
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

542
00:36:37,938 --> 00:36:40,005
        Open the fucking door!

543
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,873
        Open the fucking door,
        bitch!

544
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:48,278
    You see three little niggas
    get on this bus
    a couple stops ago?

545
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,080
I don't know.
Lot of young niggas
get on this bus.

546
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:53,849
    Don't get smart. I'm just
    asking you a motherfucking
    question, all right?

547
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:55,550
I don't see shit
but the road.

548
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:03,389
- He's here.

549
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:07,625
Is it you? Huh?

550
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:10,828
    Is it you? Huh?
    Is it fuckin' you?

551
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:20,369
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You have found your iPhone.</i>

552
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,104
                Damn.

553
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:15,378
Yo, Lily, what are you doing
opening the door
butt-ass naked for?

554
00:38:17,981 --> 00:38:20,882
Excuse my dumb-ass sister, man.
What up?

555
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,183
            Are you A.J.?

556
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:24,752
    No, that's my dad.

557
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:26,253
        I need to speak to him.

558
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:29,422
        It's about Boys Club.

559
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:31,924
        Right. Right.

560
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,493
Well, my dad's at his office
for a couple of hours.

561
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:37,028
But y'all can hang out here
until he gets back if you want.

562
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,362
                Um--
            No.

563
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:40,130
                You know--

564
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:45,867
        Hey.
                Yeah.

565
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:48,669
    - You wanna come in?
    - Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,604
Y'all come in.

567
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,114
You Piru?
Crenshaw Mafia?

568
00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:06,316
        Uh, I'm just Malcolm.

569
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:10,286
That's your hood, though.
Right? Right?

570
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:17,590
                    Yeah.

571
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,726
                    Yeah.
Yeah.

572
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,696
                        Yeah.

573
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,731
In the guest house
is where I got my studio.

574
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,067
That's where I lay down
my tracks.

575
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,386
I fuck around with it, you know.
I do my little thing.

576
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:02,056
My style is, I'm like a Dilla
meets a No ID with a little bit
of splash of Rick Rubin.

577
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:04,091
    - Right.
    - Know what I mean?

578
00:40:04,093 --> 00:40:06,993
I actually got something
that I did the other day.
Check this out.

579
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:24,508
Yeah, what the fuck
is "bereal"?

580
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,244
            Oh, shit. Look.
            I meant "cereal."

581
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:29,579
        But that's how much
        I hate crab-ass niggas.

582
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,549
    'Cause my mind, it thinks
    these C-words, but my mouth
    won't let me say them.

583
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:37,286
Okay, so, you replace words
that start with C's with B's?

584
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:40,722
- Like Crip dyslexia.
- Criplexia.

585
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:43,725
    But only soft C's, because
    you said "crab" no problem.

586
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:47,295
That's true. Why won't
your mind tell your mouth
to say "brab" instead of "crab"?

587
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:50,798
- I don't know.
  It's a case-by-case thing.
- Not "base-by-base"?

588
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,434
        See, you would think
        this hard "C" would be
        the issue, but no.

589
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:56,068
            That's interesting.

590
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,237
Fuck y'all. I'm just tryin'
to rep my set. That's it.

591
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,906
- Ladera doesn't have a set.
- What the fuck you mean?

592
00:41:01,908 --> 00:41:04,909
Huh?

593
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:07,144
- Does that make me any less   of a nigga than y'all?
-  - No.

594
00:41:07,146 --> 00:41:08,912
        Because my dad
        was from The Bottoms.
    Yeah.

595
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:11,948
My uncle, everybody on my side
reppin' the Inglewood family.

596
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,916
            'Cause that's
            where my heart is.
Yeah.

597
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:16,451
        Even though my--
        my body's right here.

598
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:18,719
- Mm-hmm.
-         - It's cool.

599
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:20,454
                I-It's "bool."

600
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:26,392
    Fuck all y'all. 'Cause I was
    in a good mood and shit.

601
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,663
What was that?

602
00:41:32,665 --> 00:41:36,466
A song that we--
You just reminded us
of something we was writing.

603
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:38,601
        "Was"?
        Let's-- Let's get to it.

604
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:40,769
    - What you mean?
    - Let's record.

605
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:43,238
    - Let's record what?
    - The song.

606
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,974
            Quit fucking around.
            Come on.

607
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:04,055
            Randy.

608
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:18,399
    Check this out.

609
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,302
    Little niggas.
    Got 'em.

610
00:42:22,304 --> 00:42:24,971
I know y'all hungry.
If you want, you can just
help yourself to my fridge.

611
00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:27,206
Or I could have Marta
cook us up something.

612
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,209
- Can she cook
  chili-cheese fries?
- Chili-cheese fries. Yeah.

613
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:31,877
Marta! Yeah.

614
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:33,712
    - Right?
    - Where you get 'em at?

615
00:42:33,714 --> 00:42:36,347
    Jimmy's Burgers on Centinela
    and Inglewood Avenue.

616
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,317
Yes, um--<i> Cuatro órdenes</i>
<i>de</i> chili-cheese fries...

617
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,686
at Jimmy's Burgers
on Centinela and Inglewood.

618
00:42:53,227 --> 00:42:56,229
Niggas, let's roll.
You coming, Malcolm?

619
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:01,900
No, I think
I'm gonna stay here.

620
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,184
                    So...

621
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:26,820
                you're a boy
                from the hood.

622
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:30,423
Good thing you found
the Boys Club and have such
an amazing mentor as my father.

623
00:43:37,363 --> 00:43:39,863
            I'm bored as fuck.

624
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:42,632
        Will you play with me,
        my little boy
        from the hood?

625
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,567
        Yeah.

626
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,402
Yeah, we--

627
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,705
I can-- Well, what do
you want to play?

628
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:55,108
            How about we play
            Mother May I?

629
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,643
        You remember that game,
        right?

630
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,745
    Yeah.

631
00:44:00,747 --> 00:44:02,747
    S-- Yeah.

632
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:05,483
            Go ahead.
            Ask me a question.

633
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:12,556
Um... what's your name?

634
00:44:12,558 --> 00:44:14,758
Lily.

635
00:44:16,026 --> 00:44:19,261
        No, you're supposed to
        ask me something like,

636
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:21,596
            "Mother, may I
             take two steps?"

637
00:44:21,598 --> 00:44:24,465
            If I say yes,
            you take two steps
            toward me.

638
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:27,901
        Or I may say,
        "No, you have to
         take three steps back."

639
00:44:27,903 --> 00:44:30,436
        Now it's my turn
        to ask the questions.

640
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:31,937
        Okay.

641
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:34,439
            - Got it?
            - Yeah.

642
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:40,044
                May I take off
                my clothes?

643
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,147
    Yeah.

644
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:48,483
    Yeah.

645
00:44:55,256 --> 00:44:57,657
                May I walk over
                to you?

646
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:02,328
    Yeah.

647
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:11,702
        May I touch you?

648
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,237
Yes.

649
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,977
        Are you a virgin?

650
00:45:25,614 --> 00:45:27,214
    No.

651
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:32,185
            Don't.

652
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,687
            Don't do that.

653
00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:39,090
        There are too many liars
        and bullshitters
        in this house, Malcolm.

654
00:45:39,092 --> 00:45:41,592
        I can tell
        you're not like that.

655
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:43,193
            Not like him.

656
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:45,361
        Don't start now, okay?

657
00:45:46,596 --> 00:45:48,630
    Okay.

658
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:50,498
Yes, I'm a virgin.

659
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:54,067
                    I gotta pee.

660
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:57,202
            Jaleel keeps rubbers
            over there.

661
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:03,040
        I want you ready
        when I get back.

662
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,853
                    Go.

663
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:21,456
            Can we get some
            chili-cheese fries?

664
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:24,158
                Burgers too.
                All right,
                we'll get, uh--

665
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,293
        Yo, can I get
        a grilled cheese?

666
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:28,227
What the fuck is this?

667
00:46:30,897 --> 00:46:32,731
        We got a problem, blood?

668
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:38,102
Listen to this motherfuckin'
Abercrombie and Fitch-ass nigga.

669
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:42,539
You little niggas
were supposed to deliver
my lunch today.

670
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,140
After school.

671
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,409
Now, I need my shit.

672
00:46:47,411 --> 00:46:49,210
Right now, nigga.

673
00:46:49,212 --> 00:46:50,878
Right now.

674
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,181
    What the fuck are you even
    talking about, nigga?
    You hungry?

675
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:56,850
            She's right there.
            Order some shit.

676
00:46:56,852 --> 00:47:00,086
Order some shit?
        See, first of all,
        you do not know me, bro.

677
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:04,089
            Let me tell you
            what's going down.
            All right?

678
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:06,257
            We're gon' order
            our food.

679
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:10,327
    And then you can
    order your lunch
    or whatever the fuck else.

680
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:12,095
                A'ight?
                Then we gon'
                keep it pushin'.

681
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,302
Where is my bag?

682
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:30,110
    - Yo.
    - What's in the backpack?

683
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:31,377
That's for my dad, right?

684
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:33,845
            Fuck.

685
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:36,781
            Lily.

686
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,682
        Lily.

687
00:47:42,218 --> 00:47:44,084
Lily?

688
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,354
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

689
00:47:49,689 --> 00:47:52,791
Look--
You don't know what you--

690
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:55,059
This is your--
Oh, my God!

691
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:58,295
This can't even be happening.
Look-- Look at you.

692
00:47:58,297 --> 00:48:01,031
Come on--
What is wrong with you?

693
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:05,034
Have you ever fucked on Molly?
        I haven't fucked
        on anything. Remember?

694
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:09,371
Okay.

695
00:48:09,373 --> 00:48:11,772
Okay. All right.

696
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:19,245
What the fuck!

697
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:22,581
You-- You threw up on me!

698
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,150
It's everywhere!
It's all in my mouth!

699
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:29,553
        Who the fuck is this?

700
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:33,023
Son of a--
                Why are you
                yelling at me?

701
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:35,325
            I don't know you,
            Mr. Bailey,

702
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,226
                but you're being
                very rude.

703
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:38,827
                What the fuck!
        Bye.

704
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:42,397
        Yes, this is Malcolm.
            Malcolm! Come here.

705
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:47,602
        Yes, can I reschedule,
        please?

706
00:48:47,604 --> 00:48:49,637
    Mr. Bailey, come on--

707
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:56,775
    Fuck!

708
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,347
                    Wait. Wait.

709
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:06,782
I have to go.
I have to go.
    Wait. We're not done yet.

710
00:49:06,784 --> 00:49:08,784
            Where are you going?
            Stop being so mean.
I have to go.

711
00:49:08,786 --> 00:49:10,786
I spaced on
my college interviews!

712
00:49:10,788 --> 00:49:12,888
I spaced on
my college interviews.

713
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,157
I only have 20 minutes
to get down there
or my whole life is fucked.

714
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,993
                I'll take you.

715
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:22,395
                What?

716
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:24,430
                I'll take you.

717
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:36,239
    - Whee!
    - Lily! Lily, get up!

718
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:39,575
Oh, Lily! It's a stop sign!
Lily, stop. Stop!

719
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:42,644
Stop!

720
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:57,622
            Oh, shit.

721
00:49:57,624 --> 00:49:59,924
                Oh, shit.

722
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,497
Lily.

723
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:11,599
            Lily!

724
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:13,667
Lily!
            I gotta pee!
            I gotta pee!

725
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:17,603
        Get out of my house!
        Let me use the toilet!

726
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:19,638
Lily! Get back!

727
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,674
- Lily!
- I gotta pee!
  I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

728
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:30,481
    I gotta pee! I gotta pee!
    I gotta pee! I gotta pee!

729
00:50:58,037 --> 00:50:59,937
What the fuck?

730
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:13,015
    Tell you what's going down.
    We gon' order our food.

731
00:51:13,017 --> 00:51:17,052
    And then you can
    order your lunch
    or whatever the fuck else.

732
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:18,787
                A'ight?
                Then we gon'
                keep it pushin'.

733
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:20,522
    Yeah?

734
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,360
Shut your fuckin'--

735
00:51:38,037 --> 00:51:39,804
Diggy, fries, fries, fries!

736
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:47,943
I want my motherfucking dope!
I want my fucking dope!

737
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:52,881
Shit, where the fuck is Jaleel?

738
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:55,082
            Fuck!
            That was our ride.
What the f--

739
00:51:56,717 --> 00:51:59,151
    Run, run, run!

740
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:02,753
Freeze! Down on your knees!
Keep your hands up!

741
00:52:06,758 --> 00:52:08,824
What the fuck?

742
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:23,235
    Mr. Jacoby's just
    wrapping up a staff meeting.
    He'll be a few minutes.

743
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:53,831
                            Dom?

744
00:52:57,068 --> 00:52:59,502
        Is that-- Is that Dom?

745
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:10,778
                Oh, shit.

746
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,413
                Austin Jacoby.

747
00:53:13,415 --> 00:53:15,782
            Nice to meet you,
            Malcolm.

748
00:53:15,784 --> 00:53:18,384
                Take a seat.
                Come on, relax.

749
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:24,823
So, uh...
Malcolm Adekanbi.

750
00:53:24,825 --> 00:53:26,858
Did I pronounce that
right?

751
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:29,626
Yeah? Great.

752
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:32,795
You're Nigerian.

753
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:35,597
                    My dad, um--

754
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,300
    He-- He went back to Nigeria
    before I was born.

755
00:53:39,302 --> 00:53:41,635
Sorry to hear that.

756
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:44,304
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

757
00:53:44,306 --> 00:53:47,840
That's why I spend
a lot of time and a lot of money
with the Boys Club.

758
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:51,008
                    Those, um--
                    Those kids--

759
00:53:52,176 --> 00:53:54,709
        A-Are they your kids?
Yes, they are.

760
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:58,645
Not too much older
than you.

761
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:00,246
        So you know Dominique?

762
00:54:00,248 --> 00:54:01,680
        Excuse me?

763
00:54:01,682 --> 00:54:05,150
            You-- You probably
            know him as Dom.

764
00:54:05,152 --> 00:54:08,786
No. Sorry.
Why do you ask?

765
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:11,655
        Dom gave me something...

766
00:54:11,657 --> 00:54:14,724
        to deliver to someone.

767
00:54:16,193 --> 00:54:18,827
        As crazy as it seems,

768
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:22,096
            I-I think
            that someone is you.

769
00:54:22,098 --> 00:54:24,498
This Dom person--

770
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,701
what did he say
that, uh,

771
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:30,970
I should have to do
with this, uh, delivery?

772
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:32,805
                I don't know.

773
00:54:32,807 --> 00:54:36,541
    I just know that he told me
    to deliver it to A.J., so--

774
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,476
And why did you do it?

775
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:42,046
    - I didn't have a choice.
    - Oh, come on, Malcolm.

776
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:44,314
Come on.
You always have a choice.

777
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:47,483
You could have done
a lot of things
with that package.

778
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:50,152
You're a smart kid.
I'm sure you thought
about all of them.

779
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:54,656
But you chose
to make the delivery
for this Dom person...

780
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:58,459
because you thought it was,
what, in your best interest?

781
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:05,564
So, you should
take responsibility...

782
00:55:05,566 --> 00:55:08,166
for the choice
that you've made.

783
00:55:08,168 --> 00:55:11,235
    Now, you know
    I'm not the person
    or persons...

784
00:55:11,237 --> 00:55:13,003
for whom this delivery
was intended.

785
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:14,738
Something happened
along the way.

786
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,607
It's like, uh, Amazon.

787
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:22,177
If you order a Rick Ross
or Macklemore CD--

788
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:25,580
            I would not order
            a Macklemore CD.

789
00:55:25,582 --> 00:55:27,315
        That wouldn't happen.

790
00:55:27,317 --> 00:55:29,650
All right. Who, then?

791
00:55:29,652 --> 00:55:31,585
                Casey Veggies.

792
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:34,387
Casey Veggies?
That's-- That's an artist?

793
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:37,656
                        Yeah.
Yeah, okay. All right.

794
00:55:37,658 --> 00:55:42,193
So, you order
a Casey Veggies CD
from Amazon, right?

795
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:46,196
            No, you don't order
            a Casey Veggies CD.

796
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:48,464
            You just go online
            and you download it.

797
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:50,499
Yeah, okay. All right.

798
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:54,603
But you are aware
that Amazon does
ship discs, right?

799
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:58,006
And if you order that disc
and it does not come
in a timely fashion,

800
00:55:58,008 --> 00:56:00,375
you're gonna call them
and say, "Where's my stuff?"

801
00:56:00,377 --> 00:56:02,543
And Amazon has to
assume responsibility.

802
00:56:02,545 --> 00:56:04,645
But it's just one CD.

803
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:09,282
But what if it's 100 orders
and 100 CDs don't show up?

804
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:11,550
    Or a thousand?
    Or 10,000?

805
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,152
It's a slippery slope.

806
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:15,953
                Slippery slope.

807
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,222
So, Amazon has
got to assume...

808
00:56:19,224 --> 00:56:21,891
the full cost
of the loss.

809
00:56:21,893 --> 00:56:23,959
But most importantly,

810
00:56:23,961 --> 00:56:27,295
they have to deal with the loss
of their reputation.

811
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:30,231
A reputation that has taken
a long time to build.

812
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:32,099
    You understand
    what I'm saying?

813
00:56:33,568 --> 00:56:35,235
So let's do this.

814
00:56:35,237 --> 00:56:37,970
Let's reschedule
this interview...

815
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:42,040
for a few weeks from now.

816
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:43,574
Give it a little time.

817
00:56:43,576 --> 00:56:45,676
Go out there.

818
00:56:45,678 --> 00:56:48,545
Make the delivery
for which you have
claimed responsibility...

819
00:56:48,547 --> 00:56:50,914
to the appropriate
consumers...

820
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:54,383
so that the suppliers
of this product...

821
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:56,084
can be whole.

822
00:56:56,086 --> 00:56:58,986
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

823
00:56:58,988 --> 00:57:00,988
If you're able
to do this,

824
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:03,523
it shows me more
about you...

825
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:06,259
than any interview
ever could.

826
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:09,328
And I would then
make it my business...

827
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,831
to make you
a man of Harvard.

828
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:18,102
<i>I want you to get out of</i>
<i>The Bottoms just like I did.</i>

829
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:21,338
<i>I know from growing up there</i>
<i>it's very, very dangerous...</i>

830
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,041
<i>and that your family</i>
<i>or your friends could</i>
<i>get killed at any moment...</i>

831
00:57:25,043 --> 00:57:28,243
<i>just by being</i>
<i>in the wrong place</i>
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

832
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:32,079
I'd hate for that
to happen to you...

833
00:57:33,848 --> 00:57:36,082
<i>or any</i>
<i>of your family members.</i>

834
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:37,316
    Getting on?

835
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,689
Looks like you and I
had the same kind of day.

836
00:57:44,691 --> 00:57:46,157
How'd the interview go?

837
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:50,026
Okay.

838
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:52,528
    Well, sit down.

839
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,996
My shift's almost over.
I'll take you home.

840
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,799
            Thanks, Mom.

841
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,602
<i>The incident took place today</i>
<i>at Seven Bucks Coffee--</i>

842
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:29,973
<i>apparently the side effects</i>
<i>of the popular club drug MDMA,</i>
<i>or "Molly."</i>

843
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:32,942
<i>Tannehill James was a witness</i>
<i>to this bizarre scene.</i>

844
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,878
<i>So, I'm here</i>
<i>at the Seven Bucks, drinking</i>
<i>my vanilla chai latte...</i>

845
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,147
            <i> and eating me</i>

846

    <i> 'Cause you know niggas</i>
    <i> don't eat scones, right?</i>

847
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:46,986
<i>When all of a sudden</i>
<i>this crazy little naked ho</i>
<i>comes up...</i>

848
00:59:46,988 --> 00:59:50,022
<i>and she squatted down</i>
<i>right in front of me</i>
<i>and she pissed right there.</i>

849
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:51,523
                <i> I swear to God.</i>

850
00:59:51,525 --> 00:59:54,125

            <i> for a long time.</i>

851
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:58,461
        <i> So, now, you tell me</i>
        <i> how am I supposed to</i>
        <i> eat my pound cake...</i>

852
00:59:58,463 --> 01:00:00,162
        <i> after witnessing</i>
        <i> something like that?</i>

853
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:04,499
<i>Reporting live, Karen Myetta,</i>
<i>Channel 10 News.</i>

<i>Up next, a fight over lunch</i>
<i>turns deadly in Inglewood.</i>

855
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,571
Did he actually say,
"I'll kill you and your friends
 if you don't sell these drugs"?

856
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,706
            Or just you? What?

857
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:16,543
        Don't act like
        you weren't curious too.
    Not directly.

858
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:20,380
He was talking about
Amazon and Rick Ross CDs
not getting to their customers.

859
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:22,081
        Niggas don't even buy
        CDs anymore, dawg.

860
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,216
    Jib, that's not
    the fucking point!

861
01:00:24,218 --> 01:00:27,252
    Are you gonna go and sell
    on the corner? 'Cause we're
    a bunch of bitches, man.

862
01:00:27,254 --> 01:00:29,387
Speak for yourself, Jib.
                            Yes.

863
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:32,323
        I am a bitch-ass nigga.
        I don't give a fuck.
        I own that shit.

864
01:00:32,325 --> 01:00:34,391
            Who are you trying
            to impress, Diggy?

865
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:36,826
We're talking
about Molly, Jib,
not fucking heroin.

866
01:00:36,828 --> 01:00:39,862
All we gotta do
is find the white people.

867
01:00:39,864 --> 01:00:43,198
- Go to Coachella, Lollapalooza.
- Yeah, yeah.

868
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,901
We can backpack and hitchhike
and sing Mumford and Sons songs
and all that faux fucking shit.

869
01:00:46,903 --> 01:00:49,670
Fuck you. Okay?
I'm just saying it could work.

870
01:00:49,672 --> 01:00:52,205
    Yeah, yeah.
    Why stop there, you know?
    Why not hit Bonnaroo also?

871
01:00:52,207 --> 01:00:53,472
Bitcoins.

872
01:00:54,674 --> 01:00:56,273
    That's how we do it.
Do what?

873
01:00:58,609 --> 01:01:00,843
        Oh, shit.

874
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:03,779
    There's these sites
    where you can-- you can
    sell everything...

875
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:06,882
    from fake credit cards
    to illegal guns and drugs.

876
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:09,551
    And they use Bitcoins
    so they can't be traced.

877
01:01:09,553 --> 01:01:11,419
    We don't have to
    stand on any corner.

878
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:14,688
        Dark Web. Could work.

879
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,690
Way better than Coachella.

880
01:01:16,692 --> 01:01:19,959
Guys, the FBI
can track us. The police--
                No, they can't.

881
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:22,528
- Not if you use a Tor browser.
- What the fuck is that?

882
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,764
        - Onion routing.
        - Layered encryptions.

883
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:28,133
        It's like a game
        of Whac-A-Mole with
        thousands of computers--

884
01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:30,602
    What the fuck
    is a Whac-A-Mole?

885
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,438
Look, these dark Web sites
run off these secret
IP addresses.

886
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,440
Like LulzSec-level shady.

887
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,008
We need to find one somehow.

888
01:01:38,276 --> 01:01:40,110

<i>Musician, scholar,</i>

    Good shit. Fair prices.

893
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:10,268
<i>William assured them that</i>
<i>he used the word "nigga"...</i>

894
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:12,069
<i>only as a term</i>
<i>of endearment...</i>

895
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:15,205
<i>as explained by Q-Tip</i>
<i>in the classic song,</i>
<i>"Sucka Nigga."</i>

896
01:02:18,008 --> 01:02:19,742
        That's your room
        right there.

897
01:02:19,744 --> 01:02:22,111
<i>After that,</i>
<i>they all hit it off.</i>

898
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,180
<i>Though he never used that word</i>
<i>in front of them again.</i>

899
01:02:25,182 --> 01:02:27,916
<i>The mission at band camp</i>
<i>was to give kids</i>
<i>from different backgrounds...</i>

900
01:02:27,918 --> 01:02:31,352
<i>a chance to exchange</i>
<i>music and experiences</i>
<i>unique to their cultures.</i>

901
01:02:31,354 --> 01:02:35,655
    W-W-Wait. Okay, so
    you're saying white girls
    will suck dick...

902
01:02:35,657 --> 01:02:37,790
                yet still claim
                they're virgins?

903
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:41,360
Yeah, man. I'm serious.
Really?

904
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:43,995
Dude, check it.
I've been getting head since
I was, like, 12, all right?

905
01:02:43,997 --> 01:02:47,331
I've been
hitting hos in the ass
since I was, like, 14.

906
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,499
It's true, man.

907
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:53,502
These chicks will
let you fill any hole,
except the pussy,

908
01:02:53,504 --> 01:02:55,504
with a dick, no problem.

909
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,940
So, technically,
you're still a virgin too.

910
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:02,943
            - Yeah.
            - Right.

911
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,546
But here's something
to wrap your brain around, man.

912
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:09,215
I've never had intercourse
with a pussy.

913
01:03:09,217 --> 01:03:12,684
Mm-hmm?
    Only asshole and oral.
    Okay?

914
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:17,488
So the question isn't,
"Am I technically a virgin?"

915
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:20,257
    What the question
    could be is...

916
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:23,726
"Am I technically... gay?"

917
01:03:24,561 --> 01:03:27,296
        Oh. That's deep, nigga.

918
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:30,198

<i>where he smoked</i>
<i>a pound of weed a week,</i>
<i>skipped classes...</i>

01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,172
<i>and had a 1.9 GPA,</i>

922

<i>yet got a perfect score</i>
<i>on his SAT.</i>

923
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:45,244
<i>He was accepted</i>
<i>to his father's alma mater</i>
<i>under academic probation,</i>

924
01:03:45,246 --> 01:03:49,481
<i>which meant he had to maintain</i>
<i>a 3.0 grade point average.</i>

925
01:03:49,483 --> 01:03:52,350
<i>So, William hacked into</i>

926
01:03:52,352 --> 01:03:55,853
<i>erasing all grades</i>
<i>from the entire freshman class.</i>

927
01:03:59,325 --> 01:04:02,025
    Small-batch, craft-brewed,
    40-ounce malt liquor.

<i>That same year,</i>

No.

Hey, nah, it's good, man.

932

01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:52,299
Wha-- Nah, really, dude.
What can I get you, man?

941
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:55,001
        I'm dead-ass serious,
        nigga.

942
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:56,669
            Dead-ass serious.

943
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:58,671
    Okay.

944
01:04:58,673 --> 01:05:01,240
Okay.
All right. Wait.

945
01:05:01,242 --> 01:05:04,243
'Cause this is
ridiculous, man.

946
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:07,579
Why the fuck,
after all these years,

947
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:11,515
you can call me N-word
and I can't say it?

948
01:05:11,517 --> 01:05:13,583
            Yo, look, we already
            went over this.

949
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:16,586
    I'll have to slap
    the shit out of you again.
    I don't want to do that.

950
01:05:16,588 --> 01:05:19,655
See, that's not even right.
I mean, like, really.

951
01:05:19,657 --> 01:05:22,424
You know I'm
not the one, all right?
This is all love here.

952
01:05:22,426 --> 01:05:24,592
                Look, let's--
                let's get back--

953
01:05:24,594 --> 01:05:26,193
Hey, you asked me
to do something for you.

954
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:28,562
I'm like, "What?" I'm down.
I don't give a fuck.

955
01:05:28,564 --> 01:05:32,866
Because you're my people,
all right? You're my n--

956
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:34,400
And this is where
I would insert that word.

957
01:05:34,402 --> 01:05:36,068
        It's nothing personal.
        You're still my nigga.

958
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,336
            But I gotta slap
            the shit out of you
            based on principle.

959
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:41,505
- Let's get back
  to what's goin' on.
- No, no, no. Wait. Principle?

960
01:05:41,507 --> 01:05:44,374
Okay, you want
to talk principle.
What about Jib here, man?

961
01:05:44,376 --> 01:05:46,042
This dude isn't
African-American.

962
01:05:46,044 --> 01:05:48,677
He's like fucking Latino
or Moroccan or some shit.

963
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:49,944
Where's this conversation going?

964
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,879
Technically, he shouldn't
be able to say the word.

965
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,881
- Why can he use it?
- Okay. Because I'm 14% African.

966
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,916
Four-- Fourteen?
That doesn't--

967
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,584
Shit, I'm probably 14%.

968
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,953
            I am 14% African.

969
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:01,921
        Look, we don't
        give a fuck.

970
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:04,623
- For real?
- Just say the damn word, okay?

971
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:07,125
    - It doesn't matter.
      It's cool, right?
    - I don't give a shit.

972
01:06:07,127 --> 01:06:09,961
    I give a fuck.
    Don't say that shit. I will
    slap the shit out of you.

973
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:13,297
No, no, no. No, you won't
because you have been
outvoted by your peers.

974
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:15,599
I'm George W. Bush.
I don't give a fuck
what the vote says.

975
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,000
                        Dig.
What the fuck?

976
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:21,103
- Let him say it.

977
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:26,040
    - All right, you can say it.
    - Thank you.

978
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:28,442
And I appreciate that.
I really do.

979
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:30,444
Now, like a nigga was saying--

980
01:06:30,446 --> 01:06:32,045
What the fuck!

981
01:06:32,047 --> 01:06:34,080
What the fuck?

982
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:36,482
What the fuck?
    Yo, it was a reflex.

983
01:06:36,484 --> 01:06:38,450
- Reflex? A fuckin' reflex?
- Dig!

984
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,251
    It won't happen again.
    I'm sorry.

985
01:06:40,253 --> 01:06:43,987
            Look. Will,
            we need your help
            to sell this shit.

986
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:45,955
    That's why we're here.

987
01:06:45,957 --> 01:06:49,224
    - Whoa. How did
      you guys get this?
    - It's a long story, man.

988
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:51,025
        We need to know
        if you're gonna help us.

989
01:06:52,761 --> 01:06:55,562
Why? I mean, you guys
could set that type
of shit up easily.

990
01:06:55,564 --> 01:06:57,597
            Nah, nigga,
            not like you. Okay?

991
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,499
        I need to go ghost.
        None of this shit
        can point back to me.

992
01:07:00,501 --> 01:07:03,768
        The type of protection
        I need for this shit
        requires a hacker.

993
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,903
                Anon shit.

994
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:08,305
    You broke into
    the fucking USC database.

995
01:07:08,307 --> 01:07:10,240
Hey, hey. No, no, no. Okay?

996
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:12,275
Samo did that.
I don't know shit, all right?

997
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:14,010
                Whatever, nigga.

998
01:07:14,012 --> 01:07:15,978
        Look, we don't know shit
        about selling dope.

999
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,612
Nothing.

1000
01:07:17,614 --> 01:07:19,680
Nothing about the units,
the terminology, the pricing.

1001
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:22,282
    None of that shit.
    I don't even know how much
    this fucking bag is worth.

1002
01:07:22,284 --> 01:07:24,417
                        You do.

1003
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:26,285
Okay.

1004
01:07:26,287 --> 01:07:30,122
But if this is
a Samo-type job,

1005
01:07:30,124 --> 01:07:32,524
man, I can't just
do this as a favor.

1006
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:34,325
            What do you want?
            A percentage
            of the profits?

1007
01:07:34,327 --> 01:07:36,327
        Fuck that.

1008
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:37,995
    Pay me in Molly.

1009
01:07:39,865 --> 01:07:42,465
Cut up the shit.
You're gonna want to
measure it out...

1010
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:45,034
so you can bag it up in grams,
sell it that way.

1011
01:07:45,036 --> 01:07:49,805
But, you know, what a lot
of the kids are liking nowadays
is the pill form.

1012
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:57,879
                So, where we
                setting up shop?

1013
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:01,548
Here.

1014
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,450
                        Here?
Yeah. Here.

1015
01:08:04,452 --> 01:08:06,185
                Are you fuckin'
                retarded?

1016
01:08:06,187 --> 01:08:08,887
No. It's actually
genius, bro.

1017
01:08:08,889 --> 01:08:10,488
<i>We have a science lab.</i>

1018
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:12,556
        We want to enter
        the Google Science Fair.

1019
01:08:12,558 --> 01:08:14,558
    All we need you to do
    is open up the science labs,

1020
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,359
                and we can do
                everything else.

1021
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,496
        Don't lose that shit,
        okay?

1022
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:24,231
<i>We have a computer lab</i>
<i>which nobody ever uses.</i>

1023
01:08:29,404 --> 01:08:32,705
<i>And all the supplies</i>
<i>laying around the band room</i>
<i>would be perfect for shipping.</i>

1024
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:38,876
And the best part--
watch.

1025
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,054
Nobody's going to
suspect a thing. We're just
geeks doing what geeks do.

1026
01:08:54,924 --> 01:08:57,357
Right?
That's what I'm saying, bro.
You're into it, bro.

1027

<i> What's up?</i>

1028
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:04,895
                Yo.
                    What's up?

1029
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:07,264
<i>Hey, congratulations</i>

<i>some customers, right?</i>

1031
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:11,935
        - Yeah.
        -<i> Check it out.</i>

1034
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:23,745
Okay. Say we're, like--
What about if you're quoting,
like, rap lyrics?

1035
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:26,114
Say we're all listening
to<i> The Chronic, Doggystyle.</i>

1036
01:09:26,116 --> 01:09:29,283
        We're all rapping along.
        Like, what are we
        supposed to say?

1037
01:09:31,754 --> 01:09:33,854
        I'm sorry.
        That's bullshit, dude.
    Yes.

1038
01:09:33,856 --> 01:09:37,224
-What about the artist's intent?
-Dude, that is exactly what
 I'm talking about, man.

1039
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:39,593
        Dude,
        I saw your bitch, Lily,
        on YouTube.

1040
01:09:39,595 --> 01:09:44,063
Okay. Well, Lily is not
my bitch anymore, so--

1041
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:46,565
    Then can I get at her, dude?
    'Cause I gotta find out
    what she was on.

1042
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:49,067
Nigga, I don't give a fuck.
All right?

1043
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:54,939
Go for it, dude.
Hey, but for real,
she was using this.

1044
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:01,878
        Um-- Mike check.

1069
01:13:34,641 --> 01:13:37,209
        <i> Lily, dude,</i>
        <i> that was unbelievable.</i>

1070
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:55,560
Principal Harris
tells me that there are
three young men...

1071
01:13:55,562 --> 01:13:57,762
who actually joined
the Google Science Fair.

1072
01:13:57,764 --> 01:13:59,296
Please.

1073
01:14:05,903 --> 01:14:07,937
Proof...

1074
01:14:07,939 --> 01:14:10,906
that the public school system
is still a ladder...

1075
01:14:10,908 --> 01:14:12,407
to success.

1076
01:14:13,876 --> 01:14:16,043
            Half an ounce
            for Joe Patterson.

1077
01:14:16,045 --> 01:14:18,545
We have an ounce
for John Smith.

1078
01:14:18,547 --> 01:14:20,914
We have an eighth
for Ashley Down.

1079
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:22,482
    - Susan Thompson.
    - Steve Burke.

1080
01:14:29,522 --> 01:14:31,689
<i>Yeah, this popped up</i>
<i>about a few weeks ago.</i>

1081
01:14:31,691 --> 01:14:34,892
Look at what they're moving.
It's major volume too.

1082
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:37,361
    I don't know why
    they're calling it "Lily."

1083
01:14:37,363 --> 01:14:41,898
    Maybe, uh, 2 Chainz
    called it that on a mixtape.

1084
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,533
        He's a rapper.
        Yeah, you know,
        "The Birthday Song."

1085
01:14:44,535 --> 01:14:46,701
            "Big booty ho."

1086
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:49,603
            Okay, never mind.
            Forget it.

1087
01:14:59,713 --> 01:15:01,647
                        Hi.

1088
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:06,984
            Um, is that offer
            still on the table?

1089
01:15:06,986 --> 01:15:10,087
Help.

1090
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,922
            If you're busy,
            I can come back
            tomorrow or later.

1091
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,658
No, um, no. They're--
They're about to leave.

1092
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,959
    Yeah.
Yeah, we were stepping.

1093
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:20,194
            Okay, cool. Thanks.

1094
01:15:30,838 --> 01:15:32,671
    Bye. Bye, guys.
            Have fun.

1095
01:15:54,124 --> 01:15:56,023
                Thanks
                for helping me.

1096
01:15:56,025 --> 01:15:58,125
        No problem.

1097
01:15:58,127 --> 01:16:00,026
    You're
    a fast learner.

1098
01:16:00,028 --> 01:16:01,560
                    Aw.

1099
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:05,830
                Thanks.

1100
01:16:11,535 --> 01:16:13,736
        Shit's been real crazy
        since Dom got locked up.

1101
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:19,708
        A few of his boys
        got smoked on the corner
        the other day.

1102
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,617
            I don't want
            to go back there.

1103
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:40,059
    Sorry. I just don't
    have people I can talk to
    about this stuff...

1104
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:42,194
                that understand,
                you know?

1105
01:16:43,296 --> 01:16:45,063
    I know.

1106
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:47,932
                    Thanks.

1107
01:16:54,038 --> 01:16:55,904
            Dom called from jail
            the other day.

1108
01:16:58,407 --> 01:17:00,274
            He asked about you.

1109
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:08,948
That's why you showed up
all of a sudden.

1110
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,683
            What's that
            supposed to mean?

1111
01:17:11,685 --> 01:17:14,452
It means
that Dom sent you here
as his messenger.

1112
01:17:16,054 --> 01:17:18,888
All this
crying on my shoulder?
Bullshit.

1113
01:17:20,423 --> 01:17:22,991
You're supposed
to put your feminine
wiles on me...

1114
01:17:22,993 --> 01:17:24,826
and find out
about the fucking dope.

1115
01:17:24,828 --> 01:17:26,794
Right?

1116
01:17:27,328 --> 01:17:28,795
        Right?

1117
01:17:38,671 --> 01:17:40,672
                    Wait. I--

1118
01:17:40,674 --> 01:17:42,907
And here I was,
stupid enough to think
that you were different...

1119
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:45,075
than these other niggas.

1120
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,576
    Nakia, Nakia, Nakia.

1121
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:48,077
                Fuck you!

1122
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:01,189
        "Feminine wiles"?

1123
01:18:01,191 --> 01:18:03,958
        Good morning.
        Today you're going
        to take the SAT.

1124
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,127
The SAT is your chance
to show how prepared you are
for college.

1125
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:10,763
You will have 25 minutes
to work on section one.

1126
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:14,366
Yo, what the fuck
was that?

1127
01:18:14,368 --> 01:18:16,468
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1128
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:18,369
            Drug search, dawg.

1129
01:18:18,371 --> 01:18:20,804
        They do it randomly,
        like, every month or so.

1130
01:18:20,806 --> 01:18:22,939
    It's all for show.
    I mean, it's not like
    somebody is stupid enough...

1131
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:24,607
                to put some shit
                in their locker.

1132
01:18:26,142 --> 01:18:27,976
Can I go to the bathroom?

1133
01:18:27,978 --> 01:18:30,244
Yes, but you will not
be given more time.

1134
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,639
                Man.
    Come on, man.

1135
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:07,908
            What in the hell
            are you doing?

1136
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,043
    Um, SAT's.

1137
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,045
                SAT's?

1138
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:16,014
I had to use the restroom,
and I'm kind of late
getting back.

1139
01:19:16,016 --> 01:19:17,582
You know?

1140
01:19:19,685 --> 01:19:21,719
    Thank you.
                Good luck,
                little man.

1141
01:19:21,721 --> 01:19:25,089
<i>Bring that beat back!</i>
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

1142
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:27,124
<i>Here it is!</i>
<i>The set ain't over!</i>

1143
01:19:27,126 --> 01:19:29,459
<i>Come on, y'all.</i>
<i>Let's get busy.</i>

1144
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:32,428
<i>Come on. Say "Yeah!"</i>

1145
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:35,130
<i>Say "Hell yeah!"</i>

1146
01:19:35,132 --> 01:19:37,432
<i>- Ain't it funky?
- </i> <i>I'm not doing</i> <i>this shit no more.</i>

1147
01:19:37,434 --> 01:19:39,233
Bro, I can
fix this shit.

1148
01:19:39,235 --> 01:19:41,602
I can fix
this shit.

1149
01:19:41,604 --> 01:19:43,904
The bag is almost done.
The shit is almost gone.

1150
01:19:43,906 --> 01:19:47,140
    I mean, I can't sell
    this shit no more. We almost
    just got fucking caught.

1151
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:50,710
        Look, I don't want
        to go to jail. I want to
        go to fucking college.

1152
01:19:50,712 --> 01:19:53,279
    I want to get a good job.
    I want to help my mom!

1153
01:19:53,281 --> 01:19:54,346
        Dig?

1154
01:19:57,316 --> 01:19:59,216
That's cool.

1155
01:20:00,484 --> 01:20:02,785
It's my fault,
my weight to carry.

1156
01:20:02,787 --> 01:20:04,653
        Yo, that's bullshit.

1157
01:20:06,255 --> 01:20:09,289
We all wanted
to go to Dom's party.
Especially you, Jib.

1158
01:20:10,624 --> 01:20:12,291
It's our weight
to carry too.

1159
01:20:13,793 --> 01:20:15,826
We've got your back
to the end, right?

1160
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:18,828
Right?

1161
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,533
            Fuck.

1162
01:20:29,136 --> 01:20:30,669
                            Ooh.

1163
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:33,772
        - There it is.
        -<i> Gracias.</i>

1164
01:20:33,774 --> 01:20:36,341
All right, so, when we get
the Bitcoins, then what?

1165
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:37,875
    I need cash.

1166
01:20:39,978 --> 01:20:42,312
    Well, you would have to
    do a currency exchange...

1167
01:20:42,314 --> 01:20:45,615
to get the US dollar equivalent,
but, I mean--

1168
01:20:45,617 --> 01:20:48,651
    that kind of
    defeats the purpose of
    a non-fiat currency, right?

1169
01:20:48,653 --> 01:20:51,754
Okay, see,
I don't give a fuck about
all that Aaron Swartz...

1170
01:20:51,756 --> 01:20:53,689
Occupy Wall Street shit.

1171
01:20:53,691 --> 01:20:58,126
    Okay, well, you'd have to
    link your Bitcoin account
    to a bank account,

1172
01:20:58,128 --> 01:21:00,862
            and then there's
            this infinitesimally
            small chance...

1173
01:21:00,864 --> 01:21:02,663
        that it could be traced.

1174
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:05,799
    I mean, the Feds
    would have to know exactly
    what they're looking for.

1175
01:21:05,801 --> 01:21:09,002
        It's not something
        they could just
        stumble upon randomly.

1176
01:21:09,004 --> 01:21:14,473
Basically, I would just
have to make a stupid-ass
mistake for them to trace it.

1177
01:21:14,475 --> 01:21:18,309
    And do I look like
    the type of nigga that
    makes stupid-ass mistakes?

1178
01:21:21,312 --> 01:21:22,545
        Um--

1179
01:21:23,847 --> 01:21:26,615
        So, you want me
        to set up that exchange?

1180
01:21:26,617 --> 01:21:28,817
    I'm-- I'm good.
    I'll do it.

1181
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:30,318
            - Um--
            - Huh?

1182
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,586
What if I want
zero chances of trace?

1183
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:36,156
                    Well...

1184
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:38,091
        if you want zero trace,

1185
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:41,627
            you gotta go
            black market, homey.

1186
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:44,363
<i>Yeah, you got to put</i>
<i>the Bitcoins on a drive...</i>

1187
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:45,964
<i>and make</i>
<i>a hand-to-hand exchange.</i>

1188
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:49,634
<i>You get cash</i>
<i>minus the transaction fee.</i>

1189
01:21:49,636 --> 01:21:53,337
<i>If you really want</i>
<i>to go that route--</i>
<i>and I really don't suggest it--</i>

1190
01:21:53,339 --> 01:21:55,238
<i>I know a dude</i>
<i>in the garment district.</i>

1191
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,139
<i>Ask for Fidel.</i>

1192
01:21:57,141 --> 01:22:00,709
<i>If you pass his test,</i>
<i>he'll help you.</i>

1193
01:22:01,911 --> 01:22:04,312
<i>If you don't--</i>

1194
01:22:04,314 --> 01:22:07,214
<i>Well, just pass his test.</i>

1195
01:22:07,216 --> 01:22:10,517
One of these alligator bags
was made here.

1196
01:22:10,519 --> 01:22:12,385
One is from the store.

1197
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:15,254
Which one is which?

1198
01:22:15,256 --> 01:22:17,489
    The right one,
    I mean, 'cause it's--

1199
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:19,357
    Mm-hmm.
            poofier.

1200
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:21,959
                They both
                look the same.

1201
01:22:25,396 --> 01:22:27,330
The reality is...

1202
01:22:27,332 --> 01:22:30,199
I sell 90% of my stuff
to white hos.

1203
01:22:30,201 --> 01:22:32,734
Most are rich enough
to afford retail.

1204
01:22:32,736 --> 01:22:34,469
Why do you think that is?

1205
01:22:35,737 --> 01:22:37,604
                I don't know.

1206
01:22:37,606 --> 01:22:41,107
They know. They know
the only difference...

1207
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:43,375
between
these two bags...

1208
01:22:43,377 --> 01:22:45,076
is the person
rocking them.

1209
01:22:45,078 --> 01:22:47,278
So, when they rock 'em,

1210
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
people are gonna assume
it's real.

1211
01:22:49,282 --> 01:22:52,182
And the flip of that is...

1212
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:55,618
it doesn't matter
if you had the receipt
from Barneys sewn into the bag.

1213
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,288
People gonna assume
it's fake.

1214
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:00,989
Only you know the truth.

1215
01:23:03,392 --> 01:23:05,726
So, what are you, man?

1216
01:23:05,728 --> 01:23:07,394
Are you a real?

1217
01:23:07,396 --> 01:23:10,096
Are you a fake?

1218
01:23:10,098 --> 01:23:12,264
That's what I need
to find out.

1219
01:23:12,266 --> 01:23:14,599
            I'm just Malcolm.

1220
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:17,301
"Just Malcolm"?
Who the fuck is Malcolm?

1221
01:23:17,303 --> 01:23:21,003
Show me.
I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

1222
01:23:23,606 --> 01:23:26,407
Hey!
Don't look at them.

1223
01:23:26,409 --> 01:23:30,310
This is between you and me.
I'm-a give you five seconds.

1224
01:23:30,312 --> 01:23:34,380
You can either man up
or run out like
the little bitch you is.

1225
01:23:35,548 --> 01:23:38,316
- One!
- Malcolm, let's just go.

1226
01:23:38,318 --> 01:23:40,885
Listen to
your friends, boy.
Two!

1227
01:23:40,887 --> 01:23:43,554
        You can't be serious.
I'm more than serious,
motherfucker.

1228
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:45,656
Three!
            I need that money.

1229
01:23:45,658 --> 01:23:48,492
You ain't gettin' shit.
Four!

1230
01:23:48,494 --> 01:23:50,927
Yeah, you see
your pussy friends leaving?

1231
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:52,528
They're running
like some little bitches.

1232
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:55,430
Run, pussy.

1233
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:57,632
Five! Five! Five!

1234
01:23:57,634 --> 01:23:59,333
Hit me, man!
Five, motherfuck--

1235
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,580
                Oh, man. You--

1236
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:27,091
Drive.
                    Where?

1237
01:24:27,093 --> 01:24:30,494
Give me the drive!
                        Shit.

1238
01:24:48,645 --> 01:24:50,078
Come here, man.

1239
01:24:57,218 --> 01:24:59,319
Now I know
who you are--

1240
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:02,055
A man that
does not give a fuck.

1241
01:25:20,304 --> 01:25:23,005
Hey, blood!
Don't you owe me
another shoe, nigga?

1242
01:25:23,007 --> 01:25:25,073
                    Shit!

1243
01:25:25,075 --> 01:25:27,375
    Get on the ground,
    bitch-ass nigga.

1244
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:30,544
    - Get the fuck off me!
    - Malcolm!

1245
01:25:30,546 --> 01:25:33,647
- Get off us! Malcolm!
- Stay the fuck down, nigga.

1246
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:36,416
    - Malcolm!
    - Bitch nigga. Yeah.

1247
01:25:36,418 --> 01:25:38,851
Yeah!

1248
01:25:38,853 --> 01:25:41,320
    - Jib, get the fucking bag.
    - Come on!

1249
01:25:41,322 --> 01:25:44,121
Oh, shit.

1250
01:25:45,857 --> 01:25:47,424
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hold on.

1251
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,661
                Give me the bag.

1252
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:03,438
        Please,
        just give me the bag.

1253
01:26:16,716 --> 01:26:19,451
        I don't even want
        that shit, blood.

1254
01:26:19,453 --> 01:26:22,687
        Let's go, nigga.
All right. Come on.

1255
01:26:22,689 --> 01:26:24,321
We out, we out, we out.

1256
01:26:32,394 --> 01:26:34,094
        It's okay.

1257
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:38,497
    It's okay.

1258
01:26:48,908 --> 01:26:50,909
                Come on.

1259
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:52,343
                Let's go.

1260
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,681
                    That's 10%.

1261
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:35,916
        Consider it a proffer.

1262
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,619
    - The rest is
      in a Bitcoin account.
    - Bitcoin?

1263
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:42,589
            It's an untraceable
            Internet currency.

1264
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:45,892
    There are Web sites
    that sell a lot of things...

1265
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,861
            that people
            would get in trouble
            for selling.

1266
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,563
            They use Bitcoins.

1267
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:53,431
            Kind of like Amazon.

1268
01:27:53,433 --> 01:27:55,132
So you sold on the Internet?

1269
01:27:56,033 --> 01:27:57,500
                    No.

1270
01:27:58,568 --> 01:28:01,069
                No. You did.

1271
01:28:01,071 --> 01:28:03,037
        Excuse me?

1272
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:06,005
    You set up a store
    on Black Market Reloaded.

1273
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,640
                Very successful.

1274
01:28:08,642 --> 01:28:10,274
                Very successful.

1275
01:28:10,276 --> 01:28:13,710
        I mean, you moved
        your entire inventory.

1276
01:28:13,712 --> 01:28:16,479
        See, the market's
        been pretty volatile,

1277
01:28:16,481 --> 01:28:22,317
but as of right now,
you have $97,267 and 31 cents...

1278
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:25,386
            in your Bitcoin
            exchange account.

1279
01:28:27,089 --> 01:28:29,422
                10,000 in cash.

1280
01:28:29,424 --> 01:28:32,992
        Now, as long as
        your Bitcoins stay
        in the exchange account,

1281
01:28:32,994 --> 01:28:35,761
    they're safe, untraceable.

1282
01:28:35,763 --> 01:28:40,932
    Now, if you were to exchange
    the Bitcoins into dollars...

1283
01:28:40,934 --> 01:28:44,702
and transfer that money
into your Jacoby Check Cashing
corporate account,

1284
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:51,007
    there would be a
    really, really small chance
    of it getting traced...

1285
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:53,743
            by the DEA or FBI.

1286
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:57,779
        I mean, that would
        only happen if you were
        idiotically sloppy...

1287
01:28:57,781 --> 01:29:00,114
while setting up
the Bitcoin exchange account.

1288
01:29:01,584 --> 01:29:03,183
        So you want me
        to set up that exchange?

1289
01:29:03,185 --> 01:29:04,684
I'm good. I'll do it.

1290
01:29:04,686 --> 01:29:09,021
I mean, that-- I mean,
it would almost have to be...

1291
01:29:11,157 --> 01:29:12,957
                intentional.

1292
01:29:16,627 --> 01:29:19,295
And why should I believe
any of this, Malcolm?

1293
01:29:19,297 --> 01:29:22,097
    Is your Jacoby APS
    shipping account number...

1294
01:29:22,099 --> 01:29:24,799
<i>FX4578?</i>

1295
01:29:24,801 --> 01:29:29,970
<i>California regional</i>
<i>bank number 267856783?</i>

1296
01:29:29,972 --> 01:29:32,605
            Federal Tax ID 95--

1297
01:29:32,607 --> 01:29:36,542
    Hey, you really should
    just upgrade your firewall,
    you know?

1298
01:29:36,544 --> 01:29:39,845
    I actually know a guy.
    He's kind of familiar
    with your system already.

1299
01:29:46,285 --> 01:29:49,520
You're all out
of toilet paper, hon.

1300
01:29:49,522 --> 01:29:52,956
Courtside, okay? Courtside.
Gotta have it. No, come on.

1301
01:30:00,964 --> 01:30:03,632
Now, what if I report
to the authorities...

1302
01:30:03,634 --> 01:30:05,867
that my securities
have been breached...

1303
01:30:05,869 --> 01:30:08,069
    and my identity
    has been stolen?

1304
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:10,671
        As I've just learned,

1305
01:30:10,673 --> 01:30:12,539
    it doesn't matter
    if this bag is real or fake.

1306
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:17,476
Because of where I come from,
everybody's going to
assume it's fake.

1307
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:19,811
        So, since you and I come
        from the same place,

1308
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,848
        what is the DEA going
        to assume about you?

1309
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,650
And because you and I
are from the same place,
Malcolm,

1310
01:30:26,652 --> 01:30:30,553
you should know
what a person like me
can do to a person like you.

1311
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:32,988
                        Yeah.

1312
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:34,923
        But that's not what
        a Harvard man would do.

1313
01:30:36,892 --> 01:30:40,094
    Nah, see, a man of Harvard
    is smart enough to see...

1314
01:30:40,096 --> 01:30:42,062
            that would set off
            a chain of events...

1315
01:30:42,064 --> 01:30:44,998
            that would
            inevitably come back
            and destroy him...

1316
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,633
<i>and everything he's built.</i>

1317
01:30:48,534 --> 01:30:51,602
<i>That would be a shame.</i>

1318
01:30:51,604 --> 01:30:55,505
    So, I think you should
    take this opportunity
    before you very seriously.

1319
01:30:57,508 --> 01:31:01,377
    Do everything in your power
    to ensure that I become
    a man of Harvard...

1320
01:31:01,379 --> 01:31:04,813
and make sure nothing happens
to a hair on my gorgeous head.

1321
01:31:06,182 --> 01:31:07,615
                Can you dig it?

1322
01:31:20,794 --> 01:31:23,760
Malcolm,
you forgot your bag.

1323
01:31:26,096 --> 01:31:27,596
                It's fake.

1324
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:43,442
<i>Malcolm.</i>

1325
01:31:43,444 --> 01:31:46,578
You're pretty damn arrogant.
You think you're gonna
get into Harvard?

1326
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:49,013
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1327
01:32:04,562 --> 01:32:06,362
Let me tell you
about two students.

1328
01:32:09,432 --> 01:32:12,500
<i>Student "A" is</i>
<i>a straight-A student who lives</i>
<i>in the suburbs of Los Angeles.</i>

1329
01:32:16,437 --> 01:32:18,738
<i>He plays in a punk band</i>
<i>with his best friends.</i>

1330
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:21,841
<i>He loves to skateboard</i>
<i>and ride on his BMX bike.</i>

1331
01:32:21,843 --> 01:32:25,911
<i>His favorite TV show</i>
<i>is</i> Game Of Thrones<i> and his</i>
<i>favorite band is The Thermals.</i>

1332
01:32:25,913 --> 01:32:29,080
<i>He's a '90s hip-hop geek.</i>

1333
01:32:29,082 --> 01:32:32,116
<i>Student "B" goes</i>
<i>to an underfunded school...</i>

1334
01:32:32,118 --> 01:32:34,184
<i>where teachers who would</i>
<i>rather not be there...</i>

1335
01:32:34,186 --> 01:32:38,087
<i>teach kids</i>
<i>who really don't care.</i>

1336
01:32:38,089 --> 01:32:40,889
<i>He lives with a single mother,</i>
<i>doesn't know his father</i>
<i>and has sold dope.</i>

1337
01:32:44,293 --> 01:32:46,193
<i>Now close your eyes.</i>

1338
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:49,763
<i>Picture each of these kids</i>
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

1339
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:52,599
<i>Be honest.</i>
<i>No one's going to judge you.</i>

1340
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:54,667
<i>Now open your eyes.</i>

1341
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,935
        So, am I student "A"
        or student "B"?

1342
01:32:56,937 --> 01:32:58,870
        Am I a geek or a menace?

1343
01:32:58,872 --> 01:33:01,606
    For most of my life,
    I've been caught in between
    who I really am...

1344
01:33:01,608 --> 01:33:03,274
        and how I'm perceived,

1345
01:33:03,276 --> 01:33:05,575
in between categories
and definition.

1346
01:33:06,877 --> 01:33:08,444
I don't fit in.

1347
01:33:08,446 --> 01:33:11,847
And I used to think that
that was a curse, but...

1348
01:33:11,849 --> 01:33:14,215
now I'm slowly
starting to see...

1349
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,284
maybe it's a blessing.

1350
01:33:17,286 --> 01:33:19,219
            See, when you
            don't fit in,

1351
01:33:19,221 --> 01:33:22,488
you're forced to see the world
from many different angles
and points of view.

1352
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:27,392
    You gain knowledge,
    life lessons from disparate
    people and places.

1353
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:30,395
And those lessons,
for better or worse,
have shaped me.

1354
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:32,163
        So, who am I?

1355
01:33:32,165 --> 01:33:35,533
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
My name is Malcolm Adekanbi.

1356
01:33:35,535 --> 01:33:38,502
I'm a straight-A student
with nearly perfect SAT scores.

1357
01:33:38,504 --> 01:33:41,571
I taught myself
how to play guitar
and read music.

1358
01:33:41,573 --> 01:33:45,174
I have stellar recommendations
and diverse extracurricular
activities.

1359
01:33:45,176 --> 01:33:47,309
    I am a Google Science Fair
    participant,

1360
01:33:47,311 --> 01:33:50,778
    and in three weeks,
    I helped make over $100,000
    for an online business.

1361
01:33:52,147 --> 01:33:54,748
    So, why do I want
    to attend Harvard?

1362
01:33:56,884 --> 01:33:59,652
    If I was white,
    would you even have to
    ask me that question?

1363
01:35:48,612 --> 01:35:51,213
Nice haircut.

1364
01:35:52,515 --> 01:35:54,182
                    I like it.

1365
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:01,789
I'm-- I'm sorry...

1366
01:36:01,791 --> 01:36:05,692
for all the stuff
that I said.

1367
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:11,030
There was a lot going on
at the time.

1368
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:14,333
And... that wasn't me.

1369
01:36:16,703 --> 01:36:18,336
                Yeah, it was.

1370
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,540
    You might have all
    these other folks fooled,
    but not me.

1371
01:36:24,775 --> 01:36:26,275
                    You're...

1372
01:36:27,777 --> 01:36:29,344
                    complicated.

1373
01:36:33,582 --> 01:36:36,182
        Anyway, I just came by
        to say thank you.

1374
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,318
    Thank you?

1375
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,386
You-- You passed?
                    Mm-hmm.

1376
01:36:42,388 --> 01:36:44,187
You passed.

1377
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:47,456
You were supposed to
go to prom with me.

1378
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:49,424
                        No.

1379
01:36:49,426 --> 01:36:52,126
        I told you I wasn't mad
        about missing prom.

1380
01:36:54,129 --> 01:36:55,696
        Hey.

1381
01:36:56,998 --> 01:36:59,799
            I was mad about
            missing Six Flags.

1382
01:37:09,508 --> 01:37:11,542
                I'll pick you up
                in the morning.
