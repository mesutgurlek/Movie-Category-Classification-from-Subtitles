[Rock]

00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,995
Never found out
why you left him

3
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:09,002
But this answer
begs that question

4
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:12,445
Too blind to see tomorrow
Too broke to beg or borrow

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,925
Span the distance
Bridge the border

00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:20,807
Beg forgiveness
round the corner again

7
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:29,540
One more point
of contention

[Girl] Are you sure you
don't wanna go to my room?
[Boy] No. Why?

11
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,235
My roommate's
already moved out.
We'll be all alone.

12
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:41,248
All right.
The door is locked.

13
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:43,255
Okay, Jim, relax. Relax.
Okay, yeah, sure.

14
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,266
No strings attached, okay?
It's just friendly
good-bye sex.

15
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,375
Yeah, right. Right,
right, right, right.

16
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:48,842
Yeah, right. Right,
right, right, right.

17
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:52,319
Uh, yeah, but you see,
it's just that, um,

18
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:55,331
we've never even had
friendly hello sex.

19
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:59,071
So do you not
wanna do this?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

20
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,749
Oh, I do. Yeah.
No, I definitely do.

21
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,426
Uh, it's just that,

22
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:07,873
you see, this is actually
my first time.

23
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:10,851
Well, not my first.
It's my first time,

24
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:14,660
uh, since my...
first time.

25
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,934
So, technically,
that's my second time.

26
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:20,178
And l-- I don't--
I don't wanna suck at it.

27
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:22,693
So if I'm not up to par,
performance-wise--

28
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:26,467
Jim, this isn't exactly
a turn-on.

29
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:29,277
I mean, girls like a guy
with confidence.

30
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:31,985
Hey, I'm confident.

31
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:36,235
Oh, I am-- I'm absolutely,
totally confident.

32
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:37,643
Oh?
Yeah.

33
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:39,481
Let's get naked.
Okay.

34
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:46,170
Seems like just yesterday
my dad picked me up after
my first year at college.

35
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:49,379
- Mm-hmm.
- We popped a couple of beers,

36
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,793
and he said,
"Now, you're a man."

37
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,235
And today I get to say
the same thing to my son.

38
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:56,403
Honey, your speeches
embarrass him.

39
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,649
So, try and do what the kids
say, and just... be cool.

40
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:03,099
I think I bring new meaning
to the word "cool," honey.

41
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:05,142
That's his dormitory
up ahead.

42
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,637
Turn over.
Okay.

43
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,379
Ow.
[ Groans ]

44
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:32,569
Can't bring alcohol
in the dorms.
Oh, uh, good.

45
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:36,779
Thank you, uh, Matt.
I'm just here to surprise
my son Jim.

46
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,225
Now pin my leg up.
What?

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,599
Pin my leg up,
like this.

48
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:44,910
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:48,050
Maybe you can help
me out, you know.

50
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,829
Okay.

51
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,004
Is that the one?
No.
There!

52
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,057
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Oh, oh, oh, okay!

[ Shudders ]
Now I remember.

54
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:04,046
I didn't do this for you.

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,055
Thanks, dude.

Where's my big guy?
Oh, my God!

Oh, no.
Hey--

-Jesus!
-Jim, we got here a little early.

59
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,561
- Dad, get out!
- I'll wait in the car.

60
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,145
Go, Dad!
Oh, my-- Geez.

61
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:24,516
Was that your dad?
Yeah.

62
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,787
- I'm so sorry.
- For your own edification,

63
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,264
son, I just--
I'm not embarrassed.

64
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:31,835
- I am!
- It's a perfectly
normal thing for two--

65
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:35,723
- Dad, what are you doing?
- This is human nature.
Human nature at its best.

66
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:40,001
Son, everybody does it.
Your mother and l--
Well, not so much anymore.

67
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:42,481
Got your favorite.
Oh, my God! They're fucking!

68
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:45,789
- No! No!
- Honey, honey, listen. No, no.
I'm gonna take her--

69
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:48,599
Please just go!
Actually,
if you wouldn't mind.

70
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:51,077

to the car.

Hi, Mama.
What?

73
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:57,731
- Natalie!
- I'm Jim's dad.

00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,678
You must be the parents
of this young lady.

75
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:02,750
I'm sorry I didn't get her name,
but hopefully my son did...

76
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:03,357
because I have not been
here the whole time.

00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:12,053
[Natalie] Thanks, Jim.
You don't believe in locks?
Oh, my God.

81
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:16,934
More time apart will give you
a few more months to argue

s this too much to live through

- Mornin', dude.
- Come on, Ozzy.
It's show time.

00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:45,161

to pick up Heather, I wanna
show you what you're missing.

on her panties!

There's little hearts
on her panties! Come on, look,
you pussy. Look.

What the fuck, man?
Come on!

94
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:08,877
I'm disappointed in you. Here
it is, the end of our freshman
year and you screwed one girl.

You're a disgrace
to men everywhere.

00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:16,144
Look at the Stifmeister.
I got laid 23 times
this year,

98
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:19,621
and I'm not counting
the hummer I got in
the library stacks, baby.

99
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:22,427
All right, here's a new idea
for you, Stifler, okay?

100
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,666
You find a girl.
You two become best friends.

101
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:27,650
You don't bother counting
how many times you have sex
with each other.

102
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:31,356
- You just laugh at the people
that do count.
- Here's a new idea for you.

00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,871
I'll get you a spoon
so you can eat my ass.

Okay, people.
Notebooks closed.
Let's get this exam rolling.

Holy shit, dude.
We got an exam today?

Bullshit.

Yes! I'm never
even gonna think about

Oh, fine.
Yeah?

summer abroad thing. Last thing
I need is more classes.

You're gonna have
a great time.
[Boy] Hello, summer!

00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:08,484
Did that exam blow or what?
Yeah, it sucked.

How are you?

Good. Put your
party hat on.

at a P.T.A. meeting.

123

Anyway, my point is,

124
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:13,955
these little sexual debacles
should not get you down,
because you know what?

It happens to the best
of us. In fact,

the first time your mother
and l... got together,

127

[ Low Moan ]
I used a condom.

Well, she referred to it
as "shrink wrapping."

Anyway, keep your chin up.
You keep plugging...

132
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,227
and, uh, good things
will happen.

- I met a Japanese girl
at the art museum.

understand all those things

- All right, enough, Finch.
- But I'll tell you, none of these women...

Oh, that's great.

- [ Moans ]

I can taste the bubbles.

306
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:14,867
Actually, I can't.

307
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,054
Much better.

308
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,300
Wait a second.

Let's go.
Thanks, man.

Oh, fuck!

Oh, fuck!

313
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,060
Yep. Half of these got
East High parking passes
on 'em.

314
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:47,844
Break up another one.
Call a couple units.

315
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:50,860
Isn't this the Stifler house?
Yeah. You ever seen
Mrs. Stifler?

316
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:54,498
Oh, what a "milf."
Oh, yeah?

[Jim]
Okay, now,

318
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:02,191
do these high school kids
think that we're cool because
they're at a college party,

319
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:08,084
or are we those weird older guys
that try to hang out with high
school kids when we come home?

320
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,324
No way. We're definitely
not those guys.
[Boy] Cops!

321

- Cops!
- [Man] All right!

[Kevin]
No, man,
Stifler's got shut down.

We can't party
anywhere anymore.

And things are--

329
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,817
Getting weird?
Yeah, a little bit.

330
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:48,293
First summer back
from college.

331
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,167
Yep, things are gonna
get weirder.

332
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,649
- What are you talkin' about?
- Well, times change, people change.

333
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:56,657
It's just what happens,
you know.

334
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,329
Kev, listen.
Go into my old room.

335
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:04,042
My friends and I knew
that it was up to us
to stick together.

336
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:07,858
You remember my first
college summer? We rented
that lake house in Grand Harbor.

337
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:11,101
We treated every day out there
like it was a post-prom party.

338
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,049
Hell of a time. We capped it
all off with a massive blow out.

339
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:16,251
Best ever.
It was legendary.

340
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:18,665
My advice is do that.
By the end of the summer,

341
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:21,609
you're gonna see
the big picture.

342
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:32,211
I love adventure
Nothing's better to me

She's on the phone.
She's on the phone.
It's long distance.

Who?
Nadia! Nadia!

346
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,625
What?
New York. She's on-- Hello.
Yes, dear, he's right here.

347
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,761
Here. Wait.
Now remember--

348
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,042
Yes, I am sure to go
see the Lion King.

349
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,217
Right. And don't ride
the subway after midnight.
Okay.

350
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:58,067
I know they've done
wonderful things with that city,
but, you know, for me--

351
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,241
- Dad!
- He's right-- Hang on.

352
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,425
Hey-- Hey, Nadia.
Jim!

353
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:09,536
How was college?
College was excellent.

354
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:12,590
Yeah. Yeah, it was--
it was really excellent.

355

You have not forgotten
about me, have you?

356
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,741
No. I, uh--
Absolutely not.

357
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:22,154
I definitely didn't.
Good, because guess what?

358
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:24,424
I'm coming to see you
at the end of summer.

359
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,064
I hope you're ready
for me...

360
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:31,783
because I have not forgotten
about you either, you sexy boy.

361

[Jim] Shit.
[Finch]Jim, you can
eat hot dogs tomorrow.

362
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:37,976
No, no, Finch,
it's not the hot dogs.

363
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,984
Nadia called me
this morning.

364
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:43,257
She's coming here
at the end of the summer
and she wants to see me.

365
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:46,500
- Oh, that's killer.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

366
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,484
No, not "good thing."
Not "killer."

367
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,685
I'll never be able
to do it.

368
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:55,672
Nadia is gonna be expecting
filet mignon.

369
00:21:55,775 --> 00:22:00,246
Okay, and all I'm gonna
be able to give her...

370
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:02,263
is rump roast.

371
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:08,081
Aw, come on.
Jim, you've had experience
since Nadia.

372
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:10,283
Ah, yes, you would be
referring to...

373
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:13,564
the flute-fetish band geek
that made me her bitch and
then ditched me after prom.

374
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,736
Yes, that's
great experience.
That's the one.

375
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:19,312
Ah, you just gotta
find the right girl, Jimbo.

376
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,421
Brings it all together.
[Finch]
I had the right woman.

377
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:26,573
She just sells her cottage
and takes off
to parts unknown.

378
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:29,284
Oh, my romantic life
has past its peak.

379
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:31,559
Take me out to the pasture
and shoot me.

380
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:36,343
Super start to
a super summer, fellas.
Welcome home.

381
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,830
Guys, I got it.
Pack your bags.

- For what?
- We're moving to the lake.

383
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,831
We're gonna be the shit.
Everybody on the beach
is gonna know us.

384
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,641
Plenty of opportunities
to practice for Nadia.

385
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,953
Throw a huge party at the end
of the summer to cap it all off.

386
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,698
Dude, that's a great idea.
That way we'll be able
to welcome Heather back...

387
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,805
and we'll be able to prepare
for Nadia's big arrival.

388
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,555
This is it.
This is my summer of love.

389
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:10,829
Just thought I'd say
good-bye to you animals.

390
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:13,173
Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
How are you, sir?
Hey.

391
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:17,526
- All packed up I see.
- Yeah, we're all set, Dad.

392
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:20,126
Don't worry, okay?
I'll be fine.

393
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:22,176
Come on and give
your old man a hug.

394
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:38,526
- Keep it real, homies.
- You too, sir.
Have a good summer.

395
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:41,109
All right, let's go.

396
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,682
I've been running these numbers
here and I don't think the four
of us can afford this place.

397
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:49,465
- Not on summer jobs.
- Well, I kind of thought of that.

398
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:53,747
So... I invited someone else.

Stifler, if you're gonna
be living with us
you gotta behave yourself.

406
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:29,807
All right, you and Finch just
stay out of each other's way.

407
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:32,788
Kevin, Stifler's stench
is unavoidable.

at other people's expenses

Don't touch me
while I'm tantric.

442
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:44,507
"Tantric"?
What the fuck is tantric?

443
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,622
It's a Buddhist discipline.
You learn to channel
your body's energies--

444
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,037
your chakras.

445
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:55,019
When you can do that,
you can have sex for hours,
even days.

-And this stuff's for real?
-It's been around for centuries.

With tantra you can make
an entire session of sex...

00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:04,620
feel like one giant orgasm.

449

Eventually, you can
sustain that feeling

he's hooked up with,
it's not even close to that.

Take that number
and divide it by three.
Then you get the real total.

it's been three girls,
it's more like one, or none.

[Amber] Nope.
Wait a second.
You were trying?

906

Fuck no!
You were trying!

Oh, I kissed Jim!

Yes?

910
00:54:01,545 --> 00:54:03,609
As you were.

911
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:07,364
Here we go.
Let's do it.

912

[ Amber Giggles ]

Them girls sound like the two
transvestites we picked up
in Biloxi, Cooter.

916
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,859
Honey, come on.
Food's ready.
I'm not hungry!

917
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:37,503
I can't--

918
00:54:37,604 --> 00:54:40,672
I can't believe it.
Okay, okay, just do it.

919
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:43,018
Ooh!
Oh.

920
00:54:43,124 --> 00:54:45,827
Oh, God.
It was worth it.

921
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:48,602
Hello!
Oh!

Whoo!

923
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,057
Uh, Amber.

924
00:55:04,164 --> 00:55:06,798
Okay, I think
that's enough.
That's good.

925
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:08,572
I want more.
Hell, yeah.

Yeah.
I want more, too, baby.

Mm-hmm.

928
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,299
We're gonna get more
physical as soon as
we get some--

- Hand jobs.
- Okay!

- Hand jobs.
- You, do him.

We love to watch.

I'm sorry?
[Amber]
Yeah.

Don't be a wimp.

936
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:47,816
Okay. It's okay.
I know what I have to do.

937
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,484
I need to keep
this party goin'.

I'm takin' one
for the team.

Come on, you pussies.
We had 'em.

940
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:01,223
I am not touching that.
Put that thing away,
Stifler.

Why can't you guys
be team players, huh?

942
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:06,545
I was the one doin'
all the sacrificin'.

Whoo!

944

And now, for our
devoted listeners,

945

try that dildo.

Okay. Now wait
just a minute.

948
00:56:23,475 --> 00:56:26,418
Stifler wanted to give
you two hand jobs?

949
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:30,328
No. Stifler wanted
one from us.

950
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:34,173
- What? Bullshit.
- No, he did, okay?
And it was horrible.

951
00:56:34,279 --> 00:56:36,013
Very horrible.

play some "asshole"?

Hey, I just wanna
do something together.

We just did something
together.

Very together.

Ho ho ho.

Now, just so there's
no confusion,

some heterosexual entertainment.

All right. Here.

And the Stifmeister's
provided us some
complimentary lubricant.

- Does this stuff
really make a difference?

my clarinet?

in your box.
Oh, thanks!

doing here?

like a dork.

Well, I know that feeling.

Spend your life playing
in the band,

994
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:56,299
it doesn't exactly give you
the ultra-cool hipster image.

I think you're pretty cool.
Seriously?

ditch me after prom?

998

I didn't ditch you.

want some...

funky, weird,
next-morning good-bye?

1002
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,734
It's not like I wanted
you to pretend you were
in love with me or something.

1003
00:59:24,843 --> 00:59:28,515
Why would I pretend that?
Guys do that.

1004
00:59:29,894 --> 00:59:33,464
Yeah, well, I'm not
like other guys.

1005
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:36,242

Okay,
I'm gonna help you.

00:59:39,594 --> 00:59:41,499
Really?

1008
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:44,270
Yeah, I feel bad
for saying that you sucked,

1009
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:47,411
even though you kind of did.

1010

00:59:54,413 --> 00:59:57,686
Okay.
Now, I'm a hot girl.
Right.

Okay, what do you wanna do?
I wanna feel your boobs.

No, you ding bat.

1016

You don't just go
groping away.

1017
01:00:05,452 --> 01:00:05,781
You don't just go
groping away.

1018
01:00:05,886 --> 01:00:08,997
You gotta preheat the oven
before you stick in the turkey.

Okay.

1020

Kiss me, here.

1021

Good, Jim.

Oh, you're making me wet.

1025
01:00:33,148 --> 01:00:36,718
Holy shit. Really?
No, I was just saying that
so you could practice.

1026
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:40,097
Of course.

1027

1028
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:46,019
[Michelle]
Okay, Jim. That was good.
Let's work on something else.

1029
01:01:00,778 --> 01:01:05,283
Does direction matter-- Iike
clockwise, counter clockwise--
make a difference?

1030
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,869
Okay, Jim,
this is what
I'm talking about.

1031
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:12,247
Your main problem is...
you're so uptight.

1032
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:16,925
Do I seem uptight
about my sexual stuff?
No.

1033
01:01:17,035 --> 01:01:20,102
The biggest pointer
I could give you is...

1034
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:23,885
you have to feel comfortable
in any situation.

1035
01:01:23,993 --> 01:01:26,268
Stand up.
Hmm?

1036
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:29,469
- Stand up.
- Ohh!

1037
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:33,285
Now, this is
a fucked-up situation.
What happened to preheating?

1038
01:01:33,393 --> 01:01:35,993
We're skipping
a few chapters.
Oh, okay.

1039
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:39,842
This is good.
This is good.

Ooh!

Wh-What?

1042
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,704
You've got to control
yourself and think of
something non sexual.

1043
01:01:48,813 --> 01:01:52,349
I haven't even touched
you yet, and you're turning
into the Sears Tower.

1044

I'm sorry.
Yeah, uh, non sexual.

1045
01:01:55,436 --> 01:01:58,036

to push your threshold.

Oh, that's cold!
What are you doing?

1054

I just shoved
a trumpet in your ass.
Aren't instruments fun?

Okay, I think you've just
crossed my threshold.

about the incident tonight.

01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:53,192
[ Mrs. Stifler ]
Oh, Finchy, I missed you.

1670
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:57,934
Yeah. Oh, God.
Jeanine. Jeanine.
Call me Stifler's mom.

1671
01:43:58,043 --> 01:44:00,244
[ Loud Moaning ]
[ Car Alarm Blaring ]

1672
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:00,552
[ Shouting ]
Oh, Stifler's mom!

1673
01:44:00,552 --> 01:44:03,619
[ Shouting ]
Oh, Stifler's mom!

1674
01:44:10,018 --> 01:44:13,759
I don't want to be
an ass anymore

1675
01:44:13,865 --> 01:44:16,602
Sick and tired
of all the promises

1676
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:19,012
That I made to you

1677
01:44:20,522 --> 01:44:22,996
And I pray to you

1678
01:44:25,406 --> 01:44:29,181
And I know you think
you've heard it all before

1679
01:44:29,285 --> 01:44:32,194
Something tells me
that you think I'm stupid

1680
01:44:32,296 --> 01:44:34,702
When I say to you

1681
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:39,247
That what I say is true

1682
01:44:40,492 --> 01:44:44,734
Too much lyin'
Too little tryin'

1683
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,877
This time it's gonna be
the last time

1684
01:44:48,988 --> 01:44:52,397
say the last time again

1685
01:44:52,501 --> 01:44:55,967
This time is gonna be
the last time

1686
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:00,220
What I say
The last time again

1687
01:45:07,754 --> 01:45:11,494
don't want to be
redundant anymore

1688
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:16,744
Skipping like a broken record
you can play again

1689
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:21,326
But I'll do it all again

1690
01:45:22,672 --> 01:45:26,915
I'll put it behind me
then you rewind me

1691
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:30,591
This time is gonna be
the last time

1692
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:34,612
What I say
The last time again

1693
01:45:34,714 --> 01:45:37,953
This time is gonna be
the last time

1694
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:42,439
What I say
The last time again

1695
01:46:05,757 --> 01:46:09,703
Once again
I must have been

1696
01:46:09,804 --> 01:46:13,544
Tryin' to wash away the sin

1697
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:17,494
'Cause I wake up
bathroom floor

1698
01:46:17,597 --> 01:46:21,566
I won't do this anymore

1699
01:46:24,321 --> 01:46:27,230
Starting tomorrow

1700
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:31,941
This time is gonna be
the last time

1701
01:46:32,049 --> 01:46:36,189
What I say
The last time again

1702
01:46:36,296 --> 01:46:39,603
This time is gonna be
the last time

1703
01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:43,985
What I say
The last time again

1704
01:46:44,091 --> 01:46:47,364
This time is gonna be
the last time

1705
01:46:47,469 --> 01:46:51,575
What I say
The last time again

1706
01:46:51,684 --> 01:46:55,025
This time is gonna be
the last time

1707
01:46:55,129 --> 01:46:59,201
What I say
The last time again

1708
01:47:05,565 --> 01:47:06,234
[Ends]

1709
01:47:06,234 --> 01:47:07,465
[Ends]

1710
01:47:19,314 --> 01:47:22,119
And it's always
little things

1711
01:47:22,224 --> 01:47:27,037
That to the surface brings

1712
01:47:29,884 --> 01:47:32,485
Space you need to breathe

1713
01:47:32,593 --> 01:47:37,269
Before the curtain call

1714
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:42,785
The light that leads the way

1715
01:47:42,896 --> 01:47:47,675
Before you hit the wall

1716
01:47:50,556 --> 01:47:53,053
The mountain
that you climb

1717
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:56,770
Just to take a fall

1718
01:47:56,879 --> 01:48:00,449
The blind among the blind
And I say

1719
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:03,592
There's an echo
'round my heart

1720
01:48:03,702 --> 01:48:07,442
Draggin' me down

1721
01:48:07,549 --> 01:48:10,857
Beneath the waves
in silence I fall

1722
01:48:10,961 --> 01:48:14,029
There's a halo
above my head

1723
01:48:14,139 --> 01:48:17,879
Spinnin' me 'round

1724
01:48:17,986 --> 01:48:21,430
'Cause I don't know
if I'm alive or dead

1725
01:48:21,531 --> 01:48:24,736
There's a dagger
in my hand

1726
01:48:24,843 --> 01:48:29,758
Bleeding me dry

1727
01:48:37,621 --> 01:48:41,065
And all we have to lose

1728
01:48:41,167 --> 01:48:45,911
Is time

1729
01:48:48,058 --> 01:48:55,779
And what we lose
we leave behind

1730
01:48:58,527 --> 01:49:05,143
Stay around
and we will shine

1731
01:49:34,553 --> 01:49:36,458
