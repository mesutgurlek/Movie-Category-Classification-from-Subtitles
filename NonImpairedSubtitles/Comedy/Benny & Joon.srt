10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And I would walk five hundred more

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

25

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# To fall down at your door

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So we're planning our next vacation.
I want Australia, she wants ltaly.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I like snorkelling. She likes garlic.

32
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All of a sudden, out of nowhere,
she says to me: do I need her?

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Jesus, Benny.
What kind of a question is that?

34
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Need? What does it really mean
to need somebody?

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Benny, fuel line.

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Waldo, could you answer that phone?

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hello.
- I need a cheque, Benny. COD.

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In a minute. Meet me in the office.

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right.

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whoa! Put that out! I got a fuel line broke.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hey, Benny. Joon's on the phone again.
- I'll call back. Find out what she wants.

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's an emergency.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She says you're runnin' low
on Peanut Butter Super Chunks.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
An emergency...

45
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The issue is jelly. You only like two kinds.

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You either like grape or boysenberry.
Which is it? All right.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, yeah, yeah, peanut butter. I know.
Super Crunch. I'll see you at six, OK? Bye.

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks for waitin', ma'am.

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm afraid the best
we can do for you is gonna be...

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's gonna be $750. If you check around,
you'll see that that is a really good deal.

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah?
- That is a really very good deal, ma'am.

52
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A little too good.

53
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's do it.

54
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come here. Come here.

55
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're not doing your job!
What is your job, anyway?

56
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
To clean this house, but not any more!

57
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Get out of my sight!
- You wouldn't dare, Joon!

58
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is going on here? Joon?

59
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mrs Smail, please, let me explain.

60
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Beware, the winds of reason
shall blow stern.

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What?
- I'm done, Mr Pearl.

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm done! The mule's turned to glue!

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She wanders off unescorted.
She has sudden outbursts.

64
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's simply unmanageable.

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mrs Smail, wait. Please, let me talk to her.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can talk to her.
You can't quit on such short notice.

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sorry, sir. In lreland, we have a sayin'.

68
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"When a boat runs ashore,
the sea has spoken."

69
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on! We can't play
three-handed poker.

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's gonna be alone every day.
I'm not leavin' her alone at night, too.

71
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- So bring her. Shejust paints and reads.
- Yeah, and lights things on fire.

72
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That happened once.
I got a fire extinguisher. Just bring her.

73
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get your ass over here.
Don't forget the Louis Prima record.

74
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Remember, always play for keeps.

75
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, I'll be there. OK.

76
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon, dinner!

77
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Spaghetti and salad?

78
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In that order?

79
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What happened between
you and Mrs Smail?

80
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She was given to fits of
semiprecious metaphors.

81
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She's a housekeeper,
not an English professor.

82
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She moves things.

83
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She said you wandered off.

84
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you leave the house alone?

85
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Define "alone".

86
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know full well what I'm talkin' about.

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can't be worried about you knocking
another housekeeper into retirement.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
First, it was Mrs Larkspur.

89
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A woman deeply
and hygienically disturbed.

90
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Her hair smelled.
- But then it was Mrs Piltz.

91
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Piltz? The answer's in the question.

92
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's face it, Benjamin.
Hiring housekeepers is not your forte.

93
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, until I do find another housekeeper,
you are gonna stick close to the house.

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
understand?

95
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now have some salad. By the way, I want
you to come with me to my poker game.

96
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Benny...
- Come on. You'll have a good time.

97
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Web belt and buckle.

98
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Classical Greek martini shaker.

99
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Six turkey-feather darts.

100
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll see you with a Deanna Durbin album.

101
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on.

102
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And I'll raise you with a stethoscope.
- Does it have little plastic earpieces?

103
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What do you care? You never win, Mike.
- I don't want 'em stabbin' my eardrums.

104
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Steering-wheel knob.

105
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Salad Shooter.

106
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
'56 Plymouth tyre iron.

107
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Fold-o.
- You must have a good hand, huh?

108
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, I'm bluffin'.

109
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Really?

110
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on. You gotta play to find out.

111
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK. 1 50 feet of coaxial cable. Show 'em.

112
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Full house. Jacks over fours.
- Oh, shit.

113
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I thought he was bluffin'.

114
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Will someone get some air to his brain?

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He was bluffing about bluffing.

116
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're a real pal, Benny.

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I got a solution to your housekeeper
problem. You can have my roommate.

118
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's a terrific offer, Benjamin. Save
you from the chore of Smail shopping.

119
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Those places are such drudgery.

120
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Montgomery and Smails,
Smails and Roebuck, Smails-R-us...

121
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon.

122
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- When did you get a roommate?
- Since last week.

123
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My cousin pounded into town and life's
gone from heaven to hell in seven days.

124
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Just like the good Lord intended.
- 26 years old, he can't even read.

125
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Spends all day polishing my plastic forks.

126
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When you say he can't read,
what do you mean? Like words?

127
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. And he keeps me up all night
watchin' stupid old movies.

128
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My work's starting to suffer.

129
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You install cable TV.
- Joon, will you please glue your sequins?

130
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have we an internal sequin issue
to deal with, Benjamin?

131
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, can we make this the last hand?

132
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on, come on. Play cards.

133
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Two tickets,
tomorrow night's baseball game.

134
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One Pocket Fisherman.

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Fold.
- Do you ever stay in?

136
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Snorkel mask.

137
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She knows how to rattle the day help.

138
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think we need to find someone
more understanding than Mrs Smail.

139
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell me, how are you two getting along?

140
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
us?

141
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Fine. Normal. You know, fine.

142
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why?
- I'll level with you.

143
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think it's time you gave some
serious consideration to a group home.

144
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- She already has a home.
- Benny, she'd be with her peers.

145
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She hates her peers. She's already quit
the two day centres to prove it.

146
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, all we need right now
is a new housekeeper.

147
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, I know of no one else.
You've been up and down the list.

148
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,592  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You might want to consider
that there are some people

149
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
more capable of handling
these episodes than you.

150
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think that you two living together
may not be the best thing any more.

151
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm her brother, and I'm her only family.

152
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And we've done just fine,
the two of us, for 1 2 years.

153
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, but her stress level is always
a factor in her display of symptoms.

154
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Her agitation should
be kept to a minimum.

155
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Everybody gets agitated.
Sometimes it's the only option.

156
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Benny, don't get me wrong.

157
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm impressed how
you've managed this long.

158
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But a group home would let her
develop other relationships.

159
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We don't know this,
but what if she were capable of a job?

160
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They'd encourage her in that direction.

161
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These are very nice places -
nurturing, supportive.

162
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm not farming her out.

163
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have every right to be outside, Officer.

164
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I have every right.
- Yes, ma'am.

165
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
May I see some ID, please?

166
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Waldo, did you start that brake job yet?
- Joon called. You've run out of tapioca.

167
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- She what?
- Oh, and the police will corroborate.

168
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Holy shit.

169
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen, Jack, you wanna go
to the baseball game tonight?

170
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hey, thanks, Benny.
- Box seats.

171
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hello? Joon?

172
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Time for your medicine, Joon.

173
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night, Steve.

174
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Oh, hello. How's it goin'?
- I appreciate the deal on the engine.

175
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No problem. Is it runnin' all right?
- Yeah, it's running great.

176
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Good.
- So... can l...

177
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can I make it up to you with some dinner?

178
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Some dinner?

179
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Dinner with you.

180
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know what? I can't.

181
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I mean, I'd like to...
- It's OK.

182
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK.

183
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stupid. Stupid.

184
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- 18-1 5.
- 17-16.

185
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- 18-1 5!
- It caught the corner.

186
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It was a foot off the table.
- It was not.

187
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Juniper...
- Benjamin...

188
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't underestimate the mentally ill.
We know how to count.

189
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- OK, fine. 17-16.
- You can't give me what was mine.

190
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're trying to cheat.
- I'm not.

191
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're cheating.
- Joon, you're the one who's cheating.

192
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're all trying to cheat me.
You're trying to cheat.

193
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. I spoke to some of the guys
on the staff, Benny.

194
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nobody wants to be a housekeeper.

195
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will. I'll keep tryin'. But I gotta
tell you honestly, I don't think so.

196
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. OK. Thanks.

197
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bye.

198
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, Stevie.

199
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, I can't even keep a goldfish alive.
What chance do I have with Joon?

200
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If somethin' bad happened to her, I'd...

201
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'd never ever be able to forgive myself.

202
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A group home
is the right thing for her, Benny.

203
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. This is definitely for her own good.

204
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, it's for both your own good.

205
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much longer
can you do this to yourself?

206
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your life is literally passing you by.

207
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,274  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're right.

208
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're right.
What am I doing with myself?

209
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I spend my life workin' on cars
and takin' care of my sister.

210
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can't have a relationship without havin'
to worry about how Joon is gonna fit in.

211
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Once she gets settled in,
you could actually take a vacation.

212
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Travel a little. I can hold down the fort.

213
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Travel?

214
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Travel?
- Benny, there's a whole world out there.

215
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I mean, picture yourself on the open road.

216
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wind in the hair in the EI Camino.

217
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Highway stretchin' out...

218
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's that, up ahead?

219
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
A lovely motorist, stranded.

220
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Carburettor trouble. Better investigate.

221
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna be stoppin' every 1 5 minutes

222
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
to call Joon to see how she's doin'.

223
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, let's see. Black Sabbath, over there.

224
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is that a flashlight?
- It's a brush kind of a thing.

225
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here's a hat.

226
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where's the batteries?
- You didn't win batteries.

227
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Those are mine.
- OK. Hey, guys, hurry it up!

228
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Or we'll start without you.

229
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've been known to play a little cards.

230
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Box of 30-aught-6 cartridges.

231
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Medium-sized, green-haired troll.

232
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Soap-on-a-rope, slightly used.

233
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Cards?
- Three.

234
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Cards?
- Two.

235
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And the dealer takes...

236
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
three.

237
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Pass.

238
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Re-grout my shower. Blue grout.

239
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I fold.

240
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shampoo my dog.

241
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lava lamp.

242
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Paint the exterior of my house.

243
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, come on, slow down.
This is supposed to be reasonable stakes.

244
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's a see and a raise. You follow me?

245
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You take my cousin off my hands.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just stop.

246
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Benny's gonna strangle you guys.
- Chill out, Thomas.

247
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Joon, we gotta go.
- Flush!

248
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Full house.

249
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes. Yes!

250
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Benny, tonight's your lucky night.
- Mike warned her it was for keeps.

251
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What? What was for keeps?

252
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I lost.

253
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's in the pot?
- A cousin.

254
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Rules are rules. Without 'em
there's no order in the universe.

255
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't you give me that crap.
You took advantage.

256
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Of your sick sister. A heart flush
is a perfectly respectable hand.

257
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Not respectable enough.
- Hey, shut up, Mike.

258
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am not takin' this guy home.

259
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have to! Remember
the bet I lost last year?

260
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
When I had to re-plate your socket set,
I didn't back out.

261
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You can't bet a human being!

262
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, well,
if you're gonna be a baby about it...

263
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
All right, Mike.
You wanna play like that? I'll take him.

264
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I may not be responsible for what
I'm gonna do to him, but I'll take him.

265
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, man.

266
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What are you doin', you jerk?
- Somethin' wrong with your car.

267
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What did you do with my hubcaps?
- I don't know.

268
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'm Sam.
- So I hear.

269
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm Benny.

270
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
With an n?

271
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. Two of 'em.

272
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- This is Joon.
- With an n?

273
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One.

274
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're out of your tree.

275
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's not my tree.

276
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think I need a beer.

277
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Benny, wait a minute! Where are you
going? Come here! Gimme a jump! Hey!

278
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're goin' with them.

279
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh! God bless you.

280
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, pal, we're tryin' to work here,
if you don't mind.

281
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, my God!

282
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"I've been looking for my boyfriend.
Have you seen him?"

283
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ruthie, a ghost come back to haunt you?

284
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"Oh, Brad! Oh, Brad!
Brad, please don't be dead!"

285
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"I never got a chance to tell you what
you meant to me. Oh, Brad, please!"

286
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's you, Ruthie Mallenek, co-star of The
Prom Queen Mutilator with Dick Beebee.

287
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You saw that?
- "He was mine!"

288
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"He was mine!"

289
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"No. Cindy, you're sick. You need help!"

290
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"No, Cindy! No! No!"

291
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"No!"

292
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't... Don't touch it.

293
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's paint.

294
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes.

295
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Kirk Douglas. Van Gogh. Ear.

296
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
These are yours.
You can sleep here. All right?

297
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's late. Let's brush your teeth and hair.

298
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I can brush my own teeth, Benjamin.
- Fine.

299
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hair, too.
- Perfect.

300
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on.

301
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. Oh, Benny.

302
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Benny.

303
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks for the couch.
Mike made me sleep under the sink.

304
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. You're welcome.

305
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Good night.
- Good night.

306
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mentally ill.

307
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Really?
- Yeah.

308
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But, I mean, don't worry about it.

309
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But just let her go about her routine.
Her routine is everything to her.

310
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, and don't hang around her room
while she's painting.

311
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- She hates that.
- No.

312
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If she runs hot and cold on you,
just ignore it.

313
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's just the way it works.

314
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen, if she starts talkin' to herself,
don't worry about it, but don't answer.

315
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK.

316
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She sometimes hears voices in her head.
That comes with the territory, too.

317
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And... just make sure that nothin'
- and, you know, I mean nothin' -

318
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
happens to her.

319
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK.

320
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK. All right.

321
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?

322
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Morning.
- Hey. This today?

323
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.

324
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So... what'd you do with the cousin?

325
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The bus station? The river?
What? You throw him in the river?

326
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No, I took him home.
- You took him home?

327
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- To your house?

328
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah, to my house.
- What, are you crazy?

329
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, believe me, it's only temporary.

330
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Great. Hey, maybe he can tell Joon
about the group home, huh?

331
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If I'm gonna do this group-home thing,
I gotta figure out the best way to tell her.

332
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where's Waldo? ls he not here yet?

333
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No.
- That's it. I'm gonna have a talk with him.

334
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am. What's his phone number?

335
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
555-0944.

336
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Too late to cry, she turned away

337
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# I started pushin'

338
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# I saw no future in this lack

339
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# I started pushin'

340
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Pushin', pushin' forward back

341
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# I was pushin'

342
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Pushin', pushin' forward back

343
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Too loud! Too loud!

344
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Pushin' forward back

345
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What?

346
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What? Oh!

347
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey.

348
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where's Sam?

349
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I didn't mean to kick him out. I mean,
I didn't kick him out, he just left.

350
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

351
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What happened? Did something happen?

352
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He just... He just left.

353
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He was... He was...

354
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
in the air and, and, and...

355
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
with a thing and... It was really loud...

356
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was really loud.

357
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I just kept seeing...

358
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He didn't mean to do it.

359
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do it? What?

360
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What did he... What did he do?

361
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He cleaned the house.

362
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And you kicked him out for that?

363
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe I should invite him back in.

364
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. Before someone sticks a stamp
on his head and mails him to Guam.

365
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Some cultures...

366
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
are defined by their
relationship to cheese.

367
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is that a fact?

368
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He can really cook, can't he?

369
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.

370
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Although, for grilled cheese,
I might've used the wool setting.

371
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's what I told him.

372
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Really?

373
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What did he use?
- Rayon.

374
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Silk would've been too soggy.

375
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Cotton would've...
- Would've burned it.

376
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Right.

377
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Fortunately he consulted me
before giving it steam. I was against it.

378
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wish he could be my new Smail.

379
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# The melodious songs of the blessed

380
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And our spirits shall sorrow no more

381
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Not a sigh for the blessing of rest

382
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# ln the sweet by-and-by

383
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# We shall meet on that beautiful shore

384
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# ln the sweet by-and-by

385
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# We shall meet on that beautiful shore

386
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night.

387
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good night.

388
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You need some help?

389
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"Dear Mom, I've departed Mike's
with love and gratitude

390
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and am now living with Benny and
Joon Pearl, two devoted new friends."

391
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"Benny's predisposition to hypertense
lrish monologists notwithstanding,

392
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
he has given me a job
as a domestic engineer

393
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and seems pleased with me so far."

394
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"Love, Sam."

395
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wow.

396
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I didn't know I could talk like that.

397
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tapioca?

398
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. Yeah.

399
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- OK.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

400
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're welcome, Sam.
Let me know if you need anything, OK?

401
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't like raisins?

402
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Not really.
- Why?

403
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They used to be...

404
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
fat and juicy.

405
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And now they're twisted.
They had their lives stolen.

406
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They taste sweet, but really
they're just humiliated grapes.

407
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can't say I'm a big supporter
of the raisin council.

408
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you see those raisins on TV?
The ones that sing and dance and stuff?

409
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- They scare me.
- Yeah. Me, too.

410
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's sick. They make them sing
and dance so people will eat them.

411
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a shame about raisins.

412
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Cannibals.
- Yeah.

413
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you like avocados?

414
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They're a fruit, you know.

415
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ruthie?

416
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you got any avocados?

417
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon?

418
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're very pretty
when you're off work, Ruthie.

419
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Thank you. Maybe I should quit my job.
- Where the hell have you two been?

420
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't worry. They were with me,
running some errands.

421
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Oh, hi. How you doin'?
- Hi.

422
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Running errands? You ran an errand?

423
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, I did. I ran an errand.

424
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They're both named Steven.
One with a v and one with a ph.

425
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Look, look, look! Ruthie's movie.
- Yes. And she's staying for dinner, too.

426
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on in. Come on in.

427
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- So why'd you leave?
- LA?

428
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wasn't that good of an actress.

429
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, that's not how Sam tells it.

430
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He's ravin' about you.
- Well, he's sweeter than he is judgmental.

431
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How long have you known him?

432
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sam? uh... 72 hours.

433
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

434
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Really?
- I'm always serious.

435
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm too serious.

436
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
D'you ever get to the point in your life
where nothin' makes any sense?

437
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Brad? Brad?

438
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Quit kidding around.
This isn't funny any more.

439
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can we turn this off?
Can we just turn this off?

440
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No!

441
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You!

442
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Cindy!

443
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why did you do this? You're sick.

444
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You need help.

445
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let me... Don't!

446
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He was mine. He was mine!

447
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And ifl can't have him, no one can.

448
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not even you.
You didn't have to buy that same dress.

449
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But you are my sister, Cindy.

450
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sorry about Brad. We didn't mean to
fall in love at the party. Itjust happened.

451
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's just forget it. There'll be
other boys, other midnight swims,

452
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
other prom dresses.

453
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No! No, Cindy!

454
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Try it again.

455
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ah. There's only two reasons
a car won't start:

456
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
either you're not gettin' fuel
or you're not gettin' fire.

457
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You've got fire.

458
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think you'd better let me drive you home.

459
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

460
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here it is. It's right here.

461
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Second job, huh?
- Yeah.

462
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gotta make those ends meet, you know.

463
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is just how I imagined your place.

464
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Well...
- You wanna come in?

465
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Or you wanna...

466
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh. No.

467
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll come in. For a minute.

468
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whoa! What is this?

469
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Nice place.
- Pretty nice fish Joon gave you.

470
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, yeah. Those fish.

471
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, I was shocked. I was...

472
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Nice fish. I mean, yeah...
- I never had a fish.

473
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What? Not even as a kid?

474
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. underprivileged childhood, I guess.

475
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Downright un-American, if you ask me.
- Yeah.

476
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You can have one of mine, if you want.
- No, I couldn't possibly. They were a gift.

477
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But we could share it. Like joint custody.
You could take it on the weekends.

478
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is this?

479
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sit down, son. You're makin' me nervous.

480
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Wanna beer?
- Yeah.

481
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know what? I better not.

482
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I gotta get goin'. I better get goin', OK?

483
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.

484
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- OK.
- I'll take a rain check on the beer.

485
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I got the doors.

486
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Wanna go to dinner?
- Ever been married?

487
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No.
- Yeah.

488
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah?

489
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Great.

490
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- See ya.
- See ya.

491
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
See ya.

492
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- See you next week.
- Right. Thank you.

493
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Benny, would you
come inside a moment?

494
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sure.

495
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who's the new housekeeper?
- The new...

496
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh! This...

497
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
friend just came to stay
with us for a while, but...

498
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon tells me he's a man.

499
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, you know Joon,
how flowery she gets with words.

500
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So she's lying?
I mean, is it a man or isn't it?

501
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well... Yes, technically.

502
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's really just a guy, a friend.

503
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where does this leave the group home?
I take it you haven't talked to her about it.

504
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, not yet.

505
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The admission date
is less than a week away.

506
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But the thing is, she's really doin' fine.
She seems content.

507
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's just leave it at that for now.

508
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let me know when you want to
tell her about it.

509
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll let you know.

510
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK. Bye.

511
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hello.
- I want to help.

512
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wonderful. OK.

513
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you'd like to fill out this application,
I'll be right with you.

514
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not so hard.

515
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wow. You actually have cuticles.

516
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know. That's amazing.

517
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What the hell is he doin'?

518
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mashed potatoes.

519
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So are you and Ruthie
considering itemhood?

520
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you?

521
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Benjamin and Ruthjamin, sittin' in a tree

522
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# K-i-s-s-i-n-g

523
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# First comes love, then comes marriage

524
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Get outta here!
- # Then comes a little baby carriage

525
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm just takin' her out to dinner.

526
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That's a good joke.
- Did you like that?

527
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What time you got?
- It's eleven.

528
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- On the nose?
- Right exactly.

529
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't think I've asked anybody the time
before and had it been right on the nose.

530
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's weird, isn't it?
It's right on the nose.

531
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you... Do you want
to come in for a while?

532
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I...

533
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've got that beer waiting for you.

534
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know what?

535
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I should probably go.

536
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- OK.
- Listen.

537
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can l... Can I tell you somethin'?

538
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What?

539
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You see,

540
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
my life is just real... complicated, and...

541
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gimme a break, Benny.
I just offered you a beer, OK?

542
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

543
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why don't we pick up Ruthie
and get some ice cream?

544
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah, let's get her.
- No.

545
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why?
- Because she doesn't want to talk to me.

546
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on. We should go.

547
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Knock it off.

548
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He is... He's incredible.

549
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's amazing.

550
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did you have to go to school for that?
- No, I got thrown out of school for that.

551
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

552
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, listen.
Why don't you guys go ahead?

553
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.

554
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Really?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

555
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll see you at home, later.

556
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- All right?
- OK.

557
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That was great.
- No, no, no.

558
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

559
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bye-bye.

560
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# When the road gets dark

561
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And you can no longer see

562
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Just let my love throw a spark

563
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And have a little faith in me

564
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And when the tears you cry

565
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:28,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Are all you can believe

566
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby

567
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And have a little faith in me

568
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And have a little faith in me

569
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And have a little faith in me

570
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And have a little faith in me

571
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And have a little faith in me

572
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# When your secret heart

573
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,909  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Cannot speak so easily

574
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Come here, darlin',
from a whisper start

575
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# To have a little faith in me

576
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Have a little faith in me

577
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Have a little faith in me

578
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon?

579
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What?

580
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I love you.

581
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Me, too.

582
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Don't tell Benny.
- OK.

583
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# When the road gets dark

584
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And you can no longer see

585
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Just let my love throw a spark

586
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And have a little faith in me

587
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you see the way you had everyone
in the palm of your hand, huh?

588
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You've got this gift
and you shouldn't ignore it.

589
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You should be doin' something with it.
- Like what?

590
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't know. All I know is I looked at you
and I said "This guy is somethin' else."

591
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're not some schmo like the rest of us,
who do what we do because we have to.

592
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're blessed.

593
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Benny?
- What?

594
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How sick is she?
- She's plenty sick.

595
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Now, I've been doin' some thinkin'.
- Because it seems to me,

596
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
except for bein' a little
mentally ill, she's pretty normal.

597
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you realise you could be
the next Buster Keaton?

598
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm tellin' you, Randy. Listen.
You've got to see this guy.

599
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Tell him, Eric.
- He's funny.

600
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He's amazing. Will you see him?
- Yeah, I'll see him. You never know.

601
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Most of these guys just work locally,
but the better ones I can book out of town.

602
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You book 'em out of town?
- All over. Detroit, Boston, sometimes LA.

603
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whoa! Really? Can you see him tonight?

604
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'd love to see him tonight.

605
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hi.
- Is my car ready?

606
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How you doin'?

607
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on in. Come on in.

608
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen, I want to apologise for
the other night. That all came out wrong.

609
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No. No, it's OK.
- No, I really...

610
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How's my car?
- It's runnin' great.

611
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your fuel pump was shot.
I threw in a new one. It's great.

612
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How much do I owe you?

613
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll tell you what. Give me $30 for the part.
I'm not gonna charge you for labour.

614
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK?

615
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:58,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen, if you're not doin' anything later,
I just lined up this thing for Sam.

616
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What thing?
- It's kinda like an audition.

617
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Maybe his chance to make a living
at all this crazy stuff he does.

618
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who knows? Maybe he could travel,
play clubs. I don't know, you know.

619
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So if you're not doin' anything later and...

620
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't know, Benny.
I got food to deliver, apartments to rent...

621
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My life's pretty complicated
right now. You know?

622
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks. Bye.

623
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We'll lay out the whole routine
right after dinner.

624
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know what you could start with?
Remember the roll thing in the diner?

625
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who died and made you Ed McMahon?

626
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What is your problem? This is his chance
to do somethin', be somebody.

627
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He is somebody.
- Yeah, I know, but he wants to be more.

628
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You don't know what he wants.

629
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know he doesn't want to be
a housekeeper for the rest of his life.

630
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you're worried about a new Smail,
don't worry, we'll get a new Smail.

631
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's not my Smail.

632
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Housekeeper, whatever.

633
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We have to tell him.

634
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What?

635
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tell me what?

636
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Benny...

637
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon... and...

638
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
and l...

639
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
are... you know.

640
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bullshit.

641
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You...

642
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Don't!
- Get the fuck out.

643
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You can't throw him out. I won him.

644
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You just settle down. Just settle down.

645
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I love him!
- Yeah?

646
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, you are crazy!

647
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am not crazy.

648
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You see what we've come to? You see?

649
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hate you!

650
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hate you!

651
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can I get you anything?

652
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tapioca.

653
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK.

654
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Anything on it?

655
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Raisins.

656
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK.

657
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hi.

658
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hi. How you doin'?
- You're out late.

659
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah.

660
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen.

661
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you have any tapioca?

662
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Jeez, I've heard a lot of lines in my life...
- No, no, no, it's not for me. It's...

663
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's for Joon.

664
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Come on in.
- Yeah?

665
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon.

666
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK?

667
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

668
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm not. No, no, I'm not.

669
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK? All right?

670
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hold tight. OK. Shh. It's OK.

671
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's OK.

672
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I am not! I am not! I am not!

673
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shut up!

674
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, no. No, no.

675
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Joon, please, come on.
- No, it's not all in my head.

676
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sir? Sir!

677
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stop the bus, please!

678
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please stop the bus!

679
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No!

680
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon.

681
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- All righty. You wanna step out?
- Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.

682
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How you doin', hon?
- You think I don't know who you are?

683
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know just who you are!

684
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
So just leave. Leave.

685
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Leave!

686
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,514  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't you touch me! Don't touch me!

687
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon? Joon!

688
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, I am going to see my sister. Would
you please just tell me her room number?

689
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Please, just come back in the morning.
- Let me talk to her goddamn doctor!

690
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sorry. She doesn't want any visitors.

691
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not you or anyone else.

692
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She doesn't wanna see me?

693
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. And she doesn't want to leave.

694
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Benny, why don't you go home?
Get some sleep.

695
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I promise I'll keep in touch.

696
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hope you're happy.

697
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I hope you are happy with
what you have done to her.

698
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:23,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You just stay the hell away
from my sister.

699
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

700
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Wanna know why
everyone laughs at you, Sam?

701
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Because you're an idiot.

702
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're a first-class moron.

703
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're scared, Benny.
- I'm what?

704
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're scared.

705
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can see it. And I know why.

706
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I used to look up to you.

707
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But...

708
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
now I can't look at you at all.

709
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:39,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Come down offyour throne
and leave your body alone

710
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Somebody must change

711
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# You are the reason
I've been waitin' so long

712
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Somebody holds the key

713
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:03,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Well, I'm weary
and ljust ain't got the time

714
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:12,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# And I'm wasted
and I can't find my way home

715
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:29,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Come down on your own
and leave your body alone

716
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Somebody must change

717
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# You are the reason
I've been waitin' all these years

718
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Somebody holds the key

719
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:52,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Well, I'm weary
and ljust ain't got the time

720
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Oh, no

721
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:02,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
# Cos I'm wasted
and I can't find my way home

722
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I think Fred Astaire is the way to go.
- Yeah?

723
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That's a good choice.
- Who was that woman in Roman...

724
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,799  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Yeah. Sam, thanks a lot.

725
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Have a nice day.

726
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I hope so.

727
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hi, Benny.
- Thomas.

728
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How is she? Tell me the truth.

729
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:43,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- She's been better, Benny.
- You gotta tell me what room she's in.

730
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
335. But don't even think about it, Benny.
It's a closed ward. No visitors.

731
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,228  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No, we've gotta find Joon. Please.
- Thomas, get us in there to see her.

732
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It's impossible, Benny.
- What do you mean, it's impossible?

733
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen, I just need two minutes with her.

734
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Benny, I'll get fired!

735
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thomas,

736
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm beggin' you, as a friend.

737
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'd love to help you out, but Garvey's
gonna be in there to check on her soon.

738
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
My hands are tied. My hands are tied!

739
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What room did he say?

740
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
335.

741
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shit.

742
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What are you doin'?

743
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mommy?

744
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What are you doin' here?
- I don't think you're supposed to be here.

745
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Get the door.
- How'd he get past Security?

746
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, watch the door.

747
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon.

748
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, I know you want to be left alone.

749
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But you do not belong in here.

750
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now,

751
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
how would you like to try
livin' in your own apartment?

752
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- An apartment?
- Yeah.

753
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's an apartment
available in Ruthie's building.

754
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You'd let me live in an apartment?

755
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's up to you.

756
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm through makin'
those decisions for you.

757
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen, l...

758
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

759
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And about Sam, I was wrong.
I was dead wrong.

760
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:08,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I scared him away.
- No, you didn't.

761
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's here.

762
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,629  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He is not.
- He's here. He got me in here!

763
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He's somewhere in the building.
- He is not.

764
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You'd never let me have him.

765
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
God.

766
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why do you hate me so much?

767
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't hate you.

768
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You need me to be sick.

769
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Juniper Pearl's chart, please.

770
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you.

771
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, wait! Wally! Wait! Wait!

772
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Put him down! He's mine.
I've been lookin' for him.

773
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll take care of him.

774
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,149  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Sam, you can't be in here.
- Where's Joon's room?

775
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I've gotta see her.
- Come on, come on.

776
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Give me a reason why
I shouldn't have you arrested.

777
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It's that one.
- Yeah.

778
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
See? Sam, where you goin'?

779
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Benny, this is exactly
what we were trying to avoid.

780
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
By now, Joon would be in a caring
and controlled environment.

781
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Isn't it obvious now that
you two need some distance?

782
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Why don't we ask Joon what she wants?

783
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sam, what are you doin'?

784
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Sam, come on! Get down, right now!

785
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't know exactly what I want.

786
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I do know... that I am tired of
everyone telling me what to do.

787
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sam, come on!

788
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't touch that!

789
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sam, leave that! I'm beggin' you!

790
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Joon, we want what's best for you.

791
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know that.

792
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I...

793
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sam, come down now!

794
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're gonna get in trouble!

795
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I think I want to try
living in my own apartment.

796
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hm. I don't know.

797
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sam, stop swinging!

798
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But I'm willing to let you try.

799
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll prepare the papers for her release.

800
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you, Dr Garvey.

801
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come down! Sam!

802
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whoa! Whoa!

803
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you OK?
- Ouch! Ouch!

804
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I know.

805
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Me, too.

806
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm gonna check you out, OK?

807
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK.

808
03:00:48,222 --> 03:00:50,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Haven't we tried this before?

809
03:00:51,222 --> 03:00:54,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, but my life's
a lot less complicated now.

810
03:00:57,302 --> 03:00:59,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is Joon inside?
- Yeah.

811
03:00:59,862 --> 03:01:01,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK.

812
03:01:24,862 --> 03:01:28,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
