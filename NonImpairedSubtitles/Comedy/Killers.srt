00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,800
(over intercom) This is your captain speaking

3
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:15,075
Flight time to Nice will be seven hours thirty minutes

4
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:18,075
Our flight attendants will be coming by
To provide you with complimentary beverages.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,704
Excuse me

6
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:26,464
Hello?
Excuse me

7
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:26,829
Hey there!

8
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:28,380
Mom!

9
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:29,135
Do you mind?

10
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:30,126
Emergency exit's 13D sweetie.

11
00:00:31,177 --> 00:00:33,601
Great, got it, thanks Dad

12
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:36,563
Excuse me
Bonjour

13
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:39,886
Three chardonnay's pleaes
-No, nothing for me.

14
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,745
I always remain alert in flight.
-Me neither thank you

15
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:43,836
Just the three then.

16
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:48,213
I am so proud of you sweetie.
A lot of women who just got dumped

17
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:52,547
Would have backed out of this vacation but not you
-Thanks Dad, but I didn't get dumped

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,115
It wasn't quite like that it...
-(Mother) it was mutual

19
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:55,979
Yes, they agreed to part ways

20
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,991
When he dumped her

21
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,229
I thought it was because he needed space?
-(Mother) No he just didn't find her spontaneous enough

22
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:02,376
Too safe?

23
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,103
Predictable.

24
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,521
I am sitting right here.
-I can hear you

25
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,096
He tried to get you to go

26
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,401
Bungie jump but you wouldn't do it

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,712
I have a thing about heights and a rule about
vomiting in public. I think that's perfectly reasonable

28
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:12,923
Too many rules dear.

29
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:17,013
There's nothing wrong with being cautious sweety,
-Safety is sexy

30
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:21,989
The first time your mother and I made love we managed to
keep our seatbelts on the entire time. It wasn't easy

31
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:22,976
OK Dad!

32
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:25,904
What did I just say
About vomiting in public?

33
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:28,547
Change seats

34
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:32,991
And the emergency exit is...?
-13D trust me, I know where it is.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,697
About to throw myself out of it.

36
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:48,177
I've got a visual on him now

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,864
Target confirmed

38
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:52,164
I know the drill

39
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,467
trois minute

40
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:00,243
(over phone) You have until five pm
to deliver the package

41
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,171
-Then the boss wants you to close the account

42
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:04,846
Yeah, yeah, I will have his final bill
ready to go

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,124
You have my wife and I on the second floor
- And my daughter on the third

44
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,669
When I specifically booked
adjacent rooms.

45
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:12,532
I assure you your room is lovely Mr....

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,338
Lovely and adjacent are not the same thing

47
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,576
She's a single woman
Always alone

48
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,842
Recently single.
- I am not always alone.

49
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:22,770
Dad, the room is fine can you just...

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,772
Do you know how many push in robberies
happen in hotels sweetie

51
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,575
Third floor.
-We'd like an ocean view.

52
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:31,269
Always the same things with the rooms.

53
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,068
Let Daddy do his thing.

54
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,738
The little Frenchman will cave

55
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,673
He's a weasel face like "you know who"

56
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:39,208
Richard, I'm talking about Richard.

57
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,112
I know Mother.

58
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,275
We're not dicussing him anymore
- Remember?

59
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:43,518
Right, right

60
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:45,131
He's dead to us.
- Yes!

61
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:47,930
So it never bothered you that he
had kind of a womanly butt?

62
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:48,946
What?

63
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,400
No he did not!

64
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:53,282
Forget I said anything

65
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,354
(clerk speaking in french)
- I do not speak french

66
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:57,400
(clerk) Excuse me.
- we have resolved the problem

67
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:58,601
I'm gonna go check on my room

68
00:04:58,634 --> 00:04:59,892
You and Dad figure this out.

69
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:01,207
You want a Maalox for the road?

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,200
Wouldn't it be easier just to humour me?

71
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:20,420
"bonjour"
- "bonjour"

72
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,579
Descente?

73
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:32,659
(speaking french)

74
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:58,692
(speaking french)

75
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:42,555
(speaking french)

76
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:43,747
I don't speak french.

77
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,435
Yeah, no I got it the first time

78
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,753
Why were you pretending back there?

79
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:51,685
I don't know?
Why did you follow me?

80
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,747
I was already going to the beach
- Remember?

81
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,317
Yeah, well I could be going swimming too

82
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,440
Are you?

83
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:00,226
No.

84
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,582
I'm just going to go marinate
- in shame

85
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,392
I'm Spencer, by the way

86
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,070
It's nice to meet you Spencer.

87
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,251
Do you have a name?

88
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:13,380
Jen, Jennifer, sometimes Jenny no its...

89
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:15,479
Jen. It's just Jen

90
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:18,712
I'm gonna go uh... swimming.
Before it gets dark.

91
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,388
Yes, of course.

92
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:22,490
Muscles like that take some upkeep.

93
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:34,046
Do you wanna get a drink with me tonight?

94
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,405
Yeah, yeah sure. I don't have anything better to do.
So why not?

95
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,964
Great.

96
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:42,009
I'll see you at "Stella Maurice" at sunset.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh no...
No cute dress?

98
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:05,631
I didn't pack a single cute dress?

99
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:07,465
Oh God

100
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:10,188
I don't think I have all my socks
- Gotta find a dress

101
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:22,090
Thanks

102
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,941
We knocked on your door several times.
I can't believe you're missing this

103
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,575
I know Dad, I'm sorry. It's just...

104
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:43,450
You know, my stomach.
It's going crazy.

105
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,565
We'll come back right away
With saltines and ginger ale.

106
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,926
No! Stay put
I'm fine.

107
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,070
Don't be a hero sweetie

108
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,018
Dad trust me, you don't want to be a part of this

109
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,421
Uh... wait

110
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,769
Darling?

111
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:00,290
At least you'll look thin on the beach.

112
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:05,489
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

113
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,103
Yes!
You and Mom go.

114
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:08,765
Have fun without me.

115
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,714
You're going to find the perfect guy.
Someone who's good and decent and kind.

116
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:17,975
Who doesn't have a dishonest bone in his body.

117
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,063
Oh God!

118
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,734
You picked a perfect table

119
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:40,498
(laughs nervously)
(server speaking french)

120
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:45,041
I had to atone for being late
-  ooh. Too bad I hate champagne

121
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:47,504
Really? I'm sorry please no...
- I was joking...

122
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:50,396
It was a joke
(in robot voice) That was a joke.

123
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,009
(in robot voice) I am a dating robot
Sent here to observe your ways.

124
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:00,932
You just pulled a robot voice.

125
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,226
All right, don't worry. There's a certain segment of the
population that goes over big for that sort of thing.

126
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,188
Yeah...
Nerds

127
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:11,457
They're my bread and butter

128
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,048
Yeah?
How's that working out for you?

129
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh God!
Oh Shit!

130
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,839
How about you?

131
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,101
I don't know

132
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:25,869
Are you all right?

133
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:33,285
Hi!

134
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:36,505
Are you on the lamb?

135
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,991
You see that guy over by the menus?
Freakishly tall, excellent mustache.

136
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:50,000
Ok
-No, I do need to sit down somewhere

137
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,242
That is a gorgeous mustache

138
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:59,191
Well he umm...
He's a Russian diplomat

139
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,135
Also kind of a pervert

140
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:04,768
Sat next to him on the plane...
Got a little grabby.

141
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:08,166
Really? wait, wait, wait...
Women don't like grabby?

142
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm gonna have to change my whole M.O.

143
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,827
I also heard him in the hotel trying to get the
room next to mine. It was just kind of weird.

144
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,178
I hope you switched rooms

145
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,174
Oh no, no
I like to live on the edge.

146
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:25,700
Dangerous weirdo's, Spicy food...
- Bungie jumping

147
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,681
I can see dangerous weirdo's and spicy foods but...

148
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:33,976
Bungie jumping? I'm mean it's almost never sexy
To puke in public.

149
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:35,761
That's what I said.

150
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:36,656
Really?

151
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:37,883
Yeah.

152
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,111
I mean it's really nice down here and all but...

153
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:43,373
My bet is that they're gone so...

154
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,277
Shall we?

155
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:46,961
Sure.
OK

156
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:53,358
So...

157
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:54,977
Should we order?

158
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,753
You know what?
Let's get out of here.

159
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:05,746
The service is awful and...
I need to show you Nice.

160
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,960
You realize I'm gonna make you tell me
Your whole life story.

161
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,331
(keys beep)

162
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,677
Trust me.
It's boring.

163
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:31,953
Do you want some of mine?

164
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:34,454
Oh no! Actually I really don't drink that much...
I should just...

165
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,941
Slow down.

166
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:39,568
What do you do?

167
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:42,109
Me?

168
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:45,035
Consulting... I'm a consultant...
For a company

169
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,720
Company consultant

170
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,794
We've been doing a lot of downsizing
I travel a lot so...

171
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:54,218
Downsizing
People

172
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:55,500
Oh.

173
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:57,537
Well if you could do anything...
You know...

174
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:59,344
Anything in the world
What would you do?

175
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:02,271
I just think it would be nice to put down some roots.
You know

176
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:07,228
I've actually always wanted to know my neighbors
I've never had that before

177
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:10,620
That's actually pretty beautiful

178
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,069
You're pretty beautiful

179
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:15,369
(laughs nervously)
It's the dress I...

180
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:16,864
It's not the dress

181
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:19,921
You'd be beautiful without the dress.

182
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:22,525
Not that I'm visualizing you naked
Although...

183
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,778
I'm sure you would look beauti... I'm saying that...
you would be... beautif.. clothed...

184
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:29,988
Differently as well

185
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,769
Yeah, Thank you
I do need another.

186
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:39,461
Why don't I get you another. Don't leave
- I won't.

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,605
Stay put!
hmmph.

188
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,621
Okay fine.
I will dance with you.

189
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:56,878
I'm sorry.
What?

190
00:13:56,911 --> 00:14:00,385
You almost ripped out of your dress.
To try to seduce me.

191
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,570
It worked!

192
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,210
No I was...     <Let's dance>
- Okay maybe just for a minute

193
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,394
Wow! you are...
A very enthusiastic dancer

194
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:16,475
Oh, oh this... Oh God!
- Ahh...

195
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:18,940
This is very nice
But I should really get back

196
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,080
To my date

197
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:22,463
Now, I blow your mind
Don't move.

198
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh now you're gonna blow my mind
Oh God, Okay

199
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:27,600
Excuse me
I'm going to cut in here

200
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,341
Back off! Yankee

201
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,842
Go find your own prostitute.

202
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,818
Oh no.
No you're misunderstanding.

203
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:35,332
I'm sorry, I am not a prosti...
(punches man)

204
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,986
Does this dress say prostitute?
- No.

205
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:43,476
It's not really, It's just its its maybe

206
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,680
Wait... Just Jen

207
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:46,416
Yes?

208
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,855
Just Jen
Yes?

209
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,165
There's something that I've been
Wanting to do all night.

210
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:00,761
Your tag was still on.

211
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:01,709
Oh no!
-Sorry

212
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:03,479
No, no no no
-It's Okay

213
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,544
It's Okay

214
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:07,931
No. Its... I can't afford this dress.

215
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:10,840
I left the tag on because I can't afford it.

216
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:15,472
Not unless my Father buys it for me
Which he wouldn't because.. He's not here.

217
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,977
It's Okay

218
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,680
It's fine
Are you Okay?

219
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,652
No, I can't believe this
- So tight!

220
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:25,997
I'm sorry, I can not keep this up.
I am not this girl.

221
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,617
I am not spontaneous

222
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,512
I never drink this much

223
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:35,037
And I don't live on the edge
I live a very quiet, normal life

224
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,097
I would like a normal life
I'd kill for a normal life.

225
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,688
Well just it.. it gets
It gets worse

226
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:42,157
Just, you know that guy...

227
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,614
At the restaurant
With the mustache.

228
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:46,173
The restaurant pervert.

229
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:47,304
That's my Dad

230
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:49,394
Wow
-Yeah

231
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,824
Sounds like a really bad
Home situation.

232
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:52,898
No, no!
Oh God! No

233
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,738
He's not Russian
Or a pervert

234
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:56,908
He's a pilot.

235
00:15:56,942 --> 00:16:00,375
He flies planes. I...I came on
Vacation with my parents

236
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,800
Thats...
How lame I am

237
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,727
I was supposed to come here with my geek boyfriend.
But he dumped me for this girl and then....

238
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:17,993
Sorry.
Go ahead.

239
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:23,548
I can't breathe

240
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,158
This dress is really, really tight.

241
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:29,612
I need to get out of it
Seriously

242
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,567
I've been sucking it in all night.
Can you just. You gotta get it off. Just take it off

243
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,147
Really?
<Yeah take it off>

244
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,612
Okay all right.
<Yeah lets do this>

245
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:40,978
The zipper's stuck

246
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:44,618
Just break it its fine. My father will pay for it.
<break it?> yeah, break it

247
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:46,479
Here just...
Turn around

248
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:49,540
Stay still... Don't
(knife opens) Hold still.

249
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,147
(dress tears)

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,147
(cutting dress)

251
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,087
I... Uh

252
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:06,849
Thanks

253
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:09,362
I'll be. I'm gonna be over here.

254
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:13,332
Doing this... In this manner

255
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,502
Thank you
For...

256
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,115
Being so honest.

257
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,672
I actually feel like I should share something with you.

258
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:27,534
It's gonna be really hard to say

259
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,688
But...

260
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:32,089
I feel like.
You're real. So...

261
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:34,490
I want to be real with you.

262
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:38,498
Haven't really told anyone this before but...

263
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:44,330
I kill people.

264
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:52,742
Wow.
You're taking this a lot better than I expected

265
00:17:58,339 --> 00:17:59,145
Awesome.

266
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:05,772
Usually it's bad people
It's not like I'm out killing good guys

267
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:07,542
I'm not a murderer.

268
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,300
I'm a professional.
I professionally...

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,667
Kill people

270
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:12,806
You're a great listener

271
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,167
Excellent
Listener

272
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:20,614
I don't like what I do
I'm not a fan of it

273
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:22,671
But I like you

274
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,540
Tomorrow, I'm going to show you Nice

275
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,990
And hopefully...
That's just the beginning

276
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:41,726
Cause I like you.

277
00:19:59,209 --> 00:19:59,991
You should take a bite

278
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:01,814
Go ahead and try it
I'm not going to eat it all

279
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:13,051
Good lord!
French food...

280
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,828
I'm goint to uh...
Just going to go to the restroom

281
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:40,759
It's a crush Spence
It happens

282
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:44,204
Go shoot some guns
And screw some models

283
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:45,620
You'll be good as new

284
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:47,696
Then what?
Kill some more people

285
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,773
They're enemies of the state.
Not people

286
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:51,463
Are you sure about that?

287
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:53,919
Cause five years ago
Levedeaux worked for us

288
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,205
And then the NSA and god knows who else.
But this week he's the enemy

289
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:58,371
What the hell's wrong with you?

290
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:02,249
You go and screw Polly Anna for a week
And suddenly your life's work's out the window?

291
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:03,370
She's normal

292
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:06,041
And I feel normal when I'm with her.
And maybe I...

293
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:09,890
Wake up!
Her world only exists because of people like us.

294
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:12,764
And I'm sorry if people change sides

295
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:15,455
Sometimes a friend becomes an enemy
And you have to take them out.

296
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:19,028
She trusts me.

297
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:20,941
And I'm not willing to compromise that.

298
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:24,489
These jobs are not optional Spencer.

299
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:26,797
You don't get to just walk away

300
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,903
Watch me.

301
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,884
You are who you are Spencer!
You can't change that

302
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,707
I think the best part is you're finally with someone
Who's genuinely attractive

303
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,676
I know

304
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,644
I know

305
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,584
I keep thinking I'm going to build up
some kind of tolerance to his..

306
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:58,284
Physical, Godlike
Perfection

307
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,425
Which just hasen't happened yet

308
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:07,431
I'm Okay

309
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:09,423
It's a little early Mom.

310
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,881
Ha ha! (laughter)
Early...(laughter)

311
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:16,841
Do you think they're all right up there?

312
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,160
Oh, as long as Daddy doesn't shoot him
We're good

313
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,317
(gunshot in distance)

314
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,746
So I hear you're jobless.

315
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,097
Corporate consulting's a tough business sir.

316
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:38,103
Jen and I were talking about putting some roots down.
I might open up my own firm here.

317
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,359
Look at my shoes

318
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:43,742
They'e Edward Greene. I picked them up 20 years ago
When I was still flying the London route

319
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:46,981
If you have something of great quality

320
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,621
And you take good care of it.
You'll have it forever.

321
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,031
I know you're worried about Jen.

322
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:58,342
Why would I worry?

323
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,857
I am confident

324
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:05,562
That you'll never hurt her.

325
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,698
That's a nice shot.

326
00:23:07,732 --> 00:23:09,403
Thank you
I was an Eagle Scout

327
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,573
They really let you shoot stuff
In the Boy Scouts?

328
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:14,762
So do the Marines

329
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:17,481
Semper Fi

330
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:19,124
That was yours.

331
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:22,237
I'm sorry I... <Be prepared Spencer>
You would have learned that in the Boy Scouts

332
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,360
I was in 4H

333
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:34,680
You know, Jen's not some fragile China doll.

334
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,892
She's funny, and she's sweet.
And she's smart

335
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:43,921
But in this kind of an off kilter kind of way where one minute she
could be talking about the strategic value of Nice in WWII

336
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,002
And the next she's telling me that
Carey Grant dropped acid.

337
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:51,148
Which I...(stuttering)
My point is...

338
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:53,784
It doesn't matter what she says

339
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:55,438
I can trust her.

340
00:23:55,472 --> 00:23:57,847
I depend on her

341
00:23:57,881 --> 00:24:00,075
Sir. It's not the other way around

342
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:02,203
So...

343
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,338
With your blessing

344
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:07,795
I'm going to marry her.

345
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:16,886
Welcome to the family Spencer.

346
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,438
Thank you Mr. Cornfield
Please...Call me sir

347
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:27,525
How big is it?

348
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:29,971
Oh, it's big.
It's probably the biggest on the block

349
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,216
Well have I ever seen anything like it before?

350
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,386
Uhh... Maybe in a magazine
Or in your dreams.

351
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,542
Will I know what to do with it?

352
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,365
I'll help you navigate the tricky parts

353
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,130
Creedy, creedy

354
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:46,498
It's this blindfold that's making me
Owww! Honey  <Sorry , sorry>

355
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:53,631
Prepare

356
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,202
To be...

357
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:59,071
Thrilled

358
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:02,554
Oh my God

359
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:03,975
Spence

360
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,965
You remodeled my office.

361
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,212
It's so organized

362
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:11,280
Okay
You can kiss me now

363
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:17,431
How did I get so lucky?

364
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,441
How did I get a guy like you?

365
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:20,274
It was easy

366
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:21,797
It was your charm

367
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:23,420
And you wit

368
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:32,329
You really shouldn't be spoiling me especially since...
It's your birthday weekend

369
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,970
No we talked about this
We're not going to make a big deal out of it this year

370
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:36,765
No presents
No parties

371
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,413
It's just dinner tomorrow night with my parents I promise.
But I never agreed to no presents

372
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:44,619
Come on! I have been keeping this secret
For a week

373
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:46,866
I'm at my limit

374
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:48,882
You kill me

375
00:25:51,856 --> 00:25:53,111
Open it it's tickets to Nice

376
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:58,165
I thought we could go back to where it began you know?
And the best part is we can go anytime

377
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,976
But because I rule
I got two weeks off at the end of the month

378
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:07,727
Do you no want to go to Nice?

379
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:08,585
Of course I do

380
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:15,962
Things are hectic at work right now and...
We have a lot going on here.

381
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:19,238
Plus the peach parade is at the end of the month and
You were going to make your cobbler

382
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:22,442
My cobbler sucks

383
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,620
You know what made Nice great?

384
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,659
You

385
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:35,125
I have everything that I need
Right here

386
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:57,567
Hey batter batter batter batter
Hey batter batter batter

387
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,567
Let's go!
Pick up the pace.

388
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:08,251
Spencer!

389
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:09,095
Hi!

390
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,132
Lily and Mac

391
00:27:10,165 --> 00:27:12,401
Hey!
I'm glad we caught you

392
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,017
(together) Block Party

393
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,793
And you guys can dress up

394
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:18,691
Perfect

395
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,281
You know what?
Here's another one

396
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:21,821
yeah
(husband) We're going to have those wings

397
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:24,710
Great <That's got a liitle bit of my spit on it>
- Don't clone me.

398
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,152
Okay we're going to go make love
You have fun

399
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:29,030
Okay
(husband) take care

400
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:32,769
Block party
Block Party!

401
00:28:01,488 --> 00:28:07,346
Our new Norton internet security suite has sonar behaviour
based protection that defends against any unknown online threats

402
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:10,299
Be sure to flag that feature for undecided clients

403
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:12,749
Okay People

404
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:15,790
We're rolling this out immediately
So uh...

405
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:18,206
Let's hop to it hmm?

406
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:20,425
Uh.. Jen.

407
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,722
Polished and consice as always
-Thank you

408
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,093
Don't change a word
When you go to San Francisco.

409
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:28,149
You want me to speak at the conference?

410
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,240
No, I want you to dominate it.

411
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:32,777
Okay

412
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:36,032
You fly out tomorrow

413
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:39,084
Oh, Mr Newpar,
Tomorrow's umm...

414
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:42,086
It's such short notice.

415
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,358
There's no one else you can send?

416
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:51,619
The conference isn't until Monday just...

417
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:53,964
Take the weekend to prep.
You'll be fine

418
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:54,618
Okay

419
00:28:56,283 --> 00:28:58,236
Of course I didn't say that it was Spencers birthday

420
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:03,348
Because it is extremely unprofessional to turn down a
Business trip to babysit your husband.

421
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,464
Birthday or not.
And...

422
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:07,257
That's why I didn't mention it

423
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,846
Can you take him out tonight or not?

424
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:11,787
Hello?

425
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:13,439
Dad?

426
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:14,867
If I have to

427
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,200
Love you sweetie.

428
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,906
I love you too.
Bye

429
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:26,415
No no.
It's too low.

430
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:29,563
Can you lift the back one up an inch?
Right, No

431
00:29:29,597 --> 00:29:31,438
Right, right there.
Perfect

432
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:35,912
Can you come in tomorrow? I'm sorry.
Mildred's having trouble with the billing again.

433
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,236
Saturday, Mildred and bills
A trifecta

434
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,244
I'm sorry.
Thank you   <Fine!>

435
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:43,752
What do you think about this thing?

436
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:47,347
Well, Henry says it's a statement piece

437
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,206
Yeah but is it stating that we like
Ugly shit hanging from our ceiling?

438
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:53,362
Yep

439
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,894
Yep, What?

440
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:58,514
Yes you turned our conference room into
Bambi's nightmare

441
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,481
Yeah I know

442
00:29:59,514 --> 00:30:02,984
Hey! Listen, do me a favor. Grab some flooring
Samples for Olivia all right?

443
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,921
Something durable that cleans up easy

444
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:08,518
In case we decide to have sex on the floor.
- Of course

445
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:10,600
You're worried she'll vomit?

446
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,527
I like her even more when
she's mean to me.

447
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,720
You're going to be a law suit

448
00:30:14,753 --> 00:30:15,931
Probably

449
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:19,326
She gets aggravated though you know
When I flirt with other women. That's what it is.

450
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,231
You do realize that only happens in pornos

451
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:23,809
Yeah! The good pornos

452
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:25,383
I'm gonna give her a shot.

453
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:28,060
Soon as I'm done letting Olivia
Do dirty things to me.

454
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:30,541
That's going to take a while.
Olivia's a bigger slut than you are.

455
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:32,847
Hey! Are we going to pretend to play
Basketball tonight? Or what?

456
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:35,019
No can do.
I've got dinner with Jen

457
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:37,343
Ahhh!
I think I just saw your balls roll by

458
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,811
Yeah? You wanna go catch them for me?

459
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:41,282
Just crushed it.

460
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:42,922
Just crushed one of your balls right there.

461
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:44,652
We'll see.

462
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,387
Call me "ball crusher" from now  on

463
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,441
So! how'd it go?

464
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:24,304
Too good. Newpar is sending me
To San Francisco

465
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:26,801
No, no. Not the presentation.
Spencer's gift?

466
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:28,397
What did he say about the trip?

467
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:30,790
He want's to stay home and eat cobbler

468
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,308
No vacation
No French getaway?

469
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:33,797
No

470
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,732
Who in their right mind?
Turns down a vacation like that?

471
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:38,655
Well you know Spence
He's kind of a home body

472
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,313
Okay, Okay...Okay

473
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:43,523
How long have you two been married?
What like three years?

474
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:44,234
Yeah

475
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,654
Okay
That's your problem

476
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,045
I have a problem?

477
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,963
Everyone always talks about the seven year itch

478
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:51,399
But no one mentions
The three year snooze

479
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:54,208
People get complacent

480
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:56,068
Get relaxed
But you have to be vigilant

481
00:31:56,101 --> 00:32:00,460
Okay otherwise your growing out your leg hair. Your growing
Out your "down there" hair you're wearing your fat jeans.

482
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,418
and a pair of Spanx Okay?

483
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,621
And the next thing you know. he runs off
With a reality TV star named Shawnda Okay?

484
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,994
And that's my personal experience.
But I'm telling you

485
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,466
You better watch out.
Because Shawnda speaks six languages

486
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:10,831
And one of those languages

487
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:12,714
Is sex.
- Are you going to eat that?

488
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:14,704
Getting hungz...
Super hungz over here.

489
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,284
(receptionist) Peach Plaza Motel

490
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:46,730
Ah yes. i'm trying to reach a guest named...

491
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:50,803
Yes uh...

492
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:55,200
Yes the guest named
Annabell Hensler.

493
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,854
(receptionist) Just a moment

494
00:33:02,258 --> 00:33:05,490
Well it took you long enough. We need to meet
That's not going to happen Annabell

495
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:09,027
I get that you love being this soft, suburban zombie

496
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:14,213
But like I told you 3 years ago in Nice.
You can't just walk away from this game.

497
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:16,318
I've got a job for you kiddo

498
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:19,121
I'm out. You're going to have to find somebody
Else to clean up your mess

499
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:22,425
My Mess! If you don't do this job.
It'll be your mess.

500
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,701
I'm in room 1-1-4

501
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:25,860
I'll be waiting for you

502
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:28,082
Just do what I'm telling you
<Spencer>

503
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,372
Hey!

504
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:34,815
Did you just hang up on someone?

505
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,274
No

506
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:43,615
Jenn's tied up at work so I'm supposed to do something nice
For your birthday so. Here I am

507
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,241
I'm going to feed you.

508
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,582
Oh boy.
That's great

509
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:48,807
Really. I can just grab something real simple

510
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,287
Are you saying you would rather eat alone?

511
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,647
No

512
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,376
Of course not I...
Let's break some bread.

513
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:00,088
Who's "h"?

514
00:34:02,026 --> 00:34:03,270
My old boss.

515
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:06,198
Just asked me if I want my old job back

516
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:10,042
He sent you hugs and kisses

517
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:11,420
Yup

518
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:12,974
It's a French thing

519
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:14,471
You know always kissing...
Fruits

520
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:18,312
I can't take you to dinner dressed like a
Street urchin so...

521
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:21,806
We'll stop by your house and
Pick up adult apparel

522
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,796
I'll leave my car here

523
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,644
I will meet you out front.

524
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:43,905
What's with you?

525
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,846
You're like a chained recess monkey at the wheel

526
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,299
Just excited about the two of us grabbing dinner

527
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:57,573
You and Mrs K. still thinking about
Going on that cruise?

528
00:34:59,394 --> 00:34:59,600
Yes

529
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,157
Where are you going to go?

530
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,056
I really think that's up to the captain Spencer.

531
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:24,820
What's with you kids?

532
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:28,428
Jen shouldn't be coming home to a dark house.
It's not safe

533
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:29,795
I couldn't agree with you more sir.

534
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:33,732
Did I leave my keys in the truck?

535
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,612
I am not telepathic Spencer

536
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:38,154
Maybe I'll just...

537
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:40,183
This is not Candyland
Unlocked trucks get stolen

538
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:43,696
Which is why careful men
Use the garage

539
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:47,313
Thank you sir.
<The keys are in the ignition>

540
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,053
Surprise!!!

541
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,335
I told you I wouldn't throw you a party...

542
00:36:12,368 --> 00:36:15,012
On my birthday
Right. Very cute

543
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:17,420
Not what you were expecting right?

544
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:18,337
No

545
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,060
Okay

546
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,207
All right

547
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:22,394
I'm going to run upstairs and
Change really quick

548
00:36:22,428 --> 00:36:23,765
Okay we'll be down here waiting when you come back.

549
00:36:27,682 --> 00:36:29,830
(drunkenly) Surprise!!!

550
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:36,605
Good job Daddy

551
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:43,449
(receptionist) Good evening Peach Plaza Motel
-Yes can cou connect me with Annabell Hensler please.

552
00:36:43,483 --> 00:36:44,716
(receptionist) One moment

553
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,875
No answer sir.
Would you like to leave a message

554
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:52,570
No

555
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:54,340
No. No message

556
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:00,400
Well I got a lot going on and that so

557
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:02,912
I don't know if I'm going to make it...
< We should hang out more >

558
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:04,169
We should

559
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:05,764
I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick

560
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:07,159
Yeah, yeah
I'll join you

561
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,305
Mama!

562
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:10,513
Oh sweetheart!

563
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:11,665
Oh dear

564
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:15,375
I was just telling Jen how you were going to come over
Tomorrow. We can't let you spend your birthday alone.

565
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:18,319
I've got the block party

566
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:20,590
We could come with you

567
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:22,023
Yeah

568
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:23,317
Perfect

569
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:24,250
Great

570
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,648
I'm coming you lush!

571
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:27,924
Oh, Henry might be staying the night
< Uh huh >

572
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:32,110
I'm telling you smoke on the water
This chick was electrified

573
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:34,949
Pow! Snap! Pop!
Whooo!!

574
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:36,541
Ha ha ha ha
< Okay >

575
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:42,623
I need to get a fill up
< Uh huh >

576
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,760
You got something there you think I might like?

577
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:47,900
I'll see you guys in a minute

578
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,928
Or something you might like
It's your party

579
00:37:49,962 --> 00:37:51,379
You get to have whatever you want

580
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:53,967
Uhh...
Wine?

581
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,117
Having Fun?

582
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:57,058
I'm uhh...

583
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:00,525
I'll go open it
I'll be here with a birthday kiss when you get back

584
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:03,638
I just hope that it was a good surprise you know?
He seems kind of distracted

585
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:06,329
He wasn't expecting a house full of people
Cut him some slack

586
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:11,900
Maybe Kristen is right about the 3 year thing. You would
Tell me right? You wouldn't sugar coat it

587
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,639
Cause with things like that.
It's just better to know

588
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:17,083
I mean, my legs aren't hairy but, I have been in my
Fat jeans for the last two weeks which..

589
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:21,421
May be why he would rather stay home and make cobbler
Than go on vacation with me. Oh my God

590
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:23,516
I really am freaking out.
<What's going on with you guys?>

591
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,893
You got her all freaked out at lunch

592
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:29,303
Are you still having sex with Spencer?
Yes or No?

593
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:31,231
Yeah all the time

594
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:32,771
Then your marriage is fine

595
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:35,585
Guys can we please play charades now?
Come on.

596
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:47,256
Are you sure you're all right?

597
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,251
Yeah yeah, I'm Okay

598
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:51,329
Watch the steps!

599
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,657
Walk home!
He really shouldn't be driving

600
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:00,543
No no babe. I got it

601
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:01,638
No honey no.
I got it

602
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:02,882
I'll put the house to bed

603
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,013
You've got to start packing

604
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:06,179
Babe, It's your birthday
< I got it >

605
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:07,582
Are you sure?
< yeah >

606
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:11,750
(snoring)  < Okay just do the bare minimum>
I'll get the rest in the morning

607
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:12,862
I love you

608
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,034
Thank you
I love you

609
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:15,932
Where are your pants?
(snoring)

610
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:44,574
Is something wrong?

611
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:47,178
No, of course not.

612
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:48,812
Are you sure?

613
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:52,754
I mean.
Is everything okay between us?

614
00:39:52,787 --> 00:39:55,365
You're kidding,
Right?

615
00:39:56,922 --> 00:40:00,510
Come here. Come here
This the spot?

616
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:06,797
Maybe I could skip the Cornfield packing method
Just this once

617
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:09,822
Your flights early
You should keep packing

618
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:38,823
(snoring)

619
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,033
(farts)

620
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,033
(follow through fart)

621
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:03,424
I should have just told Newpar I'd go tomorrow
I feel terrible missing your birthday

622
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,894
No worries.
I've got another one next year

623
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:06,069
(stifled laughter)

624
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:09,228
Well hold on

625
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:11,243
You need your birthday kiss

626
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:22,488
We don't want the neighbors to get jealous

627
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:26,625
Throwing a little porno in the driveway

628
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:27,841
Don't want you to be late

629
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:29,767
For the airport

630
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,290
Miss your flight

631
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,443
There we go!

632
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:38,583
Hey Jen!

633
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:40,783
Jen!

634
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:42,810
Hey! Jen
< Hey Jackie >

635
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:45,121
You're up early for a party animal.

636
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:46,765
Oh yeah.
I'm just runnning out to the airport

637
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:51,900
My Dougie says its a good thing  that we're such sound
sleepers because you know a lot of other people might have

638
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:51,612
An issue with all that noise.

639
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:58,645
Any who. Douggy wants to talk to Spence about this whole
fence on the property line bruhauhau we're having.

640
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:01,362
We don't want to bring lawyers into it
Any more than you do right?

641
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:03,812
But, we're quite sure our new fence is not on your land

642
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:09,075
You know, you understand <Oh yeah perfectly, but you>
Understand you're gonna have to take it up with Spence right?

643
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:09,965
Okay?

644
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:12,840
Thanks Jackie, I'm sorry
I'm in a big rush. See you soon

645
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:13,913
Okay, you're late.

646
00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:18,103
Hey, Did you guys have fun last night?

647
00:42:18,137 --> 00:42:19,598
Oh yeah, it was great

648
00:42:19,632 --> 00:42:21,658
Of course, I'm paying for it this morning

649
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:24,107
(laughing) You're still taking Spence out tonight though right?

650
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,924
Yes, for the hundredth time

651
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:26,442
Good

652
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:28,088
Okay did Daddy promise to be nice to him?

653
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:31,793
Hmmm... Not in so many words.

654
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:36,024
Just get yourself on the plane.
Let us take care of Spence, Okay?

655
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:37,943
Okay, well I'll call you
When I get to San Francisco

656
00:42:37,977 --> 00:42:38,873
Love you

657
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:40,025
Love you too dear
Bye

658
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,899
(slurps)
Mmmmm

659
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,899
(cell phone)

660
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,221
What was that?
You or me?

661
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:10,440
That's me

662
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:11,541
That's you

663
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:15,513
You got any milk?

664
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:16,846
Yeah.

665
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,302
Everything all right?

666
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:18,960
Yeah

667
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:26,228
What do I got? I've got some skim milk and...
I've got some low fat yogurt

668
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:29,218
You know what you can do?
You can mix the two together

669
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:33,083
What the hell are you doing man?

670
00:43:33,116 --> 00:43:34,669
You should have seen your face

671
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:36,966
You almost crapped your pants

672
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:37,724
Yeah, It's really funn....

673
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:44,621
What are you doing?

674
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:45,948
Killing you buddy

675
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:07,141
Where are you goiing Spence?
Huh?

676
00:44:07,175 --> 00:44:10,740
You got a gun upstairs or something?

677
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:46,618
Surprise!
I'm back

678
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:48,859
Spence?

679
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,947
(screaming)

680
00:44:55,948 --> 00:44:56,706
What are you doing!?

681
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,547
Spencer!
Stop it!

682
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,132
Stop!
You're hurting him.

683
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,329
I need you to give me something

684
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:03,709
Stop it.
Upstairs, in the bedside table...

685
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,027
There's a Glock .45
< A Glock?! >

686
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,581
A gun!
Just go get it!

687
00:45:07,615 --> 00:45:09,447
Why do you have a gun?!
< Just get it! >

688
00:45:21,448 --> 00:45:23,133
I'm coming, I'm coming...

689
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:27,000
I kind of need you to hurry
< Okay, Okay, I'm here >

690
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:31,392
Your job right now. I need you to point the gun at him...
And shoot him in the face.

691
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:33,732
What?! <Don't do it he's gone crazy>
It's a psycotic...

692
00:45:38,045 --> 00:45:40,343
Okay
(gun fires)

693
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:43,272
Oww!!
Bitch shot me

694
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:47,777
What are you crazy?!

695
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,605
You told me to shoot him in the face

696
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:52,566
I didn't think you were really going to shoot.
I was telling you to divert his...

697
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,325
Well then you should have waved or
Crossed your fingers or something.

698
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,352
I was a little busy
Trying not to die

699
00:45:57,385 --> 00:45:59,735
Oh God, I shot him
It's all right he's just knocked out, he's not dead.

700
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:01,736
It's Okay. I need you to go to the basement

701
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:02,922
And get the duct tape

702
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:05,522
There's duct tape downstairs
Go downstairs and get the duct tape.

703
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:08,385
I can't move
< Come on babe >

704
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:09,080
I can't move!

705
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:09,631
It's okay

706
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:10,711
It's okay

707
00:46:10,745 --> 00:46:12,375
It's okay, he's going to be okay

708
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:14,581
Maybe.

709
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:19,278
Spence?

710
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:22,356
What is happening?
(cell phone)

711
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,355
I'm about to find out

712
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:29,057
Ahhh!!!  <Wake up >
Owwwww!!!  < You're hurting him>

713
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,042
Yeah, I think he'll be all right

714
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,177
Sorry I'm bleeding on your chair

715
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,106
You just had it reupholstered right?

716
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,934
Yeah

717
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,532
You were under contract

718
00:46:44,565 --> 00:46:45,307
Contract for what?
The business?

719
00:46:45,342 --> 00:46:47,760
Somebody hired him
To kill me.

720
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:50,649
Oh my God!

721
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,439
I thought we were friends.

722
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:55,308
Really?
Because you never seemed that invested.

723
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:57,196
Owww!!!

724
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:02,273
I covered for you. With every client that we have.
I talked a half a dozen hussy girls out of slashing your tires

725
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:07,498
I even drove you to the free clinic when your balls were
swollen and you had that fungal thing!

726
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:11,163
< No, no no no >
I helped you bury "Sir Barks-a-lot"

727
00:47:11,197 --> 00:47:13,413
Hey.
He was a good dog all right.

728
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:14,620
Leave him out of this

729
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:15,996
He couldn't fetch for shit.

730
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,164
Spencer

731
00:47:17,198 --> 00:47:17,546
Yeah?

732
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,591
By the end of the day, you're going
to be just as dead as he is

733
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:23,279
You got a 20 million dollar bounty on your head

734
00:47:29,173 --> 00:47:29,731
Are you going to faint?

735
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:32,342
Unless I puke first

736
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:33,646
Breathe

737
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,858
It's okay

738
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:36,661
How is this okay?

739
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:38,707
I'll explain.
Just not right now

740
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,701
No you explain now!
I want you to explain right now!

741
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,802
(knock on door)

742
00:47:43,803 --> 00:47:44,469
Jen?

743
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:45,734
Spence?

744
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:49,461
Hello?

745
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:52,763
Yeah thats it.
Be very quiet

746
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:54,890
Maybe the other assassin will go away.

747
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:57,655
(outside) Yoo-hoo
< They could be any of your neighbors >

748
00:47:57,689 --> 00:47:59,471
(outside) Come out, come out wherever you are

749
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:00,409
What?

750
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:03,082
You didn't think I'd have some competition?

751
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:07,296
20 million dollars buys a lot of patience
(outside) Heloooooo!

752
00:48:08,295 --> 00:48:09,870
I can see your car

753
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:12,890
Spencer, It's just Jackie Valero

754
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,904
(Jackie) I know you're in there.

755
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:16,985
She just wants to talk about the property line or something

756
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,247
Or...
Kill you.

757
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:23,117
(knock)
(Jackie) Hello you two, Hello?

758
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:27,324
What do we do?

759
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:28,794
Go

760
00:48:30,514 --> 00:48:35,039
What about him? < Oh No no! > <Spencer, stop. >
< If I don't, he'll come after us >

761
00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:36,717
He's our friend

762
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:37,303
He's a liar

763
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,748
(gunshots)

764
00:48:52,749 --> 00:48:54,440
Put your seatbelt on
< I am, I am >

765
00:48:58,526 --> 00:48:58,965
Jen!

766
00:48:58,998 --> 00:49:00,934
Jen!
What's going on?

767
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:05,314
... my gun
I can tell

768
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:06,775
Jen, everything all right

769
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:18,706
Good Morning

770
00:49:22,888 --> 00:49:23,969
Slow Down!

771
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,892
Stop the car right there
I am getting out right now!

772
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:27,144
Sit Down

773
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:29,384
I have a right to freak out
I don't even know who the hell you are!

774
00:49:29,418 --> 00:49:30,113
It's me

775
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:31,654
I just have a different resume

776
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:32,827
Who do you work for?

777
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:34,024
Is it the Mob?

778
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,070
I can't tell you. If I tell you
They could kill you too

779
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:41,813
Let's just say that  I work for the blah. blah. blah
And they gave me a licence to blah

780
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:45,076
Air. I need air right now

781
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,094
All right
Honey

782
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:47,625
It was never my primary directive.

783
00:49:47,658 --> 00:49:52,008
Are we even married? <Yes we're married> I mean
legally married <I got out> not married in your heart?

784
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,122
I got out in France

785
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:56,118
I was in a love bubble in France
<I was in a love bubble t...>

786
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:09,115
I've got something for you Spence.

787
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:14,504
Spread your legs.  <Oh No!>
You are not getting off that easy.

788
00:50:14,538 --> 00:50:17,785
Spread 'Em!!

789
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:19,770
Here
Hold this

790
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,391
(gunfire)
Hold on

791
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,142
He's on my side.
He's on my side

792
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:54,060
Oh cool!
Race cars

793
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,584
Damn!

794
00:51:15,585 --> 00:51:16,005
That got him

795
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,050
You okay?

796
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,109
Mmm Hmm

797
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,945
He's going to be close behind

798
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:33,201
Hide

799
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:34,295
What?
<Hide now!>

800
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,251
What are you going to do?

801
00:51:40,253 --> 00:51:41,585
I'm going to kill him

802
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,081
(gunfire)

803
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,081
(gunfire)

804
00:52:29,082 --> 00:52:32,081
(coughing)

805
00:52:40,082 --> 00:52:42,081
Whoaaa!!!

806
00:52:42,465 --> 00:52:43,500
(loud crash)

807
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:57,548
Spence?

808
00:53:02,703 --> 00:53:03,457
Spencer

809
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:16,216
Get in the truck

810
00:53:17,557 --> 00:53:18,159
Is he...?

811
00:53:18,192 --> 00:53:18,942
Yeah

812
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:24,185
Start talking.

813
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,017
I was recruited in college
Freshman year

814
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,704
Why did they choose you?

815
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:38,061
They look for independent people.
And after my parents passed...

816
00:53:38,094 --> 00:53:39,998
I didn't have any family
So...

817
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:45,420
We've gotta go babe.

818
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:49,731
You can be pissed at me in the truck

819
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:51,926
Are you going to kill me too?

820
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:55,224
Come on. If I was going to kill you,
I would have shot you back at the house.

821
00:53:55,257 --> 00:53:56,944
Uh.. that...

822
00:53:56,978 --> 00:53:59,250
Sounded weird I...

823
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:02,000
Logically, You know that that's true

824
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:05,000
Okay

825
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:15,555
Spread 'em.  <For God's sake>
What else do you have down there?

826
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:22,161
How many people Spencer?

827
00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:27,592
Four

828
00:54:27,169 --> 00:54:28,806
-teen

829
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Fifteen
It's fifteen

830
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,494
Is fifteen your real number
Or is that like when

831
00:54:37,494 --> 00:54:40,375
You ask a girl how many guy's she's slept with and
You have to double in and times it by ten?

832
00:54:42,335 --> 00:54:46,566
I didn't do that. I'm just...
<Fifteen is my number.>

833
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,971
And they were all bad guys
As far as I know

834
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:52,098
But it was getting harder to tell

835
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:54,098
And then I met you

836
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:57,177
And we fell in love
And I got out

837
00:55:03,613 --> 00:55:05,148
My boss reached out to me yesterday

838
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:07,204
He's staying in a hotel

839
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,003
He'll know what's going on

840
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:26,301
Sweetie

841
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:27,800
Your gun is showing

842
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,127
Where do you expect me to put it?

843
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,030
Have you seen the size of this thing?

844
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,100
(toy squeaks)

845
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:43,951
(children laughing, playing)

846
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,951
(cell phone ringing)

847
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,490
Oh, It's my Dad.

848
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:51,235
Should I take it?

849
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,921
(rap ringtone)

850
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:00,993
I thought you said you were going to change that?

851
00:56:07,638 --> 00:56:08,779
Sweetheart
Relax

852
00:56:08,813 --> 00:56:11,554
It's a little early to check on Sprencer
Don't you think?

853
00:56:11,588 --> 00:56:14,546
And Jen will just be getting settled at the hotel

854
00:56:16,484 --> 00:56:16,824
Yeah

855
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:17,663
You're right

856
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,856
(knocking on door)

857
00:56:30,857 --> 00:56:31,240
Spence?

858
00:56:31,273 --> 00:56:32,614
I got the...

859
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:53,055
Easy...

860
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:55,761
It's my old boss
Holbrook

861
00:56:58,491 --> 00:56:59,971
Two to the heart
One in the head

862
00:57:00,005 --> 00:57:03,039
It's old school training
Had to be an experienced hitter.

863
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,198
Allright.

864
00:57:08,232 --> 00:57:10,409
Judging from his body
It happened earlier this morning

865
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:11,859
It's okay

866
00:57:11,893 --> 00:57:13,115
It's the adrenaline

867
00:57:13,149 --> 00:57:14,456
You're going in a little bit

868
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:16,596
How can you talk about him lke that?
You knew him.

869
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,210
It's my training baby

870
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:19,924
Sorry

871
00:57:23,724 --> 00:57:24,637
Spence, I can't stay here

872
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,874
I think I'm going to get sick

873
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:27,922
Just give me a second baby

874
00:57:27,956 --> 00:57:29,382
Gotta have some information

875
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:30,945
About the target

876
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:34,698
You already looked there

877
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:37,601
I'm missing something

878
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:44,556
It's the watch

879
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,577
It's wrong

880
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:50,708
He'd never wear anything this flashy
Nothing to get noticed

881
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:54,515
Look at this.

882
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,408
It's broken. Who cares?
< No no >

883
00:57:57,441 --> 00:58:00,979
It's a plug in for like a flash drive or something.
It's missing.

884
00:58:01,013 --> 00:58:03,375
You're right
Someone's taken the drive

885
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:05,810
Okay
All right

886
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:08,588
Let's go

887
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,458
Do you think that Henry got to Holbrook?

888
00:58:20,303 --> 00:58:23,808
No Henry was in agreement untill this morning
There was another shooter at the house

889
00:58:23,841 --> 00:58:25,236
I think we need to get out of here

890
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:26,566
Absolutely

891
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,732
And go to my parents

892
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:28,898
<No>
Yes

893
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:29,703
No

894
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:31,679
Yes! My Dad will know what to do

895
00:58:31,713 --> 00:58:35,845
I used to do this for a living okay. We do not
Want to involve your parents. And we definitely

896
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:37,500
Don't need help from your Dad.
<I think we do.>

897
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:38,256
Because your plan

898
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:40,875
To kill Henry and come see a dead guy.
It's not really working out

899
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:42,060
(sighs)

900
00:58:42,093 --> 00:58:44,095
I should have seen this coming

901
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:46,051
Of course you're going to
Rope your parents into this.

902
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:47,875
Oh! You are a spy
And a double agent

903
00:58:47,908 --> 00:58:50,216
But I'm the bad guy because
I want to call my parents. Really?

904
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:54,925
We've been married for three years and we've never been 5
Minutes away from your parents <come on now>

905
00:58:54,926 --> 00:59:00,000
They're always coming over and you Dad's all
"This is how the Cornfields load the dishwasher" and

906
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:04,500
"Mow the lawn clockwise, because that's the Cornfield way"
"Take this piece of coal, Stick it up your keester"

907
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:07,500
"Squeeze it real tight like we do"
"And you'll make a Cornfield diamond"

908
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:09,072
Now hold up a minute.
You're talking about my parents

909
00:59:09,073 --> 00:59:10,935
I'm your husband

910
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:13,548
What are we going to do when we have our own kids?

911
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:17,000
(vomits)

912
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,916
Jen
Jen

913
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:22,633
If you could just talk to me for a second
I take it back I love your parents

914
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,950
I'm sending them a mental hug right now

915
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:27,998
Spencer!
Hey.. you okay?

916
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:28,894
Yeah, I'm good

917
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:29,785
Yeah

918
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:32,869
Your garage. It's it's a wreck

919
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,294
Yeah it was a party foul it...
< You do realize we >

920
00:59:35,328 --> 00:59:39,624
Have the block party tonight and its a...
It's a real eyesore.

921
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,951
Well then don't look at it Pete!

922
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:51,065
You can't just run off like that
You make it impossible for me to protect you

923
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:52,688
A little late for protection

924
00:59:56,615 --> 01:00:01,835
Think about it. My emotions are all over the place. I'm
Picking up smells that half the K-9 unit would miss

925
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:04,213
Plus, I pretty much feel like vomitting
Every time I breathe

926
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:05,000
It's been a stressful day

927
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,460
Explain these

928
01:00:10,084 --> 01:00:11,256
Aren't they always that big?

929
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,750
You take the pill every day

930
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:17,095
I know, But I had strep last month remember?

931
01:00:17,128 --> 01:00:19,261
I had to take a Z pack

932
01:00:19,295 --> 01:00:21,893
Antibiotics knock out the pill. That's why I told you we 
Had to be careful. <I thought you were talking about>

933
01:00:21,926 --> 01:00:24,224
My technique. Not geeting Knocked up.

934
01:00:24,225 --> 01:00:25,272
Okay don't yell at me
Sureshot

935
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:28,060
You're the one who suggested
Naked Saturdays

936
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,539
Can I help you?

937
01:00:30,573 --> 01:00:32,435
Stop It.

938
01:00:32,468 --> 01:00:35,116
What? She's staring at us <You don't...>
Staring is rude.  <You know what?>

939
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,443
Can we just.. We're not in a library here.
Let's just pick up the pace

940
01:00:38,444 --> 01:00:40,000
Well they're not all equally accurate okay?

941
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:43,268
Well it's just crazy to stand out here in the aisle so...
Take one. Take them all. I don't know? Who cares?

942
01:00:43,301 --> 01:00:45,740
I care. I care Spence.
It would be awesome

943
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:51,085
To know if I am actually making a little being
Inside of me okay? And don't you call me crazy!

944
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,871
I'm not calling you crazy. The scenario is crazy
Standing here is crazy

945
01:00:51,904 --> 01:00:55,498
You know what?
You're not helping

946
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,030
Uh... Folks?
Could I be of some assistance?

947
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:00,173
Yes

948
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:01,908
Yes

949
01:01:01,942 --> 01:01:03,227
You can
ahh... uhh...

950
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,543
Kevin

951
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:08,117
Which one of these is the most accurate?

952
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:10,672
I don't think he's a pregnancy test expert

953
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,221
Well...

954
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,275
First Response seems to be pretty popular uh...

955
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:20,767
Can't seem to keep it on the shelf
Here you go

956
01:01:23,364 --> 01:01:25,219
Must be your first. <pregnancy test?>
Baby

957
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:26,961
Oh. Yeah, yeah

958
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:32,352
Well, It may be your lucky day

959
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:36,393
Stop it

960
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,291
Look at that

961
01:01:38,324 --> 01:01:40,421
It's on sale
<Great>

962
01:01:40,455 --> 01:01:41,648
That's great

963
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:48,655
Let's go
<Thank you so much. Thanks>

964
01:01:54,931 --> 01:01:55,784
No judging

965
01:01:55,818 --> 01:02:00,156
I need to follow protocol
Report Holbrook's termination

966
01:02:00,188 --> 01:02:02,015
I'll get a safehouse

967
01:02:02,048 --> 01:02:03,661
You'll be protected there

968
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:05,655
And I can figure out

969
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,269
Who Holbrook's target was

970
01:02:07,301 --> 01:02:09,590
Maybe find out
Who set this whole thing in motion

971
01:02:09,623 --> 01:02:12,888
Along as I get to pee on the stick and eat my
Delicious jerky. I'm in

972
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:15,244
Great

973
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:17,095
Listen.
There's one more thing

974
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:20,704
You can't be upset...
I need to steal a car

975
01:02:20,736 --> 01:02:24,700
The truck's shot to shit. <It will be the least awful
Thing we do all day so...Go for it.>

976
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,970
Honey, I'm eating like I just got home from Fat Camp

977
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:36,035
I'm glad you said it

978
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:37,974
Really?

979
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:41,328
Yoou want to poke Mama Bear right now?
That seems like a good idea?

980
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:43,211
Hey you're kind of scary right now.
<Just make your phone call>

981
01:02:46,212 --> 01:02:47,751
(over phone) You are a go for contact

982
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:52,128
This is Zulu one four niner. 
Sierra one zero zero's been forceably retired

983
01:02:52,129 --> 01:02:55,659
Prior to contact. Please advise a secure
Location for briefing

984
01:02:55,693 --> 01:02:58,046
(over phone) Hold for further instructions

985
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,758
Zulu one four niner?
<It's my code name>

986
01:03:01,759 --> 01:03:02,266
(chuckles)

987
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:06,112
It's just not very catchy.

988
01:03:06,145 --> 01:03:09,391
Sorry
All the cool code names were taken

989
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:14,275
(over phone) Zulu one four niner. 
Please confirm your contact and his status.

990
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:19,165
Sirra one zero zero and his status is dead
And I believe his target has put a hit on me

991
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,393
(over phone) Negative
Sierra one zero zero has no target

992
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:26,485
He is no longer an active agent. Please provide
Your location and coordina... <hangs up>

993
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:32,902
What happened?

994
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:34,416
Something's not right

995
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:35,308
Where are you going?

996
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:38,186
To search Henry's stuff. See if we can find out who
Hired him. Maybe there's a connection to Holbrook

997
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,302
Oh and you could do your...
Pee thing.

998
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:49,927
I got it

999
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,048
I'm in

1000
01:03:52,049 --> 01:04:00,953
Porn...porn...porn.....Poooooorn
<Porn>

1001
01:04:00,954 --> 01:04:03,586
People are so inventive.

1002
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:07,057
They're like propped up there and...
<Okay>

1003
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,382
Okay, how weird is this going to get?

1004
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,771
Because there are some things
That you can't unsee

1005
01:04:13,804 --> 01:04:16,050
It's a picture of Henry's dog
"Sir Barks-a-lot"

1006
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:17,256
In costume?

1007
01:04:23,215 --> 01:04:23,723
Wait a minute

1008
01:04:23,757 --> 01:04:26,604
Look at the size of these files

1009
01:04:30,684 --> 01:04:31,297
Oh my God

1010
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:35,095
These are pictures from two years ago

1011
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:37,541
I mean, This was the first block party we went to

1012
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:44,000
Whoever set this up was patient enough to embed Henry
And God knows who else into my life <Our life>>

1013
01:04:44,034 --> 01:04:45,059
Our life

1014
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:50,332
Wait wha...

1015
01:04:53,824 --> 01:04:55,152
I'm pretty sure your Dad took that one

1016
01:04:57,789 --> 01:05:00,000
What is that supposed to mean?
<Nothing, It's just an observation>

1017
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:02,935
Yes. An observation about my father
And that photo

1018
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:06,168
Because it's a picture that he took.

1019
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:08,763
Okay so now my Dad, is a bad guy
<I definitely did not...>

1020
01:05:08,797 --> 01:05:09,853
No no no

1021
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,702
You're right

1022
01:05:10,736 --> 01:05:11,997
Because you're a liar... and a hitman

1023
01:05:12,031 --> 01:05:15,304
And everybody probably is too <here we go>
So I bet my Mom's in on it

1024
01:05:15,338 --> 01:05:16,269
And Granny Cornfield

1025
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:20,746
Yeah, I think she's just messing with our minds with 
The whole "I'm in a wheelchair bit!"

1026
01:05:20,781 --> 01:05:24,016
Okay, We are getting into some counter productive
Territory here and...I think we should move on to

1027
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:25,438
Something else
Like

1028
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:28,823
Like... Maybe we should piss on a stick now?
That would be a good idea.

1029
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:31,596
It is a good idea because I do have to pee

1030
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,249
Grab my gun

1031
01:05:33,282 --> 01:05:36,272
You can't just walk out and...

1032
01:05:36,305 --> 01:05:39,191
You are aware that people are trying to kill us

1033
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:40,067
I really have to go

1034
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:49,499
Oh for God's sake just turn the light on
It's not like there's a lot of places to hide

1035
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:50,973
Just humour me.

1036
01:05:53,138 --> 01:05:54,655
(scarcastically) Why thanks

1037
01:06:10,397 --> 01:06:12,718
I can't pee with you just standing there staring at me.

1038
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:14,957
Honey, you've peed in front of me a million times

1039
01:06:14,991 --> 01:06:16,878
But there's a little more pressure now don't you think?

1040
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:21,041
(water running)

1041
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:23,041
Better?

1042
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:26,599
No.

1043
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:28,460
No...?

1044
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:35,106
(radio playing "Whoomp there it is")
-Ahhhh...

1045
01:06:41,107 --> 01:06:43,031
Honey, can you please just give me one minute

1046
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,559
It's going to take a minute

1047
01:06:44,592 --> 01:06:45,949
You can guard the door

1048
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:11,073
Hey!
<Hey.>

1049
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:12,247
You're here

1050
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:13,284
< You're here >

1051
01:07:13,317 --> 01:07:14,437
Oh God look...

1052
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,733
There's a problem with the wind pipe count
June 2008

1053
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:20,807
The billing?
You might want to take a look at it.

1054
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:23,148
You know what?
Let's forget the billing

1055
01:07:23,182 --> 01:07:25,348
We'll just
We'll take care of it on Monday

1056
01:07:25,382 --> 01:07:26,782
Are you sure?

1057
01:07:26,815 --> 01:07:27,479
Yeah

1058
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:29,370
Okay

1059
01:07:29,404 --> 01:07:30,062
Great

1060
01:08:00,085 --> 01:08:01,418
Spence?

1061
01:08:47,186 --> 01:08:48,725
Spence?

1062
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:27,871
Hey. You, you... Stop it

1063
01:09:27,905 --> 01:09:29,970
Stop it

1064
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:37,651
Honey, I don't know how... it's not
It's not shooting

1065
01:09:55,952 --> 01:09:56,364
Are you okay?

1066
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:02,234
Hey
Are you all right?

1067
01:10:03,819 --> 01:10:05,315
I'm out of ammo

1068
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:10,015
Bullets before babies huh?

1069
01:10:12,048 --> 01:10:13,599
Ammo's kind of important right now

1070
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:16,898
What's it say?

1071
01:10:20,265 --> 01:10:21,294
What's two bars mean?

1072
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:24,432
Hey
You've got to translate this for me

1073
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:30,159
Am I going to be a Dad?

1074
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:31,451
I'm going to be a Mother

1075
01:10:31,484 --> 01:10:33,596
But I'm not sure yet if you're going to be a father

1076
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:44,451
.  

1077
01:10:44,485 --> 01:10:46,050
Jen, Jen...
I know you're upset

1078
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:47,694
And you have every right to be
But I can't change who I was

1079
01:10:47,728 --> 01:10:48,766
Where does that leave us?

1080
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,141
We'll figure it out

1081
01:10:51,175 --> 01:10:52,921
How? <I will keep you safe >
How?

1082
01:10:54,477 --> 01:10:55,434
Tell me how?

1083
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:56,659
And I will stay

1084
01:11:03,652 --> 01:11:04,433
It's over Spence

1085
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:09,249
I know you don't want this to be over

1086
01:11:09,283 --> 01:11:12,258
What I wanted stopped mattering
The moment I saw those two bars

1087
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,343
Where are you going?

1088
01:11:25,344 --> 01:11:30,270
Jen....Jen
Jen!

1089
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:49,270
(horn blaring)
-oh... Olivia!

1090
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,270
(cell phone)

1091
01:12:01,271 --> 01:12:02,603
Henry, Who is calling you?

1092
01:12:07,604 --> 01:12:09,628
You've got to be kidding me

1093
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,628
(horn honks)

1094
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,799
Hey Spence, I've got a package for you

1095
01:12:19,154 --> 01:12:19,634
Relax buddy

1096
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,046
Try a little decaf

1097
01:12:21,079 --> 01:12:22,836
Come on around the other side for me.

1098
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:33,484
I think it's that back ordered fabric from Tuscan

1099
01:12:33,485 --> 01:12:36,306
Sure took its sweet time in getting here huh?
<Yeah>

1100
01:12:40,842 --> 01:12:42,248
I just need your signature on the top there

1101
01:12:43,282 --> 01:12:45,088
Pen?
<Oh yeah>

1102
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,207
I think I got him

1103
01:13:16,241 --> 01:13:17,581
Yeah you got him

1104
01:13:17,616 --> 01:13:21,141
Oh God,
I'm glad you're okay

1105
01:13:21,174 --> 01:13:23,948
God look at the windshield
You must have really pissed him off

1106
01:13:35,614 --> 01:13:38,408
Is anyone...
Not trying to kill me?

1107
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,302
Thanks

1108
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:22,554
Let's go steal a car

1109
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:28,685
So what do we do now?

1110
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,777
I don't know

1111
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:34,855
Maybe some couples councilling

1112
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:38,451
No

1113
01:14:38,485 --> 01:14:39,597
Now

1114
01:14:39,631 --> 01:14:41,843
Spencer
What to we do? Right now.

1115
01:14:41,876 --> 01:14:42,766
Right now
Right

1116
01:14:42,799 --> 01:14:46,264
Right now we're going to go to the house. I've got a 
Go bag. We've got money,weapons, passports. We're set

1117
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:49,658
Why exactly do we have a go bag
Spencer?

1118
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:50,930
Did you know this was going to happen?

1119
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:53,373
No.
I didn't know

1120
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:54,953
You're lying

1121
01:14:54,987 --> 01:14:56,670
You are lying

1122
01:14:56,704 --> 01:14:58,707
Am I telling you everything?
-No.

1123
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,832
I'm not telling you everything
-Okay

1124
01:14:59,866 --> 01:15:02,221
But we're married
That's what married people do honey.

1125
01:15:02,254 --> 01:15:06,179
They lie to each other. 
They tell people things that aren't true to keep them

1126
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:11,795
Safe. And to protect one another when they ask things like
If they have their Mother's arms

1127
01:15:14,111 --> 01:15:16,043
Not that you have your Mother's arms
I'm not...

1128
01:15:16,076 --> 01:15:18,755
You lie to me. <No I Didn't> The first time
We met. < No I Didn't!>

1129
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,855
Unless your Dad is a Russian pervert?

1130
01:15:20,889 --> 01:15:22,706
Well I came clean about that

1131
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:23,572
You didn't

1132
01:15:23,605 --> 01:15:25,106
You did not come clean

1133
01:15:25,139 --> 01:15:27,675
Did too. <No you didn't> I told you...
I can't help that you were sleeping.

1134
01:15:27,709 --> 01:15:29,766
I didn't know that you sleep like a dead person

1135
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:33,315
<Come on!> For all I know
You heard everything I said.

1136
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:34,718
Based on what?

1137
01:15:34,752 --> 01:15:36,874
Based on... Your leg....
Was twitching

1138
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,264
God you know this is perfect
This is just perfect

1139
01:15:39,297 --> 01:15:43,192
You couldn't have been just hiding Tranny porn in the 
Crawlspace like Suzy Pratt's husand Murray?

1140
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:46,076
Really?
Murray?

1141
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:49,455
No no no no you...
Had to be a spy

1142
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:53,676
I can't believe I married a spy.
What am I? Pussy Galore?

1143
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,602
(chuckles)
Not that I know of.

1144
01:15:55,637 --> 01:15:56,968
Excuse me?

1145
01:15:57,002 --> 01:16:00,329
You're going to complain now about our sex life?
Is that what you're doing?

1146
01:16:00,363 --> 01:16:01,754
I'm not going to complain about our sex...
<That's what you're going to do now?>

1147
01:16:01,788 --> 01:16:04,412
Pull the car over!
We'll have sex right now!

1148
01:16:04,445 --> 01:16:06,574
No! We're going to my parents
We are going to my parents!

1149
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:07,961
<No No>
I'm taking us to my parents house Yes!

1150
01:16:07,994 --> 01:16:09,350
We are not going to your parents house

1151
01:16:09,383 --> 01:16:10,660
Yes we are
I said YES!

1152
01:16:10,693 --> 01:16:11,914
Listen to me

1153
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:14,820
We can not go to your parents
You have to trust me

1154
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:16,982
I love you

1155
01:16:17,017 --> 01:16:23,299
And I will protect you. Now you did a great job of
Finding a car. I need you to point it at the house and

1156
01:16:23,332 --> 01:16:24,734
Step on it

1157
01:16:24,768 --> 01:16:27,011
Okay
-Fine

1158
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,682
I'm stepping on it and it's not...

1159
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,712
It's not going...It's

1160
01:16:33,745 --> 01:16:34,957
Stopping actually
It's starting to...

1161
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:36,219
Not go.

1162
01:16:55,245 --> 01:16:57,819
Didn't notice the uhh...
Blinking fuel light?

1163
01:16:57,853 --> 01:16:59,738
You're right

1164
01:16:59,772 --> 01:17:03,325
I apologize. Topping off the tank
Should have been my first priority

1165
01:17:09,575 --> 01:17:10,105
Run

1166
01:17:22,593 --> 01:17:23,075
Go!

1167
01:17:31,936 --> 01:17:32,786
Darn It!

1168
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:40,331
It's locked
<Stop pulling it!>

1169
01:17:41,363 --> 01:17:42,478
I missed..

1170
01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:44,570
Really?

1171
01:17:57,113 --> 01:17:59,832
20 Million!!!
<You got him sweetie>

1172
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:14,122
God those Volvo's are amazing

1173
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:21,111
Shit!
<The block party >

1174
01:18:21,145 --> 01:18:23,486
Stay close
Keep moving

1175
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:34,812
Walnut muffin?

1176
01:18:58,507 --> 01:18:59,823
Hi guys! Spence Spence
Jen Jen

1177
01:18:59,855 --> 01:19:02,150
Jen Jen
Where are you guys going?

1178
01:19:02,184 --> 01:19:05,547
They've got corn dogs
The've got regular. And they've got bacon covered

1179
01:19:05,581 --> 01:19:08,858
Honey!
There's no wat she's packing heat

1180
01:19:08,891 --> 01:19:10,474
You'd be surprised where people hide stuff

1181
01:19:11,507 --> 01:19:13,823
Guys can I use the bathroom in you house?

1182
01:19:14,857 --> 01:19:15,906
Number one.

1183
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:18,821
Where is the go bag?
In the office

1184
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:23,737
Stay away from the windows. The safe is underneath
The carpet and the combination's our anniversary

1185
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:25,071
Where are you going?

1186
01:19:25,104 --> 01:19:26,294
To get the guns.

1187
01:19:27,738 --> 01:19:29,115
Oh, to get the guns
More guns

1188
01:19:29,148 --> 01:19:30,356
That's great

1189
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,539
Rotilda Walfredsson?

1190
01:19:58,572 --> 01:20:00,881
Ooh, 
I'm Swedish

1191
01:20:07,483 --> 01:20:08,045
Spence?

1192
01:20:09,876 --> 01:20:10,974
Spencer
Is that you?

1193
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:24,918
Spence?

1194
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:28,774
Spencer
Is that you?

1195
01:20:35,746 --> 01:20:36,318
Oh God!

1196
01:20:36,351 --> 01:20:37,817
Mom.

1197
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:40,740
Hey, You know,.. 
It is actually not a great time.

1198
01:20:40,774 --> 01:20:42,032
You think?

1199
01:20:46,933 --> 01:20:47,611
Kristen?

1200
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:50,782
You know...
That actually kind of makes sense

1201
01:20:50,816 --> 01:20:53,632
(laughter)  Lower your gun!
Or it's last call for Mommy.

1202
01:21:19,727 --> 01:21:21,166
I told you
She's not a nice girl

1203
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,003
You told her that?

1204
01:21:22,037 --> 01:21:23,090
That's very rude

1205
01:21:28,219 --> 01:21:29,374
God damn it!
Who is up there?

1206
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:29,890
I don't know.

1207
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:32,458
If somebody shoots Mr. Perfect
Before I have the chance to...

1208
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:34,066
I will kill you both

1209
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,628
On principal
Lower your gun, Now!

1210
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:46,856
Check it out.

1211
01:22:01,841 --> 01:22:03,542
Just let my Mom go, okay
I am all the leverage you need

1212
01:22:03,575 --> 01:22:07,859
I didn't spend the last three years
Listening to you babble incessively

1213
01:22:07,892 --> 01:22:09,913
About your perfect little life

1214
01:22:09,946 --> 01:22:11,349
To F it all up now

1215
01:22:11,383 --> 01:22:13,917
So get in the living room
Both of you

1216
01:22:13,951 --> 01:22:15,694
Let's go

1217
01:22:17,377 --> 01:22:17,774
Let's go

1218
01:22:20,089 --> 01:22:20,822
Turn around

1219
01:22:20,856 --> 01:22:21,579
Come here dear

1220
01:22:21,612 --> 01:22:22,510
Come on

1221
01:22:25,614 --> 01:22:27,238
You okay? 
Are you all right?

1222
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:28,631
Jen

1223
01:22:28,665 --> 01:22:30,684
To be fair
We did have some good times

1224
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,100
Yeah

1225
01:22:32,101 --> 01:22:36,798
Remember when...
(gunshots)

1226
01:22:36,799 --> 01:22:37,784
Oh, there you are dear.

1227
01:22:37,785 --> 01:22:40,103
(cell phone ringing)

1228
01:22:42,104 --> 01:22:42,967
Answer the phone sir

1229
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,359
My dead best friend wants to let you know
That your target's still alive

1230
01:22:47,392 --> 01:22:49,758
Stand down Spencer

1231
01:22:49,792 --> 01:22:51,359
Whoa, hey...
Guys

1232
01:22:51,392 --> 01:22:53,171
He killed Holbrook

1233
01:22:53,204 --> 01:22:55,059
Two to the heart
One to the head. Remember?

1234
01:22:59,924 --> 01:23:01,225
And then he pulled the trigger on me

1235
01:23:03,644 --> 01:23:04,556
Daddy
Is that true?

1236
01:23:04,589 --> 01:23:08,578
I put sleepers in your life
Because I didn't trust your husband

1237
01:23:08,611 --> 01:23:10,808
I hoped I'd never have to use it

1238
01:23:12,572 --> 01:23:15,232
It's the flash drive from Holbrooks watch

1239
01:23:15,265 --> 01:23:17,579
It's all there
His old boss turned dirty.

1240
01:23:17,613 --> 01:23:21,280
 And in you office...
When I saw that card with his name on it.

1241
01:23:21,314 --> 01:23:24,399
I knew you were back in the game
And you were coming after me

1242
01:23:28,693 --> 01:23:30,173
So I activated the killers

1243
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:32,650
I'm not trying to kill you sir.

1244
01:23:32,684 --> 01:23:35,017
Why don't you tell her about Nice
Where you tried to blow me up

1245
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:36,580
How did you know about Nice?

1246
01:23:36,614 --> 01:23:38,535
I was supposed to be on that helicopter

1247
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:41,147
When I saw you
I didn't go

1248
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:49,263
You said you got out when we met in France
You said you were in the love bubble.

1249
01:23:49,296 --> 01:23:50,049
I got out

1250
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,675
I'm out

1251
01:23:51,709 --> 01:23:53,428
Just look at him
Does he look like he's out?

1252
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:54,821
It was my last job

1253
01:23:54,855 --> 01:23:57,290
I'm out
I got out

1254
01:23:58,943 --> 01:23:59,817
For us

1255
01:24:02,421 --> 01:24:03,555
And I'm never going back

1256
01:24:18,283 --> 01:24:19,038
So..

1257
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:20,636
You are not a pilot.

1258
01:24:23,695 --> 01:24:28,978
Daddy enough, put your gun down. I have been dodging
Bullets all day thanks to you and it is not good for the baby

1259
01:24:29,011 --> 01:24:30,070
You have a baby?

1260
01:24:30,104 --> 01:24:31,210
No
I'm going to

1261
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:32,364
Ohh!!
I knew it

1262
01:24:32,398 --> 01:24:33,952
(laughter)
Let's celebrate

1263
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:35,250
I'm going to be a Grandpa?

1264
01:24:35,282 --> 01:24:36,238
Yes

1265
01:24:41,129 --> 01:24:41,382
Oh God!

1266
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:45,565
Oh my God

1267
01:24:47,022 --> 01:24:47,764
And you are the father?

1268
01:24:47,798 --> 01:24:49,498
Oh for God's sakes Dad

1269
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:00,387
Okay

1270
01:25:00,421 --> 01:25:01,467
Okay

1271
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,391
This would be a great time for a trust circle

1272
01:25:03,425 --> 01:25:04,684
A trust circle?

1273
01:25:04,717 --> 01:25:06,302
Yes

1274
01:25:06,335 --> 01:25:09,263
Let's do that okay

1275
01:25:09,297 --> 01:25:11,340
Let's gather everybody
Dad, pull up a chair

1276
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:12,255
Mother
Join us

1277
01:25:12,288 --> 01:25:13,510
O...kay

1278
01:25:13,543 --> 01:25:15,925
Okay

1279
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:17,380
I don't do 
Trust circles

1280
01:25:17,414 --> 01:25:19,945
I know Mother, But I think that this is
Neccesary. Humour me.

1281
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:21,139
Okay

1282
01:25:21,173 --> 01:25:23,183
I finally understand

1283
01:25:23,216 --> 01:25:26,510
That I am not to blame
For this dynamic, okay?

1284
01:25:26,543 --> 01:25:27,716
You are

1285
01:25:27,749 --> 01:25:36,434
And you need to own that. I need to own the fact that I
Unwittingly married the one man who is exactly like my father

1286
01:25:37,923 --> 01:25:38,958
A liar

1287
01:25:38,992 --> 01:25:40,210
So...

1288
01:25:40,244 --> 01:25:45,071
If any of you want to ever see this kid.
This is what's going to happen

1289
01:25:45,105 --> 01:25:45,992
Okay

1290
01:25:46,025 --> 01:25:48,822
There will be
No more lying

1291
01:25:48,856 --> 01:25:51,272
No more..
Stealing cars or...

1292
01:25:51,305 --> 01:25:52,937
Hiding weapons in the furniture

1293
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:56,167
And I never want to see you two try to kill each other again
Okay, In fact...

1294
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,671
There will be no more killing

1295
01:25:57,705 --> 01:26:00,250
I don't want to see you swat a fucking fly!

1296
01:26:00,283 --> 01:26:00,829
Okay

1297
01:26:00,863 --> 01:26:01,783
All Right

1298
01:26:01,817 --> 01:26:03,707
Are we all together on this?

1299
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:04,239
Yeah...

1300
01:26:04,273 --> 01:26:05,147
Great job baby

1301
01:26:07,768 --> 01:26:09,041
Is there anything else?

1302
01:26:09,075 --> 01:26:12,067
That I need to
Or should know

1303
01:26:13,716 --> 01:26:14,009
Anyone

1304
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:16,213
Spencer

1305
01:26:18,246 --> 01:26:20,529
English is not my first language

1306
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:24,818
(speaking Japanese)

1307
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:36,256
Oh. Oh. And also...
The third week that we were together

1308
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:38,386
You said I love you

1309
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:45,986
In your sleep. And I didn't tell you because I wanted
To be the one who said it first.

1310
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,649
So...

1311
01:26:51,751 --> 01:26:52,244
Thank you honey

1312
01:26:54,406 --> 01:26:55,077
Mom?

1313
01:26:58,345 --> 01:27:03,606
Dear. You remember that time that, I took you and
Your little friend for a boat ride?

1314
01:27:04,988 --> 01:27:05,351
No

1315
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,418
No?

1316
01:27:07,142 --> 01:27:09,472
Well forget it then
We're good

1317
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:12,409
Okay

1318
01:27:12,443 --> 01:27:15,306
Okay
Fine

1319
01:27:15,593 --> 01:27:19,344
In addition to planting killers in your life
And secrectly working for a government agency

1320
01:27:19,377 --> 01:27:21,443
I would like to admit

1321
01:27:22,444 --> 01:27:24,000
(knock on door)

1322
01:27:25,001 --> 01:27:27,876
Yoo Hoo!

1323
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:30,674
Jen!

1324
01:27:30,707 --> 01:27:34,993
We need to talk about that darn property line

1325
01:27:35,026 --> 01:27:38,004
(laughter)
(friendly) Hi Jen...

1326
01:27:44,012 --> 01:27:44,426
Sweetie?

1327
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,366
I don't think she was a killer

1328
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:47,584
Oh, I know

1329
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:56,990
Red wire crosses blue
Good as new

1330
01:27:57,024 --> 01:28:00,260
Blue crosses red. Good as dead
I know. It's my saying

1331
01:28:00,293 --> 01:28:02,701
That's not your saying, That's my saying
You copied me.

1332
01:28:02,734 --> 01:28:05,506
I did not copy...
I have not copied you a day in my life

1333
01:28:06,843 --> 01:28:07,507
Really?

1334
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:09,000
I think it's coming in nice
Don't you?

1335
01:28:09,222 --> 01:28:10,544
No.

1336
01:28:12,545 --> 01:28:13,564
Well he likes it.

1337
01:28:13,598 --> 01:28:14,685
Don't you buddy?

1338
01:28:14,718 --> 01:28:19,074
You like Daddy's mustache don't you?
Don't you like that mustache?

1339
01:28:19,107 --> 01:28:20,400
How's my little big guy doing?

1340
01:28:20,433 --> 01:28:24,910
Great. Except for your Dad thinks I'm copying him which I'm not
Will you please tell him I'm not copying him.

1341
01:28:24,944 --> 01:28:27,534
(laughter) Sorry sweetie
Every girl marrys her Father

1342
01:28:27,567 --> 01:28:29,133
Oh that's not gross

1343
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:30,525
I certainly did

1344
01:28:30,558 --> 01:28:32,419
Oh my Father was one handsome man.

1345
01:28:32,453 --> 01:28:36,754
Well built,.. Rippling muscles.
His mustache was a lot larger than yours though

1346
01:28:36,788 --> 01:28:39,969
Thick! like a Vulcan forest
<Well that's nice mother>

1347
01:28:40,003 --> 01:28:43,161
But you're here to babysit, not creep me out
So if you wouldn't mind <baby coos>

1348
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:44,291
Oh Hi!

1349
01:28:46,451 --> 01:28:47,947
Yeah 
Grandma's a little scary

1350
01:28:51,322 --> 01:28:53,482
Maybe it's too soon.
Maybe we should just stay

1351
01:28:53,515 --> 01:28:56,238
No no. It's not too soon
We're not staying. It's date night

1352
01:28:56,272 --> 01:28:58,539
We're going to go out. It's going to be great.
I'm wearing my skinny jeans

1353
01:28:58,573 --> 01:29:00,658
Don't worry Spencer
You can trust us

1354
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:07,099
If we can't trust them
Who can we trust right?

1355
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:08,223
Right

1356
01:29:08,414 --> 01:29:15,903
Bye Buddy!
