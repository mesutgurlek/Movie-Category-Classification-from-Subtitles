checking out equipment?

1123
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,685
Dude, you heard the cop.
It's up to us to get this guy.

1124
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,171
He is the devil's nephew.

1125
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,606
We're not going near that guy!

1126
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,611
So let me get this straight.

1127
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,410
You finally meet
a girl that you like...

1128
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,285
and she likes you, and then
some douchebag comes around...

1129
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,370
and says that you
can't be with her...

1130
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,568
and your first
thought is to run away?

1131
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,410
Yes. He said
he would kill me.

1132
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,295
I'm not gonna let
you run away, man.

1133
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,321
(SCOFFS)

1134
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,855
You know what?

1135
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,927
What?

1136
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,655
You wanna know
what people say about you?

1137
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,808
I know what they say.

1138
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,730
But I haven't felt like
this in a long time.

1139
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,724
I'm good at this.

1140
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,447
I need you, man.
I need you to...

1141
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,323
I need you to
believe in me, man.

1142
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,930
Please.

1143
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,325
I'm in.

1144
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,001
(CHUCKLES)

1145
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,495
Were you about to cry?

1146
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,681
Yeah, I don't
wanna talk about it.

1147
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,535
I got misty, my heart
started pumping fast.

1148
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,880
So how are we
gonna find this guy?

1149
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,531
This is it.

1150
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,842
God, I'm getting good
at this detective stuff.

1151
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,843
Is that why you're
wearing that suit?

1152
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,525
Oh, yeah, I got promoted.

1153
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,251
You promoted yourself again?

1154
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,611
Yeah. I'm a detective.

1155
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,720
JUSTIN: What do you think
they're doing in there?

1156
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,161
I don't know, man. Something
shady, that's for sure.

1157
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,129
Let's see if we can get
inside and open those doors.

1158
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,495
Let's see if we don't do that.

1159
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,601
Listen, Chang...

1160
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,121
you've gotta stop
being such a pussy, okay?

1161
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,441
Yeah, no shit.

1162
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,815
Dude...

1163
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,080
I will whoop your little ass.

1164
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,486
You will not touch his ass.
I will hit him.

1165
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,681
(SLAPS)

1166
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,970
Don't you fucking hit me.

1167
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,921
Don't!

1168
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,495
Oh, perfect.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1170
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,120
If I wasn't involved in a case
right now, I would light you up.

1171
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,325
That right there, that apartment,
that's our vantage point.

1172
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,244
But somebody lives in there.

1173
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,360
Justin, then they
better have good food...

1174
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,650
because they're about to be
involved in their first stakeout!

1175
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,415
No.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

RYAN: Police business,
open up now.

1178
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,961
Hi.

1179
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,931
Hi.

1180
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,840
You are a fox, aren't you?

1181
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,325
Detective?

1182
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,925
Absolutely, that's my title.

1183
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,167
Dude.

1184
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,122
Uh, ma'am, we're gonna need to come inside
and talk to you for a minute, please.

1185
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,964
Oh.
RYAN: All right.

1186
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,615
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

1187
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,641
Oh, yeah.

1188
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,484
It smells like
a fish farted in here.

1189
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,090
Look at that bald one.
He looks super racist.

1190
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,208
Like he snores
the "N" word at night.

1191
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,560
I've seen every cop show ever.

1192
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,001
I'm so excited we're going
to be doing this together.

1193
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,446
Yeah.

1194
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,615
Just so we're clear, there's
no "we" in this situation.

1195
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,775
Don't be a dick.

1196
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,165
I can still be a part of
the team though, right?

1197
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,481
Absolutely.
No.

1198
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,855
Also, I'm not on ecstasy.

1199
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,095
No way.

1200
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,441
I've had some very
dramatic relationships.

1201
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,690
My therapist says I need
to meet a more stable guy.

1202
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,731
I love a man in uniform.

1203
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,530
You do?

1204
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,091
Sure.
I don't like this.

1205
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,920
I did a three-way once
with two paramedics.

Ma'am, I'm going to need
you to go to your room.

All right.
Alone.

You do not know
what vibage is, pal.

Why would you do that?

I think she's an interesting lady and
she's got a lot to offer this team.

We are doing surveillance.
We don't have time.

Who is that?

1217
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,484
I think he's the boss.

1218
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,801
Take photos of his henchmen.

1219

I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need some help.

It's my bubble bath.

1223
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,170
It's not wet enough.

1224
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,855
No.

Yes. That's our

We would love to help you,
ma'am, but we can't...

1228

because we're on a case and
we take our job seriously.

And you're not going to do
shit with it until I say so.

This is the shipment.
This is our evidence.

JUSTIN: How do you know that?

1245
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,809
Because it's a cargo van,
and these are all bad guys.

So?

1250
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,450
They tell me their badge
numbers don't match up.

1251
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,571
Which tells me one thing.
They're not LAPD.

Oh, we're dead.

1253
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,121
So, what are they?

1254
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,001
Feds, ATF, maybe a special unit.

1255
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,841
What?

1256

1268
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,771
Now what's in those crates?

1269
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,241
I'm seeing it the same time you're
seeing it. How would I know that?

1270
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,641
I need to narrate it, because that's
what you do in these situations.

1271
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,643
You see something and one of
the guys says it out loud.

1272
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,724
And the other guy, you, is
supposed to go, "Yeah."

1273
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,287
RYAN: Oh, shit, dude. We gotta
know what's inside those crates.

1274
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,090
JUSTIN: So, what do we do now?

1275
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,361
Joey, watch the fort.

1276
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,567
Where are you going?

1277
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,051
Wait a minute, actually.

1278
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,535
Oh...

Lil Wayne!

01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,650
He made a joke about Lil Wayne!

1438
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,331
Oh, shit! That's funny.

Hey, Josie, I gotta say
you're one heck of an artist.

Thank you.
PUPA: You're fine, too, girl.

Yeah, she's pretty.

1442

Josie, Josie,
look at me. Look at me.

1443
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,162
Don't do intense right now.
Okay.

You're crazy fine,
that's all I'm saying.

I wouldn't, though,
is what I'm saying.

1448

I promise it's going to be okay.

1449
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,840
I mean, I would like
to take off your dress...

1450
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,255
and put my penis inside of you.

1451
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,487
I'd really like to
get all up in that shit.

No, like in her vagina, though.

RYAN: I know, but you can't say that.
Appreciate it.

1454
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,615
I wouldn't put it in your butt.

JOSIE: I gotta go.
PUPA: And a good day to you, <i>madame.</i>

1456
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,720
Do you think I could put "Undercover sting
operation for the LAPD" on my resume?

1457
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,881
Absolutely.

Did you see when I said

That was sweet.

Here you go, buddy.

1461

What if I start sweating, dude?

1462
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,655
These tattoos are
gonna run down my face.

1463
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,681
Then don't sweat.

1464
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,444
What do you mean, "Don't
sweat?" I'm not doing this.

1465
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,125
Why you got to be such a bitch?

1466

Pupa, don't call me a bitch.

1467

You made such a cool game. If you
make it, then you got to play it.

I've been saying
that this whole time.

You made such a cool game, (CHANGES
ACCENT) now you gotta play it.

What are you doing

What are you
doing with your voice?

1472
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,575
I was agreeing with you.

1473
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,726
But you have an accent.

1474
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,809
I know you are agreeing with me,
but you're saying it like I was.

1475
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,885
What I'm saying is, you made a
great game and I believe in you.

1476
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,361
So, now, you just gotta

All right, dude.
Feel free to rob him.

1478

Oh, boy. He can't hear you. I'm just
going to ignore him from now on.

What does that mean?

1486
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,241
It means, "Suck my balls
and cock, you cocksucker."

Yeah, just say that.

recognize that you're not me...

cut your face off!

I've got to take my teeth out.

1588
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,001
I gotta take the hat off.

1589
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,165
I gotta take this thing off my ear.

I can't stop twitching.

1596
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,330
Okay, just don't think about it.
It's a mind thing.

Come on, J.

1599
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,690
I'm so scared.
Hold my hand.

1600
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,445
I'm not holding your hand.

1601
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,122
Dude, I think I'm
addicted to crystal meth.

1602
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,281
You just smoked it once.

1603
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,490
Oh, my God. I would suck
dick for this high.

You've got to be kidding.

1605
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,255
I wouldn't, but what if I do?

1606
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,691
I don't want to suck dick.

1607

gonna get good at it.

We should build a porch!

01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,885
Right now! That'd be great.
Right.

at woodwork or anything...

This is actual SWAT gear, man.

1636

Let's be real. We're never
gonna build a porch.

We're just lying
to ourselves, man.

I just want to die, dude.

on with you, man?

getting so scary.

are you going? Wait up.

It leads to Georgie's.

Oh.

1682
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,761
That's why he
wants Georgie's so bad.

1683
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,048
It's not about money laundering.
It's about having control...

of both ends of the tunnel.

Why?

at this that it's scary.

Where are you going with that?

To the police station,
to turn it in.

Why are you
getting so pissed off?

1701

Because I almost died in there!

1702

That's not funny!
All right.

1705
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,975
And for what? So you could
have some self-worth for once?

1706
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,128
Where is this coming from, man?

1707
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,807
I didn't do this for my
self-worth or whatever!

1708
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,731
I did it to get a guy like
Mossi off the streets...

1709
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,055
and we're going to!

anytime anything
in your life gets tough!

1712
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,323
And maybe that's why
you're still nowhere.

1713
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,962
Oh, I'm still nowhere? Me?

1714

Yeah, you.

around for 8 years!

you're going right now.

You screwed yourself.

responsibility for once.

Why don't you act
like a man for once,

like the way it feels.

Everyone was right about you.
