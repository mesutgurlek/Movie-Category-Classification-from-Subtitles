1
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,991
You know the girl.

2
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:53,135
Your first real vision of beauty.

3
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:56,274
The one that all other girls
have to measure up to.

4
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:59,672
Class, we have a new student today.

5
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:01,676
Her name is Cristabel.

6
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:04,247
Everyone say hi to Cristabel.

7
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:07,044
Hi, Cristabel.

8
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:10,720
The heavens opened.

9
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,219
And that was it.

10
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,794
The moment l first fell in love.

11
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,466
You know the girl.

12
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,325
The one you run to so you can

13
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,062
breathlessly declare
your undying love.

14
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:07,346
But things don't always work out
the way you think they will...

15
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,605
...when you're six years old.

16
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,526
She cries at commercials by AT&T.

17
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:25,822
She sobs at the videos on MTV.

18
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:29,695
But she says it's got nothing
to do with me...

19
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:33,667
She's just an emotional girl.

20
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:37,468
She rips off my suits and
cuts off the sleeves.

21
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:41,203
And shaves my head while
l'm fast asleep.

22
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:43,939
Sometimes l feel
she's the princess

23
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:47,381
and l'm just the pea...

24
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:51,885
And she's just an emotional girl.

25
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,355
Just an emotional...

26
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:55,686
You want the guitar?

27
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:08,704
ls...is everything okay...honey?

28
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,534
You just don't get it, do you.

29
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:11,835
l don't know.

30
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:16,014
Your songs, which suck,
by the way...

31
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:18,307
Are always about things l did.

32
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,746
They're not about you being
in love with me.

33
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:24,821
They're always about lalalalala
Jane shaved my head.

34
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:26,786
But you did.

35
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:27,890
And it's fine.

36
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,595
We can laugh about it now,
sweetie.

37
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,889
Why do you think
l spray painted your car?

38
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,894
And l know this one.

39
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,936
Because you were mad?

40
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:42,305
l'm leaving....

41
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:45,802
And l'm taking my drawer.

42
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:49,173
Fuck this.

43
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,247
For all l've put up with,

44
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:54,044
l seem to deserve better
than this.

45
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,216
Jane...okay, okay, um...

46
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,387
-Listen, listen, listen...
-What?

47
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:08,424
Are you going to keep
the actual drawer?

48
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:11,068
-You're an asshole!
-No. Okay, okay, okay.

49
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:12,236
You can keep it.

50
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,906
l just don't know what to do
with the rest of it

51
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,437
Come on.

52
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:21,107
Okay...Jane, you see?

53
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,244
l came all the way
down the stairs.

54
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,185
Stop. Please, please,
please stop. Wait.

55
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:35,360
Let's talk.

56
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:39,497
This is not talking.

57
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:50,466
You don't know what it's
like to be in love with someone

58
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,577
for years and
have absolutely no idea

59
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:55,747
if they're ever
going to love you back.

60
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:07,891
You're a loser, Nate Cooper.

61
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,397
And that's when it hit me.

62
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,625
Yes, she may have overreacted...

63
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:16,631
But Jane was right.

64
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:20,235
No other girl would ever
make me happy.

65
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,778
Cristabel Abbott was the one.

66
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:45,894
But how could l have known the
hurdles l would have to overcome.

67
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,268
l have a valentine for you
in my backpack.

68
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:56,371
We just haven't had a chance to
give ours out yet.

69
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:04,677
l knew l had to find her.

70
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:07,519
And l knew just who to go to.

71
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,789
My best friend from first grade.

72
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:16,587
Who shared in the glories
that were Cristabel

73
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:18,990
and the art of nose picking.

74
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,364
Arno Blount.

75
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,465
Are you tired of doing
hundreds of ab exercises...

76
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,637
and not getting the flat
stomach you want?

77
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:27,601
Well, it's time to stop, America...

78
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,331
Because you've been
going the wrong way.

79
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:31,202
That's right, America.

80
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,275
You've been going the wrong way.

81
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:35,481
Now there's my Ab Away Pro System.

82
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:37,774
Designed with reverse ab action.

83
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:38,813
The fastest, easiest way
to have firm, flat abs.

84
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:40,485
lt's all the same.

85
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:45,084
My Arno just loves holiday candies.

86
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,656
So we stock them up year round.

87
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:49,521
They make me feel happy.

88
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:53,161
Can l get you a Courvasier

89
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,459
or cocoa?

90
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,801
No thank you, Ms. Blount.

91
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:00,471
l'm fine.

92
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,265
So you got a degree
in art history, huh?

93
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,739
Uh...yeah.

94
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,446
That means unemployed, right?

95
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,341
-Pretty much, yeah.
-Cool.

96
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:11,413
Means a lot more time to hang, huh?

97
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:15,719
-Okay.
-So, you want to know

98
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:18,321
what happened to Cristabel Abbott.

99
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:20,321
Well, yeah.

100
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,721
Well, l'm curious to know

101
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:25,089
how everyone's doing
after all these years.

102
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,561
Everyone...Right.

103
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,232
Well, my friend, you came
to the right place.

104
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:34,463
Wow, that's Cristabel?

105
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:35,731
-Yep.
-You know,

106
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,808
"cause usually 13's a bad age.

107
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:43,175
From the first grade on,
she just got hotter every year.

108
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:46,341
That's weird.

109
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:50,081
Dear lord...Oh God.

110
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:52,723
-ls that...uh...
-June Phigg.

111
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:54,491
The nottie.

112
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:56,919
Ooh...nottie?

113
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,494
lt's a very well known
law of physics.

114
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,790
The hotness of one girl is
directly proportional

115
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:03,093
to the ugliness of
her best friend.

116
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,666
Wow. June Phigg.

117
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:10,000
lt's sort of sweet they've
stayed friends all these years.

118
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:11,232
Sweet?

119
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:15,379
She's like some hideous dragon
guarding the princess from escape.

120
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,222
What?

121
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,055
ln order to
gain access to the hottie

122
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,727
The nottie must be appeased.

123
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,793
You're saying
that June is the reason

124
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,259
why Cristabel's still single?

125
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:34,693
Of course she is!

126
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:37,767
That, my friend,
is the whole purpose of the nottie.

127
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:40,666
Cristabel Abbott is the hottest
woman in Los Angeles.

128
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:42,568
But no man will ever win her heart

129
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,039
without getting past
that monstrosity.

130
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,873
And she will destroy you.

131
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:54,182
No. No. This is fate.

132
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,583
Fate is the reason
she is still single.

133
00:08:57,824 --> 00:09:00,349
Look. l came 3000 miles
to get this girl

134
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:03,858
And it's going to take a lot more
than a June Phigg to stop me.

135
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:06,925
l like your moxie.

136
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,758
Yeah? Good.

137
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:11,033
You're gonna
need to see the file.

138
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,498
Ma!

139
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:13,967
Bring out the file!

140
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,834
Coming, precious.

141
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,672
She loves it.

142
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,872
The hottie and her every move.

143
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,609
This whole thing is about
Cristabel Abbott?

144
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:27,217
You should see the website.

145
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:30,247
Now, according to my records

146
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,516
She has a two mile jog every
morning past the Santa Monica pier.

147
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,352
She stops
at Danny's Beachside Cafe

148
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:38,428
for a light breakfast of ice
buttered mocha and fruit salad.

149
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:43,499
She'll pass the north end of the
pier between 6:15 and 6:18 a.m.

150
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:46,899
Benches that face the ocean are
the best ones to view her from.

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,937
"Cause if you face the other way,
the sun gets in your eyes

152
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:50,836
..and you lose the whole thing.

153
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:33,075
Hey guys.

154
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,780
Here she comes.

155
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:51,766
Konichiwa. Good morning.

156
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:02,442
Hi guys.

157
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:04,172
l love you.

158
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,222
Good morning.

159
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:33,304
Oh my god, l'm so sorry.

160
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,505
Were you sniffing me?

161
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:37,812
Sorry.

162
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:41,519
Hey, aren't you Cristabel Abbott?

163
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:44,689
-Yeah.
-l think we went to school together.

164
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:46,482
Back in the first grade.

165
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,525
Were you that guy who used to
put Vienna sausage in his pants?

166
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:55,029
No. The guy with processed meats
that was Jay Gray.

167
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:00,038
You're not that kid who used to
stick pencils up his nose, are you?

168
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:01,433
No, that was my friend, Arno.

169
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:02,971
Nice guy.

170
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:10,575
lf we went to first grade together,
and Arno only had one friend...

171
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:15,517
You must be Nate Cooper.

172
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:24,323
l don't want to alarm you...

173
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:27,726
but there's
a really creepy albino guy

174
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,798
standing outside the window.

175
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:34,103
Oh, that's just my stalker,
Randy.

176
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,864
He's completely harmless.

177
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,736
Randall,
that better be 40 feet away.

178
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,980
So where were we?

179
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:46,582
Right. My job.

180
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:49,184
l work as an event planner for
this charity group...

181
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:53,153
which basically means l get to
throw fun parties for a good cause.

182
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:54,516
Cool.

183
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:59,560
And...l'm pregnant.

184
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,367
l'm not sure whose it is,
unfortunately.

185
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:06,067
Oh, l'm so sorry.

186
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,867
l'm kidding.

187
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:10,302
No kids, no boyfriend.

188
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:12,010
No action of any kind.

189
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:13,711
Oh, good.

190
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:15,780
Or not.

191
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:18,209
So what do you do now?

192
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:20,885
Or are you still into finger
painting and Smurfs.

193
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,179
No, no l um...

194
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:29,656
l'm a personal trainer.

195
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,458
You're a personal trainer.

196
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:34,697
Yeah.

197
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,192
Like a gym?

198
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:38,733
A lot of people mistake
personal fitness

199
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:41,496
for being brought up
with roid rage.

200
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,938
But who wants adult acne
and a shrunken penis.

201
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,439
Not me.

202
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:54,909
No, it's a mind, body,
spirit sort of lifestyle.

203
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:56,677
You are what you eat.

204
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,287
And whatnot.

205
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,082
You should check out my gym.

206
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:03,591
Actually, my roommate and l are
going there this afternoon for yoga.

207
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,729
So do you want to come?

208
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,957
Absolutely.

209
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,566
My roommate. lt's June.

210
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,797
From the first grade.

211
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:19,104
Wow...June...Yeah.

212
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:20,869
June's into heath.

213
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:22,102
She's a vegan.

214
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:24,646
Everything she eats is non-fat.

215
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:27,815
Oh...how delicious.

216
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:30,522
l'm so glad we ran into
each other, Nate.

217
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,355
Me too.

218
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,556
So the gym is at 6th and Ocean.

219
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:38,753
Here's my number
if you forget the address.

220
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,608
There. Now you can't lose it.

221
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:19,502
Hey, Cooper.

222
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,405
Hey.

223
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,309
You remember June.

224
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:36,449
Oh God...

225
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,256
Of course.

226
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:43,553
Yes. Who could forget the
lovely...June?

227
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:45,696
-Oh, Jeanette.
-How are you?

228
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,421
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

229
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,399
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

230
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:01,641
Sorry.

231
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,371
Nice.

232
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:08,351
June and l don't get much action,
so we take what we can get.

233
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:10,020
Grab a spot.

234
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:32,639
So Nate here has become a
personal trainer.

235
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:34,675
Oh, yeah. But you know what?

236
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:36,074
Enough about me.

237
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,648
June, what do you do?

238
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:42,052
June's a handler at the zoo.

239
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:43,755
That's great.

240
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:48,119
The only downside is l'm
constantly covered in hair.

241
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,189
Not that l don't already have
enough to begin with.

242
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,625
June has a lot of problems
with hair removal.

243
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,458
l have sensitive skin.

244
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:56,768
Oh.

245
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,936
l mean, l've tried it all...

246
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:04,475
Shaving, bumps and ingrown
hairs...Nair.

247
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,400
Nasty chemical reaction.

248
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:11,514
The only thing l can really do
is Joleen Cream---bleach.

249
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,478
You know what?

250
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:15,585
lf you hadn't said anything,
l wouldn't have noticed.

251
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,356
Uh, not that l've noticed now.

252
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,456
l'm not focusing on that at all.

253
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,788
lt's natural.

254
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,655
Everybody has it.

255
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:26,865
Everybody deals with it.

256
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,361
l've got hair.

257
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,064
Okay everyone.

258
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:33,465
Let's begin with
downward facing dog.

259
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:37,164
-Adamucha Svenasama.
-Shit.

260
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,554
All right.

261
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:04,127
And easing into cat pose.

262
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,863
And arching your back.

263
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,675
And moving into downward
facing dog.

264
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,717
Beautiful form, Cristabel.

265
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:42,763
Oh, that was amazing.

266
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:51,643
So, Cris,
now that l'm back in town

267
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:56,852
l thought it'd be wonderful
if maybe you and l could

268
00:18:57,189 --> 00:19:00,454
go out to dinner...maybe.

269
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:02,493
Yeah, that'd be fun.

270
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:03,717
Yeah?

271
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:06,328
But the timing's terrible.

272
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:09,930
Nate, it probably won't come as
a huge surprise to you...

273
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:12,862
But June's never had a boyfriend.

274
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,679
-No.
-Yeah.

275
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:28,346
And all through school,
l went out with any guy who asked.

276
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:31,088
l didn't know the meaning
of the word "no'.

277
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:34,119
Sounds like l shouldn't
have left town then.

278
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:38,354
That's why l made
a promise to myself.

279
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:40,292
l'm not going to date
anyone again

280
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:43,399
till June has someone special
in her life.

281
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:44,862
Wow.

282
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:48,335
That is...admirable.

283
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:55,476
But that could be a very,
very long time.

284
00:19:55,948 --> 00:20:01,045
lt's just...the hard part
is going without the sex.

285
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:05,648
Don't take it personally, Coopie.

286
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,619
You're a great guy.

287
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:10,187
And if things were different...

288
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:12,628
Who knows?

289
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,061
l gotta go.

290
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,301
But maybe l'll see you later.

291
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:23,200
-Yeah. l'll see you...later.
-Goodbye.

292
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:29,044
She's not only smoking hot...

293
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:31,545
She's also extremely horny.

294
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:35,652
And for some unknown reason,
l think she likes me.

295
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:38,316
l've got to find a guy for June.

296
00:20:38,557 --> 00:20:40,081
There's somebody out there
for her.

297
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,986
There's someone for everyone.

298
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,351
Boys!

299
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:46,364
Mom. Nate thinks he can
fix up the nottie.

300
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:49,457
She's got fur on her toes.

301
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:50,963
Mom!

302
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:54,969
l understand she has a little
problem with hair removal.

303
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:56,797
Has she tried the new lasers?

304
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,272
Worked great on my bikini line.

305
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:01,206
Grew back in like peach fuzz.

306
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:02,573
That's true.

307
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:04,080
But what are you going to do?

308
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:05,840
Laser her whole body?

309
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:06,880
l mean, you have any idea

310
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,643
what kind of radiation
that would entail?

311
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,821
What if l tell her that
she won a makeover?

312
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:13,850
Send her to a spa, pretty her up.

313
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:14,786
Somebody'll take her.

314
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:15,755
Please.

315
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:16,653
You want to flip this chick

316
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:19,090
you're gonna have to do a lot
more than just mow the lawn.

317
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:21,897
l got it!

318
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:26,069
What if l pay somebody
to go out with her?

319
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:28,333
Pause.

320
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:31,467
Look, you think l
haven't been trying?

321
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,199
All right.

322
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:33,911
This isn't about a single date.

323
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:36,478
This is about somebody special
in her life, okay?

324
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:38,876
And you ain't got that
kind of blood money, my man.

325
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:40,649
Arno.

326
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,379
The history of mankind
is filled with men saying

327
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:47,615
that something cannot be done.

328
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,957
who are frequently interrupted by
someone who is already doing it.

329
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,093
What does that even mean?

330
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:56,330
l don't know.

331
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:58,502
l saw it on your wall back there.

332
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:01,269
That is a beautiful blouse.

333
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:03,532
Thank you. l don't even know
what they're made of,

334
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:05,037
but they're wonderful.

335
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:08,246
Thanks. He's sweet.

336
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:16,448
The reason l asked you
to meet me here...

337
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:19,486
-And like l said...
-lt's not a date. l know.

338
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:23,627
l couldn't even think about
selfish desires like that.

339
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:28,196
l am just too concerned
about June.

340
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,468
You've really been thinking
about June.

341
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:32,226
Yeah.

342
00:22:34,273 --> 00:22:35,672
That's so sweet.

343
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:39,810
And l gotta tell you
l am sickened by the fact

344
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:42,343
that none of these narrow
minded assholes

345
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:45,345
can see how beautiful she is just

346
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,849
"cause they can't get past
some infected toenails

347
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:52,352
and some backne, you know.

348
00:22:52,591 --> 00:22:53,319
l know.

349
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,322
l feel the same way.

350
00:22:55,561 --> 00:23:01,932
And l think l have found
the perfect guy for her.

351
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,600
What's his name?

352
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:05,400
Who?

353
00:23:05,938 --> 00:23:08,566
The guy that's perfect for June.

354
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:09,805
That guy.

355
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,169
His name is...

356
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:17,315
Cole Slaw...son.

357
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:18,743
Cole Slawsen.

358
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:21,544
A good friend, of a friend.

359
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:22,845
And that guy's name is Mike.

360
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:25,249
All real.

361
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,720
So it's the four of us.

362
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:30,621
Wouldn't you consider
that a double date?

363
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,390
Well, we can throw
them in the pit together

364
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,624
and hope they come out alive.

365
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:43,101
Or we could lead them
into a friendship that

366
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:46,436
blossoms into a lifetime of love

367
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:50,011
lt would be a major step
if we could get her laid.

368
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:51,173
Right.

369
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:54,613
The whole lifetime of love
thing would just be a bonus.

370
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,650
lt's just that...she never has...

371
00:23:58,023 --> 00:24:03,859
And l think a life without orgasms
is like a world without flowers.

372
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,595
l couldn't agree with you more.

373
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:43,200
Yeah, l do. l do.

374
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:51,838
No. No. Go.

375
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:54,011
Ewww. Gross.

376
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,216
Other side.

377
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:04,378
Oh yeah.

378
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:09,187
Take it.

379
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,814
Okay, listen.

380
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:34,882
-No. No.
-Okay.

381
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,382
What if l were to tell you

382
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:38,145
that you could still
make the $500 bucks

383
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,258
but all you had to do was go out
on a few dates with a woman.

384
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,288
Does she have a vagina?

385
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:48,021
Yeah.

386
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:52,225
Actually, you're gonna have to
let me know if it goes that far?

387
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:57,898
ls this woman you in a dress?

388
00:25:58,143 --> 00:26:00,907
No. No. This is a real woman.

389
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:04,013
But l have to be honest.

390
00:26:04,249 --> 00:26:07,480
She's not necessarily pretty.

391
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,850
None of my girlfriends
have been pretty.

392
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:11,316
Good.

393
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,155
This is nice.

394
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:26,130
l'm gonna have her legs
behind her head.

395
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:27,804
Get her dude.

396
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,903
Oh, these are shoulder blades.

397
00:26:36,515 --> 00:26:38,312
l thought they were wings.

398
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,484
l noticed you from across the bar.

399
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:42,311
And do you know what the
first thing l thought was?

400
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:46,046
Her daddy must be a baker "cause
she's got such a nice set of buns?

401
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,758
Do you really think
that all it takes

402
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:51,656
is a few hair plugs
some porcelain veneers

403
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:56,129
$250 jeans...to impress a girl
like Cris?

404
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:58,235
Or didn't that occur to you

405
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,234
while you were schlepping away
your days at the Porsche dealership.

406
00:27:01,473 --> 00:27:03,839
to afford a few more of those
personal enhancements

407
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:04,598
Which, by the way,

408
00:27:04,843 --> 00:27:07,311
will never hide that you
haven't been laid by anybody

409
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:09,446
you haven't had to pay for
in over a year.

410
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:12,616
So why don't you and your starry
head full of doll's hair

411
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,319
take a little walk back to the bar,
have another shot of Jager

412
00:27:15,554 --> 00:27:19,285
And give my friend some space in
case a real man comes by, huh?

413
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,221
Who told you
l used to sell Porsches?

414
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:24,787
What?

415
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:29,424
What'd l tell you?

416
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:31,863
Pay our bar tab, bitch.

417
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:33,468
What did she say?

418
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:39,104
Oh god, they're here.

419
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:40,572
Oh my god, they're here.

420
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:42,074
God, l'm so nervous.

421
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:43,212
Don't be nervous.

422
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:44,938
Just do as l said.

423
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,115
Right.

424
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:47,682
Keep drinking.

425
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:50,987
Well that...and just be yourself.

426
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,251
-Okay?
-Okay.

427
00:27:55,193 --> 00:27:57,320
Steal yourself, Cole Slawsen.

428
00:27:57,562 --> 00:27:59,223
Oh, my name's not Cole Slawsen.

429
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:02,629
Oh...right.

430
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:03,766
Like l said,

431
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:06,470
-as long as she's female.
-Okay.

432
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:15,072
Oh my god, it has whiskers.

433
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:16,436
And no teeth.

434
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:17,113
Oh, no.

435
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,749
She has teeth.

436
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:22,112
They're just not
the conventional shade.

437
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,148
lt's fine. lt's fine.
's fine. Come on.

438
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:34,321
Hello, ladies.

439
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:38,928
Cole Slawsen,
this is Cristabel Abbott.

440
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:40,430
Hello.

441
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:45,265
And the lovely June Phigg.

442
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:46,869
Nice to meet you.

443
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:48,807
-lt speaks.
-She's a woman.

444
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:51,413
l can't do this
My dingus will fall off.

445
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,776
You were rolling down your
flesh files.

446
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:53,950
l want to be released
from my contract.

447
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:54,617
-ls it me?
-Sorry.

448
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:56,980
l'll triple your offer, Cole.

449
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:58,280
Fine.

450
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:01,788
We are too excited to do
this, girls.

451
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:04,819
Woo.

452
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:12,827
Now remember to stay focused,
okay?

453
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:15,369
lf you start to panic,
practice your breathing exercises.

454
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,302
And go into your tranquil haven.

455
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,881
l am a mighty warrior,
fearless and strong.

456
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:26,447
l admire your commitment
to excellence.

457
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:28,447
Now, where's that driver guy?

458
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:29,779
-Captain.
-Captain. Okay.

459
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:31,648
l told him to be here by three.

460
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,859
Ahoy! Sorry l'm late, folks.

461
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:37,254
Just had to grab my keys
from the rental office.

462
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:42,262
And l'm not feeling too well.

463
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,832
You're going to have to find
yourself another skipper.

464
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:46,827
Out of my way!

465
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:51,039
-Oh, shucks.
-No, no, no.

466
00:29:51,443 --> 00:29:53,968
Breathe. Look at the beauty.

467
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:55,804
Drink some of this.

468
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:58,743
Okay.

469
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:03,577
What we're going to do now is
what l like to call winging it.

470
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:04,811
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

471
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,455
We need you for the date.

472
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,486
Now this is
what l'm talking about.

473
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,198
Sun in my face, wind in my hair.

474
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:16,491
The smell of salt in the air.

475
00:30:17,402 --> 00:30:19,029
lsn't this great?

476
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:22,166
Magnificent.

477
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:27,608
Okay...June,
how's your toe doing?

478
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:30,871
lt's a lot better, thanks.

479
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:32,674
This guy l work with at the zoo.

480
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:33,975
He works with the gorillas.

481
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:37,552
He actually mixed up a compound for
a silverback who had the same thing.

482
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:40,849
Okay, anyone want another drink?

483
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,587
Yes, yes.

484
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:44,385
Absolutely.

485
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,334
Are you okay?

486
00:30:51,403 --> 00:30:52,631
Never better.

487
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:56,568
Cole has a little bit of
a problem with acid reflux.

488
00:30:56,808 --> 00:31:01,074
l also have irritable
bowel syndrome.

489
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,907
And involuntary
explosive diarrhea, so...

490
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:06,240
There it goes.

491
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:07,416
l think l need to be excused.

492
00:31:07,652 --> 00:31:08,448
-You know what? You shouldn't go.
-Yeah, l should.

493
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:09,345
You should probably stay around.

494
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:11,077
-No, l shouldn't.
-There's not even a bathroom close.

495
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:11,788
No, l can't do this.

496
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:12,455
Look at her.

497
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,247
No, no, no.

498
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:14,287
You're not going to go.

499
00:31:14,526 --> 00:31:15,788
You're not going anywhere.

500
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:20,796
You know what?

501
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,290
Let's play a game.

502
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:23,364
We're going to play a game.

503
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:24,568
lt's gonna be fun.

504
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,930
lf the two of you could go
anywhere in the world on a date

505
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:33,477
Where would it be?

506
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:34,369
Home.

507
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:35,044
Okay

508
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:35,875
You know... You know what?

509
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:37,312
This is a question for me.

510
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:38,982
Nate. l'll take this one.

511
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:44,284
lf Nate could go anywhere in
the world on a date.

512
00:31:45,123 --> 00:31:49,025
His dream date would be...Venice.

513
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:51,451
-Venice?
-Yeah.

514
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,527
That would be my dream date too.

515
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:54,857
Really?

516
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,100
Anywhere in particular?

517
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:59,266
No, nowhere really.

518
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:02,667
l just heard it was a great place
to get lost in.

519
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:08,006
Well, it's a gorgeous day out
and we're on this boat, so...

520
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:09,270
Let's go get some sun.

521
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:12,540
Let's do it...Cole Slawsen.

522
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:14,183
Get our tan up.

523
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,192
Breathe.

524
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:09,835
l got this.

525
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:14,172
l'm a mighty warrior.

526
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,909
Fearless and strong.

527
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,713
Come stop me.

528
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:22,512
Nate, good news.

529
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,346
l just my toenail.

530
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:46,109
You know, he's just cooling off.

531
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:48,278
The Coast Guard will
pick him up eventually.

532
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:06,991
This should cheer us up.

533
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:08,128
Good idea.

534
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:09,628
More alcohol.

535
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,266
That'll help.

536
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:17,172
Oh...dropped it.

537
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,472
Completely forgot l had this.

538
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:23,642
They were giving these out to all
the personal trainers in town.

539
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:25,473
Some sort of a promotion.

540
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:26,479
What is it?

541
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:30,745
Gift certificate to a chi-chi
Beverly Hills spa.

542
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:31,646
Ha. Look at that.

543
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,981
lt's for two people.

544
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:33,849
You know what?

545
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:35,286
The two of you
should really have this.

546
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:37,221
l mean,
l'm never going to use it.

547
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:41,830
Nate, this is for $2,000 worth
of spa treatments.

548
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,891
You don't say.

549
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:46,366
No, you and Cris should
go together.

550
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:48,434
l don't do well
with spa treatments

551
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:51,267
They tend to backfire.

552
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,875
That Cole was an idiot.

553
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:56,603
l saw plenty of other guys
checking you out.

554
00:34:57,515 --> 00:34:59,483
Stop it, Cris. Come on.

555
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,148
We both know the only
male attention l get...

556
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:04,855
...is when they crawl
over me to get to you.

557
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:07,990
What about that guy who gave
you his card at the mall last week?

558
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:09,716
He was a dermatologist.

559
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:12,953
Well, he did offer to remove
your mole for free.

560
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:13,686
That's cool

561
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:15,626
He could have been flirting.

562
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:20,532
l heard somewhere that 95 percent
of the way others see you

563
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,672
is the way you see yourself.

564
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:25,673
Stop being
so self conscious around guys.

565
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:27,204
What am l supposed to do?

566
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:28,912
Pretend they're all blind?

567
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:33,140
l'm just saying you could try to
be more alluring and subtle.

568
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:35,314
Men like a little mystery.

569
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:39,314
Absolutely we do. Yes.

570
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:43,856
Unraveling the fairer sex is
one of life's greatest riddles.

571
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:47,656
Oh yeah. l'm the mysterious
type all right.

572
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:52,396
Nothing says subtle like an
infected toenail in your Chapstick.

573
00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:54,366
June, don't be
so hard on yourself

574
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:55,572
You know what?

575
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:56,601
lt's fine.

576
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:57,830
lt's fine.

577
00:35:58,376 --> 00:35:59,900
l know my place in life.

578
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:02,671
l allow your many suitors
to do their...

579
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:05,974
l'm a nice guy so l'm
talking to your ugly friend...

580
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:07,411
in the hopes that
l might get a glimpse

581
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:08,880
of your perfect breasts routine.

582
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,485
Right, Nate?

583
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:14,983
She's a little drunk.

584
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:20,163
You know, June, some people think
our bodies are like an Earth suit

585
00:36:20,398 --> 00:36:22,389
A vessel that carries our soul

586
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:26,364
until you pass on from this
planet into the next dimension.

587
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:30,006
l don't even know
what that means.

588
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:32,440
Yeah, l'm sort of with
her on this one.

589
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:35,635
l'm just trying to help, okay?

590
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:36,770
Great.

591
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:40,450
Well...thanks for the help.

592
00:36:46,257 --> 00:36:47,690
l'm such a bad friend.

593
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:49,017
No, that's ridiculous.

594
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,522
You were just trying to help.

595
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:51,194
Come on.

596
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:53,420
You're absolutely
wonderful to June.

597
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:54,187
l'm not.

598
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:55,592
l'm horrible.

599
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:59,034
l really made a promise to be
there for her.

600
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:02,431
You've been so sweet and

601
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:05,769
l'm really becoming
attracted to you.

602
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:08,408
You are?

603
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:11,342
And poor June's in there
crying her eyes out.

604
00:37:11,582 --> 00:37:12,048
Oh, no, no, no.

605
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:13,011
Don't worry about her.

606
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:14,411
She's not crying.

607
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:16,745
She's probably
passed out by now.

608
00:37:18,423 --> 00:37:20,186
l really like you, Nate.

609
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,392
Yeah?

610
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:23,787
And you're gonna
think l'm crazy, but...

611
00:37:24,228 --> 00:37:26,458
l've thought about you
sometimes over the years.

612
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:27,892
Really?

613
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:32,125
l even used to look at our old
class picture once in a while.

614
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:36,102
lf someone were standing here
telling me that...

615
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,070
l would think they were crazy.

616
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,244
Or a pedophile.

617
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:44,607
But none of that matters now...

618
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,977
because l can't
just abandon June like that.

619
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:52,151
Look, l have a confession to make.

620
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:54,147
When you told me you
weren't dating

621
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:56,053
till June had
someone in her life...

622
00:37:56,294 --> 00:37:58,762
l did see her as an obstacle.

623
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:02,157
l lied about the spa promotion.

624
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,957
l paid for it.

625
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,169
To give June a stealth makeover.

626
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:07,093
That's so sneaky.

627
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:08,669
l know it's awful.

628
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:11,898
But now l really do
wantto help her.

629
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:13,508
And l think l can.

630
00:38:13,744 --> 00:38:15,177
But l need your help.

631
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,908
You know what?

632
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:18,547
l believe you.

633
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:19,613
Good.

634
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:21,148
Now stick with me.

635
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:22,784
l got a plan.

636
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:33,355
Are you guys sure this won't
have any residual effects?

637
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:36,396
Define residual.

638
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,057
Okay.

639
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:39,633
What we're going to do here today

640
00:38:39,871 --> 00:38:42,533
is a combination of
aversion therapy

641
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:46,641
and do it yourself hypnosis.

642
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:49,905
Ma'am? Excuse me.

643
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:52,945
Hi. Could l um...

644
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:04,256
Are you insane?

645
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:05,427
No. Uh...

646
00:39:09,534 --> 00:39:11,092
Okay.

647
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:16,440
Mmm...isn't it creamy
and delicious?

648
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:20,735
What a delightful reward for
your attraction to June.

649
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:24,370
No, no.

650
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:25,877
This is the good part.

651
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:28,779
l don't think l can do this.

652
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,952
No, no, no.

653
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:33,054
Let's not dwell in the negative,
Cole Slawsen.

654
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,727
Your Medieval Times
goblet is half full.

655
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:37,985
Huh?

656
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:41,426
Okay...get the pendant.

657
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:51,234
Your eyes are getting very heavy.

658
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:52,300
No.

659
00:39:53,544 --> 00:39:56,240
l am going to
count backwards from ten.

660
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:59,415
And when l finish you will
only remain conscious

661
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,551
to the sound of
my mellifluous voice.

662
00:40:02,853 --> 00:40:11,522
Ten, nine, eight, seven six.

663
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:13,229
Five...

664
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:18,491
Four, three, two...

665
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:23,331
One.

666
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:31,378
You will open your eyes.

667
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:34,710
And listen very carefully.

668
00:40:35,286 --> 00:40:38,221
When you see this...

669
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:43,587
what you actually will be
seeing is this.

670
00:40:44,161 --> 00:40:45,890
Hi, Space Lady.

671
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:49,726
Good.

672
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,567
When l count to four

673
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:57,399
You will wake up refreshed,
but you will remember...

674
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:59,507
nothing of what happened today.

675
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:02,144
You will, however,
remember my instructions

676
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,315
until which time you hear the phrase,

677
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:08,176
"l love ...

678
00:41:12,356 --> 00:41:15,416
Midget ...mimes?

679
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:21,932
l love midget mimes.

680
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:22,860
Good.

681
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,794
One...

682
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:27,027
Two, three, four.

683
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:44,550
Oh, resistance is futile.

684
00:41:52,697 --> 00:41:56,224
Wow, you guys look amazing.

685
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:59,698
June's going back next week
to get her mole removed finally.

686
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,201
Well, it looks like Cole and
l are going to have to take ...

687
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,931
you two supermodels
out to celebrate.

688
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:26,224
l can't believe l'm doing this.

689
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:28,791
l haven't had fat
or dairy in years.

690
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:31,228
Whatever you've been doing...

691
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:34,661
it is working, you saucy minx.

692
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:36,770
The spa said
June's skin needs fat.

693
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:37,473
Yeah.

694
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,834
They also gave me Rogaine
for women

695
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:42,011
and prescriptions for my skin
and my toenail thing.

696
00:42:42,513 --> 00:42:45,277
l'm really sorry if my toenail
grossed you out, Cole.

697
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:46,949
lt was really embarrassing.

698
00:42:47,184 --> 00:42:50,620
how could l ever be grossed out
by such a luscious,

699
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:54,391
pouty lipped inter---gallactic
vixen such as yourself?

700
00:42:56,193 --> 00:42:58,320
Thank the gods you were
disconnected from the

701
00:42:58,562 --> 00:42:59,859
Borg Collective through
the neutralization of

702
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:02,395
your upper spinal
column neurotransceiver.

703
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:05,459
What?

704
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:08,236
Cole is a Trekkie.

705
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:09,905
lsn't that fun?

706
00:43:10,141 --> 00:43:13,338
So that is the highest
complement he can pay you.

707
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:16,273
ln this galaxy or any other.

708
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,210
Let's keep walking.

709
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,179
A little separation is fine.

710
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,488
You know, Cole, the pier is
June's favorite spot in L.A.

711
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:27,589
Yeah, l like to come down here
late at night,

712
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:29,793
when everybody's gone.

713
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,290
That way none of the tourists
ask me to take their picture

714
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,191
with them for five dollars.

715
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:38,033
You are a fiery goddess
with a clever tongue...

716
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:40,169
to match your stunning countenance.

717
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:42,302
Oh, you've got a little...

718
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,732
l'll get it.

719
00:43:50,014 --> 00:43:50,503
You know what?

720
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:53,308
Let's leave these two little
lovebirds alone, huh.

721
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:54,882
-l don't think that's the best idea.
-No, no, no.

722
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,644
-No, seriously.
-They're cute together. Come on.

723
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:58,411
He's just a little strange.

724
00:43:58,656 --> 00:44:00,783
We all are in some ways, you know.

725
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,157
You've got to be kidding me.

726
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:11,299
Oh, look, Daddy.

727
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:14,265
l love midget mimes.

728
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:26,216
They're called little people,
honey.

729
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:37,761
Oh, l totally forgot to tell you

730
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:40,520
that Cole had
a traumatic experience

731
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:42,527
with a mime as a child.

732
00:44:43,234 --> 00:44:45,361
Oh, it was awful.

733
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:49,369
lt was his 5th birthday party and
a mime came to perform and

734
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:52,233
unfortunately he caught the mime

735
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:54,808
performing personal services
for his mother

736
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:57,741
But, hey, look, this is fun.

737
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:10,686
This might be good.

738
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:37,918
l'm not going to stand for this.

739
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:39,383
Excuse me.

740
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,327
Don't mind him.

741
00:45:44,695 --> 00:45:46,492
He's a sad little man.

742
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:53,302
l'm Johann.

743
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:03,378
Sorry there's no antipasto...

744
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:05,411
This is all l could whip up.

745
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,216
-Nice place.
-Thanks, buddy.

746
00:46:09,453 --> 00:46:11,318
lt's cold and a little windy.

747
00:46:11,555 --> 00:46:12,954
Here's to new friends.

748
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:15,623
Cheers.

749
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:17,825
Cherrios.

750
00:46:18,062 --> 00:46:20,462
God, this view is incredible.

751
00:46:20,698 --> 00:46:22,359
You can even see
the Pier from here.

752
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,565
l like to go down there sometimes.

753
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:26,201
Hang out with the crowds.

754
00:46:26,437 --> 00:46:27,870
People watch.

755
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:30,734
lt could get a little lonely
when you're single.

756
00:46:39,183 --> 00:46:46,885
So...Johann...are you
are you originally from L.A.?

757
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:48,989
No, l grew up in Europe.

758
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:50,454
My parents run
a little mountaineering

759
00:46:50,694 --> 00:46:52,355
school in the Swiss Alps.

760
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:54,757
l moved here when l was
seventeen for college.

761
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:57,866
Where did you go to college?

762
00:46:58,202 --> 00:46:59,499
Harvard.

763
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:02,237
Oh...Right.

764
00:47:02,473 --> 00:47:04,600
Oh, it's really not
that impressive.

765
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:07,140
My parents didn't have to spend
all that lvy League money...

766
00:47:07,378 --> 00:47:09,312
for me just to become a dentist.

767
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:10,604
You're a dentist?

768
00:47:10,848 --> 00:47:12,941
Yeah, l love it.

769
00:47:13,183 --> 00:47:15,447
lt's so fulfilling.

770
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:19,816
Of course, l did take a few years
off for the Marines.

771
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:22,925
Let me get this straight.

772
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,287
You went to Harvard
became a Marine

773
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:27,463
and now you're a dentist?

774
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:30,598
Yeah, l also did
a little modeling on the side

775
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:33,962
just so my folks wouldn't have
to swing dental school.

776
00:47:34,238 --> 00:47:37,401
l still do it every now and
then just for a kick.

777
00:47:37,775 --> 00:47:39,743
Oh my god, l've seen you.

778
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,374
Were you on the cover of
July's Men's Abs?

779
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,308
Yeah. l didn't see it.

780
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:47,210
l was in Central Asia
over the summer...

781
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,146
doing Doctors Without Borders.

782
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:52,286
My group's done some
fund raisers with them.

783
00:47:52,523 --> 00:47:54,753
They really do
the most amazing work.

784
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:58,120
lt's the most rewarding
thing l've ever done.

785
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:03,492
Have you ever done any modeling?

786
00:48:04,168 --> 00:48:07,535
You have unbelievable
bone structure.

787
00:48:09,373 --> 00:48:11,273
Look at! Oh, look at that.

788
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:12,497
There's the bread.

789
00:48:12,743 --> 00:48:14,370
lt was hiding from me.

790
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:17,175
This is so weird.

791
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:22,078
You and Nate have
so much in common.

792
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,547
We do?

793
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:25,049
We do?

794
00:48:25,355 --> 00:48:26,652
How's that?

795
00:48:27,124 --> 00:48:31,288
Well...you're both really
into physical fitness.

796
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,987
And Nate, here,
is a personal trainer.

797
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,890
A personal trainer?

798
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:40,563
Like at a gym?

799
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,032
He's more of a lifestyle coach.

800
00:48:46,276 --> 00:48:47,334
Right, Nate?

801
00:48:47,578 --> 00:48:50,672
-Yeah.
-Exercise, diet, the whole nine yards.

802
00:48:50,914 --> 00:48:51,380
That's it.

803
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:53,014
All nine of them.

804
00:48:53,884 --> 00:48:57,376
June, if you don't mind me
saying so, you have...

805
00:48:57,621 --> 00:49:02,320
the most intriguing case of
fluorosis l've ever seen.

806
00:49:05,496 --> 00:49:07,327
Please excuse my rudeness.

807
00:49:07,564 --> 00:49:09,429
l just always notice teeth.

808
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,334
You never thought about
getting them fixed?

809
00:49:12,669 --> 00:49:14,796
Well, l thought about it...

810
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:19,168
but my insurance doesn't
cover any cosmetic stuff, so

811
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:21,968
l bet you never had a cavity.

812
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:23,202
That's true.

813
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:24,744
l never have.

814
00:49:24,982 --> 00:49:26,472
You are so lucky.

815
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:30,244
Most of my patients would love
to trade places with you.

816
00:49:39,863 --> 00:49:41,854
You are so screwed.

817
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:42,793
l am?

818
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:46,161
He's just buttering up the
freak to get to Cristabel.

819
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:49,597
This is your competition, my man.

820
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,068
Where the hell did you get that?

821
00:49:51,308 --> 00:49:52,741
Mom saves old issues.

822
00:49:52,976 --> 00:49:56,036
l'll put it back on her bed
before she realizes it's gone.

823
00:49:56,547 --> 00:49:58,174
l'm not sure
he's after Cristabel.

824
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,349
l actually think he likes June.

825
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:03,348
Well has he ever technically
asked June out on a date?

826
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:05,487
Well, not really.

827
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:09,351
Any one on one action whatsoever?

828
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:11,151
He offered to fix her teeth.

829
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:14,120
Then he hasn't closed
the door to dating Cristabel.

830
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:17,856
He's just doing a favor for her
hideously deformed friend.

831
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:22,196
You're going through
the front door.

832
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:24,798
He's going through
the back door.

833
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:28,341
He's a back door man! lt's a
time honored technique.

834
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:31,673
No. But what if Cristabel
doesn't have a back door?

835
00:50:31,915 --> 00:50:33,007
Or what if it's locked,

836
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,184
and everybody just
goes through the front door?

837
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:38,081
Oh, l'm not interested in you.

838
00:50:38,322 --> 00:50:39,949
l just want to be friends.

839
00:50:40,257 --> 00:50:46,218
Oh, oh, excuse me is that
my penis hitting your cervix?

840
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:50,059
What am l going to do?

841
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:53,269
Easy. You shadow him.

842
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:54,829
Shadow him?

843
00:50:55,072 --> 00:50:56,869
Yeah, just make sure they're
never alone together

844
00:50:57,174 --> 00:51:00,234
where he can impress her without
you being there to deflect it.

845
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,876
What you can't do,

846
00:51:02,112 --> 00:51:04,603
is let him show you up
in any way, okay?

847
00:51:04,848 --> 00:51:07,408
lf he ever tries to take off his
shirt in front of her...

848
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,779
you got to make sure it only
happens over your dead puny body

849
00:51:11,021 --> 00:51:12,648
Shirt stays on. Got it.

850
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:16,484
And secondly if his shirt ever
does come off in front of her,

851
00:51:16,727 --> 00:51:17,591
poke out her eyes.

852
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:19,090
Eyes poked out.

853
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:22,021
Thirdly, lie.

854
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:22,994
Lie?

855
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:23,665
Oh, come on.

856
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,629
l thought that the most
important rule in relationships

857
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,268
was to be honest.

858
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:28,471
l'm sorry.

859
00:51:28,705 --> 00:51:32,038
Are you a former Marine
that graduated from Harvard

860
00:51:32,276 --> 00:51:34,244
and fixes needy
children's teeth?

861
00:51:35,045 --> 00:51:36,808
l got two words for you, my man.

862
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:38,681
Lie.

863
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:57,198
The perfect people have left the
genetically inferior ones to die.

864
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:59,593
Save yourself, Nate.

865
00:52:00,003 --> 00:52:03,268
No, l'm not letting you go.

866
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:06,233
Not on my watch.

867
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:08,001
Stop!

868
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:09,405
Stop, please.

869
00:52:09,646 --> 00:52:11,443
This is awful.

870
00:52:11,682 --> 00:52:13,081
God, you're telling me?

871
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:14,944
l'm not even
supposed to be in the sun.

872
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:16,880
l had my skin lasered last week.

873
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,109
Really?

874
00:52:18,355 --> 00:52:20,721
Oh, yeah, l'm nubby.

875
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:24,122
Johann is making
the veneers next week.

876
00:52:24,594 --> 00:52:27,586
l had to shave down her teeth
in order to take the impression.

877
00:52:27,931 --> 00:52:31,298
She's going to
look like Farrah in '79.

878
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:33,796
Can you believe
how generous that it?

879
00:52:34,037 --> 00:52:35,197
Super generous.

880
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:38,067
And clearly
with no ulterior motive.

881
00:52:38,308 --> 00:52:40,572
The truth is,
there is an ulterior motive.

882
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:43,746
l can show the before and
after pictures to new patients.

883
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,106
That's perfect.

884
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:49,911
Just gives me more motivation to
enhance June's natural radiance.

885
00:52:57,894 --> 00:52:59,987
Speaking of natural beauty...

886
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:02,959
Let's go.

887
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:05,359
Come, guys

888
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:06,899
Am l bleeding?

889
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:09,703
Only on the inside.

890
00:53:16,346 --> 00:53:17,608
Cessna.

891
00:53:17,848 --> 00:53:19,440
That's a beaut.

892
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:23,684
-Where?
-Right up there.

893
00:53:25,422 --> 00:53:26,889
Johann's a pilot.

894
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,748
Of course he is.

895
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:30,456
Do you fly, Nate?

896
00:53:30,694 --> 00:53:31,718
Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:32,986
l fly planes.

898
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,697
That's what l do.

899
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:36,159
You fly?

900
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:37,356
Yeah.

901
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:41,093
l mean, to and fro... by and by.

902
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:47,674
l like to do flips and uh
the tubelyoos and whatnot.

903
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:49,071
You're a stunt pilot?

904
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:52,804
Yeah...uh...not professionally, no.

905
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:58,009
l like to take the kids up
every once in a while.

906
00:53:58,255 --> 00:54:01,281
-The kids?
-Needy children from the ghetto.

907
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:02,248
Yeah.

908
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,687
Most of the time it's the
first time they've ever flown.

909
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:09,126
Oh, god it's just...
to see their faces...

910
00:54:09,366 --> 00:54:13,200
when the G forces hit them.

911
00:54:13,437 --> 00:54:15,962
l just can't describe it,
you know.

912
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:20,438
lt's the most rewarding thing
l've ever done.

913
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:21,769
So let me get this straight.

914
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:26,210
You're not a professional pilot,
yet you risk the lives of children

915
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,010
by doing dangerous
stunts in mid air?

916
00:54:29,553 --> 00:54:32,044
Uh...yeah...yeah.

917
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:34,223
ln my flying dream....

918
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,482
that l have.

919
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,852
Just a little game with the kids.

920
00:54:38,094 --> 00:54:39,925
Didn't l mention it was a dream?

921
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:41,596
No, you didn't mention that.

922
00:54:41,832 --> 00:54:44,596
Oh, yeah. l could see
how you guys all..

923
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:48,236
No. lt's-it's-it's
a great dream that l have

924
00:54:48,472 --> 00:54:50,064
Just me and the kids.

925
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,010
Them riding on my back,
my wings out like an angel.

926
00:54:54,244 --> 00:55:01,480
Like a...male heterosexual
angel in the wind.

927
00:55:01,785 --> 00:55:04,754
-Are you done?
-Yeah. Yeah.

928
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:06,554
Wow. Okay. Yeah.

929
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:07,313
Flying dreams.

930
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:10,048
l for one love flying dreams.

931
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,586
How often do you have these

932
00:55:11,828 --> 00:55:15,264
heterosexual male angel
flying dreams, Nate?

933
00:55:15,499 --> 00:55:17,626
Oh, l don't know June,
what's normal.

934
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:20,862
Once or twice a year.

935
00:55:21,137 --> 00:55:22,832
Oh my god, me too.

936
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:24,472
And then there's
always that second

937
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:27,802
when you first wake up and you
actually believe it happened.

938
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:29,773
Do you guys ever get those?

939
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,107
Every night.

940
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,381
Every night?

941
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:40,716
l saw on Oprah that flying dreams
symbolize fearlessness.

942
00:55:40,957 --> 00:55:43,118
You can accomplish anything.

943
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:45,283
Makes sense.

944
00:55:45,695 --> 00:55:47,162
You must be extremely advanced

945
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:48,557
ln the soul level.

946
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:51,392
Even Oprah only has them
once in a while.

947
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:55,162
l don't know about my soul,
but l'm extremely advanced

948
00:55:55,405 --> 00:55:57,566
in the body temperature level.

949
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:02,573
As the expression goes,
l'm sweating like a racehorse.

950
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:04,141
l believe the expression is:

951
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:07,646
l have to piss like a racehorse.

952
00:56:11,321 --> 00:56:14,313
There was a scorpion on your back.

953
00:56:14,558 --> 00:56:16,549
There's no scorpions out here.

954
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:20,219
Or it might have been a tick.

955
00:56:21,097 --> 00:56:23,395
Now he's a mountaineering
stunt pilot?

956
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,189
Yeah.

957
00:56:24,434 --> 00:56:26,493
We gotta figure out something
you're really good at.

958
00:56:26,736 --> 00:56:29,068
Okay. Figure out
what l'm good at.

959
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:30,202
l don't know.

960
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,668
What am l good at?

961
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:34,903
You used to be good at climbing
the rope in gym class.

962
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:35,611
Okay.

963
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:36,869
Good at climbing rope.

964
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:39,138
But how am l going to work
that into the routine?

965
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:40,349
l don't know.

966
00:56:40,617 --> 00:56:42,949
What did we used to do to
impress girls during recess?

967
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:44,915
Oh yeah. Yeah.

968
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:46,247
l could dance.

969
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:48,719
Of course, l'll have to leave out
the part that l wet myself.

970
00:56:48,959 --> 00:56:50,859
-That's the best part.
-Okay.

971
00:56:51,127 --> 00:56:55,188
What else you got in your arsenal?
What about the kazoo?

972
00:56:55,432 --> 00:56:57,957
Remember, we used to rock
the kazoo at naptime.

973
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:00,229
Wait a minute.

974
00:57:00,537 --> 00:57:02,437
l got the perfect thing.

975
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,739
What's the perfect thing?

976
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:06,503
Hello?

977
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:16,852
These old coffee houses remind me
of the swinging Sixties.

978
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,883
Hey, who wants to hear
some Cat Stevens?

979
00:57:21,925 --> 00:57:24,894
Ooh, what a unique piece.

980
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,560
May l?

981
00:57:27,497 --> 00:57:29,260
Uh, yeah.

982
00:57:29,499 --> 00:57:30,932
Took a little damage.

983
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:32,134
Recently.

984
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:37,329
l'm sure we can make
this old lady sing yet.

985
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:55,685
Some day...

986
00:57:56,259 --> 00:57:58,591
Some how...

987
00:57:59,663 --> 00:58:02,393
You'll find...

988
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:09,299
You'll shine like the sun.

989
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:16,371
Some day...

990
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:22,210
Some how, you'll find...

991
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:23,350
You'll find...

992
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:25,611
What you've been...

993
00:58:25,855 --> 00:58:28,380
Looking for...

994
00:58:33,463 --> 00:58:37,331
Some day. Some...

995
00:58:37,567 --> 00:58:43,301
Times, it's nice to see them...

996
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:49,410
...fireflies burning
the night away.

997
00:59:08,598 --> 00:59:09,826
More. More.

998
00:59:10,066 --> 00:59:11,499
Oh, it works.

999
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,811
lt's loud in here, huh.

1000
00:59:25,048 --> 00:59:25,571
Huh?

1001
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:28,340
-lt's loud in here.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1002
00:59:28,585 --> 00:59:30,052
What's up with all the hats?

1003
00:59:30,286 --> 00:59:32,982
Oh, the Rogaine's working.

1004
00:59:33,556 --> 00:59:36,525
Yeah, it's just that weird
in between stage, so.

1005
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,192
Cool.

1006
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:40,863
Plus l'm trying to avoid being
attacked by any scorpion ticks.

1007
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:43,456
Heard they were pretty common
around these parts.

1008
00:59:48,138 --> 00:59:49,730
This song is amazing.

1009
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:52,168
l love this song.

1010
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:54,707
Care to dance?

1011
00:59:54,944 --> 00:59:56,969
Ooh. l'm going to sit this out.

1012
00:59:57,213 --> 00:59:58,680
But yeah,
l'll hold that for you.

1013
00:59:58,915 --> 01:00:03,215
Back in the playground days,
l used to charm the ladies.

1014
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:07,113
What's...

1015
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,618
He stole my mojo.

1016
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:09,381
Ooh, that was hard.

1017
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:11,184
Come on, l did the collar thing.

1018
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:13,224
l was telling her
l wanted to dance.

1019
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,588
What did l do wrong?

1020
01:00:14,831 --> 01:00:16,731
What? We going to
let them show us up?

1021
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:19,264
Come on. Don't you like it.

1022
01:00:19,502 --> 01:00:21,231
-Oh, yeah.
-lt's awesome.

1023
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:22,961
lt's better than
what's out there.

1024
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,473
l wish there was a prom
in the first grade...

1025
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,141
... "cause l would have rocked it.

1026
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:28,207
Stop it.

1027
01:00:28,444 --> 01:00:30,844
Hey we can tango, too, mama.

1028
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,308
Come on.

1029
01:00:32,682 --> 01:00:34,309
Don't get dizzy now.

1030
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:45,559
Another round?

1031
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:47,091
Yes. Another round would be great.

1032
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:47,989
Let's do another round.

1033
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:49,698
Another round.

1034
01:00:57,507 --> 01:00:58,940
Wow, look at this.

1035
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:02,437
Back in my country,
they call this Swissmania.

1036
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,906
Ooh, the hands.

1037
01:01:20,697 --> 01:01:22,130
Oh, come on.

1038
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:23,297
Come on.

1039
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:25,626
One small scrap of dignity left.

1040
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:30,066
-No.
-Okay, that's your cue.

1041
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,563
Excuse me.

1042
01:01:31,808 --> 01:01:32,240
Step aside.

1043
01:01:32,475 --> 01:01:34,500
Excuse me.

1044
01:01:45,355 --> 01:01:47,983
l've known a lot of jealous men
in my life...

1045
01:01:48,324 --> 01:01:49,313
But you take the cake.

1046
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:52,084
Well if Men's Abs in there would
just keep his damn clothes on.

1047
01:01:52,328 --> 01:01:52,817
He was hot!

1048
01:01:53,062 --> 01:01:54,086
Oh, he was hot.

1049
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,389
He was sweating like a racehorse.

1050
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,157
The man sweats urine.

1051
01:01:59,035 --> 01:02:01,868
Look just admit that he's hot.

1052
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:03,231
Johann is hot.

1053
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:05,338
Oh, so you're
attracted to Johann now.

1054
01:02:05,575 --> 01:02:06,098
ls that it?

1055
01:02:06,342 --> 01:02:07,536
No, l'm not.

1056
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:08,641
But you are.

1057
01:02:08,878 --> 01:02:10,038
And why wouldn't you be?

1058
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,544
He's some kind of
a damned pod person.

1059
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:14,279
l don't blame you, okay.

1060
01:02:14,517 --> 01:02:16,246
He's perfect.

1061
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:18,181
He's the male version of you.

1062
01:02:18,421 --> 01:02:20,286
Oh, so now l'm a pod person.

1063
01:02:20,523 --> 01:02:21,387
No.

1064
01:02:21,624 --> 01:02:22,921
You're just.

1065
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:26,290
l mean, look at you.

1066
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:28,353
You're out of my league.

1067
01:02:28,598 --> 01:02:30,122
You're in Johann's league...

1068
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:33,426
And l can't compete with that.

1069
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,467
You didn't have to compete.

1070
01:02:36,072 --> 01:02:37,630
l was with you.

1071
01:02:38,775 --> 01:02:40,709
l really liked you, Nate.

1072
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:43,407
l thought you were different.

1073
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:45,807
That you actually
wanted to help June.

1074
01:02:46,149 --> 01:02:48,014
And that you wanted to
get to know me.

1075
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:49,650
l did want to help June.

1076
01:02:49,886 --> 01:02:50,944
And you know what?

1077
01:02:51,254 --> 01:02:53,017
l am out of your league.

1078
01:02:53,256 --> 01:02:54,188
You can't sing.

1079
01:02:54,424 --> 01:02:55,448
You can't dance.

1080
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:57,284
You're a terrible athlete.

1081
01:02:57,527 --> 01:03:00,018
And a really crappy liar.

1082
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:04,266
l took the time to
get to know you, Nate.

1083
01:03:05,335 --> 01:03:07,565
l really wish you did
the same with me.

1084
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:08,930
Cris, Cris.

1085
01:03:09,172 --> 01:03:10,332
Hold on.

1086
01:03:10,573 --> 01:03:12,370
Look, l made mistakes.

1087
01:03:12,608 --> 01:03:13,575
l lied.

1088
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:15,334
l'm not perfect.

1089
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:19,046
But...it's still me.

1090
01:03:19,282 --> 01:03:19,748
You know?

1091
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:21,245
Nate Cooper.

1092
01:03:21,517 --> 01:03:23,075
l'm sorry, Nate.

1093
01:03:23,886 --> 01:03:25,444
lt's over.

1094
01:03:31,961 --> 01:03:33,019
Oh, come on.

1095
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:34,695
Here's your car, Loser.

1096
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:37,766
When you just
can't hide your abs,

1097
01:03:38,001 --> 01:03:39,400
and that's why
everyone is looking for

1098
01:03:39,635 --> 01:03:42,968
a product that gives them the
most effective workout possible.

1099
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:46,698
You see exercise should be
safe effective and fun.

1100
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,706
And, of course get you results.

1101
01:03:48,945 --> 01:03:51,505
Time is one thing we all wish
we had more of.

1102
01:03:52,448 --> 01:03:53,574
Look at you.

1103
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:57,280
You sad, sad man.

1104
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:00,915
Well, l'm crashing
your pity party.

1105
01:04:01,324 --> 01:04:03,554
Oh, yeah,
it may be too late for me.

1106
01:04:04,627 --> 01:04:06,561
But there's still hope for you.

1107
01:04:10,533 --> 01:04:11,898
You dick!

1108
01:04:12,135 --> 01:04:13,227
l can hear you.

1109
01:04:13,469 --> 01:04:14,834
You're a foot away from me.

1110
01:04:15,071 --> 01:04:15,503
Look, okay.

1111
01:04:15,738 --> 01:04:16,602
There's going to be
a whole world of "ow' ...

1112
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:19,000
... waiting for you if
you give up now, Nate.

1113
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:21,640
lt's like what a wise
old lady once said.

1114
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:26,375
lf you give up on your dream,
you die.

1115
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,874
Are you quoting me Flashdance?

1116
01:04:29,118 --> 01:04:31,678
There's only one person
that can help you now.

1117
01:04:32,522 --> 01:04:35,013
She'll meet you
at Danny's Beachside Cafe

1118
01:04:35,258 --> 01:04:37,192
at five o'clock.

1119
01:04:37,693 --> 01:04:39,524
Five o'clock.

1120
01:04:55,478 --> 01:04:56,740
Hey.

1121
01:04:58,448 --> 01:04:59,540
June?

1122
01:04:59,782 --> 01:05:01,807
Yeah, that's what
they usually call me.

1123
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:03,109
Your teeth.

1124
01:05:03,352 --> 01:05:04,046
Oh yeah.

1125
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:05,515
Johann did the veneers yesterday.

1126
01:05:05,755 --> 01:05:06,847
What do you think?

1127
01:05:07,623 --> 01:05:11,821
Wow. You look so...normal.

1128
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:14,529
Oh, l bet you say
that to all the girls.

1129
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:17,597
Oh, my god. l'm sorry.

1130
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:21,232
More evidence of my staggering
lack of insight into women.

1131
01:05:22,305 --> 01:05:24,239
No apology necessary.

1132
01:05:24,474 --> 01:05:25,338
l mean, come on

1133
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:27,668
l think l look
a hell of a lot better.

1134
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,172
Yeah l'd have to agree.

1135
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:30,845
Wow, you look great.

1136
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:31,569
Thanks.

1137
01:05:31,814 --> 01:05:35,375
Oh on my way over here
l'm not certain,

1138
01:05:35,618 --> 01:05:36,880
but l think l was cat called.

1139
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,643
-Really?
-Yeah.

1140
01:05:37,987 --> 01:05:41,252
l mean, l know that for most women
that's a hideous daily occurrence,

1141
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:45,427
but when the guy with the rattail
and the mullet did this thing...

1142
01:05:45,661 --> 01:05:46,252
where he put his hands like...

1143
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:47,155
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

1144
01:05:47,396 --> 01:05:48,260
l know it.

1145
01:05:48,498 --> 01:05:49,089
Okay, well anyway...

1146
01:05:49,332 --> 01:05:50,959
l looked all around...

1147
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,668
and l realized l was
the only woman in sight.

1148
01:05:53,903 --> 01:05:55,461
l mean, he was talking to me!

1149
01:05:56,305 --> 01:05:58,603
l was so excited,
l almost went over and hugged him.

1150
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:00,001
l swear to God.

1151
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:01,175
You didn't, though, did you?

1152
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:01,842
Please.

1153
01:06:02,078 --> 01:06:03,272
Even l have my standards.

1154
01:06:03,513 --> 01:06:05,242
l don't know, though,
he could have been the one.

1155
01:06:05,481 --> 01:06:07,813
So many rattails, no little time.

1156
01:06:10,653 --> 01:06:12,951
lt's like a shock to the system.

1157
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:14,554
You have a whole new look.

1158
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:15,950
Don't start.

1159
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,520
Well, to be quite honest with you,
it's not exactly all mine.

1160
01:06:20,763 --> 01:06:22,424
l borrowed the top from Cristabel.

1161
01:06:23,332 --> 01:06:24,196
l thought there was
something about it...

1162
01:06:24,433 --> 01:06:26,162
... that made me
want to shoot myself.

1163
01:06:26,402 --> 01:06:27,630
Poor Nate.

1164
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:28,802
Oh.

1165
01:06:32,341 --> 01:06:33,433
What?

1166
01:06:36,212 --> 01:06:37,736
Do l have a booger in my nose?

1167
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:41,411
No...just...

1168
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,087
l'm happy for you.

1169
01:06:46,422 --> 01:06:47,753
l'm happy for me, too.

1170
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,456
Good.

1171
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:49,089
l'm glad we agree on something.

1172
01:06:49,325 --> 01:06:50,451
Finally.

1173
01:06:51,661 --> 01:06:52,252
Hey, Randy.

1174
01:06:52,495 --> 01:06:53,257
Hey, Stan.

1175
01:06:53,496 --> 01:06:55,487
-Hey, Nate.
-Hi, Nate.

1176
01:07:06,442 --> 01:07:07,238
Here, l want you to try

1177
01:07:07,476 --> 01:07:09,376
-some of mine.
-Okay.

1178
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:10,738
Just try it.

1179
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,605
ls it better?

1180
01:07:11,847 --> 01:07:13,212
"Cause l think l got
the better one.

1181
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:14,438
No, l got the better one.

1182
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:15,708
You gave yourself the better one?

1183
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:16,577
- Yeah.
- That's so unfair.

1184
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:17,786
l'm the guest.

1185
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,954
You didn't know and
l'm selfish, so.

1186
01:07:20,189 --> 01:07:20,746
That's a good point.

1187
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,184
l wouldn't have known.

1188
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:25,992
So, how's Johann?

1189
01:07:26,229 --> 01:07:29,289
Good... l don't know.

1190
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:31,933
That was a steady decline.

1191
01:07:33,502 --> 01:07:35,265
Well, he hasn't
made a move yet, so...

1192
01:07:35,504 --> 01:07:38,632
l can't really tell
whether he likes me or not.

1193
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:41,674
Anyway, what's to like, right?

1194
01:07:41,911 --> 01:07:43,344
What's to like?

1195
01:07:43,779 --> 01:07:45,770
Oh, come on,
what does that mean?

1196
01:07:46,015 --> 01:07:47,607
There's plenty to like.

1197
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:48,644
Such as?

1198
01:07:48,884 --> 01:07:53,514
You can really hold your liquor.

1199
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:57,490
Sarcasm will get you everywhere.

1200
01:08:02,164 --> 01:08:03,961
Let me ask you a question.

1201
01:08:08,771 --> 01:08:10,636
ls this pointless?

1202
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:18,011
Am l ever going to have
another chance with Cristabel?

1203
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:27,912
Oh...yeah. Of course you will.

1204
01:08:28,157 --> 01:08:30,921
Because um...because l'm...

1205
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,288
l'm going to tell her
to give you another chance.

1206
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:38,056
Our annual costume party
is a week from tonight...

1207
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:40,895
...so you'll both be there.

1208
01:08:41,304 --> 01:08:42,737
Well, that's great.

1209
01:08:42,972 --> 01:08:43,631
Yeah.

1210
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:49,334
And you're going to
be yourself for once.

1211
01:08:49,578 --> 01:08:51,409
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Please.

1212
01:08:51,647 --> 01:08:54,377
Listen, we've built this
friendship around trust.

1213
01:08:54,617 --> 01:08:55,675
l think we need to keep it there.

1214
01:08:55,918 --> 01:08:56,646
-All right.
-Okay.

1215
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:58,649
Well, if we're both being
so honest...

1216
01:08:58,888 --> 01:08:59,320
Yeah.

1217
01:08:59,555 --> 01:09:00,852
Why don't you bring
your crappy car ...

1218
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:02,955
and that guitar you clearly
don't know how to play.

1219
01:09:03,192 --> 01:09:03,624
Okay.

1220
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:06,089
As long as you bring
that foxy yoga outfit...

1221
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:08,092
with the granny panties
l love so much.

1222
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:09,992
Don't make fun

1223
01:09:11,434 --> 01:09:13,698
God. l mean, who really
wants to go to a party...

1224
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:15,836
... as the girl who's
never been kissed anyway.

1225
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:18,506
What? No, that's not true.

1226
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:21,869
l totally planted one on you
at the yoga place.

1227
01:09:22,111 --> 01:09:23,578
Are you out of your mind?

1228
01:09:23,813 --> 01:09:24,541
No, l'm not out of my mind.

1229
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,371
That was not a kiss.

1230
01:09:25,614 --> 01:09:27,411
That was you falling into me.

1231
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:28,082
That's what l did.

1232
01:09:28,317 --> 01:09:29,944
l got the---Okay, fine.

1233
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,554
Oh...well...

1234
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:46,426
l'm sorry. l, uh...

1235
01:09:47,403 --> 01:09:49,428
l don't know why l did that.

1236
01:09:52,174 --> 01:09:54,904
You don't know
why you did that.

1237
01:09:56,979 --> 01:09:59,641
-No.
-Right.

1238
01:10:00,049 --> 01:10:01,846
-June.
-l think you should just go, Nate.

1239
01:10:02,084 --> 01:10:04,644
June, listen,
l'm trying to figure---

1240
01:10:05,654 --> 01:10:07,053
Get out of here.

1241
01:10:07,289 --> 01:10:09,086
Before your girlfriend gets back.

1242
01:10:42,024 --> 01:10:43,116
Excuse me.

1243
01:10:48,798 --> 01:10:49,787
Traffic's heavy today.

1244
01:10:50,032 --> 01:10:50,623
Beep. Beep. Beep.

1245
01:10:50,866 --> 01:10:52,595
You better have insurance.

1246
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:11,076
There's my girl.

1247
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:17,315
Come on.

1248
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,891
l want to show you off
to my friends.

1249
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,091
Looking good, buddy.

1250
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:21,261
Looking good.

1251
01:11:21,497 --> 01:11:22,930
Yeah, you too.

1252
01:11:23,165 --> 01:11:24,996
Oh, by the way,
l talked to Cristabel ...

1253
01:11:25,234 --> 01:11:27,759
and l smoothed everything over,
so she's really excited to see you.

1254
01:11:28,003 --> 01:11:30,130
Although l should warn you,
she's a little bit, you know.

1255
01:11:31,807 --> 01:11:34,503
Oh Coopie...

1256
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:35,869
What can l say?

1257
01:11:36,111 --> 01:11:38,204
l've always wanted to be a bride.

1258
01:11:39,114 --> 01:11:41,878
Every little girl's dream, right?

1259
01:11:42,885 --> 01:11:43,909
Right.

1260
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,388
You don't have to say a thing.

1261
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,486
June told me what happened.

1262
01:11:52,194 --> 01:11:54,424
-She did?
-Yep.

1263
01:11:54,763 --> 01:11:57,789
You were just being protective
of my little Junie.

1264
01:11:58,033 --> 01:12:00,399
Yes, right.

1265
01:12:00,803 --> 01:12:03,533
l may have misjudged you,
Nate Cooper.

1266
01:12:05,574 --> 01:12:06,802
Oops.

1267
01:12:07,443 --> 01:12:08,375
Don't worry.

1268
01:12:08,611 --> 01:12:10,078
lt wasn't a smelly one.

1269
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:12,845
l can tell by the way they sound.

1270
01:12:13,082 --> 01:12:14,549
That's good.

1271
01:12:19,488 --> 01:12:20,785
Shit!

1272
01:12:21,023 --> 01:12:22,388
Sorry.

1273
01:12:24,393 --> 01:12:25,360
...listen.

1274
01:12:25,594 --> 01:12:28,688
l read somewhere about white
wine getting out red wine.

1275
01:12:28,931 --> 01:12:29,522
Okay.

1276
01:12:29,765 --> 01:12:32,165
l don't know if that---

1277
01:12:32,434 --> 01:12:34,425
Oh, god.

1278
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:35,932
lt's not working!

1279
01:12:36,338 --> 01:12:37,635
lt's not working!

1280
01:12:37,873 --> 01:12:38,339
lt's not working!

1281
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:39,006
l have to go.

1282
01:12:41,744 --> 01:12:44,804
You know, l think Grace Kelly
and l need a minute.

1283
01:12:45,047 --> 01:12:46,514
-Come on.
-Bye.

1284
01:13:10,139 --> 01:13:11,629
Oh hey there, little buddy.

1285
01:13:12,107 --> 01:13:16,100
Just about to finish these pesto
gorgonzola torta rings.

1286
01:13:16,345 --> 01:13:19,610
Why don't you have a taste
and let me know what you think.

1287
01:13:26,155 --> 01:13:27,486
They're wonderful.

1288
01:13:28,123 --> 01:13:28,987
Of course.

1289
01:13:29,224 --> 01:13:30,316
Absolutely wonderful.

1290
01:13:30,559 --> 01:13:31,821
You're wonderful.

1291
01:13:32,061 --> 01:13:34,154
Everything you do is wonderful.

1292
01:13:35,564 --> 01:13:37,498
l've never seen June happier.

1293
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,797
Thanks, pal.

1294
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:42,000
Don't mention it.

1295
01:13:42,237 --> 01:13:45,798
lt was a lot of work, but once
l put my mind to something...

1296
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:47,633
l always get what l want.

1297
01:13:48,744 --> 01:13:49,506
You know what?

1298
01:13:49,745 --> 01:13:50,507
Fine.

1299
01:13:50,746 --> 01:13:52,941
l'm happy for you guys, okay?

1300
01:13:53,182 --> 01:13:53,773
l was wrong.

1301
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:56,610
You and June actually
make a great couple.

1302
01:13:57,052 --> 01:13:59,987
l know. lsn't she amazing?

1303
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:02,614
Yeah.

1304
01:14:03,058 --> 01:14:04,582
Yeah, she really is.

1305
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,594
Now that she's
got some confidence in herself

1306
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:09,695
there are plenty of guys
who'd love to have her.

1307
01:14:09,932 --> 01:14:11,729
New teeth, hair

1308
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:14,760
She's almost beautiful now.

1309
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:22,573
Women like June are just
so much more...grateful.

1310
01:14:24,313 --> 01:14:26,406
Yeah, she worked hard.

1311
01:14:26,982 --> 01:14:31,180
And l think tonight,
it's finally time for her reward.

1312
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,819
You know what l mean?

1313
01:14:38,727 --> 01:14:39,887
What's wrong?

1314
01:14:40,129 --> 01:14:41,858
Did l use too much basil?

1315
01:14:55,277 --> 01:14:56,904
Nate, what are you doing?

1316
01:14:59,948 --> 01:15:02,075
Deep breaths.

1317
01:15:03,252 --> 01:15:04,810
One one-thousand...

1318
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,577
Two one thousand...

1319
01:15:13,028 --> 01:15:13,858
All right, everyone.

1320
01:15:14,096 --> 01:15:14,926
Party's over.

1321
01:15:15,164 --> 01:15:16,631
Out.

1322
01:15:23,338 --> 01:15:25,397
One grain of happiness.

1323
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:28,469
One grain of happiness
in my entire life.

1324
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:30,679
l understand you're upset.

1325
01:15:30,913 --> 01:15:32,881
But Johann happens to be the devil!

1326
01:15:33,115 --> 01:15:33,843
Shut up.

1327
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:34,981
The night of date five,

1328
01:15:35,217 --> 01:15:37,708
when it's okay for
a consenting female adult

1329
01:15:37,953 --> 01:15:40,353
to have sex without
being considered slutty...

1330
01:15:40,589 --> 01:15:41,055
June.

1331
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:42,382
The night l was going t
become a non-virgin

1332
01:15:42,624 --> 01:15:44,922
-and leave this freak fest behind.
-June. June, listen.

1333
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,457
Shut up!

1334
01:15:48,997 --> 01:15:51,090
l helped you.

1335
01:15:52,935 --> 01:15:53,993
l could have shot you down

1336
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:56,500
and Cristabel would never
have returned your calls.

1337
01:15:56,739 --> 01:15:58,070
He doesn't love you.

1338
01:16:00,809 --> 01:16:03,209
He said that you would be grateful.

1339
01:16:03,512 --> 01:16:05,207
l am grateful!

1340
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,845
You don't get it, do you.

1341
01:16:14,356 --> 01:16:15,721
l don't know.

1342
01:16:16,225 --> 01:16:20,924
l've never even had a boyfriend.

1343
01:16:21,497 --> 01:16:22,691
He doesn't get you.

1344
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:23,898
He doesn't deserve you.

1345
01:16:24,133 --> 01:16:26,897
Oh and you think people get
what they deserve in life.

1346
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:31,032
You think they get
the fairy tale ending.

1347
01:16:31,273 --> 01:16:31,830
l don't know.

1348
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:33,507
Maybe, yeah.

1349
01:16:33,742 --> 01:16:36,142
You know, if they're
not willing to compromise.

1350
01:16:36,378 --> 01:16:38,778
lf they're not willing
to settle for anything less.

1351
01:16:44,253 --> 01:16:47,950
Well, knowing what you are is
also knowing what you're not.

1352
01:16:51,393 --> 01:16:52,917
l'm not the girl ...

1353
01:16:54,196 --> 01:16:56,096
...the guy runs to,

1354
01:16:56,899 --> 01:16:59,561
to tell his feelings for,
all out of breath.

1355
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:01,461
Why couldn't you be?

1356
01:17:01,703 --> 01:17:06,106
Because not everybody gets
that out of breath sort of moment.

1357
01:17:07,309 --> 01:17:08,742
That's okay.

1358
01:17:10,879 --> 01:17:11,971
Most of us are just happy...

1359
01:17:12,214 --> 01:17:14,341
... to date a guy
who brushes his teeth.

1360
01:17:18,353 --> 01:17:20,719
That's the thing
about fairy tales, Nate.

1361
01:17:24,693 --> 01:17:26,285
They're just not true.

1362
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:41,805
Nate, she "s big girl.

1363
01:17:42,044 --> 01:17:45,172
Yeah. l understand that.

1364
01:17:46,381 --> 01:17:48,212
lt's sweet how protective
you've been...

1365
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:51,078
...but if June wants to be
withJohann tonight...

1366
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,584
...then that's
her decision to make.

1367
01:17:55,691 --> 01:17:58,455
Anyway, it's not like she agreed
to marry him or anything.

1368
01:17:58,694 --> 01:18:00,787
lt's just one night.

1369
01:18:01,964 --> 01:18:04,831
Well, somehow l don't take
comfort in that knowledge.

1370
01:18:06,168 --> 01:18:07,863
Relax, Nate.

1371
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:09,603
You did it.

1372
01:18:09,938 --> 01:18:11,929
You found someone for June.

1373
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:14,867
And a deal's a deal.

1374
01:18:16,378 --> 01:18:18,573
Now that June gets
what she wants...

1375
01:18:18,814 --> 01:18:20,475
...we can get what you want.

1376
01:18:22,784 --> 01:18:24,809
Oops, l forgot.

1377
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:27,682
l have a confession to make.

1378
01:18:29,091 --> 01:18:30,854
l was kind of testing you tonight.

1379
01:18:32,694 --> 01:18:33,922
What do you mean?

1380
01:18:34,162 --> 01:18:35,459
This tacky dress...

1381
01:18:35,697 --> 01:18:38,564
acting drunk and anxious
to get married...

1382
01:18:39,034 --> 01:18:41,298
and spilling
the wine all over my dress.

1383
01:18:41,703 --> 01:18:43,261
lt was all an act.

1384
01:18:44,339 --> 01:18:45,397
Why?

1385
01:18:45,641 --> 01:18:47,836
Well, when you really
care about someone...

1386
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:50,271
...you're willing to
overlook their flaws.

1387
01:18:50,946 --> 01:18:56,179
And l just wanted to make sure
that you liked me for me.

1388
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:02,914
Come with me.

1389
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:04,887
l got something to show you.

1390
01:19:37,292 --> 01:19:41,922
Here's to
finding your perfect match.

1391
01:19:54,142 --> 01:19:55,507
Pick one.

1392
01:20:04,086 --> 01:20:06,554
You have excellent taste,
Mister Cooper.

1393
01:20:06,788 --> 01:20:07,777
Thanks.

1394
01:20:08,023 --> 01:20:10,389
So why don't you
go light some candles.

1395
01:20:10,726 --> 01:20:13,160
June has some
in the dresser in her room.

1396
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:22,561
So was your father a baker
by any chance?

1397
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,334
No. Why?

1398
01:20:27,676 --> 01:20:30,804
"Cause you've
got such great buns.

1399
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,455
l want to become a non-virgin.

1400
01:21:27,202 --> 01:21:29,466
Don't make any sudden moves.

1401
01:21:29,704 --> 01:21:32,400
She's trying to strangle herself
with her hood.

1402
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:39,141
l just wanted to give her this.

1403
01:21:44,453 --> 01:21:47,854
Thanks....l guess.

1404
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:24,687
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

1405
01:22:32,534 --> 01:22:33,865
Listen, l think...

1406
01:22:34,102 --> 01:22:35,899
Oh...okay...

1407
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:42,307
Can you please
put your robe back on?

1408
01:22:42,744 --> 01:22:43,642
Okay.

1409
01:22:43,879 --> 01:22:46,905
lt's the first time anyone's
asked me to do that.

1410
01:22:47,282 --> 01:22:48,544
l'm sure.

1411
01:22:50,352 --> 01:22:52,946
l think that l just want to talk.

1412
01:22:53,622 --> 01:22:55,351
Okay, sure.

1413
01:22:57,526 --> 01:22:58,424
Nate...

1414
01:22:58,660 --> 01:22:59,957
...you can turn around now.

1415
01:23:00,195 --> 01:23:04,154
Right. Turning around.

1416
01:23:11,907 --> 01:23:17,004
lt's just...why me?

1417
01:23:17,312 --> 01:23:18,609
What do you mean?

1418
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,613
There are a million guys
who would kill to be

1419
01:23:23,852 --> 01:23:26,685
sitting here with you right now.

1420
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:28,781
Why did you pick me?

1421
01:23:29,024 --> 01:23:30,514
l didn't pick you.

1422
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:32,850
-You didn't?
-No.

1423
01:23:33,428 --> 01:23:37,296
lt was fate. Magic. Serendipity.

1424
01:23:37,532 --> 01:23:42,834
Right, and that's what l thought,
too, but why did you think so?

1425
01:23:43,071 --> 01:23:46,268
Well, you know, after all these
years of not seeing each other...

1426
01:23:46,508 --> 01:23:48,703
and then how we literally ran
into each other at the beach.

1427
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:51,242
Oh, about that.

1428
01:23:51,947 --> 01:23:53,642
l tracked you down.

1429
01:23:53,982 --> 01:23:57,042
and l found out you were
going to be at the beach that day.

1430
01:23:57,285 --> 01:23:59,276
And l followed you.

1431
01:24:00,655 --> 01:24:01,622
You stalked me.

1432
01:24:01,856 --> 01:24:04,848
Stalked is a big word.

1433
01:24:05,093 --> 01:24:08,119
Uh, listen...

1434
01:24:09,297 --> 01:24:11,424
Ever since the first grade...

1435
01:24:12,634 --> 01:24:16,764
l thought you were the girl
that l was meant to be with

1436
01:24:17,639 --> 01:24:20,506
And now you think you
made a mistake?

1437
01:24:20,742 --> 01:24:22,232
Let's put it this way.

1438
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:28,641
l think l gave the valentine
to the right girl.

1439
01:24:30,885 --> 01:24:33,046
Oh my god.

1440
01:24:33,588 --> 01:24:35,647
You have to go tell her.

1441
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:37,886
Are you sure?

1442
01:24:38,827 --> 01:24:39,987
Nate, l'll be fine.

1443
01:24:40,228 --> 01:24:42,321
lt's not like l have trouble
getting dates.

1444
01:24:43,665 --> 01:24:45,064
Yeah, you're probably right.

1445
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,996
Um...okay.

1446
01:24:49,137 --> 01:24:49,694
Go.

1447
01:24:49,938 --> 01:24:51,371
Okay.

1448
01:24:53,408 --> 01:24:55,273
Way to go, June.

1449
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,884
June?

1450
01:25:27,442 --> 01:25:29,205
l'm so sorry.

1451
01:26:13,688 --> 01:26:15,053
Don't say a word.

1452
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:21,686
l came here not to tell you
that Johann doesn't deserve you

1453
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:23,830
which you already
figured out for yourself.

1454
01:26:24,065 --> 01:26:27,034
And not to tell you
that l am in love with you.

1455
01:26:27,402 --> 01:26:28,869
Which l am.

1456
01:26:29,204 --> 01:26:30,694
Desperately.

1457
01:26:32,073 --> 01:26:32,801
My entire life,

1458
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:35,407
something has been holding me back
from falling in love.

1459
01:26:35,643 --> 01:26:37,372
And l thought it was Cristabel.

1460
01:26:37,612 --> 01:26:44,484
But l realized that l've just
been fumbling my way to you.

1461
01:26:45,186 --> 01:26:47,416
My last girlfriend,
her name was Jane.

1462
01:26:47,655 --> 01:26:49,589
That's one letter off.

1463
01:26:49,858 --> 01:26:50,654
l don't even know
what that means.

1464
01:26:50,892 --> 01:26:51,620
That's dumb.

1465
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:52,690
l'm sorry.

1466
01:26:52,927 --> 01:26:53,951
Listen.

1467
01:26:54,262 --> 01:26:56,127
l don't deserve you.

1468
01:26:57,432 --> 01:27:01,926
Because l didn't take the time
to see who you were.

1469
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:10,639
And you have to know
that you're the girl.

1470
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,910
You're the girl that
the guy runs to.

1471
01:27:17,185 --> 01:27:19,085
You're the girl.

1472
01:27:21,222 --> 01:27:25,716
You're...you're out of breath.
