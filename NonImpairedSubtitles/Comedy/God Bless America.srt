2
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,778
In order to get outside

3
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,322
and get this guy in a rear naked choke,
and he passes out.

4
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,824
- Oh, fuck. Really?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,742
- That's terrible.
- No, it was awesome.

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,330
I'm Robbie Barkley, and you're
watching "Hollywood Extreme."

7
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,666
And another young man
comes forward with allegations

8
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,960
that he was sexually molested
by Michael Jackson

9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,254
while visiting the Neverland Ranch.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,673
His parents claimed
to keep the secret under wraps

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,007
because they loved his music.

12
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,676
Why don't they
just leave him alone?

13
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,386
All Michael ever wanted to do
was make people happy.

14
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,554
That's all he wanted to do.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,763
You know, people don't know
what happened

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,056
between him and those kids.
They weren't there.

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,391
They're just a bunch of jealous haters.

18
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,727
I hate people who say bad things
about Michael Jackson.

19
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,936
I fucking hate haters!

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,813
I hate my neighbors.

21
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,023
The constant cacophony of stupidity

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,152
that pours from their apartment
is absolutely soul-crushing.

23
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,445
And you know what?
And I looked him right in the eye.

24
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,572
I go, "You're retarded," and then I
punched him right in the face.

25
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,699
It doesn't matter
how politely I ask them

26
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,410
to practice some common courtesy.

27
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:21,748
They're incapable of comprehending
that their actions affect other people.

28
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,168
They have a complete lack
of consideration for anyone else

29
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,212
and an overly developed sense
of entitlement.

30
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,675
They have no decency,
no concern, no shame.

31
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,218
They do not care that I suffer

32
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,472
from debilitating migraines
and insomnia.

33
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,141
They do not care
that I have to go to work

34
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,602
or that I want to kill them.

35
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,605
I know it's not normal to want to kill.

36
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:49,025
But I also know
that I am no longer normal.

37
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,611
I hate that baby.

38
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,823
I hate that baby's fat, stupid face.

39
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,744
Hey, buddy. What's wrong?

40
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,038
A lot.

41
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,207
I'm Robbie Barkley,
and this has been "Hollywood"...

42
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,086
Take it easy, bro.

43
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,838
I'm not your bro.

44
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,716
Oh, God!

45
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,136
Please don't shoot!
I have a baby!

46
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,791
Look at this, look at this.
This is just tragic.

47
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,459
Oh, God.

48
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,753
What is wrong with Lindsay Lohan?

49
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,506
She used to have a lot of potential.
I don't know what happened.

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,093
It's the most
hilarious ringtone ever!

51
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,095
Just text P-I-G-F-A-R...

52
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,347
Controversial Reverend
Artemus Goran

53
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,765
and his supporters
are back in the news.

54
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,394
This time protesting
at a cancer victim's funeral.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,021
God hates fags! God hates fags!

56
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,231
God hates fags!

57
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,068
- VELOCitea.
- VELOCitea.

58
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,361
It's in your face.

59
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,949
Coming up on "Tuff Gurlz"...

60
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,454
Listen, you... skank,
don't you...

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,418
Did you... poop in my food?!

62
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,837
What? What?

63
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,256
You bitch!

64
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:44,015
I think she's a traitor
and should be tried for treason.

65
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,393
Look, just because
she lost her son in the war

66
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,520
does not give her the right

67
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,315
to disrespect
all of our brave sons and daughters

68
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,734
who are serving our country right now.

69
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,987
Frankly, I think
her son's better off dead,

70
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,573
because now he doesn't have
to see the jerk

71
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,199
that his mother has turned into.

72
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,784
And, now, I know, I know.

73
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,120
Before you all start
flying off the handle with,

74
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,123
"Oh, Mike, how can you be
so heartless?"

75
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,709
let me remind you,
there's three things I love...

76
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,420
my mother, my country,

77
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,256
and the men and women
who fight the fight over there

78
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,799
so we don't have to fight it here.

79
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,009
That's it for "Fuller Talk."

80
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,344
You've heard the end of the statement.

81
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,012
Remember to order
all your "Fuller Talk" products

82
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,472
at the 800 number
at the bottom of the screen.

83
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,390
We've still got plenty
of T-shirts available.

84
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,934
Remember, two for...

85
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,269
The boys were caught
after setting the homeless man on fire

86
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,272
and then posting video footage
of the attack online.

87
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,107
Dumb Nutz!

88
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,694
Dumb Nutz!

89
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,705
Dude, are you all right?

90
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,957
Dumb Nutz!

91
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,125
We have a press

92
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,420
that just gives him a free pass
because he's black

93
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,797
so he doesn't have to work hard

94
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,925
like the rest of us
who play by the rules.

95
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,720
That... is the world we live in,
ladies and gentlemen.

97
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,391

00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,847
You're wasting our time, Steven.

Do you have a mental problem?

No.

115
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,818
Go get some psychiatric help.

116
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,279
I'll see you in Hollywood.

117
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,531
I can't answer that question.

118
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,576
He also killed
his wife and mother,

119
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,871
bringing the total
to 16 dead and 33 wounded,

120
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,623
all in one tragic afternoon.

121
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,418
A former altar boy and Eagle Scout,

122
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,922
he climbed the University of Texas
clock tower in 1966

123
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,884
and, using his high-powered
rifles and Marine training,

124
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,929
he became America's first spree killer.

125
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,730
Meet Steven Clark,
the newest star

126
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,732
from last night's "American Superstarz."

127
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,400
Now, if you missed the show,

128
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,277
you might want
to plug your ears for this one.

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,413
That's my favorite part of the show,
when they have the crazies on.

133
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,664
I know.

134
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,250
I feel so guilty for laughing,
but it is so funny.

135
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,378
Wake up! This is ridicu...

136
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,189
- Good morning.
- Yeah?

137
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,775
- Who is it?
- You blocked me in again.

138
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,152
You blocked yourself in, bro.

139
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,905
Okay.

140
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,908
Could you move your car?
I'm running kind of late.

141
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:33,828
Now?

142
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,122
Yeah.

143
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,707
Tell him to park his car
away from us.

144
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,296
Fine.

145
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,506
Do you know
where the remote is?

146
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,843
Dude, you need
to leave yourself more room.

147
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,469
Right.

148
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,012
In fact, 40% of adult Americans

149
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,765
cannot read
above a fourth-grade level.

150
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,975
When high schoolers were asked

151
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,269
what living American
they would want to be,

152
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,604
the majority of girls
answered Kim Kardashian,

153
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,897
and the majority of boys

154
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,109
answered any male cast member
on the "Jersey Shore."

155
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,361
We are listener-supported radio.

156
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,863
We can only stay on the air with...

157
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,533
I'm really late, Ed.

158
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,217
How about you remember
how to park your fucking car?

159
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,306
Hey, if he plays this well
with one testicle,

160
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,183
maybe the whole team should get cancer.

161
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,437
Send all angry letters
and cards to the E-Man here.

162
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,981
What?
Okay, well, I'm the bad guy, all right?

163
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,774
What? I'm just saying
what you're all thinking.

164
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,443
This ain't your daddy's sports show.

165
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,571
The mucho macho grande
burrito machismo experience.

166
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,780
It's extreme.

167
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,869
This is my favorite part
of "American Superstarz,"

168
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,038
when they have the retards on.

169
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,248
- I know what you mean.
- This thing is great!

170
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,166
We're giving you

171
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,711
backstage passes, and all you have to do
is touch her on the tit

172
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,338
and then maybe box a little bit.

173
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,881
Jesus, how long have you
worked on this show,

174
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,674
and you don't know
how to screen the dirty girls?

175
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,259
We want to see blood,
we want to see tears,

176
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,595
we want to see one
of you whores get knocked out.

177
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,681
Hit her in her defective tit.

178
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,271
Hi.

179
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,981
What's up? You called.

180
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,943
I was just trying to figure out
what time to pick up Ava tomorrow.

181
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,111
Ava says she doesn't want to visit you.

182
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,655
Yeah, well, she's going to.

183
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,365
Frank, I can't make her.

184
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,992
Yes, you can. You're the adult.

185
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,494
Put her on the phone.

186
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,287
All right.

187
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,039
Hey, Ava, honey...

188
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,749
It's your dad.

189
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,085
I'm doing something important.

190
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,128
Well, maybe you can press "pause"?

191
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,839
But I'm almost to the next level!

192
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,841
Hit "pause."

193
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,597
Hi, Daddy.

194
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,642
Hey, kid!
You excited to come see me tomorrow?

195
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,185
I want to stay with mommy.

196
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,520
Why?

197
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,232
Because there's nothing to do
at your house.

198
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,110
What do you mean there's nothing to do?
We do lots of stuff.

199
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,738
We play in the park, we go to the zoo,
we make art.

200
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,490
Your house is boring!

201
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,284
Well, you're coming to see me.

202
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,785
Do you have a present for me?

203
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,328
No.

204
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,664
Hey.

205
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,374
Where'd she go?

206
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,584
She just handed the phone back.

207
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,796
You know, I should have never let you
move her out of town.

208
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:35,009
Frank, she didn't like to come visit you
even when we lived in Syracuse.

209
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,802
All right, well, Alison,

210
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,013
see what you can do
about changing her mind, okay?

211
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,056
Bye.

212
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,641
So, we're done talking?

213
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,312
No, Brad. Oh, hey, listen...

214
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:50,649
I'm not sure I remembered to tell you,
but...

215
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,401
Brad and I are getting married.

216
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,863
Well, tell Brad...

217
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,240
when he's down there
to smell my balls, all right?

218
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,411
Frank says hi.

219
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,496
Tell him hi back.

220
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,789
Bye, Ava!

221
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,294
Alison, get her to come, okay?

222
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,587
It means everything to me.

223
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,505
God, Frank, I'll try, all right?

224
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,923
You are such a drama queen.

225
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,842
Drama queen! Drama queen!

226
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,303
Daddy is a drama queen!

227
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,889
Yeah, thanks.

228
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,940
Hi, Karen.

229
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,567
Hi.

230
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,030
Here's that book
I was telling you about.

231
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,407
Thanks.

232
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,083
True, true.
But you know what I was thinking?

233
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,293
If he plays that good
with only one testicle,

234
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,961
maybe the whole team should get cancer.

235
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,797
Oh, killed it, boss!

236
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,173
I can't believe you said that!

237
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,218
Oh, come on, I'm just saying
what you're all thinking.

238
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,140
Oh, my God!
I feel so bad for him. Is he for real?

239
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,350
Yes, he's for real.

240
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,227
He was on "Fat Boy" this morning.

241
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,604
That's real all right... real bad!

242
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,941
Oh! You're real bad!

243
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,360
I think he's good.

244
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,694
Not!

245
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,030
You scared me. You had me.

246
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,620
I think I hurt my back
on that one!

247
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,001
You probably like him secretly.

248
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,837
See? Right there.

249
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,048
♪ Do you like the things
that life is... ♪

250
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,509
Here comes his pitchy part.
Yeah.

251
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,971

252

00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,111

255
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,030
So, what about you, Frank?

256
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,325
Did you see that freak
on "American Superstarz" last night?

257
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,577
What?

258
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,329
Last night, the freak
on "American Superstarz"?

259
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,789
No.

260
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,209
I mean, yes,
I saw that guy accidentally.

261
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,880
I don't watch "American Superstarz."

262
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,423
You don't watch it, but you saw him.

263
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,801
Yeah, right.
What, are you too good for the show?

264
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,512
Yeah, I'm too good for a karaoke contest

265
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,723
that makes stars
out of people with no talent.

266
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,766
You can't say that, dude!

267
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,643
Some of those kids have real talent.

268
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,353
No, they don't.

269
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,982
They have good pitch.
They're relatively clean.

270
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,068
They're non-threatening
to little girls and old ladies.

271
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,695
They have the ability to stand in line

272
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,616
with a stadium full of other
desperate and confused people.

273
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,910
But I assure you, they are talent-free.

274
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,829
Yeah, well, I bet 32 million people
would disagree with you, bro,

275
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,999
'cause that's how many people called in
to vote last year on the finale.

276
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,920
I wish I was a super-genius inventor

277
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,796
and could come up with a way
to make a telephone

278
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,007
into an explosive device
that was triggered

279
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,636
by the "American Superstarz"
voting number.

280
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,347
The battery could explode
and leave a mark on the face

281
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:12,559
so I could know who to avoid talking to
before they even talked.

282
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,478
Yeah, I could look and say,

283
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,314
"Mm, no, you're not gonna be
saying anything

284
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,441
that's gonna add any value to my life."

285
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,818
Yeah, but it's funny.
I mean, you gotta admit that.

286
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,071
Steven Clark, that's funny shit, Frank.

287
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,366
It's not nice to laugh
at someone who's not all there.

288
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,910
It's the same type
of freak-show distraction

289
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,830
that comes along every time
a mighty empire starts collapsing.

290
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,542
"American Superstarz"
is the new Colosseum.

291
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,835
And I won't participate
in watching a show

292
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,923
where the weak are torn apart
every week for our entertainment.

293
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,758
I'm done, really.

294
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,010
Everything is so cruel now.

295
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,304
I just want it all to stop.

296
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,181
I feel sorry
for Jennifer Aniston.

297
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,849
Oh, yeah, it's tragic.

298
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,768
You know, and I don't care
how many foreigners she adopts,

299
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,228
I do not like Angelina Jolie.

300
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,437
Me either!

301
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,440
I mean, nobody talks
about anything any more.

302
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,318
They just regurgitate
everything they see on TV

303
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,321
or hear on the radio
or watch on the web.

304
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,157
When was the last time you had
a real conversation with someone

305
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,409
without somebody texting

306
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,870
or looking at a screen
or a monitor over your head?

307
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,206
You know, a conversation
about something

308
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:22,504
that wasn't celebrities, gossip, sports,
or pop politics?

309
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,047
You know, something...

310
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,467
something important
or something personal?

311
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,888
You know what?

312
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,016
"Tate and Jeff" were talking
about that this morning.

313
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,270
They were saying how their freedom
of speech is in jeopardy.

314
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,063
What, you don't listen to them, either?

315
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,690
No, I don't.

316
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,569
What, are you more of
a "K.T. and the Snake Pit" type of guy?

317
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,696
'Cause those guys are pussies,
Frank, all right?

318
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,990
And they stole everything they got
from "Tate and Jeff."

319
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,367
I really don't like any of them.

320
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,161
How can you say that, bro?

321
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,871
So, maybe they're not
"politically correct,"

322
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,706
but it's funny, Frank.

323
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,585
Well, seeing how as I'm not afraid
of foreigners or people with vaginae,

324
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,046
I guess I'm just not
their target audience.

325
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,213
You don't get it.

326
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,299
If you got it,
you wouldn't be so offended.

327
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,718
Oh, I get it, and I am offended.

328
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,136
Not because I got a problem

329
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,848
with bitter, predictable,
whiny millionaire disc jockeys

330
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,477
complaining about celebrities
or how tough their life is,

331
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,771
while I live in an apartment
with paper-thin walls

332
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,272
next to a couple of Neanderthals

333
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,399
who, instead of a baby,
decided to give birth

334
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,944
to some kind of nocturnal
civil defense air-raid siren

335
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,906
that goes off every fucking night
like it's Pearl Harbor.

336
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,617
I'm not offended that they act
like it's my responsibility

337
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:38,163
to protect their rights to pick
on the weak like pack animals

338
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,166
or that we're supposed to support
their freedom of speech

339
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,460
when they don't give a fuck
about yours or mine.

340
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,004
So you're against freedom of speech now?

341
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,798
That's in the Bill of Rights, man.

342
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:54,179
I would defend their freedom of speech
if I thought it was in jeopardy.

343
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,931
I would defend their freedom of speech

344
00:16:56,057 --> 00:17:01,353
to tell uninspired, bigoted blow-job,
gay-bashing racist and rape jokes

345
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,940
all under the guise of being edgy,
but that's not the edge.

346
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,316
That's what sells.

347
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,862
They couldn't possibly pander any harder
or be more commercially mainstream,

348
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,491
because this is the "Oh, no,
you didn't say that" generation,

349
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,452
where a shocking comment
has more weight than the truth.

350
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,498
No one has any shame any more,
and we're supposed to celebrate it.

351
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,042
I saw a woman throw a used tampon

352
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
at another woman last night
on network television,

353
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,006
a network that bills itself
as "Today's Woman's" channel.

354
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,136
Kids beat each other blind
and post it on YouTube.

355
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,929
I mean, do you remember

356
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,641
when eating rats and maggots
on "Survivor" was shocking?

357
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,269
It all seems so quaint now.

358
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,938
I'm sure the girls
from "Two Girls, One Cup"

359
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,275
are gonna have their own
dating show on VH 1 any day now.

360
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,486
I mean, why have a civilization any more

361
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,490
if we no longer are interested
in being civilized?

362
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,829
Frank...

363
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,748
Can I see you in my office?

364
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,333
Yeah, sure.

365
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,797
Come on in. Have a seat.

366
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,265
- You know Ronald from HR.
- Yeah, yeah.

367
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,851
- Hello.
- Hi.

368
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,023
Frank, there's no easy way
to bring this up,

369
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,650
so... let's just cut to the chase.

370
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,488
What is your relationship
to Karen in reception?

371
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,491
Frank, what is your relationship
to Karen in reception?

372
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,411
Oh, well, I just started
talking to her recently.

373
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,662
She's very nice.

374
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,499
We sit together at lunch.

375
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,834
Is something wrong?

376
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,544
What is she accused of?

377
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,796
I find it hard to believe

378
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,881
that she would ever do anything
to hurt the company.

379
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,716
I see.

380
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,638
Did you send Karen
flowers to her home?

381
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,181
Yeah.

382
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,183
Yeah, I did.

383
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,560
Why?

384
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,687
Well, she said
she was having a bad day,

385
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,607
and I thought it would
make her feel better.

386
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,526
How did you get her address?

387
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,737
I looked it up.

388
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,656
I went in the records.

389
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,700
You understand that's a huge violation
of company policy, right?

390
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,119
Well, yeah, but I didn't want
to have them delivered to the office.

391
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,371
I didn't want to embarrass...

392
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,122
Frank, I'm going to have to let you go.

393
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,208
You're kidding, right?

394
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,335
No, Frank, I'm not kidding.

395
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,712
This company has
a strict no-tolerance policy

396
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,507
about harassment
in the workplace, and...

397
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,969
Well, Karen doesn't feel safe
with you employed here.

398
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,264
She's never said anything
like that to me.

399
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,349
Why don't I go talk to her,
and then we'll...

400
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,852
Frank, listen to me for a second.

401
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,146
Now...

402
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,193
I want you to leave quietly.

403
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,655
Don't harass Karen or anyone else
on the staff as you leave.

404
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,908
Your severance checks
will be mailed to you.

405
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,369
This is ridiculous.
I've been here 11 years.

406
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,454
I know, Frank.
I know it's ridiculous.

407
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,248
But it's not me.

408
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,000
It's the higher-ups.

409
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,836
Let me know if you need
a recommendation.

410
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,982
Would you ask her for my book back?

411
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,276
He wants his book back.

412
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,738
Thank you, Danny.

413
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:07,307
A tumor this size
is very dangerous.

414
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:15,732
Unfortunately, surgery to remove it
can be just as dangerous as leaving it.

415
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,527
I advise you to discuss this
with your family.

416
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,614
I'm sorry.

417
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,282
Oh, gotta take this.

418
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,744
Yeah.

419
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,164
What?

420
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,249
I wanted the one with the moon roof.

421
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,043
The... The... The...

422
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,088
No, like the one we test-drove.

423
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,133
I'm going to fuck you.

424
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,385
I'm gonna come down to the dealership

425
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,512
and I'm gonna fuck you in the ass,
you understand?

426
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,431
I'm gonna come down there,
I'm gonna rip your cock off,

427
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,433
I'm gonna shove it right up...
No, you know what?

428
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,312
I'm gonna tear the cock off
of that giant purple gorilla

429
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,148
and shove that up your ass.

430
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,734
Yes, maybe then you should look
into a moon roof.

431
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,278
Yeah, that'd be great.

432
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,447
Thank you!

433
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,997
Do you have any family?

434
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,374
No, not really.

435
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,926
Sir?

436
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,095
You can't be here.

437
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,222
This Tuesday,

438
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,142
forget everything you know
about bowling.

439
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,103
This is bowling on steroids!

00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,859
Bowling Beatdown Raw!

441
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,903
You think you know bowling?

442
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,947
Suck it!

443
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,826
All right, people, make me happy.
What do you got? Give me something.

444
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,287
We got this dude Steven Clark

I live in Virginia Beach,

00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,765
Say something, honey. Come on.

478
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,768
- The camera's on.
- I wanted an Escalade.

479
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,020
- You said...
- Take it back then!

480
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,106
I wanted an Escalade!

481
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,358
- Daddy can take it ba...
- Get away from me!

482
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,694
It's my job as a parent
to make her happy,

483
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,029
so I screwed up this time,
because she's not happy.

484
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,074
That's the evidence of it.
If she's not happy, I screwed up.

485
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,495
So, tell us all about Chloe!

486
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,291
Chloe is not just my daughter,
she is my best friend.

487
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,834
Mother!

488
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,086
They're asking me.
I'm very popular.

489
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,671
Everyone loves me
because my family's rich

490
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,131
and because I'm so pretty.

491
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,842
This is the biggest day of my life,
and you're... it up!

492
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,927
Are you serious?!
You're so stupid!

493
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,014
You're not even doing anything!
I'm doing all the work!

494
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,101
What the... is that, Dad?!
What the... is that?!

495
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,520
You know what?
Let's do this without them around.

496
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,315
No, you can stay.
I don't care about you, okay?

497
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,649
All I...

498
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,946
- Hey.
- I hate mommy!

499
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,573
I hate mommy!

500
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,033
What are you talking about?

501
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,453
She got me a Blackberry,
and I wanted an iPhone.

502
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,122
Okay. Okay, honey.

503
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,957
Let me talk to your mommy.

504
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,001
Hello?

505
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,336
You got her a Blackberry?

506
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,172
Look, Frank, I don't want to hear it.
I feel bad enough as it is.

507
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,257
I thought it's what she really wanted.

508
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,260
No, I mean, why would you get her
a Blackberry or an iPhone?

509
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,179
I don't need this right now.

510
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,933
Did you talk to her
about me picking her up?

511
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,186
Ava, princess, do you want
to go see your dad?

512
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,938
I want an iPhone!
I don't want my dad!

513
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,273
I hate going there!
I never want to see him again!

514
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,943
I want an iPhone!
I want an iPhone! I want an iPhone!

515
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,861
Frank, I gotta go.

516
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,502
No, you can stay. You can stay.

517
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,588
I don't care about you, okay?
All I care about is my party.

518
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,216
- Turn that off.
- Dad, listen to me!

519
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,885
This is the biggest day of my life,
and you're... it up!

520
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:18,928
Are you serious?!

521
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,306
You're so stupid!
You're not even doing anything!

522
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,266
I'm doing all the work!

523
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,268
What the... is that, Dad?!

524
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,103
What the... is that?!

525
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,480
Dad, listen to me!
You're not listening to me!

526
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,774
You're just talking
to the... cameras!

527
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,613
I don't care about gift bags...

No, I don't want that!

Weird drifter guy?

Look, I know you're in there!

576
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,860
Hi.

577
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,028
What are you doing?

578
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,404
Nothing.

579
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,990
Great! Me too.

580
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,243
I'm Roxy. What's your name?

581
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,411
Frank.

582
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:39,332
Great! It's really excellent
to meet you, Frank.

583
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,876
Tell me all about it.

584
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,919
About what?

585
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,464
Did the bitch cry?

586
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,716
Yeah.

587
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,762
That is... fantastic!

588
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,848
Oh, God, I wish I could have
seen it up close!

589
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,811
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Somebody just made that.

590
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,647
Jumping Jesus Christ, Frank!

591
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,608
Live it up!
This is the best day ever!

592
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,942
Who are you killing next?

593
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,444
Do you take requests?

594
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,405
'Cause I was thinking
maybe some Kardashians.

595
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,658
My gym coach.

596
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,159
People who give high fives.

597
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,994
Really any jock.

598
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,454
Twihards.

599
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,832
People who talk about "punk rock."

600
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,460
- Who else really rips my cock off?
- Get off the bed.

601
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,629
Oh, Mormons
and other religious assholes

602
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,547
who won't let gay people be married.

603
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,092
And adult women
who call their tits "the girls."

604
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,927
- Like...
- Stop it!

605
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:39,016
Just, please, be quiet.

606
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,477
Get off the bed?

607
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,479
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

608
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,232
I... I'm kind of busy right now.

609
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,573
Awesome.

610
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,951
Be careful with that.

611
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,501
- Wait.
- No, don't do that.

612
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,919
That's kind of personal.

613
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:12,800
"Dear Ava,
your life will be better without me."

614
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,385
I'm sorry.

615
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,011
"Love, Dad."

616
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,225
A suicide note?

617
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,269
Are you fucking kidding me?

618
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,396
God, the greatest thing
that ever happened around here,

619
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,356
and you're just some sad-sack pussy?

620
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,567
Goddamn it.

621
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,987
Well, do it, then.
I want to watch.

622
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,908
Let's go!

623
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,578
How do you know I won't kill you?

624
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,205
I don't.

625
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:47,168
And, frankly, Frank,
I don't fucking care.

626
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,851
Frank?

627
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,102
What?

628
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,230
I got an idea.

629
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,052
Okay, go ahead.

630
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,471
You sure you're ready now?

631
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,516
Yup. All systems go.

632
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,190
Wait again!

633
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,817
Sorry.

634
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,443
Can I say something first?

635
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,111
Go ahead.

636
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,366
You know, it's just that...

637
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,786
you really had the chance
to do something awesome here.

638
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,871
But you're blowing it, Frank.

639
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,081
Now you're just gonna be remembered

640
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,834
as some creepy, old stalker dude
who was in love

641
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,170
with some young twat
on a television show.

642
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,131
Just a pervy old dude
that killed that girl

643
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:19,760
and then himself
when he couldn't have her.

644
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,011
Wah.

645
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,098
I didn't kill her
because I couldn't have her.

646
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,476
I killed her...
because she wasn't nice.

647
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,021
And that was a fantastic start, Frank!

648
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:36,277
Your instincts were right on.
She was a class-A cunt.

649
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,113
But with so many horrible people
in the world

650
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,366
who should be taking the big dirt nap...

651
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,995
why quit now?

652
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,163
You kill yourself, Frank,

653
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,000
and you're killing
the wrong person, which...

654
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,209
would be a shame when there are

655
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,589
so many other Chloes out there
who need to die.

656
00:36:58,842 --> 00:36:59,884
Like who?

657
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,762
NASCAR fans.

658
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:04,930
Country fans.

659
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,641
People who dress their babies
in band T-shirts.

660
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,394
No, no, no, no.
People who deserve to die.

661
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,148
All those people do deserve to die.

662
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,817
No.

663
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,740
Chloe's parents.

664
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,498
If anybody comes, you honk the horn.

665
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,293
But no matter what you don't get out
of the car, you got it?

666
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,794
Aye-aye, captain.

667
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,505
I'm not kidding around.

668
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:41,467
- Frank...
- What?

669
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,552
This is more fun
than killing yourself, right?

670
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,513
I don't know.

671
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,098
Yeah, I guess.

672
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,892
Frank...

673
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,853
Yeah.

674
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,661
Yeah?

675
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,537
- Get in the house and shut the fuck up.
- Jesus.

676
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:11,872
Get over here. Get over here.

677
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,165
- Go! Go!
- Honey?

678
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,000
Get over there by the couch.
Get over there.

679
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,377
Do what he says.

680
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,879
What do you want?
We could give you money.

681
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,173
Listen, I'm a very rich man.

682
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,009
Don't you know who we are?
W-We're Chloe's parents!

683
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,386
We were all on TV!

684
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,721
Yeah, I know exactly who you are.

685
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,515
I'm the man that killed your daughter.

686
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,143
Goddamn it!

687
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,105
Oh, God!

688
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,522
- Yes, we did it!
- Hey, hey, hey, get off me!

689
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,399
I told you to stay in the car!

690
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,192
Frank, she was getting away.

691
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,737
You mean "thanks"?

692
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,239
Yeah. Let's go.

693
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,997
That was fucking crazy, right?

694
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,832
Yeah.

695
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,461
I feel...

696
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,670
Good?

697
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,965
Yeah.

698
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,010
I feel good. It's weird.

699
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,763
Thanks. Perfect.

700
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,476
You guys need some extra napkins?

701
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,196
Look, I'm sorry.

702
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,281
I really thought this would work.

703
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,366
All right, my turn.

704
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,576
Try me again.

705
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:16,747
We're definitely gonna need
some new clothes.

706
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,416
So, where are we going next?

707
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,793
What do you mean "we"?

708
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,628
There's no we.

709
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,880
Frank, you have to take me with you.

710
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,215
No way.

711
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,050
Come on, please?

712
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,928
No. What about your family?

713
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,971
My family?

714
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,809
Well, my mother is what you
would call a crack whore.

715
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,977
I live in a trailer
with her and her boyfriend,

716
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:43,565
and every night after she passes out
he comes into my room and rapes me.

717
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,614
I don't know what to say.

718
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,824
Well, let's kill them.

719
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,951
Yes!

720
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,119
Wait, no.

721
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,121
No, no, we can't keep killing
people we know.

722
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,455
That's how people get caught.

723
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,542
We have to keep it random.

724
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,087
That's a good idea.

725
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,506
See? I'm already helping.

726
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,258
So, please, Frank?

727
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,051
Can I please come with you?

728
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,261
What about your friends?

729
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,680
I mean, don't you got
any friends you can stay with?

730
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,056
Frank...

731
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,517
I have no friends.

732
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,520
All right.

733
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,647
Really? Oh, thank you!

734
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,191
Hey, listen, you know,
when I say something, it goes.

735
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,027
No more of this shit.
No more acting on your own.

736
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,697
All right. Thank you.

737
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,412
The washing machine's broken.
What?

738
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,463
What are you doing?

739
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,550
Seeing if there's anything
in the news about us or the murders.

740
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,135
- Is there?
- Yeah.

741
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,721
On the murders.
Nothing about us.

742
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,682
"Murdered family
of reality star found"...

743
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,017
Hey, let me see that.

744
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,647
See ya!

745
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,275
Oh, my God!

746
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,987
I had this shirt.

747
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,155
It's still ugly.

748
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,489
What do you think?

749
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:18,327
I think that might be
a little small on the belly.

750
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,370
So, do you have a girlfriend?

751
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,623
I'm not gonna answer that question.

752
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,166
Why not?

753
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,667
'Cause you're a kid.

754
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,461
I don't want to have
an inappropriately mature

755
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,922
conversation with you, all right?

756
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,925
I was only asking
because I thought you were gay.

757
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,092
Well, I'm not gay.

758
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,178
You seem gay.

759
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,554
- Really?
- Yes.

760
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:43,727
So, do you? Have a girlfriend?

761
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,646
- No.
- A wife?

762
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,273
I did. Not any more.

763
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,195
Are you attracted to me?

764
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,614
Don't be weird.

765
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,076
You don't like me
because you think I'm ugly?

766
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,496
I'm not attracted to you
because you're a child.

767
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,248
And you think I'm ugly.

768
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:07,709
I'm not gonna answer that question.

769
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,378
Well, what if we were the same age?

770
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,672
I'm not gonna answer
that question, either.

771
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,591
Oh, so you can kill a teenager,
just not fuck one?

772
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,093
Yeah.

773
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:19,263
But you do think I'm mature for my age.

774
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:22,724
Not particularly.

775
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,852
You're seriously not interested
in me at all as a girlfriend?

776
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:29,064
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm not a pedophile.

777
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,775
What, so we're platonic spree killers?

778
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,944
Yeah, and that's all.

779
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,862
Because you think I'm ugly.

780
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:39,116
It's unethical for me
to answer that question,

781
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,035
because I refuse to objectify a child.

782
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,830
I mean, that's part
of what's wrong with everything.

783
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,248
I'm not American Apparel.

784
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,792
I'm not the creep that came up
with those Bratz dolls.

785
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,252
All men like young girls.

786
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,504
Oh, that's what society's
trying to sell ya,

787
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,339
but, you know,
maybe it's time for adult males

788
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,301
to aim a little bit higher
than raping kids.

789
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:01,513
I mean, fuck R. Kelly,
fuck Vladimir Nabokov,

790
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,516
and fuck Mary Kay Letourneau,
while we're at it.

791
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,977
Fuck Woody Allen

792
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:10,188
and his whole "the heart wants
what it wants" bullshit.

793
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,691
You know, apparently
that erudite genius's heart

794
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:13,859
wants the same thing

795
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,028
that every run-of-the-mill
pedophile wants...

796
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,531
a young, hairless Asian.

797
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,285
Nobody cares
that they damage other people.

798
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:27,080
I was just wondering
if you thought I was pretty.

799
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:31,543
I won't be responsible
for the self-esteem of a teenager.

800
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,712
If you don't like it, you can cram it.

801
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,007
Fuck you, Frank.

802
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,857
Frank?

803
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,442
Hey.

804
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,488
I thought you left.

805
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:02,074
I thought about it.

806
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,659
I got you something.

807
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,955
Oh, yeah, yeah. I get it.

808
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,124
Bonnie and Clyde?

809
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,293
Well, fine,
you don't have to wear it.

810
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,796
I just don't usually wear hats.

811
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,923
My head looks kind of weird in them.

812
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,806
Although that one
looks pretty good?

813
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,641
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

814
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,898
Yours looks good.
Patty Hearst, right?

815
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,585
Thank you for choosing our theater.

816
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,965
As a courtesy to your fellow patrons,
please refrain from talking

817
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:05,220
and please turn off your cell phones.

818
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:10,642
And now enjoy our feature presentation.

819
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:22,779
War is an atrocity.

820
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,783
I mean, it takes young kids...

821
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,703
good kids, for the most part...

822
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,205
turns them into animals...

823
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,918
Hey, bitch.
No, I'm not doing anything.

824
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:43,091
I'm in a movie.

825
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,759
Stuff you never thought you'd do.

826
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,511
Oh, hey, look.

827
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,430
How cute, right?

828
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,683
Okay, mom.

829
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,567
Hello? We're in the middle.

830
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,776
We're in the middle!

831
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,404
Sad face! Is that Matt?

832
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,615
Oh, he's bringing food.

833
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,201
Hey, did this really happen?

834
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,746
Munchies!

835
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,956
Thank you!

836
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:22,631
Some of the guys
start raping their mothers!

837
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,761
Let's go.

838
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,138
We go out, get a smoke...

839
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,854
Sit down.

840
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,607
No place to hide,

841
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,901
because the villages
were supporting these bastards.

842
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,986
So...

843
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,827
Hey, hey.

844
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,037
No, I can't get...

845
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,706
I'm at work.

846
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,291
I can't. You're gonna have
to pick her up today.

847
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,087
I can't get there.
I'm... I'm working.

848
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,048
Yeah. So...

849
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,050
What can I tell you?
I'm swamped.

850
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,302
God.

851
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,518

00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,108

870
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,584
Thanks for not talking
during the feature.

871
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,253
Thanks for turning off
your cellphone.

872
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,213
You're welcome.

873
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:10,382
Here.
You can use this thing as a pillow.

874
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,384
Thanks.

875
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,053
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night.

876
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:48,336
You folks shouldn't be sleeping
out here.

877
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,589
Can I see your license and registration?

878
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,466
Of course, Officer.

879
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,010
My dad keeps everything in here.

880
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,805
I'm...

881
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,974
I'm her uncle.

882
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,225
This is my brother-in-law's car

883
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,311
'cause I'm taking her down
to see some colleges.

884
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:07,480
Go, big... blue!

885
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,985
You have any ID?

886
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,112
Yes, I do, sir.

887
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,164
All right, I'll be right there.

888
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,003
No more sleeping
on the side of the road.

889
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,921
Do you still need to see my ID?

890
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:36,176
No, that's fine, honey.
You just stay safe.

891
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,178
Lot of crazy people out there.

892
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,138
Tell me about it.

893
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,347
Thank you, Officer.

894
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,434
What the hell was that about?

895
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,770
Hey, at least I don't steal cars.

896
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,147
What makes you think it's stolen?

897
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,732
All right, I stole it.

898
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,151
But from a jerk.

899
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,994
What is this?

900
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,455
Don't get too attached.

901
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,171
Now you go.

902
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,591
All right,
I'm a little bit bigger than you.

903
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,343
You don't gotta "Dirty Harry" it.

904
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,553
Wrap your other hand around here.

905
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,764
Feel a little stability there?

906
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,141
All right, now do it.

907
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,395
Pretty good.

908
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,398
Just concentrate on that far sight.

909
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,987
You're aiming at the bear, right?

910
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,823
Don't anticipate the recoil.

911
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,575
Just squeeze it and let it go.

912
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,747
That's all bear there.

913
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,043
I think Elvis would be proud.

914
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,294
Pretty good.

915
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,755
Thanks.

916
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,967
3:00.

917
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,970
6:00.

918
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,306
12:00!

919
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,766
9:00!

920
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,935
6:00!

921
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,937
Six!

922
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,237
- Yay!
- Yay.

923
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,660
- Good?
- Yeah.

924
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,418
Migraine?

925
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,044
Yeah.

926
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,630
Well, we could stop shooting.

927
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,841
Yeah, thanks.

928
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,094
You did a good job.

929
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,888
Well, I have a good coach.

930
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:48,016
That, and I was pretending the targets
were the cast of "Glee."

931
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,517
What's wrong with "Glee"?

932
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,520
It stereotypes and homogenizes
homosexuals.

933
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,189
Plus, it ruined "Rocky Horror" forever.

934
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:56,941
That's true.

935
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,110
You want my money?
I'll pay for all your healthcare!

936
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,445
Tea Party members

937
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,113
continued to taunt
the Parkinson's sufferer

938
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,282
after he was shoved to the ground.

939
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,868
Parkinson's is what God
gives socialists!

940
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,912
Parkinson's is what God
gives socialists!

941
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,790
God, I'm so depressed.

942
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,793
I mean, I can't believe
there's nothing on about us.

943
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,796
That's one of the problems
of your generation.

944
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,758
You can't enjoy anything
unless it was recorded.

945
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,134
You were there. You lived it.

946
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,136
Isn't that enough of an experience?

947
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,680
I mean, next time you want
to remember something,

948
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,766
instead of taking out your cellphone,

949
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:33,061
why don't you take a picture of it
with your brain camera?

950
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,813
I mean, when I was your age,
nobody tweeted,

951
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,900
and we managed to have experiences.

952
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,779
You know, the phone was attached
to a wall back at the house.

953
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,031
It didn't have a camera.

954
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,659
What are you, Jeff Foxworthy?

955
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:50,411
"And a 'cell' phone was the phone
you called your pappy on"

956
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,788
to get you outta jail.

957
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,415
"A-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot."

958
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,878
Some people are blaming
the movie itself for the murders.

959
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,923
Is this violent documentary too violent?

960
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,299
Do you believe that?

961
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,009
I know! We made the news!

962
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,970
No, what they're saying.

963
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:10,431
Nobody can take personal responsibility
for anything any more.

964
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,101
But that's not what
the lone survivor believes.

965
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,395
- What's the point?
- Everybody was talking...

966
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,856
goofing around, making noise.

967
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,693
I believe they did this
because we were all being so rude.

968
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,903
How about that?

969
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,864
Unbelievable.
The truth, and on this channel.

970
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,408
The suspects are

971
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,660
a Caucasian male
in his mid-to late-50s...

972
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,036
- Late 50s?
- ...and a young woman...

973
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,039
in her early to mid 20s,
also Caucasian.

974
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,251
They are considered armed
and very dangerous.

975
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,587
See? They think I'm mature for my age.

976
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,673
We're famous!

977
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,175
Hey, high five.

978
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,885
Come on,
don't leave me hanging, Rock-o.

979
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:51,431
No, I don't high five.

980
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,892
Mental high five?

981
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,855
Yeah, mental high five.

982
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,023
Steven Clark.

983
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:02,066
He wasn't the winner
on "American Superstarz,"

984
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,526
but I think he's a winner.

985
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,695
He's back with a new hit single.

986
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,572

Completely random.

- You know what I hate?
- What?

1002
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:51,449
I hate guys that say "actually"
all the time.

1003
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,286
Like, "You actually got a gun

- That's a good one.

You're actually still alive.

00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,542
You know what else I hate?

1007
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,753
People who misuse the term "literally."

1008
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,046
Okay, ready?

1009
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,631
Literal people, I guess.

00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,049
Okay.

1011
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,468
We're getting close.

1012
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,304
I hate guys that buy $100,000 cars

1013
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,724
and then drive them around
10 miles slower than the speed limit.

1014
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,437
I hate guys who wear lady pants.

1015
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,064
Lady pants?

1016
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:25,566
Okay.

1017
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:29,028
I'm no mathematician,
but my odds are not good.

1018
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:33,282
Well, Pythagoras, it may be time to die.

1019
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,661
How'd that feel?

1020
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,871
It felt good.
It's a good night to die.

1021
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,126
VELOCitea Energy Drink.

1022
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:45,461
It's in your face.

1023
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:50,383
Frank, let me sleep in the chair.

1024
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,093
No, I'm all right.

1025
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,178
Come on. Sleep in the bed.

1026
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,013
You're the one
with the fucked-up headaches.

1027
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,600
No, this is good.

1028
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:07,191
Behold, the walls of Jericho!

1029
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,820
No, I'm fine.

1030
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,198
Jesus, Frank, get in bed
or I'm sleeping on the floor.

1031
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,951
I'm sleeping on the floor.
Here I go.

1032
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,327
Do you see this?

1033
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,495
I'm going down.

1034
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,998
Frank, it smells!

1035
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,917
I wouldn't trust that floor.

1036
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,382
Come on, Frank.

1037
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,864
What are we gonna do now?

1038
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,158
Well...

1039
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,118
What's our prime directive?

1040
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:03,164
I didn't have you pegged
as a "Star Trek" fan.

1041
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,583
What's that supposed to mean?

1042
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,086
I don't know.
I figured you more for...

1043
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:12,632
the new "Battlestar Galactica."

1044
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,468
Maybe some graphic novels.

1045
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,430
Bands like Fall Out Boy
and the Green Days.

1046
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,350
Oh, fuck you, Frank!

1047
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,102
I happen to like classic
and Next Gen "Star Trek."

1048
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,272
And I'm actually able to read
a book without pictures,

1049
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,775
thank you,
and I prefer the classics.

1050
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:31,943
I'm not ashamed to admit

1051
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,488
to the occasional Anne Rice
or "Harry Potter."

1052
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:40,826
Fall Out Boy and Green Day
suck shit through 10 bricks.

1053
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:44,413
Musically I'm all about Alice Cooper.

1054
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,999
I like Alice Cooper.

1055
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,295
You don't like Alice Cooper, Frank.

1056
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,633
That's... That's like a Muslim
saying that he likes Muhammad.

1057
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,343
You...

1058
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,388
accept Alice Cooper.

1059
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:04,392
You accept that Alice came down

1060
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:08,479
and gave us rock
that upset authority figures

1061
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:13,276
and made the outcasts
not feel so all alone.

1062
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:16,946
You accept that there would be
no goth movement without Alice,

1063
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:20,032
no Trent Reznor,
no Marilyn Manson,

1064
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:24,412
not even shitty soft cock-rockers
like Poison or Bon Jovi

1065
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:28,582
because not only did he introduce
macabre theatrics into rock,

1066
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,544
he also invented the power ballad

1067
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,464
with a little song called
"Only Women Bleed."

1068
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,800
Okay, I get it.

1069
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,052
I promise I won't kill Alice Cooper.

1070
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,471
Hey, don't even joke about it, Frank.

1071
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:46,309
Do you realize that he was
the first rock star to wear makeup?

1072
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,686
And he was wearing dresses

1073
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,522
long before Bowie
stole his first pair of culottes

1074
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,566
from his mother's clothesline.

1075
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:57,653
And he was screaming about death
and frustration way before punk,

1076
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:03,367
so I guess you have to accept
that Alice Cooper invented that, too.

1077
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,579
Are you A. D. D., Juno?

1078
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:09,707
Yes, I have A. D. D.,

1079
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:13,544
and don't you ever call me
fucking Juno again.

1080
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,629
Sorry.

1081
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,717
That's who we should kill next.

1082
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,510
A fictitious character?

1083
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,387
No, Diablo Cody.

1084
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,972
You know, fuck her
for writing that movie.

1085
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,893
She's the only stripper who suffers
from too much self-esteem.

1086
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,102
I don't want to kill people

1087
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,229
just because
you don't like their movies.

1088
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,564
Why not?

1089
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,858
She's encouraging teen pregnancy,

1090
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,527
her storylines and characters
are for shit,

1091
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,404
and she's just so excited

1092
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,615
to throw any funny line she's heard
into the scene

1093
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,325
that she makes girls my age

1094
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:47,953
look like cutesy assholes
from a dirty Dr. Seuss book.

1095
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,208
"Horton Hears a Star-Bellied Queef.
Blah."

1096
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:56,629
I only want to kill people
who deserve to die.

1097
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,175
You know who we should kill?

1098
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,469
Mm?

1099
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,971
People who use "rock-star"
as an adjective.

1100
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:08,682
As in "rock-star parking"?

1101
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:11,435
Or people that pound
energy drinks all day.

1102
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:16,065
People who use the term "edgy,"
"in-your-face," or "extreme."

1103
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,233
No, no, no, wait.

1104
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,693
That would rule out a lot
of the chalupas that I love.

1105
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:25,658
Anyone who wears crystals
or calls themselves "spiritual."

1106
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,576
Or people who say "Namaste."

1107
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,245
What's that?

1108
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,914
It's an Indian greeting
the hippies stole.

1109
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,291
Hippies!

1110
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,794
Anyone who buys an anarchy T-shirt.

1111
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,549
Or people that use the term "the man"
in a positive or negative light,

1112
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,260
as in, "The man is always
sticking it to us,"

1113
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:45,636
or "You're the man!"

1114
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,639
- Anyone who's ever been "pumped."
- Or "stoked."

1115
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:52,309
Anyone who gives and receives
physical high fives.

1116
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,103
- Agreed.
- Oh, really?

1117
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,021
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1118
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:58,691
Not gonna let you play the freedom
of speech here on my show, okay?

1119
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,526
Okay? Let me explain
something to you.

1120
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,737
I would much rather lose
my rights to freedom of speech

1121
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:07,074
than ever have the A.C.I.U.
defend my right to freedom of speech.

1122
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,659
And another thing, you pinhead.

1123
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,870
The A. C.I. U...
take heed, America...

1124
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:15,291
I think is more dangerous
to the United States than al-Qaeda.

1125
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,542
I'll give you a chance to respond

1126
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,169
if you have anything articulate to say
right after this.

1127
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,336
More of the full story...

1128
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:23,340
Anyone who makes a living
spreading fear to the masses.

1129
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,801
Or is just plain mean.

1130
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,178
Mm.

1131
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,097
So... our prime directive

1132
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,433
is to interfere
with the cultural evolution

1133
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,144
of a pre-warp civilization.

1134
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,398
I got to go to sleep.
My head is killing me.

1135
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,447
Stop it.

1136
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,491
What? I was trying
to help your headache.

1137
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:52,244
It's a pressure point.
I wasn't being sensual.

1138
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,747
Yeah, people who use
the term "sensual."

1139
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,207
Gross.

1140
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,209
You said it.

1141
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,793
Hey, Frank?

1142
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,715
Thanks for letting me
come along with you.

1143
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,105
Good night, Juno.

1144
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:21,732
Fuck you, Frank.

What do you think?

1167
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,992
Looks good.

1168
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,495
Jesus, Frank,
you look like fuck pie.

1169
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,705
Oh, there he is.

1170
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,043
Ladies.

1171
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,005
I gotta get back to working out.

1172
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,057
Did we get him?

1173
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,351
No, I think we just winged him.

1174
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:11,694
Is he breathing?

1175
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,447
I don't know.

1176
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,412
You stop moving or I shoot her.

1177
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,163
You don't have the balls.

1178
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,374
Really? I don't?

1179
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,710
Fuck you,
you condescending prick!

1180
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:30,796
Why do you got to be so rude
all the time?

1181
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,676
Is that what this is all about?

1182
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:38,262
My show?

1183
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,722
Shit.

1184
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:42,891
You must really hate my politics?

1185
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:46,770
Look, you kill me,
you just turn me into a martyr.

1186
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,397
I don't hate your politics.

1187
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,316
In fact, I agree with you
on some things.

1188
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,862
- You do?
- Yeah.

1189
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,407
Then, what is this about?

1190
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,743
Why do you go to be
so mean all the time?

1191
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:05,622
Are you really willing to die
just because you don't think I'm nice?

1192
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:08,041
Do you have it in you, Fuller?

1193
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:11,920
How long has it been since you
actually had to shoot someone?

1194
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,506
Oh, wait. You never have.

1195
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,760
I forgot.
You never served in the military.

1196
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:20,679
You had your parents
help you dodge the draft

1197
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,973
just like every other rich blowhard

1198
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,642
who makes a living
off of American xenophobes.

1199
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,562
It seems like you guys
just exploited some tragedies

1200
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,063
to further your agenda.

1201
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,316
In fact, it seems like
it's always been about

1202
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:37,529
protecting big oil companies' right
to keep boiling the whole world alive

1203
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,991
just because some
court-appointed, hillbilly president

1204
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,535
started taking orders
from Jesus or the Easter Bunny

1205
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,079
or some other
make-'em-up play-friend of his.

1206
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:46,997
Please!

1207
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:53,796
That is just your typical uneducated,
left-wing, "femonazi" point of view.

1208
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:55,047
Feminazi.

1209
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,174
Again, why do you got to be so mean?

1210
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,010
He just wishes
everyone would act nice.

1211
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,554
I, on the other hand,
think your politics are shit.

1212
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,139
Well...

1213
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,854
You bitch!

1214
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,148
Yep.

1215
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,661
Exactly what part of his politics
do you agree with?

1216
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:28,413
Less gun control, of course.

1217
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:32,459
But, Frank...
then every nut will have a gun.

1218
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,145
Look at all these people.

1219
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,692
Yeah, I wish I had an AK-47.

1220
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,364
Bam.

1221
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,492
Supporters of Michael Fuller
are calling him a hero,

1222
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,996
believing that his homicide is tied
to the outspoken support of the war

1223
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,205
and possibly the work

1224
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:13,041
of a terrorist sleeper cell
within our own borders.

1225
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,043
Fuller was right.

1226
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,921
He's a fucking martyr.

1227
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,173
Fucking morons.

1228
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,969
I don't care.
I'm just glad he's dead.

1229
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,772
Is that your ex-wife?

1230
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,858
Yeah.

1231
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,818
She's pretty.

1232
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,279
Yep.

1233
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:46,825
I don't care if we're late.
I hate school!

1234
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,456
I thought that was you, Frank.

1235
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,583
Oh, hi, Brad.

1236
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:55,751
New wheels?

1237
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:57,878
Yeah.

1238
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,504
You want to come say hi?

1239
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,341
School sucks!

1240
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,718
Nah. They look kind of busy.

1241
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,599
Who's your friend?

1242
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,392
A friend.

1243
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:19,816
Well, give us a call
if you decide to stay in town.

1244
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,777
I'm sure the girls
would love to see ya.

1245
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,028
Yeah, thanks.

1246
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,906
Hey... don't tell 'em we were here,
al right?

1247
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,491
Oh, roger that.

1248
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,869
Will you get Ava's backpack
from the house?

1249
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,746
Sure thing!

1250
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,581
I want my backpack.

1251
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,458
You're killing me, honey.
You're killing me!

1252
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,920
So, are we gonna kill him?

1253
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,339
No! Not that one!
I hate that one!

1254
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,924
I want my other one!

1255
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,218
Just... Just get the blue one.
Get the blue one.

1256
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,928
Nah.

1257
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,263
I want him to suffer.

1258
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:16,915
Isn't it early for beer?

1259
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:22,087
This doesn't seem like the type of place
to order the Cognac.

1260
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,173
Have you been to a doctor?

1261
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,301
Yeah. I'm fine.

1262
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,930
Give me your hand.

1263
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,349
It's not gonna work.

1264
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,813
Is this some kind
of new-age bullshi...

1265
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,823
Can't believe that's actually working.

1266
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,241
Shut up and give me your other hand.

1267
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,451
Gentle.

1268
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,290
You know what you need, Frank?

1269
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,459
A straw?

1270

Thank you all.

Where'd you hide 'em
after you killed 'em?

1332
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,439
I told you the truth, Sheriff.

1333
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,024
I didn't kill them.

1334
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,484
I just wanted to scare them...

1335
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,861
I've been thinking.

1336
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:59,239
Let's go legit.

1337
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,700
What do you mean?
Turn ourselves in?

1338
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:02,867
No.

1339
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,577
Like, let's move to France

1340
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:08,623
or some other country
that hates Americans.

1341
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,543
Well, if we get caught later,
France wouldn't extradite us.

1342
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:14,045
And we could have
a cute, little French farm

1343
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,214
and raise cute, little French goats

1344
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,758
and make cute, little French cheeses,

1345
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:23,346
and have a bunch of other
adorable, little French animals.

1346
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,265
Sounds nice.

1347
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,354
Here, give me your hand.

1348
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:40,405
I still can't believe that works.

1349
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,159
Do you know
where you're going to?

1350
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,411
Well, we know where
Steven Clark is going to.

1351
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,079
The "American Superstarz"
performer

1352
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,665
has been asked to perform
on the live finale of the show

1353
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,251
after last week's failed attempt
to take his own life.

1354
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:54,669
Good news.

1355
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,213
We should kill all those people.

1356
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,550
They make fun of that guy
till he's ready to kill himself.

1357
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,427
Then, they exploit him

1358
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:05,055
so everybody can feel better
about laughing at him

1359
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:09,017
and pushing him over the edge
in the first place.

1360
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:11,895
I really hate this country.

1361
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,689
That's why we're moving to France.

1362
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,580
Hello.

1363
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,958
Hey, Doc, it's Frank Murdoch.
You left a message.

1364
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:36,336
Yes, I did, Frank.

1365
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,588
I have some bad news.

1366
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:43,510
You don't have a brain tumor.

1367
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,595
What?!

1368
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,222
You're not gonna die.

1369
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,016
I don't understand.

1370
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,685
I mean, I saw the tumor.
You showed it to me.

1371
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:56,147
Yes, there was a tumor in an MRl,

1372
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:59,067
but that was Frank Burdoch with a "B",

1373
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:02,404
not Frank Murdoch with an "M".

1374
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:05,907
Wait, what is the bad news, then?

1375
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,202
Because this cocksucker Burdoch's
probably gonna sue me.

1376
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:11,371
He's a real ball-buster.
You know what I mean?

1377
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:14,624
But how come my head hurts
all the time, then?

1378
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,376
I don't fucking know, Frank.

1379
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,837
I mean, maybe you sit
too close to the computer.

1380
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:21,798
Maybe you got high blood pressure.
Maybe you don't exercise enough.

1381
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,717
Maybe it's, too much Viagra,
too much caffeine.

1382
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:26,136
What the fuck do I know?

1383
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,638
Hey, you're not gonna sue me,
are ya?

1384
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,307
No, no.
No, I wouldn't do that, Doc.

1385
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:34,185
Well, that's a relief, Frank.

1386
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,896
Well, hey,
thanks for the good news, Doc.

1387
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,857
Well, I got to go call
that cocksucker Burdoch now

1388
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,024
and tell him the bad news.

1389
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:42,777
You take care, Frank.

1390
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:45,655
Let's sell the car
and move to France.

1391
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,532
Really?

1392
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,409
Oh, I think it would be
très magnifique.

1393
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,786
I know a lot of French.
I know a lot of wines.

1394
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,914
I know how to ask where the library is.

1395
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,708
I know how to bum a cigarette.

1396
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,127
I know Oh là là, but that's about it.

1397
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,629
I know Oui.
What else could we need?

1398
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,298
Speaking of which, I have to wee.

1399
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,008
Oh, snap.

1400
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,598
Hey, buddy.

1401
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,057
What's up with the girl?

1402
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:14,225
Pardon?

1403
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:16,186
I know she's not your daughter.

1404
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,272
I can tell by the way
she makes you smile.

1405
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:20,565
She's my niece.

1406
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:24,194
Yeah, I got a lot of nieces.

1407
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,362
How much for a date?

1408
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,117
I think you got the wrong idea, sir.

1409
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,703
Yeah, you stick to that story.

1410
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,955
I don't think I do.

1411
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,373
You have a good one.

1412
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,167
I know you're gonna have a good day.

1413
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,418
God bless.

1414
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:46,591
Hey, don't use up
all the hot water this time.

1415
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:47,800
I won't!

1416
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,386
God, you better not be
this uptight in France.

1417
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,139
You don't have to shower in France.

1418
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,161
We'd like to take this chance

1419
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:18,957
to thank everybody in our community
and the media

1420
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:23,169
for helping us in our search
for Roxanne.

1421
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:26,631
We pray that she's still alive
and that she makes it home to us.

1422
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:30,093
Roxanne, we miss you
and we love you.

1423
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,178
Anyone with any information on the...

1424
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,722
God fuckin' damn it!

1425
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,708
You son of a bitch!

1426
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,418
Get off me!

1427
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:34,198
Frank?

1428
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:36,784
Is that you?

1429
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,414
What happened?

1430
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,625
- Your parents!
- What?

1431
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:45,168
Yeah, I just saw 'em on the TV.

1432
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,878
You lied to me!

1433
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,213
Well, would you have taken me along

1434
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,050
if I told you
that I lived in a normal house

1435
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:55,678
with a set of normal parents
who didn't abuse me

1436
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,931
but also didn't even try
and understand me?

1437
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:04,395
That every day in my normal life
felt like a million years?

1438
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:09,442
And that I spent all day, every day,
being told what to do and what to think

1439
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:12,195
by people who I'm
a million times smarter than,

1440
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,781
but since it's not polite
to acknowledge that,

1441
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:17,659
I just had to pretend to listen to?

1442
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:22,038
That every single morning,
I just woke up and wished

1443
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:26,250
that anything not normal
would happen?

1444
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:27,877
Here are the keys to that car.

1445
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,337
Where am I supposed to go?

1446
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:31,381
I don't care!
Go back to your parents.

1447
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,508
Just stay out of my life.

1448
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,884
I don't got time for you!

1449
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,179
You're just like everybody else.
I don't got time for liars!

1450
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,389
Oh, fuck you, Frank!

1451
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,599
You're just a pathetic, broken man!

1452
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:47,814

Frank, you didn't really tell me

1471
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,805
exactly what you were looking for
when you called,

1472
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:46,599
so I brought you kind of
a gun pupu platter.

1473
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:56,734
We got your .357 Magnum.

1474
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,446
Nickel finish, six shots,
eight-inch barrel.

1475
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:04,367
It's .357, so you know
it's got some punch to it.

1476
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,410
You put this to the back
of some nigger's head,

1477
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:08,621
all you're gonna see is pink mist.

1478
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,292
No, maybe not.
Maybe not for you.

1479
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:16,003
Old school.

1480
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,755
Walther P38.

1481
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:22,510
German, nine-millimeter,
made during the second World War.

1482
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,596
I mean, who knows how to kill people
better than Germans, right?

1483
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:26,889
You know it's got to be good.

1484
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,182
You're not a Jew, Frank, are you?

1485
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:30,726
I'm just asking 'cause, you know,
I brought up a German gun.

1486
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:32,812
Okay, hey, maybe,

1487
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:36,691
maybe you're looking for something
that's a little bigger.

1488
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:37,984
Little more firepower.

1489
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:42,530
See what we got
that may strike your fancy here.

1490
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,662
Is that a honey or what?

1491
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:54,834
AK-47.

1492
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,503
When you absolutely, positively
have to waste

1493
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,755
every single motherfucker
in the room,

1494
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:01,591
accept no substitute.

1495
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,177
I can see you like this.
Definitely.

1496
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,179
7.62 x 39.

1497
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:10,391
It's an assault rifle,
but it's still light.

1498
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:11,767
And talk about reliable?

1499
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:13,853
Frank, I could throw this off the roof.

1500
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,605
I could run this over with my car.

1501
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:20,401
I could bury it in the dirt
and dig it up, and it'll still fire.

1502
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:22,403
That's how reliable that is.

1503
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:25,364
Best mass-produced
combat weapon ever made.

1504
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,616
Look at this. That fits you.

1505
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,159
Look at this.
You're friggin' Rambo, man!

1506
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:30,369
Look at that. Look. I love it!

1507
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,288
You know what?
You don't even have to aim this thing.

1508
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:35,374
It's a spray-and-pray
kind of weapon.

1509
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,751
I mean, what's better than that, right?

1510
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:39,503
Now, the one thing is
this is not a cheap weapon.

1511
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,838
This is an assault rifle,

1512
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,466
so we're looking
around two grand for this.

1513
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,134
So, I don't know
if that's in your budget,

1514
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,552
but what I will do,

1515
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,555
I got three fully loaded
30-round mags in here

1516
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,058
that I will throw in for that $2,000.

1517
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,768
That's a steal.

1518
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:55,978
For a weapon of that quality, you know.

1519
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,147
This something you can afford?

1520
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,899
Yeah, I want the case, too.

1521

You know what?

is that sasquatch

01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,227
Oh, no, it's Robin Williams.

1638
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:23,615
Just take it easy.

1639
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:26,327
Yeah, come on.

I'm gonna ask you again.

What the hell was that?

What do you want?

1665
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,621
I want you to put your guns down.

1666
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,206
You know we can't do that.

1667
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,876
Well, I'm gonna keep shooting judges
until you do.

1668
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,754
That wasn't a policeman
that came up behind ya.

1669
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,006
That was a security guard
acting on his own.

1670
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:04,383
So, just calm down.

1671
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,051
Would you tell me who you are?

1672
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,512
Who I am?

1673
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,180
Sure.

1674
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,728
Is that thing on?

1675
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,655
My name is Frank.

1676
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:29,533
But that's not important.

1677
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:33,328
The important question is,
who are you?

1678
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:36,415
America...

1679
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:40,586
has become a cruel and vicious place.

1680
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:44,339
We reward the shallowest, the dumbest,

1681
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:46,800
the meanest, and the loudest.

1682
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:51,763
No longer have
any common sense of decency.

1683
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:54,183
No sense of shame.

1684
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:56,602
There's no right and wrong.

1685
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:01,482
The worst qualities in people are...

1686
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:04,067
looked up to and celebrated.

1687
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:09,239
Lying? Spreading fear? Fine.

1688
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:11,575
As long as you make money doing it.

1689
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:15,245
We've become a nation

1690
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:19,875
of slogan-saying,
bile-spewing hatemongers.

1691
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:23,295
We've lost our kindness.

1692
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:26,798
We've lost our soul.

1693
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,177
What have we become

1694
01:37:30,303 --> 01:37:32,513
when we take
the weakest in our society

1695
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,724
and we hold them up to be ridiculed?

1696
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:39,853
Laughed at
for our sport and entertainment.

1697
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:42,147
Laughed at to the point

1698
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,191
where they would literally
rather kill themselves

1699
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,527
than live with us any more.

1700
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:48,070
Frank?

1701
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:49,488
Yeah, Steven?

1702
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:54,243
I didn't try to kill myself
because people were making fun of me.

1703
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:55,702
I tried to kill myself

1704
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:59,456
because they weren't gonna
put me on TV any more.

1705
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:23,397
You are a pretty girl.

1706
