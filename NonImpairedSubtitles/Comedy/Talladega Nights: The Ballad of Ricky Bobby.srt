1
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:08,685
-Guess how fast we're going now.
-I don't care, I'm having a baby!

2
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,822
Hundred and five miles an hour,
you believe that?

3
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:19,857
Reese, you just passed the hospital!

4
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,734
-The baby's coming, he's coming now!
-All right, all right, hold on.

5
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,837
-Okay, but I think he might be stuck.
-Grab onto something. Ready?

6
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,973
One, two, three!

7
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:38,848
It's a baby boy.

8
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:44,121
I'm happy that Waffle House
was okay with me coming here...

9
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:46,415
...to talk to y'all about
my day-to-day.

10
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,419
And, y’all, that's pretty much,
in a shell...

11
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:51,789
...what it's like to manage
a Waffle House.

12
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:54,522
Ma'am, I don't know what else
you want me to say to them.

13
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,167
And I'm also gonna need to know
where your commode's at.

14
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,894
Okay, let's give him a round
of applause. Thank you.

15
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:04,102
Okay, next up is Ricky Bobby.
Ricky, is your father here?

16
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:07,540
No, ma'am.
I haven't seen my daddy in years.

17
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,805
But my mama say he's out
racing cars...

18
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,381
...and, well, dipping his wick
in anything that moves.

19
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,915
Okay, kids, that's enough.
We're gonna move on to Brennan.

20
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:19,085
Don't pay them no mind, Ricky.

21
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,556
Thanks, Cal. Shake and Bake.
You'll be my best friend forever.

22
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:24,524
--his job is like as a prison guard.

23
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,554
Excuse me, daring.
I'm Reese Bobby.

24
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:30,132
I'm here for career day
with my son, Ricky.

25
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,035
-Dad!
-Hey there, boy!

26
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:36,071
Man, you got big. How long's it been?
Three, four months?

27
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:38,174
-Ten years.
-Ten years?

28
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,537
Man, I gotta lay off the peyote.

29
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,337
Mr. Bobby,
there's no smoking in here.

30
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,310
It's all right, I'm a volunteer fireman.

31
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:48,279
Okay, I am a semi-professional
racecar driver...

32
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:51,114
...and an amateur tattoo artist.

33
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:56,289
And the first thing you gotta learn
if you're gonna be a racecar driver...

34
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,018
...is you don't listen to losers...

35
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,494
-...Like your know-it-all teacher here.
-Okay, I think that's enough.

36
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,635
Your teacher wants you to go slow,
and she's wrong...

37
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:08,431
...because it's the fastest who gets paid
and it's the fastest who gets laid.

38
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:13,934
Oh, yeah.
You know what I'm taking about.

39
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,647
You people are in the wrong
on this one!

40
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,042
So in the wrong!

41
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:22,049
This is egregious,
do you hear me? Egregious!

42
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,521
We were cellmates together, Andy.
You got payback coming!

43
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,121
Dad!

44
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,764
Don't listen to these people, Ricky.
You're a winner.

45
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:39,869
You got the gift. Always remember,
if you ain't first, you're last.

46
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,669
If you ain't first, you're last.

47
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:50,003
-See you when you're grown up.
-Dad! Come back, Dad!

48
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,685
It's a hot one here in Talladega...

49
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:09,458
...and this crowd of over 1 80,000
is enjoying one heck of a day.

50
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:27,244
Yo, Terry. Terry, we got the caution.
Bring it in for a pit. Let's work on it.

51
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,755
AII right, fellas, let’s go.

52
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:43,524
Looking good. Yes, come on.

53
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:44,997
Keep it up, baby.

54
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,303
-AII right, way to go.
-Go, way to go.

55
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,068
Nice jack work, Ricky.

56
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,936
Hey, Shake and Bake, Cal.

57
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,272
-Shake and Bake!
-Terry, it's all on you, bro. You go.

58
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,573
Go, baby, go.
Wait, what are you doing?

59
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:00,512
-I gotta take a piss.
-Go, go, go!

60
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,346
It doesn't matter, Lucius.
We're in last place. Relax.

61
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:06,285
Jeez, I gotta go take a whiz.
Get off my ass.

62
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,425
You see,
this is what I'm taking about.

63
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:12,118
That's why this group right here
is the laughingstock of NASCAR.

64
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,888
Face it, we suck.

65
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,865
It's not always bad to be in last place.
Here's some things we can focus on:

66
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,197
One, we tried hard.
And two, we're still dear friends.

67
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:22,703
Glenn, shut up.

68
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,467
I see Terry.
He's having a chicken sandwich.

69
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:30,470
Hey, fellas! These are really good.
You should try one.

70
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,513
That place actually makes
a nice sauce.

71
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:34,878
Let me eat this,
then I gotta make a phone call...

72
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,816
-...then I'm coming back, all right?
-This is the bottom line.

73
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:39,990
If we don't get that car
back on the track...

74
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:42,682
...our sponsors are gonna
shit a chicken.

75
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:47,797
Now, is there anyone out there
who wants to go fast? Anybody?

76
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,128
I wanna go fast.

77
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:54,897
Hey, get him a suit. Hurry up,
make it snappy. Let's go.

78
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,404
-Hustle up, hustle up.
-Hey, man!

79
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:01,167
Remember when we got kicked out of
biology for playing with Matchbox cars?

80
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,779
-Yeah!
-Who's retarded now?

81
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:06,951
-Yeah.
-Hey, what are you doing after this?

82
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,642
-After the race?
-Yeah.

83
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:11,822
I don't know, but it feels like
we're wasting a lot of time.

84
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,150
No, I know, I know.
I'm just excited, man!

85
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,658
-Yeah, I know. Yeah.
-Hey! I love you!

86
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,420
-What?
-Nothing.

87
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,424
Shake and Bake! Get some!

88
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:26,732
You're my best friend!
You're my best friend!

89
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:28,633
-Okay, then!
-I'm in there with you!

90
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,705
-I gotta get going!
-Go, go!

91
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,078
-Yeah!
-That's Ricky, baby!

92
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:39,511
That's my boy, Ricky!

93
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,115
Hey, Ricky,
just remember one thing:

94
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,225
If you wreck that car,
that's 200 grand out of your pocket...

95
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:51,395
...so let's take it nice and slow, okay?

96
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:55,327
With all due respect, Lucius,
I'm gonna do some driving.

97
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:00,195
Excuse me, coming through.

98
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:05,508
Apparently, we've got a situation for
the laughing clown, number 26 car.

99
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,508
Terry Cheveaux is refusing to drive.
One of his crew members...

100
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:09,907
...has taken the wheel.

101
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:13,379
Hey, just wanted to share a little piece
of personal information with you.

102
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:14,779
I got a chubby right now...

103
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,978
...because this is one of the most
awesome experiences of my life...

104
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,816
...because I'm getting to
drive a racecar!

105
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,686
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

106
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,174
Wow, that was cool.

107
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,240
Come on, come on.

108
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:53,918
The big story from Talladega:

109
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,458
Little-known jack-man Ricky Bobby
places third in the Dennit machine.

110
00:07:57,662 --> 00:08:00,995
Ricky, first of all,
where did you learn to drive like that?

111
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,192
In a car.
Car handle really good. Yeah.

112
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,137
Can you speak up, Ricky?

113
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:09,203
A car.
It handled real good.

114
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,705
So, what do you think, Mr. Dennit?
He sure can drive.

115
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,367
He's got guts.
Dennit Racing needs a racer like him.

116
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,309
Come on, Dad.
He's just a stupid cowboy.

117
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,107
Look how bad he is
in that interview.

118
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:22,946
Junior, driving has got nothing
to do with interviews.

119
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:26,180
I just wish to hell you had
a little more stupid cowboy in you.

120
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:29,849
I felt like I was on a spaceship and....

121
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:32,589
I'm not sure
what to do with my hands.

122
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:34,662
Be good to hold them down
by your side.

123
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:39,030
We're really happy
with what was going on.

124
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:43,936
And at the end of the day, you know,
you gotta be happy.

125
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:48,238
-What did you say his name was again?
-His name is Ricky. Ricky Bobby.

126
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,937
Ricky Bobby?
He's got two first names.

127
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,117
Whatever his name is,
let’s get him over here.

128
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,479
Everything ended up fine.

129
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:59,816
Yeah, okay, everything was fine.
Thanks, thanks. Great job in the car.

130
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:02,390
Ricky Bobby, a force to be
reckoned with, possibly...

131
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:03,992
...in the near future.

132
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:06,186
Ricky Bobby with yet another
impressive win.

133
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,092
He is dominating NASCAR.

134
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,824
First or last, baby, you know it!

135
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:14,004
I've never seen a driver who
wants to win more than this guy.

136
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,503
I could get used to
this winning thing!

137
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:35,350
Dennit Racing Incorporated
has decided to field an additional car.

138
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,427
And, at the urging of Ricky Bobby...

139
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,690
...who's been like a son to me,
only better...

140
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,358
...I'm naming Cal Naughton Jr.
as the driver.

141
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,029
AII right.

142
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,868
-Cal Naughton.
-Hey...

143
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:54,704
...we just want to say to all
you other drivers out there...

144
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:57,904
...if you smell a delicious,
crispy smell after the race...

145
00:09:58,116 --> 00:10:01,313
...it's not your tailpipe,
it's a little bit...

146
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,884
...of shake....

147
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,487
And then bake.

148
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:07,088
Shake and Bake!

149
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,725
-That's our nickname.
-Get used to hearing it.

150
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,752
And Ricky Bobby wins...

151
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:14,363
...with Cal Naughton Jr.
finishing second.

152
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,767
-Yeah!
-Hey, man!

153
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,236
-Shake....
-And bake!

154
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:24,999
Hey, driver! Drive these.

155
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,846
Please be 1 8.

156
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:43,292
You want to make this out
to Charlotte?

157
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:44,927
Hey, excuse me, Ricky.

158
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,960
-Hey, Dale.
-Hey, can I get your autograph?

159
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:50,293
-Sure. Who do I make this out to?
-It's for me. I think you're awesome.

160
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:53,026
-Don't tell the other drivers.
-I'm not gonna tell anyone.

161
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,499
I'II see you out there.

162
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:56,673
Absolutely, ma'am,
I'd love to sign your baby.

163
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,842
You're not gonna wanna wash
that forehead.

164
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,838
-That's right, Powerade's number one.
-Not just for hydration, for vitamin.

165
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:05,538
No, it's me,
it's me, Susan, your assistant.

166
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,718
Gotta watch it when I get into
autograph mode.

167
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,786
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault,
I shouldn’t have been standing.

168
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:13,590
I'm Ricky Bobby.
Christmas is right around the corner...

169
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,782
...and what better gift
to give a loved one...

170
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:17,551
...than the Jackhawk 9000?

171
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,127
Available at Wal-Mart.

172
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:21,694
When you work on
your mysterious lady-part stuff...

173
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,357
...you should have the right tools too.
So that's why you should use...

174
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,401
...Maypax, the official tampon
of NASCAR.

175
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,365
I'm Ricky Bobby.

176
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:33,738
If you don't chew Big Red,
then f*** you.

177
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,407
Prune candy.

178
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:43,081
-You happy?
-I'm very happy.

179
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,619
-Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
-And I'm Cal Naughton Jr.

180
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:48,189
Urging you never to travel
to Tijuana.

181
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,117
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

182
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,387
Okay, I'm starting to get sick.

183
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,331
Dick Berggren in Las Vegas,
Victory Lane, for Fox Television.

184
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:59,435
Ricky Bobby, today's big winner.
Heck of a win for you today...

185
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,630
...but it seems as if you either win
or crash the car trying to win.

186
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:06,935
Well, Dick, here's the deal.
I'm the best there is, plain and simple.

187
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,544
I mean, I wake up in the morning
and I piss excellence.

188
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,681
And nobody can hang with my stuff.

189
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:15,114
You know, I'm just a big, hairy,
American winning machine.

190
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,186
If you ain't first, you're last.
You know what I'm taking about?

191
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,651
That phrase is trademarked...

192
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:22,348
...not to be used without permission
of Ricky Bobby Inc.

193
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,029
Supper's ready! Come on, y’all!
I've been slaving over this for hours!

194
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:37,071
Dear lord baby Jesus...

195
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:40,608
...or as our brothers
to the south call you, Jesús...

196
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:46,846
...we thank you so much for this
bountiful harvest of Domino's, KFC...

197
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:50,077
...and the always delicious Taco Bell.

198
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:53,052
I just want to take time to say
thank you for my family...

199
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:56,658
...my two beautiful, beautiful,
handsome, striking sons...

200
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,329
...Walker and Texas Ranger...

201
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:01,531
...or T.R., as we call him...

202
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:04,496
...and of course,
my red-hot smoking wife, Carley...

203
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,465
...who is a stone-cold fox.

204
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:10,332
Who if you were to rate her ass
on 1 00, it would easily be a 94.

205
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,874
Also wanna thank you for
my best friend, Cal Naughton Jr...

206
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:15,875
...who's got my back
no matter what.

207
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:18,176
Shake and Bake.

208
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,442
Dear lord baby Jesus, we also
thank you for my wife's father, Chip.

209
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,847
We hope that you can use
your baby Jesus powers...

210
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,785
...to heal him and his horrible leg.

211
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:30,620
And it smells terrible and
the dogs are always bothering with it.

212
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,489
Dear tiny infant Jesus, we--

213
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:34,460
Hey, you know, sweetie...

214
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,824
...Jesus did grow up.

215
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,968
You don't always have to
call him ''baby.''

216
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,865
It's odd and off-putting
to pray to a baby.

217
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,905
Well, I like the Christmas Jesus best
and I'm saying grace.

218
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,770
When you say grace, say it to
grownup Jesus, teenage Jesus...

219
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,468
...bearded Jesus,
whoever you want.

220
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,907
You know what I want?

221
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:54,642
I want you to do this grace good,
so that God will let us win tomorrow.

222
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:56,619
Dear tiny Jesus...

223
00:13:56,821 --> 00:14:01,622
...in your golden-fleece diapers,
with your tiny, little, fat, balled-up fists...

224
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:04,360
-...pawing at the air....
-He was a man. He had a beard.

225
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:07,030
Look, I like the baby version the best,
do you hear me?

226
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:08,994
I win the races and I get the money.

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,692
Ricky, finish the damn grace.

228
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:15,667
I like to picture Jesus
in a tuxedo T-shirt...

229
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:18,535
...because it says, like,
''I wanna be formal...

230
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:20,472
-Right.
-...but I'm here to party too.''

231
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:23,078
Because I like to party,
so I like my Jesus to party.

232
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,772
I like to picture Jesus as a ninja
fighting off evil samurai.

233
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:30,886
I like to think of Jesus,
like, with giant eagle’s wings.

234
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:34,148
And singing lead vocals
for Lynyrd Skynyrd...

235
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:35,950
...with, like, a angel band.

236
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,095
And I'm in the front row,
and I'm hammered drunk.

237
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,888
Hey, Cal?
Why don't you just shut up?

238
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,191
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

239
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:48,771
Dear 8-pound, 6-ounce,
newborn infant Jesus...

240
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,036
...don't even know a word yet...

241
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:55,201
...just a little infant and so cuddly,
but still omnipotent...

242
00:14:55,413 --> 00:15:00,009
...we just thank you for all the races
I've won and the 2 1 .2 million dollars--

243
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,753
Love that money!

244
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,422
--that I have accrued
over this past season.

245
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,717
Also, due to a binding
endorsement contract...

246
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,417
...that stipulates I mention
Powerade at each grace...

247
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,859
...I just wanna say that
Powerade is delicious...

248
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,226
...and it cools you off
on a hot summer day.

249
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:22,134
And we look forward to Powerade's
release of Mystic Mountain Blueberry.

250
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,672
Thank you for all your power
and your grace, dear baby God. Amen.

251
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,070
-Amen.
-Amen.

252
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,506
Let's dig in!

253
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:31,705
That was a hell of a grace, man.
You nailed that like a split hog!

254
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,679
I'm not gonna lie to you, it felt good.

255
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:35,579
Dad, you made that grace your bitch.

256
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:37,981
Hey, boys, I wanna see
some napkins in the lap.

257
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:39,619
Boys, how was school today?

258
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:43,021
I threw a bunch of Grandpa chip's
war medals off the bridge.

259
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:46,492
Sounds like a good day.
Texas Ranger, how about you?

260
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,894
Well, the teacher asked me what
was the capital of North Carolina.

261
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:51,964
I said, ''Washington, D.C.''

262
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:53,136
-Bingo.
-Nice.

263
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:57,501
She said, ''No, you're wrong.''
I said, ''You got a lumpy butt.''

264
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,836
She got mad at me and yelled at me
and I pissed in my pants.

265
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,843
And I never did change
my pee pants all day.

266
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,141
I'm still sitting in my dirty pee pants.

267
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,615
I wet my bed until I was 1 9.
There's no shame in that.

268
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,252
I get emotional because
you guys are working so hard.

269
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,419
I'm just so proud of you.
You remind me of me...

270
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,255
...precocious and full of wonderment.

271
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:21,363
Tell you what, Ricky,
you are truly blessed.

272
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,863
-These two are two in a million.
-I am.

273
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,968
Just like Carley's tatas.

274
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,434
You won't find another rack like that,
I guarantee.

275
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,300
Thank you, Cal.

276
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:31,941
That's real sweet of you, Cal.

277
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:35,078
That's real nice. That's one of
the nicest things you've ever said.

278
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,747
-Well, I mean it.
-Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

279
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:39,643
It comes from my heart, that's why.

280
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:42,048
I can't hold my tongue.

281
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:45,450
These kids are my grandchildren,
and you are raising them wrong.

282
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:46,884
They are terrible boys.

283
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,719
Shut up, Chip,
or I'II go ape-shit on your ass!

284
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,452
I'm gonna scissor-kick you
in the back of the head.

285
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,563
-Yeah!
-Yeah. Turn up the heat.

286
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,323
Go on and get some, boys.

287
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:58,832
I'm 1 0 years old,
but I'II beat your ass.

288
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:01,561
Chip, I'm gonna come at you
like a spider monkey.

289
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,467
Like a spider monkey! Go on.

290
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:04,800
Chip, you brought this on.

291
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,874
The greatest generation, my ass.

292
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:08,635
Tom Brokaw is a punk.

293
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:09,835
What is wrong with you?

294
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,277
Chip, I'm all jacked up
on Mountain Dew.

295
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:14,173
I love that.

296
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:17,843
You gonna let your sons talk to their
grandfather like that? I'm their elder.

297
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:21,081
I sure as hell am, Chip.
I love the way they're taking to you.

298
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,886
They're winners.
Winners get to do what they want.

299
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:25,618
Hell, you're just a bag of bones.

300
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,594
Only thing you ever done with your life
is make a hot daughter.

301
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,767
That's it. That is it!

302
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,196
We wanted us some wussies...

303
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:35,133
...we would’ve named them Dr. Quinn
and Medicine Woman, okay?

304
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,398
I work too hard for your bull, Chip.

305
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,405
Come here.
You make me hot. Come here.

306
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:41,809
Everyone just keep eating.

307
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:44,572
-It's on.
-Come here. Come here.

308
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:48,443
AII right.

309
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,085
I'II hold your hair.

310
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:04,924
-Hey, Stephen.
-Hey, Ricky.

311
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:07,069
Got those two tickets
for my special friend?

312
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:11,002
Yeah, sure do. You know I do, Ricky.
Got them right here, buddy.

313
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,301
Great. Hey,
how's your mama's hip?

314
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:15,569
She's gonna be all right,
thank you for asking.

315
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,804
-Appreciate it. Hey, good luck today.
-Thanks.

316
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,415
That's the saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

317
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:23,348
That boy leaves two tickets
for his daddy at every race...

318
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:24,816
...and he never shows up.

319
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,751
That's a shame.

320
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:30,051
The human heart is such a mystery.

321
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:33,492
-Let's sell these bitches, huh?
-Hell, yeah.

322
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,495
-Beer money, huh?
-There you go. Yes.

323
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,200
As the laps wind down,
Jamie McMurray is the leader.

324
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:43,430
Cal Naughton in second.
Ricky Bobby in third.

325
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:46,201
What's up, Cal? You ready
for a little Shake-and-Bake-age?

326
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,208
-Hey, buddy.
-Naughton Jr. is letting Ricky Bobby...

327
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:53,008
...draft up to him to make
that slingshot move past McMurray.

328
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,708
Can you believe that he would do that
for his teammate?

329
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,547
Set him up that way?

330
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,714
Slingshot, engage.

331
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,792
And there goes Ricky Bobby
on the outside!

332
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,155
That's how we do it.

333
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,797
Makes his move.
Naughton's giving him plenty of room.

334
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:11,593
What in the hell is he doing, guys?
Get him off of me.

335
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,032
They touch! They spin!

336
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,266
Snap!

337
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,240
Come on, man!

338
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:25,314
See you, wouldn't wanna be you.

339
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,557
Look at that! Ricky Bobby's gonna
try to win the race in reverse.

340
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,458
Man, he wants this win bad!

341
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,335
Ricky Bobby wins it in reverse!

342
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:47,367
Unbelievable!
I love that! That is cool!

343
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:52,508
Jamie, losing's never fun, but here's
something to pick your spirits up.

344
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,338
It's real nice.
I got it at Target. It's on sale.

345
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:02,577
Yeah!

346
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:11,620
-That's it. Another one. Another one.
-AII right, man. We did it!

347
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:15,321
I don't wanna be raining on
your parade, but I gotta tell you...

348
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:19,593
...that was some of the dumbest driving
I have ever seen in my life.

349
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,668
-Thank you.
-And I know you won the race...

350
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:23,430
...but you're not gonna live forever.

351
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,438
I'm not stupid, Lucius.
No one lives forever. No one.

352
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,875
But with advances in modern science
and my high level of income...

353
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,482
...I mean, it's not crazy to think
I can't live to be 2 45, maybe 300.

354
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:38,177
I just read in the newspaper they
put a pig heart in some Russian guy.

355
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:40,653
Know what--? I mean,
do you know what that means?

356
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,452
No, I don't know what that means.
I guess, longer life.

357
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,491
-Well, no, he didn't live.
-He didn't live?

358
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:48,324
No. It's just exciting
that we're trying things like that.

359
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:51,190
-Ricky?
-Hey, Mr. Dennit.

360
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:53,427
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

361
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,935
-She already wasted?
-Celebrating.

362
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,370
She's celebrating.
You feel pretty good today, huh?

363
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:00,543
Look, Ricky,
early word out of NASCAR...

364
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:03,474
...is your little obscene gesture's
gonna cost you 1 00 points.

365
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,080
You know how much that costs us
in sponsorship dollars?

366
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:08,012
With all due respect, Mr. Dennit...

367
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:13,178
...I had no idea you had experimental
surgery to have your balls removed.

368
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,381
What did you say?
What was that?

369
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:17,423
Well, what?
I said, ''With all due respect.''

370
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,358
That doesn't mean you get to say
whatever you wanna say to me.

371
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,225
-It sure as heck does.
-No, it doesn't.

372
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,094
It's in the Geneva Convention.
Look it up.

373
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:26,428
I remember your daddy
used to love it.

374
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:31,301
-This is not my dad-- This is my team--
-Used to love it when I used to win.

375
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,908
Now, I suggest you and your wife,
Mrs. Jim Beam...

376
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:36,238
...you guys go take a chill pill.
Enjoy the win!

377
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,176
-Come on, man!
-Yeah, Ricky. Okay.

378
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,077
Baby, photo op, photo op.
Come on.

379
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:42,013
Come on, number one.

380
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:44,811
Hold my hand, baby.

381
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,956
I'II tell you what, though, guys,
that was a hell of a race today.

382
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,067
-Shake and Bake in full effect.
-It's always been like that.

383
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:02,863
Me and Ricky,
since we were little kids, man.

384
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,304
We go together like Chinese food
and chocolate pudding. Let's face it.

385
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,206
Yeah, but those are two things
that don't really go together.

386
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,813
We go together
like cocaine and waffles.

387
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:14,745
No, like, for instance,
if I say peanut butter and....

388
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:17,285
-Ladies, right?
-Yep.

389
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:18,648
-No, jelly.
-Am I right?

390
00:22:18,856 --> 00:22:21,086
-Jelly?
-You like to put jelly on a lady?

391
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,953
I'm gonna settle this thing.
Let's just get ourselves...

392
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:28,188
...a whole mess of cocktails,
get drunk and work this thing out.

393
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:30,059
-Work this thing out.
-That's right.

394
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:34,804
So I was taking to Nana on Saturday,
and her birthday's coming up...

395
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,303
...but I don't know what to get her.
She's gonna be 88.

396
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:39,203
Get her a coffin.

397
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:48,918
Hey, Cal, I'm sorry
about wrecking you today.

398
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,953
-I mean, but that was for the team.
-No, that's cool. That's cool, I know.

399
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:55,648
I was thinking, though, one time...

400
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,455
...it would be really awesome if, like,
you could slingshot me in for a win.

401
00:23:00,664 --> 00:23:03,258
Yeah, but-- Okay, but if you won...

402
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,765
-...how am I gonna win?
-Yeah.

403
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,529
-Think about it.
-No, I was thinking about it.

404
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,798
I mean, it's not like
you're finishing 1 8th.

405
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:14,068
-There's nothing wrong with silver.
-Nothing wrong with silver at all.

406
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:16,542
I'm just kidding you, man.
I don't wanna win.

407
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:20,346
I'II just bury it down inside.

408
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:23,281
Bury it deep down in there,
and never bring it up again.

409
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,648
It's painful, and I love you!

410
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:27,687
Get her a gigolo.

411
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:30,553
-What?
-A guy to have sex with her.

412
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:32,661
No, she's gonna be 88 and....

413
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:35,457
You don't stop liking sex
when you're old.

414
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,030
Well, I was thinking
more along the line of....

415
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:44,640
-like, she likes afghans and quilts.
-She's probably got a million of those.

416
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:48,038
How many dudes does she have
coming over to have sex with her?

417
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:51,279
-None.
-Exactly.

418
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:53,573
Be thoughtful, Glenn.

419
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,485
Don't stop.

420
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:04,382
What is that?

421
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:06,961
Someone made a tape of
something dying or something.

422
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,165
Hey, turn that crap off.
What's going on?

423
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,266
I want this music out of my head.

424
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:12,935
Hey, turn that off!

425
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,433
Turn that off right now!

426
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,636
Why did you stop the jazz music?

427
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:27,645
Was it not pleasant for you?

428
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:30,718
No one plays jazz here
at The Pit Stop, okay?

429
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:33,446
So why is the song on the jukebox?

430
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:36,785
We keep it on there
for profiling purposes.

431
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:40,088
We also got
the Pet Shop Boys and Seal.

432
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:43,732
My name is Jean Girard...

433
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,525
...and I am a racing-car driver
just like you...

434
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:50,730
...except I am from Formula Un.

435
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:55,309
I am the greatest one
in the whole world.

436
00:24:55,512 --> 00:25:01,041
I have been following your career
with great interest, Monsieur Bobby.

437
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,617
I can't understand a word
you've said the whole time.

438
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,617
Did you eat peanut butter
or something?

439
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:08,791
You sound like a dog with peanut butter
on the roof of your mouth.

440
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:12,553
I think what you are hearing
is my accent.

441
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,288
I am French.

442
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:17,091
You say you're French?

443
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:21,096
We? No, we are not French.

444
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:24,406
We're American,
because you're in America, okay?

445
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,132
Greatest country on the planet.

446
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:28,140
Well, what have you
given the world...

447
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:32,475
...apart from George Bush, Cheerios,
and the ThighMaster?

448
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,547
-Chinese food?
-Chinese food.

449
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:35,979
That's from China.

450
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:38,313
-Pizza.
-Italy.

451
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:41,047
-Chimichanga.
-Mexican.

452
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:43,818
Really, smarty-pants?
What did French land give us?

453
00:25:44,027 --> 00:25:48,259
We invented democracy,
existentialism...

454
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,625
...and the blowjob.

455
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,726
-Those are three pretty good things.
-Hey.

456
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:54,494
Well, that last one's pretty cool.

457
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:59,438
You know, the 69 with
the head near the-- That bit.

458
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,803
We came up with it.

459
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:03,445
We created the missionary position.

460
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:07,242
-You're welcome.
-Ricky Bobby...

461
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:10,477
...I have come here to defeat you.

462
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:13,485
Oh, well, there's strikes two and three
right there.

463
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:15,716
Did you hear what he just said?

464
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,224
Well, welcome to America, amigo.

465
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:27,301
You are fast, Ricky Bobby...

466
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:29,699
...but I am faster.

467
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:33,603
AII right, you let go of me,
you Formula One jazz nutjob!

468
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,335
Like the frightened baby chipmunk...

469
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:39,344
...you are scared by anything
that is different.

470
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:41,847
I will let you go, Ricky...

471
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:46,284
...but first I want you to say:

472
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:51,227
''I love crêpes.''

473
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,887
Don't you say it, Ricky.
These colors don't run.

474
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,725
-I'm not gonna say it.
-Good.

475
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:59,094
Hey, look, Frenchy,
I thought about it.

476
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,532
So why don't you go ahead
and break my arm?

477
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:04,798
I do not want to break your arm,
Monsieur Bobby...

478
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,600
...but I am a man of my word.

479
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,869
Here's the deal.
He's not gonna break it...

480
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,479
...because I'm gonna slip
out of it right now. Houdini.

481
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:12,943
Get down, you little pancake.

482
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,708
Someone get me a beer
while I'm here.

483
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:17,113
But you have forced me to do this.

484
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,050
You are now mocking me
and making me look ridiculous.

485
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,884
Just say, ''I love crêpes.''

486
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:25,994
You know, just to put this in there, I had
a whole mess of crêpes this morning.

487
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:27,959
They're like pancakes,
maybe even better.

488
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:30,895
-Are they the really thin pancakes?
-Yeah.

489
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:34,093
They are the really thin pancakes.
It's just a French word for them.

490
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,795
-My God, I love those.
-Put any syrups you want on them.

491
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:39,840
-I'm saying, think about it.
-They come with cheese sometimes?

492
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:41,772
Yes, of course,
a fromage-crêpe.

493
00:27:42,012 --> 00:27:44,037
Well, why didn't someone
yell that right away?

494
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:45,839
You know what's in
the crêpe suzette?

495
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:48,142
-Oh, I love the crêpe suzette.
-With the sugar...

496
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:51,047
-...and lemon juice, Grand Marnier.
-Sugar and lemon juice.

497
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:53,620
I wish I could crawl into
one of those right now.

498
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:57,487
-I'd eat my way out from the inside.
-They are tasty.

499
00:27:57,694 --> 00:28:00,185
Either way this goes, could we
get some after we're done?

500
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:03,059
-Absolutely. We're gonna do that.
-So, what if you just said:

501
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:07,498
''I love really thin pancakes''?
That is a fair compromise, no?

502
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:09,831
-That is a fair compromise.
-Very fair, actually.

503
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,736
No! Because then everyone
would know I really meant crêpes.

504
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,467
That's a pretty good compromise.

505
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:17,579
Why do you want me
to break your arm so badly?

506
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,875
You don't understand
because you don't understand liberty.

507
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:22,915
You don't understand freedom.

508
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,816
So you put a crack in my arm
like the crack in the liberty Bell.

509
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:30,055
Hey. This is just
between you and me, okay?

510
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,421
I mean, forget all these other guys.

511
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,359
But he did give you a pretty
decent out. But it's your call.

512
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,260
What do you think?

513
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,835
-Don't say it.
-Yeah. I'm not gonna say it.

514
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,503
Break it, Pepé Le Pew.

515
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,133
As you wish.

516
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:50,473
-He actually did it!
-AII right. You did it. Back off.

517
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:52,511
-I didn't say it!
-No, you did not.

518
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:56,117
Your injury is one
of ignorance and pride.

519
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,913
Hold it right there,
Mr. Fancy Pants Foreigner.

520
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:02,557
You just broke my bro's arm.

521
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,351
Now you're about to get Tasered.

522
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:08,493
-Say hello to Dr. Watts.
-Get him, Cal.

523
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,794
I need you all to step away...

524
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,334
...from my driver.

525
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:17,473
The hell you taking about, ''my driver''?
What are you doing with a gun?

526
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,165
Don't you worry about my gun, Ricky.

527
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:23,278
Jean Girard is my new boy
at Dennit Racing. He's here to win us...

528
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,210
...an overall-points championship,
something you apparently...

529
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,976
...have no interest in.
He's gonna usher in a new era.

530
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,880
Mr. Dennit, with all due respect--

531
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,351
And remember,
I'm saying, ''with all due respect.''

532
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:37,891
--that idea ain't worth a velvet painting
of a whale and a dolphin getting it on.

533
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:41,287
That's good. That's good fun.
That's good fun, Ricky...

534
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:44,433
...but that doesn't bother me anymore
because Jean is the future...

535
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,033
...Ricky, the past.

536
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,431
So, Jean, introduce me
to your new teammates.

537
00:29:49,105 --> 00:29:53,269
Everybody,
this is my husband, Gregory.

538
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:54,943
What?

539
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:57,708
See you at the track.

540
00:29:58,315 --> 00:29:59,782
Did he just say ''husband''?

541
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:04,420
Sweet lord. Dennit hired a gay
Frenchman as your teammate.

542
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,919
The room's starting to spin real fast.

543
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,522
Because of gayness.

544
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:15,494
-Cal, I love you.
-Ricky? Ricky! Oh, God!

545
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:29,475
Fans and NASCAR, everyone is taking
about this new driver, Jean Girard.

546
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,137
Let's find out a little bit more about him
from our reporter, Davey Wesling.

547
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,081
Talented. Eccentric. Dominating.

548
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:40,620
These are the words
that define Jean Girard.

549
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:45,727
Before each race, Jean Girard spends
time with his world-class horses...

550
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,954
...who are also gay.

551
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,632
Jean's days are filled
with sun-drenched walks...

552
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,029
...with his beloved husband, Gregory.

553
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:56,733
Though Gregory is
no stay-at-home spouse.

554
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,875
He's a world-class trainer
of German shepherds.

555
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,340
Rolfe, the Nazi boyfriend.
Up on top!

556
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,812
Very nice. Very nice.

557
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:11,148
Only time will tell if Jean's foray
into NAS CAR...

558
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,413
...will end up in Victory Lane.

559
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,309
Well, kiss my ass on Sunday.

560
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,471
-Lucius, what the hell is going on?
-The man can drive.

561
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:41,513
And check out his crew chief
over there.

562
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:43,948
Won the Nobel Prize
for physics back in '93.

563
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:47,123
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a new track record.

564
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:50,884
As it stands now, Jean Girard is sitting
on the pole, which is, of course...

565
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:53,324
...a statement of fact
and in no way a comment...

566
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,361
...on the driver's sexual orientation.

567
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:58,329
Put a smile on your face?
That's the future of Dennit Racing.

568
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,901
-That make you happy?
-I'm just thrilled, Mr. Dennit.

569
00:32:01,104 --> 00:32:03,197
I love seeing some French guy
break my record...

570
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:06,239
...while I got my arm wrapped up
like a fricking gordita.

571
00:32:06,443 --> 00:32:08,001
Hello, Ricky Bobby.

572
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:13,411
What happened last week was
very regrettable and unfortunate...

573
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,251
...and, as a gesture, I would like to...

574
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:18,887
...sign your cast, please.

575
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,717
Hell, you know what,
get my car off the trailer, guys.

576
00:32:21,925 --> 00:32:23,552
Baby! That's my baby!

577
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,923
Hold on, Ricky. Ricky, Ricky, Rick.
What are you taking about?

578
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,725
Look. I wanna drive. My arm's fine.
So let’s get the car off the trailer.

579
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:33,027
Don't look at me.
Get it off the trailer!

580
00:32:33,236 --> 00:32:37,434
Even with a healthy arm, you don't
have a chance against Jean Girard.

581
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,438
AII right, fellas. You heard the man.
Get the car off. Let's go.

582
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:41,974
You guys heard it.

583
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,839
-What's going on?
-Soon you will know what it is like...

584
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:50,611
...to be defeated by the hands of
somebody who is truly better than you.

585
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:56,222
As William Blake wrote,
''The cut worm forgives the plow.''

586
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:59,293
Well, let me just quote the late,
great Colonel Sanders...

587
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:03,057
...who said,
''I'm too drunk to taste this chicken.''

588
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,131
What's that got to do with this?

589
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:09,032
I got a message for all of them.
Ready? Shake and Bake!

590
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,640
What does that do? Does that
blow your mind? That just happened!

591
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:16,141
What is that, a catch phrase
or is that epilepsy?

592
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:18,871
-Shake and Bake. Shake and Bake.
-What?

593
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:23,781
Listen, you better be careful because
tomorrow you're going to get beaten.

594
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:26,080
Beaten real bad, cowboy.

595
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:27,654
-Really?
-Yes!

596
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,984
-I don't want to know.
-That's news to me.

597
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:33,458
-Tomorrow you'll be in trouble.
-I'II rip you a new one.

598
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,922
There's going to be a croissant
I'm going to take away.

599
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,327
I play for keeps!

600
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:41,630
I give you one option,
Monsieur Bobby.

601
00:33:41,838 --> 00:33:45,001
As a sign of humility,
if you kiss me on the lips now...

602
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:48,803
...I will return to Paris and you will
never see me again in NASCAR.

603
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:50,411
The answer is never!

604
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,275
-I close my--
-Do you hear me? Never ever!

605
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:56,179
-Well, yes or no?
-That's sick.

606
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:01,955
Let me tell you, hold on.
Shake and Bake.

607
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:03,386
Yeah!

608
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,390
What does that mean?
It makes no sense!

609
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:07,358
This ''Shake and Bake,''
it's nonsense.

610
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:10,863
-Hey, baby. You guys are so smooth.
-Thanks, daring.

611
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:14,093
Cal, you could say that 1 0,000 times
and it still wouldn’t be enough.

612
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,499
-It fires me up.
-I love it. Say it one more time.

613
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,674
-Shake and Bake!
-Doesn't that feel good?

614
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:22,902
Yeah! It rhymes,
they're both verbs. It's awesome.

615
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:48,465
NAS CAR on Fox welcomes you
to Lowe's Motor Speedway...

616
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:51,162
...where tonight we'll go 500 miles.

617
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:55,637
The big stories tonight
are at both ends of the grid.

618
00:34:55,845 --> 00:35:00,179
Up front, Larry, the surprising French
Formula One driver, Jean Girard.

619
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:04,551
And at the opposite end of the grid,
Darrell, Ricky Bobby.

620
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:07,882
I saw Ricky Bobby last night walking
around with a cast on his arm.

621
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:10,958
Now, I don't know who he conned
into letting him start this race.

622
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,991
Just keep a camera on him
all night long.

623
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:15,962
I am so excited.

624
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:18,827
This is a new era
for Dennit Racing, huh?

625
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:23,870
So serious all the time
about your big race team.

626
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:27,600
-Who cares?
-But this is my life. This is my life.

627
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,337
You know what? There's only one
good thing about coming to the races...

628
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:35,347
...and that is
the vibrations from the cars.

629
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,385
Oh, I love when them cars whiz by.

630
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:43,151
Can feel the motor...

631
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,589
...running up my legs.

632
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:50,622
Ricky Bobby, who never met
a sponsor he wouldn't push...

633
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,824
...has a Fig Newton sticker
on his windshield.

634
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:54,867
Think NAS CAR will
black-flag him for that.

635
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,436
He sold the windshield!

636
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,370
This sticker is dangerous and
inconvenient, but I love Fig Newtons.

637
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:03,937
Ricky Bobby started this race
in the back...

638
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:06,513
...but he's making no friends
on the way to the front.

639
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:10,379
I'm all about getting to the front tonight,
Lucius. Let's go! Let's move it!

640
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,451
Well, he's driving
like a man possessed.

641
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:16,455
I'm not even sure he realizes how
much damage he's doing to his car.

642
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:23,656
Hey, Ricky. You know you're driving
like a pissed-off teenager, okay?

643
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,561
Where is that Frenchy?

644
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,767
I got you, Pepé Le Bitch.

645
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,172
Oh, Ricky Bobby.

646
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,938
Hey, it's me, America.

647
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,586
Yeah, I'm here.

648
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,255
You have spilled my macchiato.

649
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:50,222
Look at Girard in the 55.

650
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:54,294
He's made that car three lanes wide,
but he's still fast.

651
00:36:54,497 --> 00:36:58,263
No, no, no, my friend.
This way also closed. Not this way.

652
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:01,963
Lucius, what's he doing?
He's everywhere at once.

653
00:37:02,171 --> 00:37:04,605
Guy's dangerous, Ricky.
He's like a cobra. Back off!

654
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,798
Where's Cal?
I need a little support here!

655
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:10,545
Tell Ricky I'm on my way.

656
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,676
Damn it!

657
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,582
Hey, Ricky, listen.

658
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:25,694
Cal blew out his engine.
You have no backup. Back off!

659
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:29,092
I ain't backing off.
I'm Ricky Bobby, I'm the best there is.

660
00:37:29,298 --> 00:37:32,028
He's too good, Ricky. Lay off!

661
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:34,893
Bobby's boxed in.
There's nowhere to go there.

662
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:40,874
He's gonna try the outside move again.
I don't know if it's gonna work.

663
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,704
Come on, Daddy!

664
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,573
Come on, Daddy! Whoop his butt!

665
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:47,375
Send that weird man
back to Indonesia.

666
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:53,088
-Come on!
-Bobby moves to the outside.

667
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,916
Not a lot of room. He's in the wall!

668
00:37:55,124 --> 00:37:57,354
Bobby is sliding,
slamming into the wall.

669
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,331
He's airborne!

670
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:09,830
Yep. I'm flying through the air.
This is not good.

671
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,701
-Ricky!
-Cool!

672
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:23,585
Ricky!

673
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,093
Peaches and cream!

674
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:38,158
The car comes to rest
in a big cloud of smoke.

675
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,267
Ricky Bobby appears to be okay...

676
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,870
...but that Wonder Bread car is toast.

677
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,767
Fantastic.

678
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:47,602
Oh, my God! Ricky!

679
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:51,044
Hakuna matata, bitches.

680
00:38:57,453 --> 00:39:00,422
It's okay, guys, it's just a wreck.
Ricky can handle it.

681
00:39:00,623 --> 00:39:03,922
Now, that's one of the nastiest wrecks
you'll ever see.

682
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:06,288
Oh, no, no, no.

683
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,464
It's all right. You're safe.

684
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:10,598
-You're safe.
-We got you. We're here.

685
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,165
I'm on fire.

686
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:14,598
It's all right.
It's all right, you're not on fire!

687
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:18,570
-You're lying! I'm on fire!
-There is no fire.

688
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,334
-I'm on fire. I don't wanna die.
-Come back here.

689
00:39:21,544 --> 00:39:25,173
But something looks wrong. I mean,
he's running around like he's on fire.

690
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:29,078
Oh, my God! Help me!
I don't wanna die! Stop, drop, and roll!

691
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:32,686
-You're not on fire, Ricky Bobby!
-I'm on fire!

692
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:34,356
You're not on fire.

693
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:37,758
But I'm not even sure he even knows
where he's at right now.

694
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,863
This makes us all realize the kind
of pressure these drivers are under.

695
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:44,532
Mr. Bobby, come on down here.

696
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:48,363
Help me, Jesus!
Help me, Jewish God!

697
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:49,970
Help me, Allah!

698
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:52,801
Help me, Tom Cruise!

699
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:55,603
But how did he get down
to his underwear that fast?

700
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,974
Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft on me
to get the fire off me!

701
00:39:59,182 --> 00:40:00,547
Look. Here, help's coming.

702
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,479
-Wait a minute!
-It's Cal Naughton.

703
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:07,022
Oh, God! Please don't let
the invisible fire burn my friend!

704
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,548
I got you!
I got you, man! I'II help you!

705
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:15,458
He's jumping on Ricky, trying
to put the nonexistent fire out.

706
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,223
Now, that's a teammate right there.

707
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:18,923
This is going downhill fast.

708
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:22,070
It would be a great time
to go to commercial break.

709
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:24,363
Help me, Oprah Winfrey!

710
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:30,173
You know, Larry, there's good days
in racing, and there's bad days.

711
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:33,610
Ricky Bobby just had himself
a bad day.

712
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,585
He's suffering from catatonic shock.

713
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:47,354
His injuries are minor, but right now he
can't deal with the trauma of the wreck.

714
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:50,657
Golly, this is a hard decision.

715
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:55,735
But I have thought about it,
and I want the plug pulled.

716
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:57,337
Yeah.

717
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,770
Ma'am, your husband's not dying.

718
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:02,274
He's just taking a nap.

719
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:04,643
-Just look at him.
-No, I'm not lying.

720
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:07,179
I've never seen him
make that noise. Ever.

721
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,781
Got more plugs in him
than a Circuit City.

722
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:15,617
Oh, baby.
Mama loves you so much.

723
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:20,021
Hey, Ricky. It's me, Cal.

724
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:24,529
Just want you to know,
I got your back, bro. No matter what.

725
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,869
There's something
I want to get off my chest...

726
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,904
...and it's about that summer when
you went away to community college.

727
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:35,635
I got a offer to do Playgirl magazine...

728
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:38,308
...and I did it.

729
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:41,711
I did a full spread
for Playgirl magazine.

730
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:46,185
I mean spread, man.
I pulled my butt apart and stuff...

731
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:50,624
...and I was totally nude,
and it was weird.

732
00:41:50,826 --> 00:41:52,555
You probably didn't hear about it...

733
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:55,094
...because I went under the name
of Mike Honcho.

734
00:41:55,298 --> 00:41:56,993
But I just wanted you to know that.

735
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,999
If you could hear me,
if it got into your brain somehow...

736
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:03,364
...that I spread my butt cheeks
as Mike Honcho.

737
00:42:03,572 --> 00:42:06,439
''Are you there, God?
It's me, Margaret.

738
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:10,544
Gretchen, my friend, got her period.
I'm so jealous, God.

739
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:13,681
I hate myself for being so jealous,
but I am.

740
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:16,078
I wish you'd help me just a little.

741
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:20,745
Nancy's sure she's going to
get it soon too. And if I'm last....''

742
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:24,056
Hey, Ricky. Ricky!

743
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:26,258
Come on, man, wake up.

744
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,191
Are you faking it?

745
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,831
Are you faking it? Fake it!

746
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:43,003
I don't know how much longer
I can take seeing you like this.

747
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,547
I am not gonna let you die here...

748
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,650
...Like some kind of vegetable.

749
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:52,213
I'm gonna put an end to this
right now.

750
00:42:52,421 --> 00:42:54,082
Get all this crap off you.

751
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,349
You don't need any of this crap.

752
00:42:59,195 --> 00:43:01,686
This is it. This is how it ends.

753
00:43:01,897 --> 00:43:03,421
This is how Shake and Bake ends.

754
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:06,297
It's shadow time, buddy.

755
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:11,370
It's time to go home to Jesus.

756
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:13,970
Goodbye, buddy.

757
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:19,948
Oh, wow, you definitely--

758
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:22,583
You definitely
still got some fight in you.

759
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:27,182
Okay, maybe we give this
another day.

760
00:43:28,057 --> 00:43:31,049
Middle. I'II go up to the middle.
Let's play some defense!

761
00:43:32,962 --> 00:43:36,022
I just wanna say thanks, doc,
for taking care of our boy here.

762
00:43:36,232 --> 00:43:39,360
-Oh, shit.
-That's a foul! That's a foul!

763
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:40,933
Doc, give it to me straight.

764
00:43:41,137 --> 00:43:43,435
Is he ever gonna be able
to walk again?

765
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:46,506
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought someone
had told you. He's fine.

766
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:48,404
He found that wheelchair
in the hallway.

767
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:51,478
His paralysis is
entirely psychosomatic.

768
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,309
But we all need to go along with this,
because he's in a delicate state.

769
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:59,045
So when you say psychosomatic,
you mean, like...

770
00:43:59,255 --> 00:44:01,655
...he could start a fire
with his thoughts?

771
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:03,848
No, not at all.
It means it's all in his mind.

772
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:07,722
I'm saying, sometimes you get a knock
on the head, you get special powers.

773
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,330
It happens all the time.
Read a comic book, okay?

774
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:11,966
Everyone's real friendly.

775
00:44:12,168 --> 00:44:15,160
It doesn't hurt being Ricky Bobby.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

776
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:16,998
So how's the physical therapy going?

777
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:20,073
Oh, I gave that up.
Yeah, I gave that up...

778
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:23,336
...after maybe the first day.
Within the first hour, I gave that up.

779
00:44:23,546 --> 00:44:25,571
I'm through lying to myself,
you know?

780
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:29,217
It's time to be mature about this
and just face facts.

781
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,852
I bought myself
a hundred-thousand-dollar...

782
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:33,385
...handicap-accessible van...

783
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:37,286
...with the captain's chairs and the DVD
plasma screens in the back for the kids.

784
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:39,984
-You all paid up on that?
-Yeah. That's all paid in full.

785
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:43,165
It's parked out there.
And then the next thing I gotta do...

786
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:47,301
...is I just gotta have a sit-down
with Carley and just let her know...

787
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:53,470
...that it's okay for her to seek
the comfort of other men.

788
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:57,744
Because she's gotta run wild. You
can't keep something like that back.

789
00:44:58,013 --> 00:44:59,378
Hold on, man. Hold....

790
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:01,780
-We gotta tell him.
-Now?

791
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:04,748
No, I don't care what the doctor said,
we gotta tell him now.

792
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,512
Ricky, the doctor told us...

793
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:09,486
...that we should let you work it out
in your own sweet time...

794
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:11,023
...but, Ricky, you can walk.

795
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:12,922
What did you just say?

796
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:16,222
He's telling you the truth, man.
It's all in your head.

797
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:21,994
You sick sons of bitches!

798
00:45:22,204 --> 00:45:24,001
I mean, you walk in that door...

799
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:27,607
...on your two legs,
all fat and cocky...

800
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:32,338
...and looking at me in my chair,
and you tell me it's all in my head?

801
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:34,516
I hope that both of you have sons.

802
00:45:34,717 --> 00:45:39,677
Handsome, beautiful, articulate sons
who are talented and star athletes...

803
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:41,719
...and they have their legs
taken away!

804
00:45:41,924 --> 00:45:43,858
I pray you know
that pain and that hurt.

805
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:46,357
Don't you put that evil on me,
Ricky Bobby!

806
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:50,931
Don't you put that on us!
You are not paralyzed!

807
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:52,862
I am so paralyzed!

808
00:45:53,068 --> 00:45:56,504
-No, no, no! No, he needs to know!
-Getting a little rough on him.

809
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:59,105
-He's always crying!
-Tough love, it is. Tough love.

810
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:01,970
- Wake up, idiot!
-You wanna know what I am?!

811
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,611
You wanna see what my life is?!

812
00:46:04,813 --> 00:46:06,041
Don't do it.

813
00:46:06,248 --> 00:46:10,412
-You wanna see what's going on here?
-Don't you stick that knife in your leg.

814
00:46:18,794 --> 00:46:21,456
-Man!
-Hold on, hold on.

815
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:24,962
-Hold on, now. Walk it off.
-Oh, that hurts.

816
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:26,464
-Oh, my--!
-Walk it off.

817
00:46:26,669 --> 00:46:28,466
Stretch, stretch. Stretch it out.

818
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:31,139
Hey, man.
You can walk! You can walk!

819
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,898
I can walk!

820
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:35,974
-I think I touched a nerve.
-Right there.

821
00:46:36,178 --> 00:46:38,908
AII right, we got it, we got it.
Hold it right there.

822
00:46:39,114 --> 00:46:40,411
Maybe don't touch it.

823
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,516
-Can you feel it?
-I can!

824
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:45,084
We’ll use this knife to pry it out.
We’ll pull it out.

825
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:47,847
-Now we got two in there.
-Just don't think about it.

826
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:50,321
-We're going down a bad path.
-Cut around the meat.

827
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:52,221
I'II cut right here.
Stretch it out.

828
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:54,692
Just take out a plug of meat.
Just like a deer.

829
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:57,627
We gotta wiggle it a little bit. That's it.
Can you feel that?

830
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,630
-Yeah, I feel that.
-You are back!

831
00:46:59,835 --> 00:47:01,427
I love you guys!

832
00:47:02,104 --> 00:47:05,733
Hey, I'm sorry, guys. I mean,
I hope your boys don't lose their legs.

833
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:09,206
-Thanks, buddy.
-So when do I get to drive again?

834
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:12,403
Well, that's the thing. The doctor
said you suffered major trauma...

835
00:47:12,615 --> 00:47:14,913
...and he thinks you should
take it slow for a while.

836
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:18,848
Yeah, so, I was thinking, like,
while you're resting up and stuff...

837
00:47:19,054 --> 00:47:21,989
-...maybe you could let me win a few.
-Well, there you go.

838
00:47:22,191 --> 00:47:24,022
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

839
00:47:24,526 --> 00:47:27,461
Yeah. I'm Ricky Bobby.
I mean, you know how I play it.

840
00:47:27,663 --> 00:47:29,824
-Yeah.
-First or last, right, baby?

841
00:47:30,032 --> 00:47:32,432
-Don't know what I was thinking.
-Besides...

842
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:35,468
...Dennit Jr. must be freaking out.
AII the money he's losing?

843
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:37,229
Without me on the track?

844
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:38,633
I mean, I just laugh...

845
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:41,776
...thinking about him whining
all the time, bitching and moaning:

846
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:44,002
''Damn, I wish Ricky was here.''

847
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:45,703
You know what I mean?

848
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:51,610
What?

849
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,220
Frenchy can drive.

850
00:47:57,993 --> 00:47:59,358
Oh, no.

851
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:29,018
Very good.

852
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:31,351
C'est la vie and que sera, sera.

853
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,552
It looks like the NASCAR
has gone French.

854
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:36,487
Well, in other news, Ricky Bobby...

855
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:39,759
...is going to be running some test laps
this weekend at Rockingham...

856
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:42,232
...in an attempt to come back
from his grisly crash.

857
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,864
It's one of the hardest things
to do in racing.

858
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:48,737
To try to bounce back after
a devastating, violent wreck.

859
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:51,378
Ricky Bobby was traumatized
during the incident.

860
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,842
AII right, baby.
Come on, now.

861
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:56,381
But today he gets to strap back into
a racecar for the first time since...

862
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:58,712
...to try to show he can still
get the job done.

863
00:48:58,921 --> 00:49:02,152
-He's gonna be great. Yep.
-He's gonna be great, sure.

864
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,087
Would you stop staring at me like that,
Susan? I swear...

865
00:49:05,294 --> 00:49:07,762
...you are the weirdest little girl
I've ever seen.

866
00:49:07,963 --> 00:49:10,659
Okay, I'm really gonna open it up!

867
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:16,896
I missed you, Mama Speed.
Ricky Bobby's back.

868
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:18,835
Wait, how fast is he going?

869
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:20,599
Twenty-six miles an hour.

870
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:26,445
What were those things?
Were those the other cars?

871
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,388
Oh, God. So fast.

872
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,319
Go, baby! There you are.

873
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,286
Am I on fire? I'm on fire.

874
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:40,462
-No, no, you're not on fire.
-Stretch it out.

875
00:49:40,662 --> 00:49:42,254
-It's okay, baby.
-Take it easy.

876
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:46,494
-Oh, God, I'm gonna get sick.
-Oh, God.

877
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:50,535
-Oh, he's in his underwear again.
-Ricky! Please put your clothes on.

878
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:53,003
He's in his underwear again.
Go get him, fellas.

879
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,436
Oh, lord.

880
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:57,476
You know who's gonna be
number one at Dennit Racing?

881
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,976
-Not Ricky?
-I'm gonna windmill you.

882
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:04,050
Mr. Cal Naughton Jr.

883
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:06,847
-Come back at him. It's the only way.
-Who are you?

884
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:08,682
-Number one.
-No.

885
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:12,383
-Oh, yes, ma'am.
-Ricky! Come on, man!

886
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:13,959
It's embarrassing.

887
00:50:14,163 --> 00:50:17,997
The ninjas are trying to get me.
The ninjas are trying to get me.

888
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,929
-Oh, my God.
-What happened?

889
00:50:20,135 --> 00:50:22,535
What happened? He's done.
He's done.

890
00:50:22,738 --> 00:50:25,263
That's what's happened.
It's over. He's finished.

891
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:27,065
What's gonna happen to me?

892
00:50:27,276 --> 00:50:30,268
I feel like I was riding inside
an asteroid or a comet or something.

893
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:32,470
Yeah, you were going fast.

894
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:34,740
-Look at that.
-What are we gonna do?

895
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,510
This is ugly.
This is bad for all of us. Look at that.

896
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:40,654
-I gotta go check on cuckoo bird.
-No, cuckoo's okay.

897
00:50:40,856 --> 00:50:43,552
Why don't you get over there
and settle down Carley for me?

898
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:45,818
-Could you do that for me?
-Yes, sir.

899
00:50:46,028 --> 00:50:47,518
There you go.

900
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:50,822
What began as a day
of hope and optimism...

901
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:54,332
...for Ricky Bobby and his race team
has ended here in sad disappointment.

902
00:50:54,536 --> 00:50:55,730
There we go, boy.

903
00:50:55,938 --> 00:50:57,803
-I lost all muscle control.
-Yeah, you did.

904
00:50:58,006 --> 00:51:01,407
-He just lost his muscle control is all.
-I lost my muscle control.

905
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:04,977
He's fine.
He just can't control the muscles.

906
00:51:14,523 --> 00:51:16,923
-Thanks for the lift, Hershell.
-Yeah, no problem.

907
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:24,197
Jenga!

908
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:27,435
I love you, Cal.

909
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:31,268
-Good one, kiddo.
-What the hell's going on?

910
00:51:31,473 --> 00:51:33,566
Hey, Ricky, nice of you
to stop by for a visit.

911
00:51:33,775 --> 00:51:36,608
What do you mean, a visit?
This is my house.

912
00:51:36,812 --> 00:51:38,302
Baby...

913
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,640
...shoot. I'm so sorry.

914
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,079
I really--
I didn't want it to be this way.

915
00:51:43,285 --> 00:51:45,685
Hey, what happened
to the family portrait?

916
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:48,582
You just crudely pasted
your face over mine.

917
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,655
We're getting married, Ricky.

918
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:53,327
And we're getting matching
leprechaun tattoos.

919
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,428
Isn't that cute?
With a little pot of gold.

920
00:51:55,631 --> 00:51:57,826
Is this some kind of joke?
You guys putting me on?

921
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:02,094
I was gone three hours.
Dennit just fired me from the team.

922
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,170
Ricky, you and I...

923
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:07,900
...we both know that this marriage
has been over for a long, long time.

924
00:52:08,143 --> 00:52:11,044
No! I honesty did not know that!

925
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:15,749
Ricky, you can't race no more.

926
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:20,854
I'm not going back to being poor
and dancing at the Wizard's Den.

927
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:22,819
You know, my old boyfriend Greg?

928
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:25,152
He still works there
and he was crazy.

929
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,328
Baby, stop.

930
00:52:27,996 --> 00:52:31,830
Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Just a second.
Let me make sure I got this straight.

931
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:34,564
Are you asking me for a divorce?

932
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,295
-Yay! Two Christmases!
-Yay! Two Christmases!

933
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:39,371
Cal?

934
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,405
How could you do this to me, man?

935
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,205
Ricky, your marriage was
a hollow shell.

936
00:52:45,414 --> 00:52:47,075
It was a cruel charade.

937
00:52:47,282 --> 00:52:49,307
She just gave me the 41 1
on the whole deal.

938
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:52,919
And you know what else?
You never let me win one time.

939
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:55,487
I thought we had a good thing going.
Shake and Bake.

940
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:58,387
You're doing great.
You just keep it up. Keep it up.

941
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,562
And Mr. Dennit told me
that it's my time now.

942
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:03,822
-Oh, really?
-That Shake and Bake is dead.

943
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:06,523
And we just came up
with a new nickname.

944
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:09,169
-It's so good. It's so good.
-I got a new nickname.

945
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:12,236
The Magic Man.
Now you see me...

946
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:14,608
...now you don't.

947
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,971
That is the stupidest nickname
I've ever heard.

948
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:18,840
Is it, Ricky?

949
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:21,311
Because I think
you wish you thought of it.

950
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:25,920
AII right. You got me.
That's an awesome nickname.

951
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:28,282
I've always had a lot of great ideas.

952
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,449
I also think I might design a car
that's in the shape of a rabbit.

953
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:36,256
It might poop out little real rabbits out
the back that'll run around the track.

954
00:53:36,465 --> 00:53:38,729
You have live rabbits
being pooped out onto a track?

955
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:41,664
If I win, I might do a special thing
with David Copperfield...

956
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:44,134
...where he hides in my car
in the passenger seat...

957
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:46,603
...and he just flings magic stuff
out the window.

958
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:48,666
Did you run any of this
by NASCAR?

959
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:52,506
Watch the mail for that invitation to
the wedding, because I want you there.

960
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:53,942
-What?!
-I know it...

961
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:56,913
...that some bad stuff happened
just now, but in time--

962
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,916
The wedding's not for
a coupe of weeks.

963
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:00,986
Why would I come
to your guys' wedding?

964
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:03,157
--you're gonna get over it
and be my best man.

965
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:04,757
I'm not gonna be your best man!

966
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,894
Baby, he's not gonna come
to the wedding.

967
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:11,156
Cal, do you realize the implications
of your actions right now?

968
00:54:11,366 --> 00:54:12,628
What's ''implication'' mean?

969
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:14,267
We are no longer friends.

970
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:17,131
-Why?
-What do you mean, ''Why?''

971
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,437
You're wrecking my life!

972
00:54:19,641 --> 00:54:22,303
You just lost your wife.
You just lost your job.

973
00:54:22,511 --> 00:54:25,207
Don't throw out your best friend
because of your anger.

974
00:54:25,781 --> 00:54:28,841
-That's absolutely ridiculous, man.
-Ricky...

975
00:54:29,051 --> 00:54:33,988
...remember, the field mouse is fast,
but the owl sees at night.

976
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:39,488
That's kind of creepy, ain't it?

977
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:45,964
-Hey, Ricky, I'II call you tomorrow.
-Shut up.

978
00:54:46,168 --> 00:54:48,830
-Bye, kids. I'II see you next weekend.
-Bye.

979
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:57,275
Ricky! Boys! Is everything all right?

980
00:54:57,512 --> 00:55:01,141
Mama, we got nowhere to go.
Carley and Cal took everything.

981
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:03,317
Well, you're home now,
and you got your mama.

982
00:55:03,518 --> 00:55:04,678
Get in here, boys. Come on.

983
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:07,582
Come on. Get in this house.

984
00:55:14,463 --> 00:55:16,658
Hey, Ricky. Are you on fire?

985
00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:20,764
-Nice denim shorts, dude.
-Hey, shut up, man.

986
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:34,780
Hump me!

987
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,618
Now, you watch yourself.

988
00:55:40,822 --> 00:55:44,121
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
I promise it won't happen again.

989
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:52,524
Hey, sorry, man.

990
00:56:01,476 --> 00:56:02,807
Hey.

991
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:04,974
I lost my license.

992
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,444
That's why I'm on the bus.
I'm delivering pizzas.

993
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:10,049
Motherfucker,
what makes you think I care?

994
00:56:10,252 --> 00:56:12,948
Shut the fuck up!

995
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:15,684
I was just telling you that because--

996
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:19,190
like I said, I lost my license. I've
been having a lot of problems lateIy.

997
00:56:19,394 --> 00:56:21,988
Problems? I don't wanna hear about
your damn problems.

998
00:56:22,197 --> 00:56:23,687
Everybody got problems.

999
00:56:23,899 --> 00:56:25,958
My mama got problems.
She just lost her leg.

1000
00:56:26,168 --> 00:56:30,036
My cousin Pookie just lost a testicle.
My dog threw up somebody's finger.

1001
00:56:30,238 --> 00:56:31,671
That's a problem.

1002
00:56:31,873 --> 00:56:34,740
I really regret opening my mouth
and taking to you.

1003
00:56:37,112 --> 00:56:39,706
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Get out of the road!

1004
00:56:39,915 --> 00:56:42,850
Hey, come on, man.
I'm on a bike. Relax.

1005
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:45,349
-Hey, shut up!
-Idiot!

1006
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:50,883
It's open.

1007
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:55,020
Hugalo's Pizza. We are pizza.

1008
00:56:56,898 --> 00:56:59,924
-You are pizza?
-Yeah, we are pizza. I gotta say it.

1009
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:05,601
Either close the door or come in.
I got weed in here, cowboy.

1010
00:57:11,613 --> 00:57:14,673
You got three pizzas that haven't
been eaten just sitting over there.

1011
00:57:14,883 --> 00:57:17,613
I know. I've been calling them
all day trying to get you...

1012
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:20,185
...but they keep sending me
different delivery people.

1013
00:57:20,388 --> 00:57:22,117
Trying to get me? Why?

1014
00:57:22,324 --> 00:57:24,019
Because I'm your daddy, that's why.

1015
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,720
-What did you just say?
-I said, I'm your daddy.

1016
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:30,454
I'm Reese Bobby.

1017
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:35,466
Me and your mama did it in a Rustier
Steak House bathroom when I was 1 7.

1018
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,467
And then you showed up.

1019
00:57:44,279 --> 00:57:46,179
Hey, son.

1020
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:49,646
-Son! Son, did this go good?
-No!

1021
00:57:49,851 --> 00:57:52,786
-Seems to me like it went pretty good.
-You're not my dad.

1022
00:57:52,988 --> 00:57:55,286
-It got a little heated, but....
-Stop taking to me!

1023
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,584
Hey, is that a Huffy?
That's a nice-looking bike, boy.

1024
00:57:58,793 --> 00:58:00,590
I can't believe it!

1025
00:58:00,795 --> 00:58:03,923
I mean, he's been
blowing me off for 25 years...

1026
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:06,692
...and now he wants
to get to know me?

1027
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,732
How the hell did he even find me?

1028
00:58:08,937 --> 00:58:10,234
I called him.

1029
00:58:10,438 --> 00:58:13,339
Are you kidding me?
Mama, why did you go do that?

1030
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,236
Son, you need help.

1031
00:58:15,443 --> 00:58:17,934
-I know he's a son of a bitch.
-He's scary.

1032
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:22,105
But you're a grown man.
You're delivering pizzas on a bike.

1033
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:25,013
How'd you even get hooked up
with him in the first place?

1034
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,848
You probably couldn’t tell
by looking at him now...

1035
00:58:28,323 --> 00:58:30,689
...but your daddy used to be
a real charmer.

1036
00:58:30,892 --> 00:58:35,761
And that night in the ladies' room of
the Rustier Steak House, he chose me.

1037
00:58:35,964 --> 00:58:37,299
-In a ladies' room?
-Shut up in here! I'm trying to sleep!

1038
00:58:37,299 --> 00:58:40,564
-In a ladies' room?
-Shut up in here! I'm trying to sleep!

1039
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:43,670
One of you turds is about
to get smacked in the mouth!

1040
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:47,273
Hey, stop yelling at me, okay?
I'm your dad. You're 7 years old.

1041
00:58:47,475 --> 00:58:49,136
Don't talk like that.

1042
00:58:51,513 --> 00:58:53,037
Hey. Hey there, lucy.

1043
00:58:53,248 --> 00:58:54,943
How you doing?

1044
00:58:56,284 --> 00:58:58,878
Oh, hey there, Ricky. look, son...

1045
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:02,146
...I know you don't
want me to be here...

1046
00:59:02,357 --> 00:59:06,316
...but I saw what happened to you
on the television. You saw the fear.

1047
00:59:06,528 --> 00:59:08,462
-I can help you with that, son.
-Really?

1048
00:59:08,663 --> 00:59:11,996
What do you care about me or us?
You never even met your grandkids.

1049
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,328
-What are you looking at, Popeye?
-Shut up, you little pot-licker.

1050
00:59:15,537 --> 00:59:16,868
I'II put you in a microwave.

1051
00:59:17,072 --> 00:59:18,630
Now, you show me the DNA test...

1052
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,809
...and then maybe I'II say hello
to these swamp rats.

1053
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,743
You people shut the hell up! I got
a wife in an oxygen tent trying to sleep.

1054
00:59:26,948 --> 00:59:30,111
You better shut up or I'II come
over there and rip a hole in that tent.

1055
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:31,478
Yeah, shut up, Frank!

1056
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:34,154
Go shave your balls,
you dusty old fart!

1057
00:59:34,356 --> 00:59:36,722
Okay, I guess they are my grandkids.

1058
00:59:38,927 --> 00:59:42,021
I know you, son. I know you well.

1059
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,393
You're just like me. Talladega's
coming up in a coupe of weeks...

1060
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,296
-...and I know you wanna win that thing.
-No, I don't.

1061
00:59:48,803 --> 00:59:50,566
Listen, Ricky.

1062
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:54,708
I'm 55 years old
and all I got to my name is a car...

1063
00:59:54,909 --> 00:59:58,743
...and a duffle bag full of underwear,
and sweet, stinky weed.

1064
00:59:58,947 --> 01:00:01,074
How much you selling that weed for,
old man?

1065
01:00:01,282 --> 01:00:03,580
I know I screwed up
raising you as a boy...

1066
01:00:03,785 --> 01:00:05,844
...but just let me help you as a man.

1067
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:10,589
-Do it, Dad. Get your balls back.
-Go fast again.

1068
01:00:11,926 --> 01:00:14,019
Fine. I'II do it.

1069
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:18,291
-But I ain't calling you Daddy.
-Well, what you gonna call me?

1070
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,230
AII right, Professor Dickweed.
What's the plan?

1071
01:00:21,436 --> 01:00:24,496
Well, basically, what happened to you
is that you saw the fear.

1072
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:27,899
So before you can even think
about any real driving...

1073
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:31,943
...you gotta make friends with that fear.
So get in the car.

1074
01:00:38,853 --> 01:00:41,549
What the hell?!
There's a goddamn cougar in the car!

1075
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:43,747
I know there's a cougar,
I put it in there.

1076
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:46,893
You gotta learn to drive
with the fear.

1077
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:50,792
Ain't nothing more damn frightening
than driving with a cougar in the car.

1078
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:53,092
-God, where'd you get that thing?
-I trapped it.

1079
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,202
Been keeping it in my bathroom
at the motel, feeding it old pizza.

1080
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:59,601
-Now get back in that car, you hear me?
-No, I'm not getting in that car.

1081
01:00:59,808 --> 01:01:04,575
Hey, listen to me. If you're calm,
that wondrous big cat will be calm too.

1082
01:01:04,779 --> 01:01:06,269
But if you're scared...

1083
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:09,917
...that beautiful death machine
will do what God made it to do...

1084
01:01:10,118 --> 01:01:12,985
...namely, eat you
with a smile on its face.

1085
01:01:13,188 --> 01:01:15,179
God, he's just following me
wherever I go.

1086
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:16,755
Well, he's just looking at you.

1087
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:19,586
You're saying if I just calm down,
the cougar will be okay?

1088
01:01:19,794 --> 01:01:22,957
-You got it.
-Damn it. Okay.

1089
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:25,189
Come on, son.
You can do it. Come on.

1090
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,867
Oh, come on.

1091
01:01:27,836 --> 01:01:29,133
That's it.

1092
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:33,801
-And no sudden moves.
-Like, is this too fast? Oh, man. See?

1093
01:01:34,008 --> 01:01:35,976
-That's a little quick.
-You see what he did?

1094
01:01:36,177 --> 01:01:38,577
You gotta be a little more deliberate
in your movement.

1095
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,442
I'm just gonna get in there.
I'm just gonna grab the handle.

1096
01:01:41,649 --> 01:01:44,209
I'm gonna get in and drive that car.
I'm gonna do it calm.

1097
01:01:44,419 --> 01:01:47,820
-Calm. Piece of cake.
-I was just trying to stay calm.

1098
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:52,490
-Oh, man!
-Sometime today, son.

1099
01:01:52,694 --> 01:01:54,958
Okay, here we go. I'm getting in.

1100
01:01:55,196 --> 01:01:56,857
Oh, God, help me!

1101
01:01:57,899 --> 01:02:00,390
-Ricky! Control your heart rate.
-Oh, my God!

1102
01:02:02,604 --> 01:02:03,901
Hey, Mama.

1103
01:02:05,974 --> 01:02:08,499
Well, hey there, Ricky. How'd it go?

1104
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:11,178
Well, I was mauled by a cougar...

1105
01:02:11,379 --> 01:02:14,542
...learned nothing about driving,
and my Crystal Gayle shirt was ruined.

1106
01:02:14,749 --> 01:02:16,512
But other than that, it went fine.

1107
01:02:16,718 --> 01:02:18,049
Where are the boys at?

1108
01:02:18,253 --> 01:02:21,552
I dropped them off at Sunday school
at my church about 1 0 minutes ago.

1109
01:02:21,756 --> 01:02:23,018
Anarchy!

1110
01:02:23,224 --> 01:02:26,352
-Anarchy! Anarchy!
-Anarchy!

1111
01:02:26,561 --> 01:02:29,928
-There they are.
-What in tarnation?

1112
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:33,294
-Anarchy!
-I don't even know what that means...

1113
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:35,662
...but I love it!

1114
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:39,666
-What in the hell?
-That is it!

1115
01:02:39,874 --> 01:02:42,604
That puts the lid right on the jar!

1116
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:44,710
-Mama! Mama!
-No, Ricky, no.

1117
01:02:44,913 --> 01:02:48,349
I will not have my grandbabies
acting like shiftless, wild hobos.

1118
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,451
AII right, now, you boys listen up,
and you listen good.

1119
01:02:51,653 --> 01:02:54,952
Now, I am declaring Granny law.

1120
01:02:55,156 --> 01:02:58,956
And if you do not obey Granny law...

1121
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,685
...I will paint your back porch red.

1122
01:03:01,896 --> 01:03:04,126
Sorry, Granny,
but you're shit out of luck.

1
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,787
We make the rules, not you.

2
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:09,954
Hey!

3
01:03:11,296 --> 01:03:13,890
You're gonna break us
like wild horses, ain't you?

4
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:17,296
It's the beginning of a new age.

5
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,134
Hey, Derek, it's Ricky.

6
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,773
Just wondering
if you can ditch school...

7
01:03:23,975 --> 01:03:26,773
...and take over my shift
at the pizza place...

8
01:03:26,978 --> 01:03:29,105
...because I got strep throat.

9
01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:31,839
And it's bad. I don't wanna
give it to everyone else.

10
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,280
So call me back.
You know the number.

11
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:36,654
Hello.

12
01:03:36,988 --> 01:03:39,923
Hey, man. How's it going?
You wanna come over and party?

13
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,592
Did you just say ''party''?

14
01:03:41,793 --> 01:03:44,353
You know what? No.
Because I still hate you, okay?

15
01:03:44,562 --> 01:03:47,554
-What are you so mad about?
-What do you think I'm mad about?

16
01:03:47,766 --> 01:03:50,200
Come on, man, that was last week.

17
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:52,869
What about the time you ran over
my leg with a car?

18
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:56,734
-I let that go that day.
-Yeah, I remember.

19
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:58,769
Wind is kicking up.

20
01:03:59,677 --> 01:04:01,304
Are you in the hot tub?

21
01:04:01,513 --> 01:04:04,448
Answer me this:
When you're in spa mode...

22
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,810
...how come the water level
drops in the spa?

23
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:11,580
Are you pressing the buttons
in the back panel or in the kitchen?

24
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,987
-I just started pressing stuff.
-Hey, don't press all those buttons.

25
01:04:16,027 --> 01:04:18,723
I'm getting bored. You wanna
come over and play G.I. Joes?

26
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,557
I would love to. No!

27
01:04:21,032 --> 01:04:23,728
Come on. You know what?
Screw you, man.

28
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:26,631
Ricky, man, you gotta
cross over the anger bridge.

29
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:28,772
Come back to the friendship shore.

30
01:04:28,973 --> 01:04:32,568
-''Cross over the anger bridge''?
-Yeah, that's where you're at.

31
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:34,540
You're stuck on an anger bridge.

32
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:37,476
Can you not see why
I'm stuck on the anger bridge?

33
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:41,079
Look, I don't know why I'm taking
to you, okay? What is it?

34
01:04:41,286 --> 01:04:44,744
They got bottomless nachos
at Bennigan's.

35
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,688
God, a whole mess of nachos
sounds good right now.

36
01:04:47,892 --> 01:04:50,326
I don't have a car no more.
Can you come get me?

37
01:04:50,528 --> 01:04:54,259
I'II get you. Which one of your cars do
you miss the most? I'II bring that one.

38
01:04:54,465 --> 01:04:56,456
-I miss the Hummer.
-I'm coming in the Hummer.

39
01:04:56,668 --> 01:04:58,260
-Are you ready?
-Yeah. No, wait.

40
01:04:58,469 --> 01:05:00,835
Okay. Our friendship is done.
AII right?

41
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,030
-You hear?
-You wanna hang out in your house.

42
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:05,368
-Come on.
-Screw you, dude. I'm hanging up.

43
01:05:05,577 --> 01:05:07,374
Okay, that's it. Bye.

44
01:05:07,979 --> 01:05:11,813
Oh, man, this is absolutely crazy.
I mean, this is borderline reckless.

45
01:05:12,016 --> 01:05:15,645
Don't you get it? You don't drive with
your eyes, you drive with your heart.
