Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

3
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,939
Tippytoe, come in. Are you there?

4
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,108
This is Tippytoe. Over.

5
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:12,444
Did you receive the souvenir package?
Over.

6
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:16,323
Package received. Over.
Is it snowing there now, Dad?

7
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,825
I wouldn't know, kiddo,
because I'm in Marrakech.

8
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:20,035
Whoa!

9
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,245
This is the big one, buddy.
A dream come true.

10
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,122
We have been compromised. Over.

11
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:26,374
Kiss her for me!

12
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,420
This is Mama Bird. Over and out.

13
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:32,923
You, get to sleep.

14
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,841
Guess where I am now, pal. Romania!

18
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:52,776
I can reach now.

19
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,820
Wow! How long have I been gone?

20
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,780
Two months and 17 days.

21
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,449
Well, don't worry, because Samoa
is what we've been looking for.

22
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,284
This one is going to be my legacy.

23

Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:31,398
Tippytoe to Bald Eagle. Over.

28
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,984
Come in. Are you there?

29
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:37,779
Hey, kiddo. I'm right on the verge
of something big here.

30
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,907
But I'm not going to make it home
for your birthday.

31
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,992
I'm really sorry,

32
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:44,870
but opportunities like this
are hard to find, Son.

33
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,204
(STATIC)

34
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:54,254
Opportunities like this
are hard to find, Franklin.

35
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:57,924
I'm about to bag a rare species
on this little expedition.

36
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:01,052
Fifteen F.A. R. That's a million absolute.

37
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,470
And a landmark building.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,764
Don't thank me,
just start building a statue.

39
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,850
-Morning, Pippi.
-Mr. Popper.

40
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,435
Contract.

(SNIFFING)

42
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,479
I love the smell of toner in the morning.

43
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:12,689
That's the pertinent printout.

44
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,525
And the person we are purchasing
the property from is present.

45
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,152
Let's do it.

46
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,613
Mr. Popper for Mr. Gremmins.

47
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:21,448
And you are?

48
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,909
Pippi Peponopolis.
I'm Mr. Popper's personal assistant.

49
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:26,620
I process his paperwork
and I procure his periodicals.

50
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,079
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

51
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,206
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

52
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,498
You can go in.

53
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,502
Mr. Popper, sorry to waste your time,

54
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:37,756
but I've changed my mind.
I'm not going to sell.

55
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,216
POPPER: I understand.

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,593
Second thoughts
are as valid as first thoughts.

57
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,844
They just come later.

58
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:46,556
It's just that this building is my last holding
and if I sell, then. . .

59
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,226
Then you're free, and that's a scary thing.

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,687
Hey, I get it.

61
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:53,939
Doing any sailing this year?

62
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:55,565
(SCOFFS)

63
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,858
Who has the time?

64
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:59,861
Yeah. My father sailed
around the world solo.

65
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:01,154
-Yeah.
-Lucky man.

66
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,865
Yeah, pulled a Hemingway.
Just him and the sea.

67
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,993
You know,
that's always been a dream of mine.

68
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:10,205
Oh ! (CHUCKLES) He had some stories.

69
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,457
Like that storm off the Horn of Africa.

70
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,501
-The Horn of Africa?
-Oh, yeah.

71
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:18,964
The sea was calm, the sailing smooth.
When, out of nowhere. . .

72
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,090
(EXCLAIMS)

73
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,593
Twenty-foot swells,
like a hammer punch to the prow.

74
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:27,514
Dad was a heck of a sailor,
but he'd never seen waves like this.

75
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:30,850
(BLOWING) Gale force winds
straight from the Devil's nostrils

76
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:33,270
whipped his ship like a rubber ducky.

77
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,313
The salt spray in his face
felt like a thousand needles.

78
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:38,608
And suddenly, the wind ripped
the mainsail off the mast.

79
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,986
He was doomed.

80
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,487
What did he do?

81
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,155
-What did he do?
-Yes.

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,573
He spun the wheel.

83
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:48,535
Hoisted the jib,
threaded the needle backwards.

84
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,996
And when he came out the other side. . .
Oh, my God !

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,872
Oh, my God !

86
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,835
-What?
-lt can't be. But it is.

87
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,253
What is it?

88
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,379
A blue whale.

(IMITATING WHALE CRY)

90
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:07,637
Like a gentle giant,

91

It's so beautiful.

92
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:10,765
Can you see it?

93
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,143
His skin glistening in the sun.

94
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,229
A rainbow

95
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,649
in the spray of his mighty blowhole.

96
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:22,902
Oh, well. You will get out there,

97
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,654
someday.

98
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:25,989

POPPER: Hey, it's what I do.

102
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,757
Gentlemen, what is the future
of Franklin, Reader & Yates?

103
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,176
A long, slow decline,
getting older and weaker

104
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,510
till it has that funny smell

105
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,138
and starts driving around all day
with the left-turn signal on?

106

Franklin?

107
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:53,016
Or will it be reborn

108
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,270
with vim, vigor and Viagratality?

109
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,064
I say we meet the future head-on.

110

Sexy!

111
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,694
Come on, guys. It's time to commit.

112
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,906
It's time to go above and Beyoncé,
and put a ring on it.

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,618
Beyoncé is a singer, Franklin.
She's a singer.

114
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,370
Named Beyoncé!

Can he hear me?

00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,581
FRANKLIN: We had a feeling
this was coming, Popper.

117
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,541
We saw the marble slab in your office.

Oops.

00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,922

than you to take a seat at this table.

-FRANKLIN: Don't sit just yet.
-Okay.

There is one more prize
we would like you to get for us.

What's the matter, Popper?

128
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:48,196
Nothing. It's just kind of a rundown place.

129
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,825
It's the only privately held real estate
in Central Park.

We can build anything we want on it.

You mean, like,
wipe it off the face of the Earth?

132
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,583
Start over?

-Yeah.

Greetings, Rick,
and welcome to our planet.

147
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:37,370
Lately, we've been using the word, "Hi"
or a simple, "Sup?"

00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:39,914
How are you?

149
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:42,125
I'm better now. Thank you.

No, really, Thomas, how are you?

Really, I'm good.

Okay, I will.

Hey, Popper!
I've been working on my power shot.

155
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:59,851
Let's see what you've got, tough guy.
Come on.

Did you say hi to Rick?

161
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,947
Yeah. Yeah, he hugged me three times.

162

00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,413
They say she turned you down flat.

650
00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:43,291
Fellas, calm down. Life's too short,

651
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:44,376
especially for Franklin.

652

We thought we could trust you with this.

is not a one-act play.

You know that she's
the chair of several charitable foundations.

655
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:54,469
One of those foundations
is having a benefit

656
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:55,804
at the Guggenheim Saturday.

657
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:57,305
And Mr. Popper will be present.

with integrity and character.

660
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:03,061
Somebody like Jimmy Stewart.

661

(IMITATING JIMMY STEWART)
And, doggone it,

662
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:08,400
that's exactly what I'm going to be.

663
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,026
I'll use my own voice, though.

664
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:12,487
Although, that was uncanny.
Come on, give it to me.

665
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,698
We expect some results, Popper.

666
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:18,785
And until we get them, you can keep
your name off my marble slab.

667
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:22,122
A man your age shouldn't be
talking about marble slabs.

I printed a pertinent page from Wikipedia.

I'm paraphrasing.

676
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:44,310
They're imprinting, all right.

00:58:04,103 --> 00:58:05,187
Love?

1128
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,314
Well, it sounds weird
when you make me say it.

1129
00:58:07,398 --> 00:58:10,609
These aren't children, Mr. Popper.
They're animals.

1130
00:58:10,693 --> 00:58:12,486
They need food. They need snow.

1131
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:15,489
And every once in a while,
one of them needs to be eaten by a whale.

1132
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:16,948
-(HONKS)
-Hey!

1133
00:58:17,033 --> 00:58:18,575
You want to know who they love?

1134
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:20,285
I'll tell you who they love.

1135
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,662
Whoever is holding the fish.

1136
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,840
Traitors.

1137
00:58:35,968 --> 00:58:37,010
Wake up, Popper.

1138
00:58:37,094 --> 00:58:40,347
These penguins can only survive
in the zoo or Antarctica.

1139
00:58:40,431 --> 00:58:43,558
So, sooner or later,
I will take these penguins.

1140
00:58:45,686 --> 00:58:46,770
POPPER: Omega-3s, Pip.

1141
00:58:47,104 --> 00:58:48,772
Penguins are way ahead of us on this.

1142
00:58:48,856 --> 00:58:49,981
Mr. Popper, I'm perplexed.

1143
00:58:50,066 --> 00:58:52,067
How does this pertain
to the Van Gundy problem?

1144
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:54,819
Van Gundy? Lots of that. Lots of that.

1145
00:58:54,904 --> 00:58:56,363
Please tell me you have a plan.

1146
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:58,573
I always have a plan, Pippi.

1147
00:59:00,243 --> 00:59:01,284
They're fresh.

1148
00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:04,746
Oh, really? Why do I smell bleach?

1149
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,414
Mr. Popper,
we're being pressed for progress.

1150
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:08,291
Perhaps I could pamper the penguins
for you.

1151
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:10,252
You need to procure your promotion.

1152
00:59:10,336 --> 00:59:13,880
No, Pippi.
What we need is squid, and plenty of them.

1153
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,925
The weather outside is frightful

1154
00:59:17,009 --> 00:59:18,802
The fire is so delightful

1155
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,888
Since there's no place to go

1156
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:25,475
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

1157
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:28,728
Oh ! Good morning, kids.
Babies on the way.

1158
00:59:28,813 --> 00:59:29,938
Got to get ready.

1159
00:59:31,107 --> 00:59:34,776
Young Gentoos need an ice shelf
at 28 degrees. A little powder on top.

1160
00:59:34,944 --> 00:59:37,112
That's right. I'm kind of a penguin expert.

1161
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:38,613
Oh !

1162
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,408
Hey, not in the house, young lady.

1163
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:45,203
Besides, when you pack this stuff down,
you could really hurt somebody.

1164
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:47,080
JANIE: Come on, let's get him, Billy!

You're begging for it.

1168
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,676
Here, hold on.
Look how much can go in this hat!

1169
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,303
Look how much can go in this hat!

1170
01:00:01,387 --> 01:00:02,387
Ah !

1171
01:00:03,014 --> 01:00:04,014
Uh-oh !

1172
01:00:04,098 --> 01:00:05,307
Grab a pen, Popper.

1173
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:08,518
I'm going to hook you up with the number
of a very good moving company.

1174
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:10,562
Ow!

1175
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:15,650
-Hey.
-POPPER: Wow.

1176
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:17,694
I think I hear your mama calling.

(GURGLING) Kent! Kent!

1178

You're only delaying the inevitable, Popper.

1179
01:00:24,035 --> 01:00:25,744
I'll be telling the board about this.

You don't want to miss this.

1182
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:34,878

1183
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:36,463
Shh !

It's another one.

01:01:50,204 --> 01:01:51,287
Or apart.

Captain's still waiting to be a dad, huh?

Mom. Yeah, that's right.
A woman can be a captain.

You're just not equipped for this.

Maybe you should let me
take care of them for a while.

What if the Statue of Liberty

1273
01:06:56,427 --> 01:06:58,177
No more loafing around.

01:06:58,262 --> 01:06:59,345
What's the matter, folks?

That's right, it's the Dawn of the Dead.
I'm eating brains and taking names.

Marshall, get Zoning on the phone,

1278
01:07:07,771 --> 01:07:09,439
I want to know
how soon we can break ground.

1279
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:12,483
Remind them of our donation
to the Mayor's re-election fund.

1280
01:07:12,568 --> 01:07:15,278
Boy, I never get tired
of looking at New York from here.

1281
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:16,571
I love what you've done with the place.

1282
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:18,614
Popper, what are you doing here?

1283
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:21,868
I'm on a mission of mercy, Franklin.
I decided to take you back.

1284
01:07:21,952 --> 01:07:23,911
You're taking us back? We fired you.

1285
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:26,122
All is forgiven then, don't worry about it.

1286
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:27,707
Let me bring you up to speed.

1287
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:29,876
I've been playing hardball with Van Gundy.

1288
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,045
I told her kids
we were offering $100 million.

1289
01:07:32,337 --> 01:07:36,299
I suggested they make her life difficult
until she accepts,

1290
01:07:36,592 --> 01:07:38,217
so they've all moved back home.

1291
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:40,470
Mrs. Van Gundy has planned
a press conference for tomorrow.

1292
01:07:40,554 --> 01:07:42,055
She wants us all present.

1293
01:07:42,556 --> 01:07:43,639
If you'll excuse us,

1294
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:45,808
we have to unpack.

1295
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:49,103
Popper's back!

1296
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,230
POPPER: Oh, hey, guys!

1297
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:52,565
-Hey, Dad.
-Hi.

1298
01:07:52,649 --> 01:07:54,108
Hey, how are you feeling?

1299
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:55,526
Yeah, Dad, are you okay?

1300
01:07:55,611 --> 01:07:57,070
Yeah, I'm fine.

1301
01:07:57,154 --> 01:07:59,322
Before you go in there,

1302
01:07:59,406 --> 01:08:02,825
I think I should tell you,
there has been a couple of changes.

1303
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:13,377
BILLY: Where are they?

1304
01:08:13,462 --> 01:08:16,089
They're okay, they're fine.
They're at the zoo.

1305
01:08:16,173 --> 01:08:18,091
And you know what?
It's really the best place for them.

1306
01:08:18,342 --> 01:08:19,717
They're probably in an icy pool right now.

1307
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:22,678
All the fish they can eat.
Full-time penguin masseuse.

1308
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:25,139
The whole thing's being narrated
by Morgan Freeman.

1309
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:27,225
You sent them away to some cage?

1310
01:08:27,935 --> 01:08:31,979
Billy, they're birds.
They don't feel things the way we do.

1311
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,731
-Thom, I don't think. . .
-Don't bother, Mom.

1312
01:08:33,816 --> 01:08:35,441
Come on, guys.

1313
01:08:35,526 --> 01:08:38,319
We had fun,
but it's time to get back to reality.

1314
01:08:38,403 --> 01:08:40,488
We got soccer.
We got the Snowball Dance.

1315
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:43,491
I'm not going
to the stupid Snowball Dance.

1316
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:46,369
Cooper Keegan asked somebody else.

1317
01:08:47,704 --> 01:08:49,914
Janie,

1318
01:08:49,998 --> 01:08:51,541
sometimes boys are gonna disappoint you.

1319
01:08:53,127 --> 01:08:55,044
I'm not disappointed in him.

1320
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:57,463
BILLY: Janie!

1321
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,927
What was I supposed to do?

1322
01:09:03,053 --> 01:09:04,554
How about feel something?

1323
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,721
Oh !

1324
01:09:06,056 --> 01:09:07,473
Please.

1325
01:09:07,558 --> 01:09:09,225
I feel great.

1326
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:12,645
I saw you with that egg. I saw you !

1327
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:14,105
That wasn't me.

1328
01:09:14,189 --> 01:09:16,566
That was a dream
where people live with penguins.

1329
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,526
And their kids love them.
And all the eggs hatch.

1330
01:09:18,902 --> 01:09:20,236
So wake up!

1331
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,864
Wow.

1332
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:27,910
I think I just did.

1333
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:33,916
And Rick wanted to extend the Ghana trip,
turn it into a vacation.

1334
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:36,502
Are you okay with that, Popper?

1335
01:09:38,797 --> 01:09:40,506

in all my travels

1343
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:44,070
I've never encountered
a creature quite so wise as this.

1344
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:46,989
You see, once it loves you,
it never leaves your side.

1345
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:52,036
I'm sorry, Son, that it took me so long
to Iearn that Iesson.

1346
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,914
But I hope there's still time for you.

1347
01:10:54,998 --> 01:10:57,541
Give your little ones a hug from Grandpa.

1348
01:10:57,626 --> 01:11:01,629
And hold them as close as you can
for as long as you can.

1349
01:11:01,797 --> 01:11:04,757
Bald Eagle, over and out.

1350
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:18,437
All right, everybody in. Let's go.

1351
01:11:18,522 --> 01:11:21,649
We don't want to go
to your stupid press conference.

1352
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:25,528
-We're not going to the press conference.
-Pardon?

1353
01:11:25,737 --> 01:11:28,698
-Driver, take us to the zoo.
-JANIE: What?

1354
01:11:28,782 --> 01:11:30,616
We're getting our penguins back.

1355

-Yes!
-Yes!

1356
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:40,668
Mr. Popper,

1357
01:11:40,752 --> 01:11:42,670
late as usual.

1358
01:11:44,298 --> 01:11:45,423
Call him.

But, Dad. . .

1362
01:11:50,304 --> 01:11:51,887
Sweetie, you've got to put
your heart out there.

1363
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:55,016
And it might get broken,
but that's how you know you have one.

1364
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,142
Call him.

1365
01:11:56,727 --> 01:11:59,562
Dad, I don't even really like him anymore.

1366
01:12:01,064 --> 01:12:02,356
I just got the name down.

1367
01:12:02,566 --> 01:12:03,899
But thanks.

1368
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:06,986
-Call her.
-Who?

Hey, Janie. What's up?

1376

Amanda, hi. Look,

I know this is a total Hail Mary,
but please don't go to Ghana.

Thom, are you kidding me right now?

then it becomes a relationship, and. . .

I'm not asking for you
to just jump right back in with me.

I just want one more date.

1382

Just stay
and go on one more date with me.

Please.

1384

lt means she's thinking.

Where are you going to take me
this time, Popper?

Another landmark
you're planning to tear down?

No.

1388
01:13:07,714 --> 01:13:10,758
The kids and I are going
to visit some old friends.

1389

Two children, one adult.

1390

-I'm going to call you back.

Mr. Popper, they're not your penguins.

1403

Don't give us the runaround, slick.
Why aren't they out there?

1404
01:14:02,519 --> 01:14:04,979
Because we already have penguins.

1405
01:14:05,063 --> 01:14:06,730
What we don't have is an emu.

1406

1407

-ls that just a bird?
-Yes.

01:15:32,025 --> 01:15:34,360
I'm sorry, have we met?

1442
01:15:34,444 --> 01:15:35,444
Come on.

1443
01:15:35,612 --> 01:15:37,446
-(BANGING ON DOOR)
-Let me out!

1444
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,617
-What took you so long?
-MAN: Sorry, sir.

1445
01:15:41,701 --> 01:15:44,245
Sir, what do the suspects look like?

1446
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:46,205
Hmm, uh, let me think.

1447
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:48,707
They're the ones with the eight penguins.

1448
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,334
Now seal all the exits!

1449
01:15:51,294 --> 01:15:52,294
AMANDA: You guys have the babies, right?

1450
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:53,546
JANIE: Yeah, Mom, we got them.

1451
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:56,549
Excuse us!
Avian infectious disease containment!

1452
01:15:56,633 --> 01:15:58,884
-AMANDA: Antarctic bird flu !
-Very bad !

1453
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:01,220
-Diarrhea! Vomiting !
-Vomiting ! Diarrhea!

1454
01:16:01,304 --> 01:16:02,513
You might want to hold your breath.

1455
01:16:02,597 --> 01:16:04,139
Thank you for your co-operation.

1456
01:16:04,641 --> 01:16:05,683
This way.

1457
01:16:08,019 --> 01:16:09,103
-Oh, no!
-Or that way.

1458
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:10,854
BILLY: Come on, guys.
Follow me. Follow me.

1459
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:12,856
Okay, try to act normal.

1460
01:16:38,216 --> 01:16:39,508
-(SQUAWKING)
-Go! Go!

1461
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:42,136
I'll get him on this side. This way!

1462
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:47,349
Get him ! Don't let him in the elevator.
He's heading to the roof.

1463
01:16:48,893 --> 01:16:51,895
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry, ma'am, you can't take this exit.

1464
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,606
No, not this way.

1465
01:17:00,905 --> 01:17:03,282
It's the north side exit,
you can't go this way.

1466
01:17:03,366 --> 01:17:05,451
Thank you. Sorry for the inconvenience.

1467
01:17:05,535 --> 01:17:06,702
(YELPS)

1468
01:17:08,038 --> 01:17:10,080
Hey, miss? Miss!

1469
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,624
All right.

1470
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,793
Nice and neat formation.

1471
01:17:14,878 --> 01:17:17,921
Okay, stay in formation.

1472
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:19,715
Remain calm.

1473
01:17:19,841 --> 01:17:22,134
-What happened?
-I was pricked by a porcupine.

1474
01:17:22,218 --> 01:17:24,136
-Where were you pricked?
-ln my posterior!

1475
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,304
I don't know where that is.

1476
01:17:25,388 --> 01:17:27,389
There's the limo. Just stay in formation.

1477
01:17:27,515 --> 01:17:28,891
JONES: I'm at the rear door, he's not there!

1478
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,310
-Hey!
-Break formation !

1479
01:17:31,561 --> 01:17:33,604
-JONES: Popper!
-POPPER: Break formation !

1480
01:17:34,981 --> 01:17:36,190
Halt!

1481
01:17:39,986 --> 01:17:42,696
Ha-ha! You lose, slave trader!

1482
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:45,574
I don't think so, Popper.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1483
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:47,326
No, I don't think I'm forgetting something.

1484
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:50,079
Thom, we forgot to do a head count.

1485
01:17:50,163 --> 01:17:51,705
Okay, one thing I forgot.

1486
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:52,998
GUARD ON RADlO: We got him on the roof!

1487
01:17:59,589 --> 01:18:00,756
Captain !

(HONKS)

1489
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,973
Captain ! No!

(YELLS)

1491
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:21,110
She's doing it.

1492
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:26,782
Captain is flying !

1493
01:18:31,955 --> 01:18:33,372
(EXCLAIMING)

1494
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:40,379
Whoa!

1495
01:18:40,463 --> 01:18:42,047
Can you believe that?

1496
01:18:42,382 --> 01:18:44,007
Hey! (LAUGHS)

1497
01:18:44,134 --> 01:18:46,552
Why are you hitting yourself? Huh?
Why are you hitting yourself?

1498
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:48,721
That's not attractive for a zoo official. Huh?

1499
01:18:48,805 --> 01:18:49,930
I'll tell you what.

1500
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:55,394
Now you're trapped like an animal.
It's ironic.

1501
01:18:56,354 --> 01:18:57,855
Hey! Don't. . .

1502
01:18:57,939 --> 01:18:59,022
Come back here!

1503
01:19:00,275 --> 01:19:01,358
Did you see that?

1504
01:19:01,443 --> 01:19:03,736
-Pretty good date so far.
-We're just getting started.

1505
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,362
Driver, Tavern on the Green.

1506
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:08,949
Hold on, boss. Hold on, I got it.

1507
01:19:11,202 --> 01:19:13,120
Hey, hey! Stop!

1508
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:20,586
MRS. VAN GUNDY: There have been
a lot of rumors floating around lately,

1509
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,254
and I'm here to clear them up.

1510
01:19:22,464 --> 01:19:26,049
I have always said
that I would only sell the Tavern

1511
01:19:26,134 --> 01:19:29,344
if I found the right person.

1512
01:19:29,429 --> 01:19:32,306
And that's why I'm here to announce...

1513
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:35,559
(SLOWLY) Wait!

1514
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,937
Don't

1515
01:19:39,272 --> 01:19:41,231
do

1516
01:19:41,316 --> 01:19:44,067
it!

1517
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:47,821
Did you like that? The slow motion effect.

1518
01:19:47,906 --> 01:19:49,656
I just wanted to get your attention.

1519
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:52,242
Mrs. Van Gundy, you can't sell this place.

1520
01:19:52,368 --> 01:19:54,787
-I know.
-If you sell it to me, I'll just tear it down.

1521
01:19:54,871 --> 01:19:56,580
And then Freddy and Tito and Klaus,

1522
01:19:56,664 --> 01:19:58,999
and the guy that looks like Chef Boyardee
will be out on the street.

1523
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,794
-I know.
-This place is a part of New York history.

1524
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:05,589
It's a part of my history.
I came here with my father.

1525
01:20:05,673 --> 01:20:09,092
The other day I had the best
second first date a man could ever have.

1526
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:13,138
And I would rather cut my hands off
and stick knives in my eyes than. . .

1527
01:20:13,223 --> 01:20:16,016
Wait, I'd have to do the eyes first
and then the hands,

1528
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,976
and I'd have to have somebody
help me cut the right hand off

1529
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:21,104
-because the left hand would be gone.
-Mr. Popper, stop talking.

1530
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:22,981
-Okay.
-I'm not selling.

1531
01:20:23,066 --> 01:20:24,149
You're not?

1532
01:20:24,234 --> 01:20:25,234
Mmm-mmm.

1533
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:28,111
Glad we got dressed up.

1534
01:20:28,196 --> 01:20:29,947
There he is.

1535
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:33,659
Excuse me, folks.
Nat Jones, New York Zoo.

1536
01:20:33,743 --> 01:20:35,953
This man has been trafficking
in stolen penguins.

1537
01:20:36,037 --> 01:20:39,289
(SCOFFING) What are you even talking
about from left field?

1538
01:20:39,374 --> 01:20:41,542
Penguins?

1539
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:43,168
It's absurd.

1540
01:20:45,421 --> 01:20:47,297
No, no, no! Penguins, please!

1541
01:20:48,842 --> 01:20:51,510
Hi, Pip.
I thought you were going to stay in the car.

1542
01:20:51,594 --> 01:20:52,886
They pecked the power locks.

1543
01:20:54,264 --> 01:20:56,056
He has been keeping
these defenseless creatures

1544
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,850
locked away in his apartment.

1545
01:20:57,934 --> 01:21:00,936
When I tried to save them,
he broke into the zoo and kidnapped them.

1546
01:21:01,271 --> 01:21:03,105
I've seen these penguins before.

1547
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:05,190
Is it true, Mr. Popper?

1548
01:21:05,275 --> 01:21:06,692
Yes, I'm afraid so.

1549
01:21:06,776 --> 01:21:07,943
Why did you do it?

1550
01:21:08,027 --> 01:21:10,779
Knowing you,
it must be for some sort of personal gain.

1551
01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:13,699
Yes, the kind no amount of money can buy.

1552
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:14,992
For Pete's sake.

1553
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:18,537
Mr. Popper and his equally crazy family
believe that these penguins love him.

1554
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:19,705
They are wrong.

1555
01:21:19,789 --> 01:21:23,166
If they have to choose between love
and a nice juicy sardine,

1556
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:25,043
they will choose the fish every time.

1557
01:21:25,128 --> 01:21:26,920
-I don't think so.
-Let's find out.

1558
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:29,381
He's got a fish.

1559
01:21:30,842 --> 01:21:32,217
I got this.

That's right.

1564
01:21:53,364 --> 01:21:54,656

01:21:54,991 --> 01:21:56,241

Have a heart?

I'm going to call the Mayor.

1599
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:27,082
that that little boy
hadn't gotten lost somewhere.

1600

Nice work, Popper.

1601
01:23:30,336 --> 01:23:32,295
Hey, Franklin.

1602
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:35,424
When do we break ground
on the new building?

1603
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,925
We're not.

1604
01:23:37,176 --> 01:23:38,176
Hmm?

1605
01:23:39,262 --> 01:23:41,096
What are you talking about?

1606
01:24:24,974 --> 01:24:27,476
-It's really beautiful, Thom.
-Thank you.

1607
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,144
You did a great job, Dad.

1608

I appreciate that, Billy.

But it wasn't just me.
I'm just the mastermind.

1610
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:39,154
So, I brought you here today
because I want to tell you something.

1611
01:24:39,238 --> 01:24:42,074
I'm going on a trip, very far away.

1612
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:45,118
And I could be gone for a very long time.

1613
01:24:46,204 --> 01:24:49,206
So, I'm going to need you
to come with me.

1614
01:24:49,999 --> 01:24:51,500
BOTH: Nice!

1615
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:55,170
Where are we going?
I hope it's someplace warm.

1616
01:24:58,549 --> 01:25:00,175
It's not, is it?

Hey, Dad. I don't think Captain likes it here.

It's okay, girl.

I think she's going to be just fine.

01:26:14,876 --> 01:26:16,251
What should we name him?

1634
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:19,546
Well, he's going to be an amazing flyer.

Flow like a harpoon, daily and nightly
