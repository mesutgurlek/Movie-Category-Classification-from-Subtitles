Relax, Greg. This cockpit's

lt's disrespectful.

514
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,764
Right, of course. Yeah.

515
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,102
Greg, a man reaches
a certain age

516
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,142
when he realizes
what's truly important.

Hmm-mmm.

That, too. Right. Yeah. Sure.

525
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,453
Now, my grandson, Little Jack,
is part of that legacy.

526
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,997
ln six months, you and Pam
are gonna be married.

527
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,053
Sometime after that,

528
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,100
you'll want to start
a family of your own.

529
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,795
Yeah. Right.
Actually, on the subject,

530
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,734
l had some thoughts
about the wedding date.

531
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,295
We'll discuss that later,
after this weekend, Greg.

532
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,636
Now, let's get back on point.

533
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,437
Let me put it very simply.

534
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,909
lf your family circle

535
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,208
does indeed join
my family circle,

536
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,942
they'll form a chain.

537
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,641
l can't have a chink
in my chain.

538
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,707
Hmm.

539
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,219
Yeah. Okay.
l get the metaphor.

540
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,950
Now,
l've never met your parents,

541
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,686
so l'm not going to jump
to any hasty conclusions.

542
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,853
But, like studying
a frozen caveman,

if l can see
where you came from,

544
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,188
l'll have a much better idea
of where you're going.

545
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,392
Okay.

546
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,834
A-are you thinking
maybe my parents might be

547
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,929

in the chain or...

what's there to worry about?

643
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,254
What are you talking about?
He's a baby.

644
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,988
l want to talk to him
like he's a baby.

645
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,757
Bazooka! Bazooka!

646

[wailing]

647
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,126
(Bernie)
He likes me.

648
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,803
When Roz's dad died, l said:

649
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,499
''Hey, we're freezing our
tushies off here in Detroit.''

650
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,098
You know, ''Let's head south

651
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,201
and get some year-round fun
in the sun.''

652
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,576
This house is
over a 100 years old, so--

653
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,046
Dad. Dad,
you continue the tour.

654
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,707
l'm gonna tell Mom
we're here, okay?

655
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,580
Oh! The upstairs bathroom
is on el fritzo.

656
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,779
So we're all gonna have to
share this one for now.

657
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,788
Since there's a water scarcity
on the island,

658
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,450
we kind of abide by the
''if it's yellow let it mellow,

659
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,755
if it's brown
flush it down'' policy.

660
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,087
Oops. Forgot my own rule.

661
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,226
[toilet flushing]

662
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,736
The RV has paid
for itself already.

663
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,095
§§[music playing]
All right, kids.

664
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,198
Forward and backward.

665
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,073
(Roz)
Rotate those hips.

666
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,740
Let's get your
kundalini rising.

667
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,646
And now it's time
for the ladies

668
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,708
to get into the reverse
cowgirl position.

669
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,845
Guys, you have to
lie across the Liberator pad

670
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:50,910
like so.

671
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,887
Everyone look at
how lra's doing it.

672
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,721
Bingo. Bango. Bungo.

673
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,728
The man is loose, he's limber
and he's ready for action.

674
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,093
So, climb aboard, girls,

675
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,064
and let me hear
your bodies talk.

676
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,190
Ooh!

677
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,791
Whoa! Yes!

678
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,234
This position is terrific

679
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,272
for anyone with osteoporosis,
gout or goiter.

680
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,570
Stay with me, kids.
We're almost done.

681
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,277
Ah! Honey!

682
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,869
Oh! All right, guys.

683
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,607
We have to wrap it up.
Everyone.

684
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,546
Remember to take
your Liberator pads.

685
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,381
And don't forget to stretch
before you try this at home.

686
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,054
We don't want anyone
shattering a pelvis.

687
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,214
Hello, my precious.

688
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,724
Oh, l love you so much.

689
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,283
l haven't seen
my bubeleh in months.

690
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,659
Honey, you feel thin.
No, no.

691
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,322
You're not eating.
What's the matter?

692
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,299
No. l'm fine. Mom, how do
we explain all these people
to the Byrneses?

693
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,928
Honey, they're leaving.
The Byrneses won't know
they were here.

694
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,303
Okay. We agreed to be discreet
about you being
a sex therapist this weekend

695
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,365
until you got to know
Jack and Dina better. Right?

696
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,535
Don't worry. l'll be discreet.
l put all my toys away.

697
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,602
And my office is all ready
for them to sleep in.

698
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,614
Your office? No, no.
we're putting them upstairs.

699
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,946
Your father thought they'd be
more comfortable down here.

700
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,009
The upstairs plumbing...
You don't wanna know.

701
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,986
Talk to me about
something important, honey.

702
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,317
How are things
with you and Pam?

703
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,414
They're great.

704
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,924
Because, you know,
after two years,

705
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,721
you have to work
to keep things going.

706
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,557
Does she still
climax regularly?

707
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,753
Mom.

708
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,764
You can't talk that way
this weekend, okay?

709
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,958
Honey, l'm just saying

710
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,661
l didn't raise you
to be a so-so lover.

711
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,600
l know.
Okay, what is he doing?

712
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,071
What?
Don't--don't worry about them.

713
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,366
Mom, Mom,

714
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,341
you got to get these people
out of here now.

715
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,399
Okay.

716
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,705
Wipe that
little gloss off you.

717
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,803
Okay.

718
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,948
You hunt deer, Bernard?

719
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,608
What? No, l hate that thing.

720
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,118
Roz's father gave it to us.

721
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,383
He was into all that
macho-wacho crap.

722
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,514
Oh! So is Greg.

723
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,116
He and l went
duck-hunting together.
Didn't we, Greg? Hmm?

724
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,524
Duck-hunting?
Me and you?

725
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,755
Duck-hunting?
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

726
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:38,853
What? What?

727
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,524
Gay, you went duck-hunting
with--with Jack?

728
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,591
Um, yeah. We went, we did.

729
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,260
We went
on a little hunting trip.

730
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,463
You shot a duck?

731
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,268
l shot at a duck and...
Mmm-hmm.

732
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,969
You killed an
innocent creature of the sky?

00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,635
l don't... Did l...
l did... l don't...

734
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,680
l think
l might've clipped it or...

735
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,612
Never really checked.

736
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,870
Oh, Lord.

737
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,506
And now,
for the piece de resistance.

Oh, my goodness.

l've been workin' on.

Oh, l see. Oh.

741
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,149
Mom will be out in a sec.
What's that?

00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,960
lt's the Wall of Gaylord.

00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,131
The Wall of Gaylord?

745

lsn't it nice to finally
display your accomplishments,
Son?

at all your awards.

That's great.

He's my champion.

749
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,461
Oh, l didn't know

750
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,201

ribbons.

751
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,835
Oh, Jack, they got them
all the way up to 10th place.

752

Hey! Anybody want to
get a drink by the lagoon?

753
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,580
This one looks impressive.

Very nice.

757
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,350
We've always tried

758
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,414
to instill a sense of self
in Gaylord

759
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,823
without being
too goal-oriented.

760
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,657
lt's not about
winning or losing,

761
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,718
it's about passion.

762
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,589
We just want him
to love what he's doin'.

763

You know what l mean, Jack?

764
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,534
Not really, Bernard.

765
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,070
l think
a competitive drive

766
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,799
is the essential key
that makes America

767

the only remaining superpower
in the world today.

Well, whatever works.
Mmm-hmm.

769
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,638
(Roz)
All right.
Don't forget the positions.

770
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,182
Bye, Dr. Roz.
You're a lifesaver.

771

Oh, Thank you, BJ.
Goodbye.

Bing, bang, bong.

775
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,051
What--What kind of work
does your mother
do with those patients?

776
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,959
Those look like yoga mats.
ls there yoga involved?

777
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,257
lt's yogaesque.

778
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,093
lt's sort of, um,

779
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,894
a, um, a--a--a
couples therapy.

780
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,264
Kind of mind-body...

Hello! Hello! Hello!

784
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,135
How are you, baby girl?

785
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,473
Good, Roz.

786
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,479
God! Look at you,
you're glowing!

787
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,741
Oh, thank you.

788
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,045
Hi, l'm Roz Focker

789
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,712
you must be Jack,
and you must be Dina.

790
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:16,947
Hi.

791
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,352
l--l just can't believe

792
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,084
it's taken us
this long to meet, huh.

793
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,416
And who's
this little hairball?

794
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,587
They brought their grandson
Baby Jack along.

795
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,927
He's so adorable.
l could eat him up.

796
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,058
Bern, did you show them
where they're sleeping?

797
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,797
Right, right, right.
Because we don't
have any air-conditioning,

798
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,204
l made up a nice spot for you
in Roz's office 'cause it
gets the best breeze,

799
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,105
and it's very near
the communal commode.

800
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,043
Oh, well, you know,
actually, we're gonna
stay in our motor home.

801
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,306
ln the trailer?

802
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,348
Come on, Jack.
You're family.

803
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,643
We sleep under the same roof.

804
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,685
Actually, Mom's office
is kind of cluttered.

805
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,117
So, that--that
works all right.

806
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,984
lt's just really easier
with Little Jack.

807
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,818
No, no. Really.
We insist.

808
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,415
They wanna sleep
in the trailer,

809
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,823
let them sleep
in the trailer.

810
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,794
Mom, it's not actually--
lt's not a trailer.

811
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,057
lt's kind of like--
lt's like a-- like a
hotel on wheels.

812
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,066
This is practically a hotel.
l was gonna do
the turndown service--

813
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,125
l know, l know,
but it's their choice.

814
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,467
Wherever you feel
most comfortable is fine.

815
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,336
(Bernie)
lt's not right.
Bern, let it go.

816
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,669
Let it go? Fine.

817
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,902
Yeah, let it go.

818
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,773
Look at you, sulking.

819
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,836
Now, look at this.
l married a teenager. Right?

820
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,280
At least you have the libido
of a teenager.

821
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,146
l gave her
a little matinee today--

822
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,152
Oh! Don't you dare!
Stop it!

823
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,518
[chuckling]
How about a double feature?

824
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,745
[laughing]

825
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,618
(Bernie)
Come on. Come on.

826
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,354
Lagoon? Why don't we go
show them the lagoon?

827
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,123
The lagoon.
Come see the lagoon.

828
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,824
The lagoon, Jack. Come on.

829
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,262
We'll get drunk,

830
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,994
we'll take a piss
in the lagoon.

831
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,537
(Bernie)
Roz, why don't you
take them outside?

832
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,094
Show them around.
l'll make a drink.

833
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,841
Oh, God.

834
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,941
(Greg)
Hey, Dad--

835
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,608
lt's going good
so far, right?

836
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,245
Dad, you gotta take down
that weird shrine thing.

837
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,754
But l'm very proud
of you, Gaylord.

838
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,119
What's wrong with showing it?

839
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,521
lt's ridiculous.

840
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,753
Most people aren't proud
of sixth place ribbons.

841
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:03,816
Most people?

842
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,624
Since when do you care
about most people?

843
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,791
l don't, but Jack
is really into winning

844
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,664
and competition and sports.

845
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,498
lt's a whole other thing
with him.

846
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,232
Hey. Hey. You're a winner
up here and in here.

847
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,069
And that's all that matters.

848
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,574
Okay. Thank you.

849
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,610
l don't know what that means,
but thank you.

850
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,134
(Jack)
So, to solve that problem,

851
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,205
l created a life-like
latex left breast

852
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,683
molded from his mother's
actual left breast,

853
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,346
so this way LJ would avoid
any nipple confusion.

854
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:34,482
You're avoiding confusion
by strapping a boob on a man?

855
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,924
Well, yes, believe it or not,

856
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,894
it is less confusing
because of the texture

857
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,020
Mom.

858
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,065
...of the breast itself.

859
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:45,034
Uh, l guess it's very,
uh, creative.

860
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,092
lt's very creative.

861
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,434
§§[Bernie humming]

862
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:52,875
A little birdie told me
that one of our guests here

863
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,844
is a Tom Collins man.

864
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,210
[all laughing]

865
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,475
Oh, for pity's sake.

866
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,175
lsn't that nice, Jack?

867
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,877
That is nice. Thank you.

868
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,410
(Bernie)
All right. Wait. Don't drink.
l want to make a toast.

869
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,323
Now,
l had a vasectomy in 19<i>7</i> 4...

870
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,452
'<i>7</i>3, honey.

871
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,688
You're right. '<i>7</i>3.

872
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,561
So, unfortunately,
l never had the chance
to procreate a daughter,

873
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,860
but had l been able to,

874
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,562
l really
would've wanted a girl

875
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,002
as sensitive
and as intelligent

876
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,639
and as beautiful

877
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,035
as this young lady
sitting right here before us.

878
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,637
Thank you, Bernie.

879
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,906
And if l might add...

880
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,004
Greg.

881
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,473
Yeah.

882
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,383
l thought you had a sister?

883
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,476
Nope. No sister.

884
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,621
You said you had a sister.

885
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,919
You said
you milked your sister's cat.

886
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,393
(Bernie)
Okay, l'm not done yet.
What l'm trying to say is,

887
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,263
it's taken far too long
to do this, you know,

888
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,528
but we're finally
all together.

889
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,572
(Roz)
That's nice, honey.

890
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,199
Oh, thank you.

891
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,909
All right, that's enough.

892
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,606
L'chaim, everyone.

893
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,874
(all)
L'chaim!

894
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,347
L'ha-ha.

895
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,317
Like you have popcorn
stuck in the throat. lt's a...

896
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,009
Okay. To family.

00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,012
To family.

899
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,148
Oh! l forgot.

900
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,318
l want to say one more
thing about my vasectomy.

901
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,622
(Roz)
Sit down.

902
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,027
Honey,
get yourself over here.

903
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,087
l went overboard?

904
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,154
(Roz)
A little bit.

905
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,031
You're so cute,
they'll forgive you anything.

906
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,203
(Bernie)
God! You're so beautiful.

907
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,671
[whispering]
You are the sexiest woman
alive l know.

908
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,608
Mmm. You're just trying to
get me back into bed.

909
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,837
(Bernie)
Or the hammock.

910

[clearing throat]

911
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,809
This is
a delicious Tom Collins.

912
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,213
What l did,
l used real lemon juice.

913
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,274
lt's from our trees here.
That's the secret.

914
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,183
He was squeezing
all afternoon.

915
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,414
Yeah. And, Jack,

916
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,252
l managed to make some
lemon juice, too.

Honey, you okay?
Are you sure?

[frogs croaking]

922
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,728
Well, l think

923
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,900
that Roz and Bernie seem like
very nice people.

924
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,773
Oh! Very nice people.

925
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,169
A little off-color,
but very nice.

926
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,044
Oh! But isn't it
wonderful, Jack?

927
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,514
After all this buildup,

928
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,210
the kids
are finally getting married.

929
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,912
l feel so happy.

930
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,921
Wait a second.
l think he just spoke.

931
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,480
Little Jack,
were you about to speak?

932
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,547
[farts]

933
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,952
Nope,
just a little flatulence.

934
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,519
What were you saying, honey?

935
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,894
Nothing, dear.

936
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,429
Guys, where are you going?

937
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,233
We're checking out
Jack's macho-wacho trailer.

938
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,898
Yeah.
l want to see that boob.

939
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,067
Can l talk to you
for a sec?
Yeah.

940
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,475
Hey, listen,
don't let Moses go in there.
They have a cat.

941
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,207
Moses is perfectly trained--

942
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,044
Dad, he humps
everything that moves.

943
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,413
Honey,
he's like his father.

944
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,746
l never cheated on you.

945
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,912
They're not listening to me.

946
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,984
So, what's up?

947
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,390
They seem to be
getting along really well,
don't you think?

948
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,191
Yeah, they do. l know.
l kind of feel bad
that l worried so much.

949
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,662
Yeah. That was okay.

950
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,028
What's going on?

951
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,762
l'm pregnant.

952
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,665
You're pregnant?
Mmm-hmm.

953
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,271
l'm two weeks late.
l'm nauseous,

954
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,171
my boobs hurt,
and l can smell everything.

955
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,870
You're gonna have a baby.
Yeah. A baby.

956
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,776
Oh, we're gonna

Hey! This is, uh,

Nice to meet you, too.

1123
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,668
Not yet married,
and already a little one?

1124
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,804
And he is
a handsome little Focker.

[laughs]

1126

See?

1127
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,370
Oh, no. He's not a Focker.

1128
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,808
Yeah, no.
He's not mine.

1129
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,368
And still you stayed
to raise her child?

1130
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,571
Good for you.

1131
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,013
No, he's Pam's nephew.

1132
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,584
He has no connection
to Greg whatsoever.

Mom.

1145

l think l'll take
him inside.

(Jack)
Good idea.

1147
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,379
You're a very
lucky woman, Pam.

1148
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,540
He's very special,
this one.

Oh, l could tell you
some stories about him.

1152

Really?

1153
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,991
Oh, she's just
being silly.

1154

Hey, you did good, Greg.

1162

She's very pretty,
this one, huh?

1163

Yeah, she's, uh,
she's really great.

Really great.

it's been 15 years?

[speaking in Spanish]

1167
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,620
So many wonderful memories
from those days.

1168
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,123
Yes. Yes, lot of wonderful,

1169
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,889
kind of private memories.

1170
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:16,228
So, you never told
your fiancee about us, huh?

1171
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,995
Um, no, l don't think l did.

1172
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,434
l don't, l think,
l don't think it ever
came up on my end.

1173
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,904
Not that l didn't
want her to know.
lt just, never really...

1174
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,271
Yeah, and not that, l--l mean,
not that it wasn't great.

1175
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,572
lt was really, you know,
for me it was like...

1176
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,078
And you were so

1177
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,738
helpful and--and--

1178
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,145
Don't you worry, baby.

1179
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,683
Your secret's safe with me.

1180
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:34,773
Okay.

1181
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,575
There's no secrets.
But, good, yeah,

1182
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,679
maybe if we keep it quiet
this weekend and then...

1183
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,849
Because, yeah, l don't want
Pam to feel uncomfortable.

1184
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,917
And then later, when it's
the proper, you know, setting,
l can...

1185
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,554
Okay, yeah, okay, good.
And, uh...

1186
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,886
Good.

1187
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,226
Oh, and fondue, fondue
is going-- is goin' over.

1188
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,600
Gay, you're just in time
to hear me tell the gang

1189
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,662
how you lost
your virginity to lsabel.

He was 19. A late bloomer.

1192

You s-slept with lsabel?

1193
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,439
We were relieved.

1194
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,974
Why--why would you,
why--why would you
bring that up?

1195
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,076
What's the problem?

1196
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,518
lt was, what, 15 years ago.

1197
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,021
Honey, your father thought

1198
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,420
that it'd be fun
to share stories

1199
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,752
about our first time.

1200
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,485
Really? That sounds like fun.
That's...

1201
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,256
That's fine.

1202
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,798
Come on, tell us how
you popped your cherry.
Come on.

1203
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,796
l really don't feel
comfortable

1204

discussing that
with you, Bernard.

1205
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,303
You know what? l suggest that
we get back to talking
about the wedding.

1206
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,839
Thank you, Bernie.

What?

1209
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,573
Mom, didn't you just take
Little Jack back to the room?

1210
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,476

Oh, baby monitors.
Hidden cameras.

1213
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,883
Whatever happened
to a little thing
called privacy?

1214
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,013
Bernie,
surveillance technology
has helped protect

1215
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,318
a lot of the freedoms

1216
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,325
that we as Americans
take advantage of today.

1217

He's right.
lt has been good.

1218

S-son, that is bullcrap
in a chef's salad.

Jack, tell me one smart thing
the CLlA has done

and l'll give you
the deed to her house.

The CLlA?

l think that baby might need
a couple of pulls

1226
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,249
on that knocker
of yours, Jack.

[both laughing]

No, it's okay.

1229
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,255
We're Ferberizing him.

1230
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,821
You're what?
The Ferber method.

1231
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,629
You let him cry it out.
This way he doesn't
depend on coddling.

1232
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,966
On the other hand,
the Continuum Concept

1233
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,801
shows that a baby benefits

1234
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,273
more from constant
physical contact.

1235

Oh.

We use the Ferber Method.

We used the Focker Method.

1238

We hugged and kissed
that little prince

1239

like there was no tomorrow.

Yes, it was.

Nine-and-a-half, at least.

No, no, no,

1253
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,240
These are the curls

1254
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,105
from his first trip
to the barbershop.

1255
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,906
Nobody wants to see this.

1256
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,843
Oh, and you kept
all of his baby teeth.

1257

Look at his
darling little teeth,

1258

isn't that sweet?

Uh-oh, somebody looks
very grumpy there.

Oh, that's Gay with the mohel.

1261

The mohel?
No.

1262
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,187

He's the man who snips
the baby's little winkydink.

1263
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,820
See, that's Greg getting
circumcised, right here.

1264
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,955
We had the ceremony
at my parents' house

1265
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,863
but there was a cold snap
and... Tell him.

Mom.

1268
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,636
No matter how hard he tried,
the mohel couldn't coax

1269
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,003
Greg's tiny little turtle
from its shell.

1270
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,542
You know what?
Let's not talk about
the tiny turtle, okay?

1271
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,770
Let's... Th-this is dinner.

00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,575
Honey, half the people
at this table have penises.

1273
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,376
Mom, control yourself.

1274
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,917
Roz, he's right.
You're embarrassing him.

1275
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,784
Okay, l'm sorry.

1276
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,982
Make a long story short, Jack,
he wound up with a semicirc.

1277
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,415
[giggling]

1278
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,755
What's a semicirc?

1279
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,089
l can't wait to hear this.

1280
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,131
What? lt's a cross between
an ant eater and--

1281
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,665
A German Army helmet.

1282
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,257
[all laughing]

1283
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,793
But, honey... Oh!

1284
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,101
You wanted to talk
about the wedding, right?

1285
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,906
Don't tell me you kept
his umbilical cord.

1286
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,278
Of course not,
that's Greg's foreskin.

1287
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,918
All right, you know what?
That's it. That's--that's
enough humiliation.

1288
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,283
Honey, stop.
We're having fun.

1289
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,343
No, l'm not having fun.

1290
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,285
Why deny us our memories?

1291
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,345
Because we're done!

1292
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,050
[all screaming]

1293
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,148
[sizzling]

1294
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,656
Anyone in the mood
for Chinese?

1295
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,358
You told me
your first time

1296
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,568
was with the Danish
transfer student
in high school.

1297
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,471
Yeah, well, you weren't
exactly forthcoming

1298
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,907
about your engagement
with Kevin.

1299
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,910
Yeah, well,
he wasn't my babysitter.

1300
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,707
Okay, l should have
told you, all right.

1301
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,338
Can we just let
it go, please?

1302
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,282
We both got
enough stuff to deal with
this weekend.

1303
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,415
Oh, hi, Jack.

1304
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,515
Hello, Greg.

1305
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,581
[sighs]

1306
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,854
Funny dinner, huh?

1307
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,057
How do you mean?

1308
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,894
l know that you are
studying my family
like the frozen caveman.

1309
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,025
So, l just, l don't want
you to be worried, okay?

1310
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,729
l mean, they're
a little quirky,

1311
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,431
but they-they're
well-intentioned

1312
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,497
and--and l think
they're just nervous and...

1313
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,941
Greg, l am sure tomorrow
will be a better day.

1314
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,375
(Bernie)
l'm sorry, ma'am.

1315
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,310
l thought you
ordered room service.

1316
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,677
Are you sure
you don't want

1317
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,682
any whipped cream
with your sundae?

1318
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,739
[Roz screaming]

1319
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:35,876
(Roz)
Bern, stop it!

1320
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,046
Who's Bern?
l'm Chad, the bellhop.

1321
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,884
Oh, no, come on,
we did that last week.

1322
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,822
Can't you be
Sam the carpet-cleaning man?

1323
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,622
lt's illogical.
Why would a carpet cleaner
have whipped cream?

1324
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,821
Well, improvise, honey.

1325
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:46,885
Good evening, miss.

1326
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,295
l'm here to clean
your carpet.

1327
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,196
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1328
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,997
Do you mind if l put some
foam down on your rug?

1329
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,401
l don't mind at all.

1330
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,495
Good night, Greg.

1331
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,596
Okay, sleep well, Jack.

1332
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,937
(Roz)
How long-- how long have you
worked in this hotel?

1333
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,838
lt's time to put some snow
on your mountains.

1334
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,641
Come on, l'm gonna get
some whipped cream

1335
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,703
on those Tetons.

1336
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,578
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1337
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,617
Guys!

1338
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,584
(Roz)
Come back in the morning,
tootsie roll.

1339
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,644
(Bernie)
Gay, you see
the cowboy hat on the door?

1340
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,087
Cowboy hat is off the door!

1341
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,555
No cowboy hat this weekend!

1342
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,853
l'm coming in!

1343
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,826
Just stop doing
what you're doing!

1344
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,853
Oh!

1345
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,158
Come on, man, you know

1346
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,563
what that cowboy hat
on the door means.

1347
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,124
Will you please
help me out here?

1348
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,067
What?
We're just being ourselves.

1349
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,331
Mom, mom, please...

1350
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,100
l think he's saying
not to be ourselves.

1351
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,231
Yes, be yourselves

1352
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,775
but be yourself in a way

1353
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,073
that's a little less than
being your full selves, okay.

1354
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,476
(Roz)
l don't understand this.

1355
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,343
l mean, why you're so
afraid of this Jack?

1356
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,576
You've been kissing his ass
ever since you got here.

1357
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,982
Mom, l'm not afraid
of him, okay.

1358
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,076
lt's not true.
lt is true.

1359
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,383
(Bernie)
l can't believe you went
duck-hunting with him.

1360
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,854
Our people
don't shoot ducks.

1361
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,449
Just make Jack feel a little
more comfortable here, okay?

1362
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,050
So you don't want us
to be ourselves?

1363
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,153
No, l just don't want you
to break his RV, Dad,

1364
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,289
and--and--and reveal
that l had sex with lsabel

1365
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,198
and play weird sex games
that everybody can hear
in the house.

1366
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,292
Mom... Mom, please.

1367
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,394
lf you ask me,
it wouldn't be so bad

1368
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,961
if your future in-laws
heard this.

1369
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,029
Do me a favor.

1370
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,735
Just don't therapize
the Byrneses
this weekend at all, okay?

1371
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,072
All l'm saying is,

1372
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,669
a few minutes
of concentrated work

1373
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,804
with him and Dina,

1374
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,712
she could get him
to blow like Krakatoa.

1375
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,842
Right, okay, yeah,
you know what?

1376
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,185
One day, just give me
one day, okay,

1377
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,551
without any complications.

1378
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,522
We get through it,
everybody goes off,

1379
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,319
we go on with our lives.
Can we do that?

1380
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,825
All right.
You got it, dude.

1381
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,088
Thank you, okay.

1382
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,687
Hon, put the hat
back on the door, okay?

1383
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,232
No mom.
No cowboy hat this weekend.

1384
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,234
(Bernie)
Okay, but tonight
doesn't count.

1385
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,597
[Bernie hooting]

1386
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,864
All aboard.

1387
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:35,994
[Bernie laughing]

1388
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,883
Morning, partner.

1389
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,309
Morning.

1390
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,582
Sleep okay?

1391
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,324
l slept all right,
thank you.

1392
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,462
lt's nice, all of us
being here together,

1393
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,865
don't you think?

1394
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,562
Bernard, do you mind
if l have some privacy?

1395
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,200
Almost done.

1396
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,110
Bernie,
this fritatta is wonderful.

1397
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,173
What's in it?

1398
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,447
Well, a lot of the taste comes
from this old skillet.

1399
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,613
l've never washed it.

1400
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,122
Hey, guys,

1401
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,349
can l have everybody's
attention, please?

1402
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,394
Gay, be back in a second.

1403
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,920
Okay, Dad. All right.

1404
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,658
Uh, so...

1405
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,327
Mom, l know we've been--
we've been talking about

1406
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,666
having the, uh,
wedding in October,

1407
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,728
but Pam and l
have been doing
a little thinkin'

1408
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,171
and playing around
with some ideas

1409
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,300
and, uh, we're thinking
of moving it up to June.

1410
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,400
Nice.

1411
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,466
This June?

1412
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,842
Yeah.
Yeah.

1413
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,108
That's--that's in a month.

1414
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,113
l always wanted
a spring wedding, you know.

1415
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,675
Well, that's great,
so we can announce it
at the party tonight.

1416
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,742
Good idea.

1417
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,845
Wait, what party?

1418
00:50:58,922 --> 00:50:59,911
Jack!

1419
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,584
Let's play football!

1420
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,057
Oh, your father
and l are throwing

1421
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,559
a little
engagement soiree

1422
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,220
for you two lovebirds.

1423
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,161
Look at that.

1424
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,927
(Pam)
That's so sweet.
Thank you, guys.

1425
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,299
l thought we were just having
a nice quiet dinner.

1426
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,167
lt was supposed
to be a surprise.

1427
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,536
The phone keeps ringing,
the list keeps growing.

1428
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,632
Yeah, now,
it's up to 50 Fockers.

1429
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,143
When were you going to tell us
about this?

1430
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,443
50 Fockers.
What could be better?

1431
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,242
Dad, what are you doing?
We never play football.

1432
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,252
l'm trying to cement
relationships here.

1433
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,185
Jack said
he was into footy ball.

1434
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,723
Let's show El Stiffo
how we play the game.

1435
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,780
Footy ball?

1436
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,292
Come on, come on,
let's play!

1437
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,588
l'm feeling a little tired.

1438
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,687
l think l'll sit it out
with Little Jack, okay?

1439
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,391
Honey, you want me to
keep you company?

1440
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,956
No, Dina, come on,

1441
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,865
you and l will take on
Jack and Roz.

1442
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,905
Come on, Jack, it'll be fun,
we'll swap wives.

1443
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,805
Don't worry, you'll get her
back after the game.

1444
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:52,864
[all laughing]

1445
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,171
Fine, we'll play
three on two.

1446
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,144
But someone needs to be
official quarterback.

1447
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,237
Gay goes both ways.

1448
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,576
l'll bet he does.

1449
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,238
[cooing]

1450
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,115
One, two. Hut.

1451
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,246
[all chattering]

1452
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,298
Come on.

1453
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,969
l'll run a down-and-in,
draw in the defense,

1454
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,638
then you'll hit Roz
here in the end zone for a TD.

1455
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,807
What do you mean?
He hits me where with a what?

1456
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,113
l'll throw you the ball,
you try to catch it, okay.

1457
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,119
You want me to catch?
Yeah.

1458
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,176
On two. Ready?

1459
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,347
Yes.

1460
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,356
Hut one, hut two, hike!

1461
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,580
[screams]

1462
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,084
Come on, this way!

1463
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,561
That way, that way,
that way.

1464
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,655
[Roz screams]

1465
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:51,723
[laughs]

1466
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,330
You remember
that time in the park?

1467
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,996
You remember that time
in the park?

1468
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,869
Guys, come on, come on,
cut it out.

1469
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,200
l'm so proud of you.

1470
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,468
l caught the ball.

1471
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,307
(Greg)
Mom, come on.

1472
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,539
l caught the ball!

1473
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,705
Come on, huddle up.

1474
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,942
No, l'm bored. Here!

1475
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,416
Dina, come on, let's go.

1476
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,543
You want a spritzer?

1477
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,382
What? Oh, a spritzer.

1478
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,443
That sounds yummy.

1479
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,513
All right, come on.
Dad, you got
to focus, all right?

1480
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,422
He's beating you
down the field every time.

1481
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,858
You want me to
be macho-wacho?

1482
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,795
No. What? Have l ever said
the words macho-wacho
to you in my life?

1483
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,161
l got it.
What?

1484
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,631
l won't disappoint you.

1485
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,934
Okay, let's try again,
l'm gonna run a stop and go.

1486
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,527
Fake the short pass,
then hit me here

1487
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,970
in the end zone
with a Hail Mary.

1488
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,029
Okay, got that.

1489
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,438
Yeah, we keep
running that play.

1490
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,874
You want to mix
it up a little?

1491
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,071
No, l don't. l've exposed
Bernie's weakness

1492
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,613
and l want to take advantage
of it.

1493
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,616
Exposed his weakness.
Okay, okay. On four?

1494
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:41,673
Four.

1495
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,924
Just you and me, Jack.
Mano a mano.

1496
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,993
You think you can take me,
Flowerman?

1497
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,435
l'm pretty sure l can,
Mr. Mom.

1498
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,204
You're going down,
Bernsie-boy.

1499
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,105
l'm going to
rearrange your bouquet.

1500
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:09,976
Sell the pump fake, Greg,

1501
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,980
'cause that
Focker's gonna bite.

1502
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,287
[inaudible]

1503
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,391
[inaudible]

1504
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:27,919
Hut one, hut two,
hut three, hut four. Hike!

1505
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:54,746
[grunting]

1506
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:57,554
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

1507
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,087
[screaming]

1508
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,151
Shit!

1509
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,719
[chanting]

1510
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,360
Hey, Jack, you okay?

1511
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,333
l'm fine, Greg, thank you.

1512
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,565
l see that kind of injury
all the time at the hospital.

1513
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,664
l wish you'd let me
give you a quick exam.

1514
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,800
No, l'm, l'm fine.

1515
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,812
l told you l'll have my doctor
look at it when l get home.

1516
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,670
Okay.

1517
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,740
You know, it's amazing
how your father anticipated
the pump fake like that.

1518
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,413
lt's almost like
he knew it was coming.

1519
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,211
Hmm.

1520
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:31,155
Well, he definitely takes
competition seriously.

1521
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,659
How a man handles himself
on the football field

1522
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,722
says a lot
about his character.

1523
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,365
Know what l mean?

1524
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,895
Okay.

1525
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,272
Hey.
Hey.

1526
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,436
We got him, didn't we,
dude, huh?

1527
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,103
Was he impressed?

1528
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,171
No, Dad, he wasn't.
That was a really hard shot.

1529
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,806
You could've hurt him.

1530
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,680
l just wanted it
to be a fun game

1531
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,083
but you wanted to win,

1532
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,984
so, you know,
you got me all steamed up.

1533
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,886
No, l asked you to play
a little defense,

1534
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,084
l didn't ask you to turn it
into a blood sport.

1535
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,389
l play too easy.
l play too hard.

1536
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,657
What are you really
asking me to do, Gaylord?

1537
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,494
l'm not asking
anything of you, Dad.

1538
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,557
Just--just go down there
and apologize to him, okay?

1539
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,329
He thinks it
was a cheap shot.

1540
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,303
Sure. Okay.
Whatever you say.

1541
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,627
Okay.

1542
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,872
l can't win with this kid.

1543
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,240
Honey--
(Bernie)
l can't.

1544
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,335
lt's okay.

1545
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,902
Hi, baby.
Hey.

1546
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,943
So, how far along is Pam?
Hmm?

1547
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,309
What?

1548
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,650
Come on, honey, l knew it
the minute l saw her.

1549
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,279
Her boobs are bigger.
She's hormonal.

1550
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,324
No wine at dinner,
no football.

1551
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,988
She just found out yesterday.

1552
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,688
[screams]

1553
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,455
Honey.

1554
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,566
My bubeleh's
going to have a baby!

1555
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,100
My bubeleh's
going to be a father!

1556
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,328
Oh, my God.

1557
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,371
Tell me, talk to me,
so this is so exciting.

1558
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,427
[shushing]

1559
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,534
No.
You didn't tell Dad, did you?

1560
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,041
No, not yet.
He's gonna plotz.

1561
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,406
No, no, Mom,
you can't tell him.

1562
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,377
Why not?
Because he
can't keep a secret.

1563
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:57,435
You know that.

1564
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,638
You think Jack knows?

1565
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,615
Are you kidding?
That guy's in such denial,

1566
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,674
he still thinks his daughter
is still a virgin.

1567
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,379
Yeah, l know,
he's very old-fashioned.

1568
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,581
That's why Pam
can't tell him
till after the wedding.

1569
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,647
That is ridiculous.
Mom, it isn't, believe me.

1570
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,215
You don't know him like l do.
Fine.

1571
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:11,783
My lips are sealed.

1572
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,920
l am so excited
and thrilled for you.

1573
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,589
[laughing]

1574
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,189
So happy for you two!

1575
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,568
Did you plan this?

1576
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,331
Uh, no,
it just sort of happened.

1577
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:22,530
How did it happen?

1578
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:23,798
How?

1579
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,203
lt just happened.
You know--you know
how it happens.

1580
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,073
l mean, l'm not going
into the details.

1581
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,702
Honey, l love details.

1582
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,940
Sorry.
[mumbling]
All right. Okay.

1583
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,773
Well, you know, honey,

1584
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,909
many unplanned
pregnancies happen

1585
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:39,318
because the man
is such a sexual dynamo

1586
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,784
and the woman
craves his sperm

1587
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:44,053
on an unconscious
but very powerful level.

1588
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,252
Hmm-mmm. Mom,
l am truly not comfortable

1589
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,887
having this
conversation with you.

1590
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,124
No?
No.

1591
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,632
l've been saying it
since l was 1 1 .

1592
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,826
All right.

1593
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,062
Love you.
Love you, too.

1594
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,467
Uh, Jack!

1596

1597

parental instincts.

1608
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,621
Dad,
Greg deals with little kids
in the ER all the time.

1609
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,259
lt's true. They don't call me
Barry Poppins for nothing.

00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,905
Why would someone call you
Barry Poppins?

1613

They wouldn't.

1614

Now, remember, Greg,
we're Ferberizing him.

1615

So unless it's an emergency,

1616
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,177
under no circumstances
should you pick him up

1617
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,973
or coddle him in any way
when he cries.

1620
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,751
that means no television,
no unapproved toys,

1621
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:16,876
and most of all,

1622
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,284
no monkey business
of any kind.

of the playpen,
he put on <i>Scarface,</i>

1899
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,824
and he glued his hands
to the rum bottle. Okay?

That's it.

Please, Daddy. He made
an honest mistake. Let it go.

No, why?

1931

a few skeletons in his closet
that he is not
telling you about.

And skeletons don't like
living in closets.

Here we go again.

that you'd behave yourself.

And what you said
to those people

1948
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:19,828
was really hurtful.

1949

clearly right now.

You knew she was pregnant?

We all did, Jack.

2518
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,760
Daddy, l was gonna tell you
after the wedding, l swear.

2519
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:13,270
This is the reason l created
the circle of trust

2520

so we could
discuss these things.
