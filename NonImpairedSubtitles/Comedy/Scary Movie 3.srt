I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,100
There are so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
because of TV and television,
we're losing

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

"Dude"!

I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,100
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,800
You know what else I heard?

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,000
Magnetic waves shrink
silicone molecules.

- I know something even scarier.
- What?

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,600
Have you heard about
this videotape?

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,800
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
And then in the bathtub?

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,000
He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

- And did you see the...
- No.

- Not that tape.
- Oh.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,800
The one with
all the scary images.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,400
And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,800
Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

Thank you, Ross.

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

100
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,800
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

103
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,600
But either way,
it's clear something strange

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
is happening in that small town.

- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

109
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,200
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposé.

110
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

111
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,400
Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

No, I'm telling you, I sense
something about that cornfield.

Call it women's intuition
or ESPN or both.

when danger's near.

who cut that stuff
into your corn?

Please.
I'm not a minister anymore.

that terrible night.

Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

Look, there's always
an explanation

153

for all this so-called
phenomena.

with them,

George, you have to help me.

Why? You can always sleep over
if you want.

1126
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,400
Linda's built for two,
and she vibrates.

1127
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
Stop it! Just tell me
what I need to know.

1128
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,700
Who is that little girl?

1129
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,600
Okay, okay.

1130
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,600
My wife and I wanted a child,
but she couldn't get pregnant.

1131
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,400
Neither could I.

1132
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,600
So you adopted.

1133
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,100
We loved our daughter,
but she was evil.

1134
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,400
Made the horses crazy,
killed our puppies,

1135
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
hid the remote.

1136
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,600
Really sick shit.

1137
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,500
My wife took her
to the old family farm

1138
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,400
and drowned her in the well.

1139
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,800
I felt a simple time-out
would have been sufficient.

1140
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,200
But Tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape.

1141
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,300
I never meant for it
to get out, but...

1142
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,800
But what?

1143
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,400
I put it in the wrong box
and returned it to Blockbuster,

1144
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,200
instead of my copy
of "Pootie Tang."

1145
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,100
It's been circulating
and killing ever since.

1146
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,000
Just like "Pootie Tang."

1147
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,800
But what does this
have to do with aliens?

1148
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
I don't know.

1149
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,500
Perhaps Tabitha's summoning them
to kill us all.

1150
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,000
An alien invasion?

1151
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,400
I have to warn the world.

1152
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,300
It's already begun.
You're too late.

1153
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,900
Oh, my God.

1154
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,200
But not too late
to make an old man happy.

1155
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,000
What?

1156
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,700
And now reports of lights
in the sky.

1157
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,800
Glimpses of spacecraft.

1158
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,000
Possible alien sightings being
reported all over the world.

1159
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Are they aliens?

1160
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,600
The first video images
are coming in.

1161
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,400
Disturbing home video tonight

1162
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,800
from a ranch
outside Sydney, Australia.

1163
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,100
Watch very carefully now.

1164
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,200
There it is.

1165
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,500
Let's see that again.

1166
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,700
Very, very disturbing.

1167
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,000
And this just in
from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

1168
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,000
Let's see that again.

1169
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,000
Very, very disturbing.

1170
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,700
And this just in
from South Texas.

1171
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,400
Do they pose a threat?

1172
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,000
Only one thing's for certain.

1173
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
We are all going to be killed.

1174
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,800
We have to board up the house.

1175
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,800
HARRIS: Are you sure
this is necessary, Wilson?

1176
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,000
Having an awards ceremony
at a time like this?

1177
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,200
Yes, sir. Everything must
appear business as usual.

1178
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,100
The nation, while not yet
panicked, is deeply disturbed.

1179
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,600
Right.
We can steer that course,

1180
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,600
keeping everybody
deeply disturbed.

1181
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,800
We don't want a panic.

1182
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,200
Very few presidents have faced
a crisis like this.

1183
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,100
I wonder what President Ford
would've done.

1184
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,000
Well, if the buck stops here...

1185
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,800
the buck stops here.

1186
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,900
Thank you all,
and welcome to the White House.

1187
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,400
The Mother Teresa Awards

1188
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
recognize those
who have overcome

1189
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,700
the severest handicaps
and disadvantages

1190
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,800
to help others
in their communities.

1191
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,000
The young, the old.
Black and white.

1192
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,600
Our Native American friends.
Hey, how are you?

1193
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,200
[Chanting] Hey, how are you?
Hey, how are you?

1194
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,400
Hey, how are you?

1195
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,800
Ah.
Well, it is therefore my honor

1196
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,600
to present each and every one of
you with this symbol of merit.

1197
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,400
The room is secure,
Mr. President.

1198
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,500
- Or is it?
- Sir?

1199
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,800
I've been thinking, Thompson.

1200
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,200
What if the aliens could
take over human bodies?

1201
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,700
They'd look just like us.

1202
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,000
Or almost.

1203
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,500
I never thought of that, sir.

1204
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,800
We should be on alert
for anything suspicious.

1205
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,100
They could be anywhere.

1206
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,300
Even...

1207
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,500
Right here.

1208
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,600
My God.

1209
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,400
We'd never see
the attack coming.

1210
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,800
- It's frightening, sir!
- Don't panic.

1211
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,200
We'll just move slowly
toward the exit.

1212
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,800
[Mechanized voice]
At last we meet, Mr. President.

1213
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,300
It's happening.
I knew it.

1214
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,600
You'll never take me alive!

1215
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,800
Aaaah!

1216
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,100
Ah!
She's scrambling my brain!

1217
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,400
I'll get her!

1218
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,400
Aaah!

1219
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, no, you don't!
Not on my watch!

1220
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,600
Good work, sir!

1221
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,500
Good God!
The small ones have metal teeth!

1222
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,900
Jerry's kids, my ass!

1223
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,400
WILSON:
Mr. President!

1224
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,400
Mr. President, have you gone
completely insane?

1225
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,800
Like a fox.

1226
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,000
We got to talk to the person
who saw this coming,

1227
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Cindy Campbell.

1228
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,800
She knows how
to defeat the aliens.

1229
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,900
- Filthy, rotten scum!
- Aah!

1230
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,600
Aah!
You're hideous!

1231
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,800
Get off my planet!

1232
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,600
- No!
- Is everything all right?

1233
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,800
The exits are all blocked.

1234
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,400
I'll find one, sir.

1235
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,600
Everybody, clear!

1236
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,400
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

1237
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,300
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

1238
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,000
Cody?

1239
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,100
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

1240
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,200
Honey?

1241
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,400
GIGGINS: After today's incident
in the East Room,

1242
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,000
the White House
is now advising all citizens

1243
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,700
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

1244
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,400
Oh, no.

1245
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,000
And now a News 8 exclusive.

1246
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,200
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

1247
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,800
We're the only station
that has it,

1248
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,400
and we're showing it all night.

1249
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

1250
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,800
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

1251
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,200
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

1252
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
- George.
- Cindy.

1253
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,900
There's no time.

1254
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,200
Cody.

1255
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

1256
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,800
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

1257
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,400
No, he didn't.

1258
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Okay, but I was gonna.

1259
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,200
No, he wasn't.

1260
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,700
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

1261
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,400
I wanted to be with George.

1262
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,200
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

1263
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,200
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

1264
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,600
Why would I be good at that?

1265
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,900
SUE:
Uncle George!

1266
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,200
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

1267
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,400
I'm going to die, aren't I?

1268
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,200
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

1269
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
about you
the day you were born?

1270
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,300
No.

1271
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,800
I was in the delivery room
with her.

1272
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,600
She was having a hard time.

1273
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,200
Then you began
to come out of her.

1274
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,200
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

1275
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,000
She yelled, "Just kill me.

1276
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,600
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

1277
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,400
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

1278
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,500
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

1279
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,200
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

1280
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, finally you came out.

1281
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,800
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

1282
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,800
Well, on the second try.

1283
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,400
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

1284
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,900
After all, she was drunk.

1285
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,200
Actually, drugged.

1286
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,400
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

1287
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,600
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

1288
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,400
So she did just a little.

1289
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,600
My penis?

1290
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,400
Yes.

1291
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,000
They sewed it on upside down.

1292
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,800
So that's why I pee up?

1293
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,200
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

1294
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,100
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

1295
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,800
Anyway, there you were.

1296
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,400
Your mom turned to me and said,

1297
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,500
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

1298
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,200
Then she died.

1299
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,600
And I took you.

1300
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,800
Do you know why?

1301
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,400
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

1302
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,300
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

1303
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,100
And I miss that cat, Cody.

1304
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,600
But I love you.

1305
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,700
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

1306
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,200
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

I don't hear anything.

SUE:
It was Uncle George.

Well, it's scary.

Good work, Sue.

I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

1318

made these lights go off.

1319
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,000
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

1320
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,500
I can get these lights back on.

There's something
on the other side of the door.

I can't see anything.

They're horrible.

They're grayish
with big black eyes.

through a wooden door?

She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

with those new round planes.

Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.
