1
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,634
(helicopter whirring)

2
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,734
(rock music playing)

3
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,067
Man's voice:
My whole life, it was obvious

4
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:02,900
l was gonna end up in this city.

5
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:10,635
l don't want to be arrogant here,
but l'm an incredibly attractive man.

6
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,468
l can't help it.
l don't try to be. l just am.

7
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:17,267
When l was a kid, my mother's
best friend used to tell me

8
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,634
that l was gonna be
a little heartbreaker.

9
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,634
Turns out she was right.

10
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,300
Her husband came home
from work one day

11
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,901
and found us fucking
on the Stairmaster.

12
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:30,101
Los Angeles, California.

13
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,934
That's where all the beautiful little
heartbreakers go to live and dream.

14
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,269
30,OOO of them arrive here
every single month.

15
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,834
30,OOO prom kings
and queens

16
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,734
and Little Miss Cute Tits,

17
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,601
every one of them
with stars in their eyes

18
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:44,433
and a dream in their heart.

19
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,935
When l first came out here,
l had a dream--

20
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,901
a dream of an easy life.

21
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,135
l was gonna get rich
from lyin' around

22
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:53,100
having my picture taken.

23
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:56,702
l was gonna live in the hills
and drive a noisy yellow sports car

24
00:01:56,733 --> 00:02:00,536
and fuck 6' girls
who weighed 89 Ibs.

25
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:03,669
- (distant siren wailing)
- Guess what? Most of it came true.

26
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,734
Hey, handsome!

27
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,034
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

28
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,233
- Excuse me.
- What's up?

29
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:28,133
- (chuckles)
- Good to see you.

30
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:31,268
- You're here a little early, man.
- Well, you know, a boy's gotta eat.

31
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,467
(dance music playing)

32
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:12,101
#  l don't wanna tell you # 

33
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:14,167
#  'Cause you're lookin'
that way # 

34
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,302
#  Turn around and wonder
how you keep up # 

35
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,600
#  With things that
l don't want to tell you # 

36
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,900
#  'Cause you're lookin'
that way # 

37
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,268
#  Turn around and wonder
how you keep up # 

38
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,100
#  With things that
l don't... # 

39
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:28,434
Man's voice:
Some men remember breast feeding.

40
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,634
l do not.

41
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,901
l do remember seeing
my mother in the shower once.

42
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,935
She had a giant
mound of pubic hair.

43
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,435
lt caused me an aversion
to all things untrimmed.

44
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:42,601
Ah. Meet Jen.
She has a bush like the outback.

45
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,234
Strong hands though.
l like that.

46
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:50,833
Let's see.

47
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,367
Ah, Shelly.

48
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,034
Ladies, if you want tits,
go to Canada.

49
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,535
They just do 'em better up there.
Don't ask me why.

50
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:03,735
l don't remember her name.
But l do remember the look on her face

51
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:06,468
when she found out l was
also sleeping with her sister.

52
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:11,035
But tonight l'm not looking
for the tight skin of a 20-year-old.

53
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:13,934
l am in need of assiduation
and that changes the game.

54
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,668
Ah, here we go.

55
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:19,201
The jacket's Dolce,
the jeans are by Helmut Lang

56
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,901
and the complexion comes
from a strict regimen of facials.

57
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,235
l'm guessing
she drives a Mercedes.

58
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,966
By the way,
there's only one pick-up line.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,634
Everything else is cheese.

60
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,934
Hi. What's your name?

61
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,301
- Samantha.
- Hi, Samantha.

62
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:36,866
l'm Nikki.

63
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,501
- l'm leaving.
- Really?

64
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:41,901
Why?

65
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,101
- It's late.
- You're right.

66
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:45,700
We should get going.

67
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,334
So wait a second.
You had dinner here?

68
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:49,401
What'd you have?

69
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:50,933
l had a salad.

70
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:54,002
- What kind of salad?
- A Greek salad.

71
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:56,267
You had a Greek salad
at a French restaurant?

72
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:58,634
l like that.
Oh. Valet, huh?

73
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,135
l bet you're a bad driver.
You want me to drive?

74
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:02,666
l'll flip you for it. Here.

75
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,967
Heads, l drive;
tails, you drive.

76
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:09,234
- There it is.
- It's tails. You flipped it.

77
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,467
You always flip it.
Don't be a sore loser.

78
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,734
Look, you're cute and everything,

79
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:17,602
but you're not coming home with me.
Thank you.

80
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:21,002
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

81
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:23,434
''You're cute and everything''?
What is that?

82
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,267
l was trying not to be rude.

83
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,000
- You're far from rude.
- Aww.

84
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:28,933
l'll help you out.

85
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:31,835
Tell me that you're married.

86
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:35,766
l am not married.
That would be a lie.

87
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,967
You're not.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,235
Tell me that you're madly in love
with someone.

89
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,600
- That would also be a lie.
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,767
Then tell me why l can't
come home with you.

91
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,700
(laughs)

92
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,267
l don't know you.

93
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,567
Nikki's voice: Roll the windows down,
turn the music up

94
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,600
and make an ass out of yourself.

95
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,133
lt puts them at ease.

96
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,300
(yelling)

97
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,401
lt's nice.

98
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:19,767
Peter Bogdanovich
used to live here.

99
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:22,067
Hmm. l bet he did.

100
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,700
What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,434
Nikki's voice:
Never show you're impressed.

102
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,201
lt lowers your market value.

103
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,701
Do you want a drink?

104
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,267
l don't drink.

105
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:52,566
Come here.

106
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,434
Wait.

107
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:05,135
No boots in the bed.

108
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,200
lt's my bed.

109
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,501
The boots go or l go.

110
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,901
(moaning)

111
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,600
Nikki's voice:
You want to give them a good fucking,

112
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:23,768
but not too good. Leave a little
room for the relationship to grow.

113
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:28,300
(panting)

114
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,033
- Oh, this fucking--
- (laughs)

115
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:35,434
Hey, Nikki.

116
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,634
Nikki, wake up.
l gotta go to work.

117
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,734
Now pay very close attention.

118
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:43,269
l call this the ''roll over
sleeping smile.''

119
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,334
(moans softly)

120
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,267
(footsteps leaving)

121
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,134
(door opens, closes)

122
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,701
- Right here is fine.
- There?

123
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,534
Yeah.

124
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,833
Nice spread, man.

125
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,701
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

126
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,301
Hey, do you keep
these cards on file?

127
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:48,267
Yeah, we can.

128
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,433
(sighs)

129
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,335
Nikki's voice: It doesn't matter
if you can cook or not.

130
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:27,036
Women grade on effort. It's almost
better when the meal's a flop.

131
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,133
lt shows that you're willing
to make a fool of yourself.

132
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,501
lt's all about creating equity.

133
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:34,233
Think of it as a point system.

134
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:37,701
One for flowers, two for dinner,
three for an orgasm.

135
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:41,069
You need 26 points
for them to trust you.

136
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,067
And then you can go back
to watching football.

137
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,734
- Hello?
- In here.

138
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,934
Oh ho ho, you're still here.

139
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:56,401
And you're cooking.

140
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,600
- l'm trying.
- Hmm.

141
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,001
Turn around.

142
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:02,600
Here you go.
(chuckles)

143
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:05,201
Sit down...
and take off your shoes.

144
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:07,133
l'm gonna go pour you
a glass of wine.

145
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:09,933
Nikki's voice:
Here's what she doesn't know--

146
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,667
l'm homeless, carless

147
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:13,600
and completely unreliable.

148
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:15,500
l do, however,
own a cell phone

149
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,334
that happens to be
right in front of her.

150
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:22,203
That's right, baby. 19 other offers
and l'm here with you

151
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:24,334
creating equity.

152
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:27,736
So what do you do?

153
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:29,501
What?

154
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,467
For work?

155
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,100
Do you have a job?

156
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:37,666
No.

157
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:41,367
What did you do today?

158
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,900
l was here today.

159
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,567
Yesterday--

160
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,434
what did you do yesterday?

161

182
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,400

183
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:51,066
(squealing)

184
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,467
: fire :

#  That's right. #

Nikki's voice:
Just rack up those points until...

198
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,834
(sighs)

199
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,234

00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:11,234
You want to stay here.

217
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:35,934
Hey!

talking to each other.

219

l do not like you two
talking to each other.

220
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,567
This is bad.

221
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,100
(laughs)

222
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,834
- Stop! Stop!
- (grunting)

223
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,401
- God.
- How do you like my new house?

224
00:14:48,432 --> 00:14:50,867
You think any girls are gonna
believe this is your house?

225
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,534
The young ones do.
Oh FYl, l'm a graphic designer

226
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:55,200
if anybody asks.

227
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,267
What? What happened?

228
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,867
- l blew it.
- With who?

229
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,568
- El Paso Erin.
- That DJ girl?

230
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,001
No, that's Hi-fi Tara.
No El Paso's a somatologist.

231
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:06,666
- She's--
- That's--

232
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,367
l fuckin' froze up.
l couldn't say anything.

233
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,300
l-- l started making
cricket noises.

234
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,133
You know what your problem is?
You care too much.

235
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:15,401
You gotta cut out
the conversation, right?

236
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:17,867
And just like say something
to piss 'em off.

237
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,600
- Why?
- 'Cause once you piss 'em off,

238
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,433
you set up the apology.

239
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,734
And once you apologize,
you look like a sensitive guy.

240
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,267
l am a sensitive guy.

241
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,900
All right, but you've
gotta look like a rebel

242
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,769
before you look
like a sensitive guy.

243
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,634
(laughing)

244
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,267
- Is that Helen?
- Helen: Oh!

245
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,167
- Who invited her?
- l don't know.

246
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,267
- l didn't fucking invite her.
- She's gonna tell people

247
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,734
- it's not my house.
- Hey, Nikki.

248
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:43,768
- Hi.
- Yeah, l heard you were having a party

249
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,234
so l thought l'd just
stop by and say hi,

250
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,066
see where you landed.

251
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:51,268
Yeah, not bad.
Not-- not bad at all.

252
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,835
- So, you want to go swimming?
- Oh whoa!

253
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:57,535
- Helen, uh, just--
- (laughing)

254
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,401
Nikki:
Okay, we gotta get her out of here.

255
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:00,966
- You gotta take her home.
- What?!

256
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,103
Just take her home. she's gonna
blow this whole thing for us.

257
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,833
- l was hoping to meet someone, man.
- Who you gonna meet tonight?

258
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,133
- l don't know.
- Who are you gonna meet?

259
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,666
Nikki.

260
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,300
Hey.

261
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:13,001
l'm drunk as shit.
Where's my tour?

262
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,534
Your tour's starting right now.

263
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,067
l-- l love you.

264
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,134
- Hey, Helen? Meet Harry.
- Helen: Huh?

265
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,068
Nikki's voice: A tour of the house
should always end in the bedroom.

266
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:29,168
l like fucking in the kitchen
as much as the next guy,

267
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,967
but you're three times
more likely to get laid

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,202
if there's a bed in the room.

269
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:35,434
- You're good at that.
- l used to be a cheerleader.

270
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,267
- Oh really?
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,033
(both laugh)

272
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,900
So you took your pants off a lot?

273
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,434
- What?
- What?

274
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:46,034
(laughing)

275
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:47,666
You date the offense
or the defense?

276
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,667
Give me some credit.
Offense.

277
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:51,233
Offense.

278
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,166
- Mm-hmm.
- Quarterbacks?

279
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,967
- Receivers.
- Mm.

280
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,535
Took a bunch of acid once
and thought my dick was a Dolphin.

281
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,234
l hate the Dolphins.

282
00:17:02,632 --> 00:17:04,200
- l'm a Niners fan.
- (groans)

283
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,100
l don't know how l feel about that.

284
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:11,901
Feels like you like it.

285
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:27,301
That lady's crazy.

286
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:30,435
- Crazy good, right?
- No. Just crazy.

287
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:33,868
She almost got us killed...

288
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:37,002
trying to grab me,
get my zipper down...

289
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:39,401
while l'm driving.

290
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,700
- That's a problem?
- She's trying to fuck me

291
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,367
while l'm driving.
l need to see the road.

292
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,134
lt's an important part
of driving.

293
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,799
(Nikki laughs)

294
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,535
Somebody's gotta make
the first move, man.

295
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:54,400
Yeah, well, she wanted to know
if you brought any girls

296
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,400
over to her house
when you were living there.

297
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,434
What'd you say?

298
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,699
What was l supposed to say?

299
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,902
All these things l can say,
things l can't say.

300
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:11,035
Sometimes l get confused.
What am l supposed to do?

301
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,567
Dude.

302
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,235
- What am l supposed to do?
- (laughs)

303
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:24,767
You're an asshole.

304
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,333
l hate you.

305
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,234
Did you show her
the little red Corvette?

306
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,533
But of course... not.

307
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:34,135
Dude, you didn't fuck her?
How could you not fuck her?

308
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:36,300
- Fuck you.
- She's got a magical pussy.

309
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,767
- Ain't nothing wrong with it.
- Oh because it's, what,

310
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,368
- been worked on like 30 times maybe?
- (laughing)

311
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:46,401
Hey, there's a spare bedroom here
if you want to stay.

312
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,534
- Yeah.
- Don't let me screw this one up, okay?

313
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:56,700
This is hot.

314
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,734
Yeah, this is prem nice.

315
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:02,136
Nikki: When you're rich,
it costs more money to stay rich.

316
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,033
Nikki's voice:
l always follow up a meaningless fuck

317
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:06,566
with a cham phone call.

318
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,068
Heeps me in the game.
Most guys drop the ball

319
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:11,067
after they ball.
l look ahead.

320
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,235
An easy call the day
after a lay can go a long way.

321
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:16,934
Hola, amiga!

322
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,234
Lo siento por el mess.

323
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,701
(patriotic ringtone playing)

324
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:33,067
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?

325
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,368
- Nikki: Uh, l'm at your house.
- Really?

326
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,335
So why didn't you answer the phone?
l called you twice last night.

327
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:44,002
You did?
How's New York?

328
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:46,968
Samantha: These guys don't need
a lawyer. They need a babysitter.

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,336
So, listen, we have some friends
coming over on Thursday night.

330
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:52,468
We do?

331
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,467
Samantha: We do.
Do you want to check your schedule?

332
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,267
Yeah, sure.

333
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,536
Hey, Gina, how's my
Thursday night look?

334
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,200
Oh, that's sweet.

335
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,167
So we're on.

336
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:07,301
- We're on.
- Okay.

337
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:11,101
- Bye.
- Okay.

338
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,800
Bye.

339
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:17,566
(football game on TV)

340
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,233
(football game on TV)

341
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,433
Announcer:
The home team has first and 10...

342
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:27,435
Oh my God. You didn't tell me you live
at the top of the fucking globe.

343
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:32,601
My car overheated,
so l walked up the hill.

344
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,133
This guy offers me a ride.

345
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,766
l say no, but he keeps
following me,

346
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,367
so l ran.

347
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,901
Oh my God.
Is that a ham?

348
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,968
l haven't eaten
since like Thursday.

349
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,168
Cornflakes.

350
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:47,634
l started this band--
me and this guy.

351
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,633
We tell everyone
we're brother and sister

352
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,200
and then we get
all sexy on stage.

353
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:56,634
Who are you hustling, Nikk?

354
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,036
- What?
- Mm. The house.

355
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:03,535
- Who's it belong to?
- Uh...

356
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,101
it used to belong
to Peter Bogdanovich.

357
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,468
Who? Come on, Nikk.
It's me, okay?

358
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:11,400
Remember me?

359
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:13,066
l was the first girl
to shave your balls.

360
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:14,800
You were the first guy
in my ass, l mean--

361
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,334
there were feelings.

362
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,167
lt's not what you think.

363
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,767
You can tell me.
l mean,

364
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,835
it's not like you're getting
any from me.

365
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,169
Nikki's voice: When a girl tells you
you're not getting any,

366
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,734
before you ask,

367
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:31,435
before you even try,

368
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,668
you're getting some.

369
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:35,333
Mm-hmm.

370
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,933
What do you tell these women?

371
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,268
Less is more.

372
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,867
Why do you care?

373
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:45,934
Um, so that when you call me

374
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:48,034
lonely and miserable
in 10 years,

375
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:51,134
l can tell you exactly
how you got there.

376
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:52,966
- Hmm.
- You're a good person, Nikki.

377
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,469
l mean, this can't feel good.

378
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,468
So what's her deal?
How old is she?

379
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,901
l have to be inside you
right now.

380
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:10,435
Every time we have sex,
you disappear.

381
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:12,434
- It's not like that--
- You say that every time.

382
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:16,236
l didn't call you for sex.
l called you because l miss you.

383
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:19,401
Yeah, but now that l'm here,

384
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:22,768
you don't miss me anymore
and now you want sex.

385
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,068
- And you don't?
- l want more than sex.

386
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:27,900
Me too.

387
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,567
What, Nikki?
More what?

388
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,269
l-- l don't know.
It's all very new, this feeling.

389
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,100
You are so full of shit.

390
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:42,634
You're right.

391
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,934
l am full of shit.

392
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:54,934
(TV chattering)

393
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:05,866
Does she have a bathtub?

394
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:12,333
You want to shave my papaya?

395
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:26,300
Be careful with me.

396
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,367
Promise.

397
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:34,300
l promise.

398
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:53,166
Nikki's voice:
Lots of times l can envision my future

399
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,167
with a woman before l come.

400
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,135
How long are you gonna
keep doing this?

401
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:05,534
And then after, l just want them
to stop touching me.

402
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:07,634
l don't know.

403
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:12,434
What if we just gave it a try?

404
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:19,301
l don't want
to do that to you again.

405
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,868
l'm a big girl.
l can handle it.

406
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,868
Maybe you just
don't care about me.

407
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,634
You cool?

408
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,401
Yep, l'm cool.

409
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,234
You know you're
my homegirl, right?

410
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:43,899
Yeah.

411
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:50,534
- See ya.
- Drive safe, okay?

412
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:52,167
Yep.

413
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:58,435
- (football game on TV)
- Oh!

414
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,100
Announcer:
The snap...

415
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:03,001
Brown kicks it off.
It's 40, at the 45,

416
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:04,733
he's at the 30, 35...

417
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,367
- Oh yes! Yes!
- (announcer shouting)

418
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,234
- No!
- Yes!

419
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:09,799
- (screams)
- (laughs)

420
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,168
- What the hell's wrong with them?
- They suck,

421
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,733
that's what's wrong with them.

422
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:15,767
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

423
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,333
(giggles)

424
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:34,101
(Nikki moaning)

425
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:40,434
Jesus Christ.

426
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:43,035
- Turn it off.
- (gasps)

427
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:46,201
- Uh...
- Uh...

428
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:47,933
- Get out.
- Her?

429
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:50,268
Her! Get out.

430
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,800
l, uh--

431
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,901
- Announcer: Brown has it.
- --we were watching the game

432
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,968
and, uh, one thing led to--

433
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:59,534
l'm-- l--

434
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:04,767
- l'm sorry.
- For what? Getting caught?

435
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,401
How was your little party?

436
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:13,834
- What party?
- The one my maid cleaned up for you.

437
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,534
Sit down.

438
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,467
Thanks.
See you later.

439
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:33,635
l trusted you.
l fucking trusted you.

440
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,468
Yeah? Really?
You trusted me?

441
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:38,200
'Cause it kind of feels like
you came home early

442
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:40,400
to catch me at something,
but catch me at what?

443
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,767
l don't really know, 'cause we never
really had the conversation.

444
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,367
Oh, the conversation?

445
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:46,067
You want to have
the fucking conversation?

446
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:49,235
Okay, how would you
characterize our relationship?

447
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:51,367
What? l'm--

448
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:54,068
You want me to characterize
and you can confirm or deny?

449
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:55,733
- Confirm or deny.
- Yeah, confirm or deny.

450
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:57,734
We are hopelessly
in love with each other.

451
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:02,469
Come on! Are we hopelessly
in love with each other?

452
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:04,734
- No.
- No, of course not.

453
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,334
- No.
- So how about this?

454
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,434
We have a relationship built
on honesty and integrity.

455
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:10,467
- Samantha, l'm not--
- What? Confirm or deny!

456
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:12,868
- Well, you want me-- deny!
- Deny is right.

457
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,867
How about this?

458
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:19,036
l support you
and you perform sexual favors.

459
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:21,000
ls that what this is about?

460
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:24,833
- We're friends.
- We're friends?

461
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:27,034
Friends who...

462
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:29,033
fuck.

463
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:31,700
Okay, how about we're
friends who fuck

464
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,701
and you don't
stay here anymore?

465
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,634
- Fine.
- Great.

466
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,202
l don't know how
that's gonna work.

467
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:47,734
l don't have a car,
so l can't--

468
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,601
it's not-- l can't come over.

469
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,701
And l don't have a place,
so it's not like you can come and...

470
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,035
fuck me,
so, l-- l guess if we're--

471
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:00,566
and as my friend,

472
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,167
l think you should be
a little bit concerned

473
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,134
that l don't have
a place to live.

474
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,734
You are a real piece of work.

475
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,901
(rock music playing)

476
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:25,434
#  Help # 

477
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:34,703
#  Standing at the door,
there's a man to meet # 

478
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,867
#  Shaking on my hand... #

480
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:50,638
#  And he just might be afraid,

481
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:56,637
#  l don't want to hear

482

488
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:20,500
These pancakes are sour.

489
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:24,401
They're buttermilk pancakes.
They're supposed to be sour.

490
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,100
Oh, maybe you're right.

Can l get you anything else?

502
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:58,734
How about a phone number?

503
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,701
Why? 'Cause we're
so compatible?

504
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,769
l don't know. l just thought we'd get
a cup of coffee or something.

505
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,734
When l leave here,
the last thing l want is coffee.

506
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:08,668
(chuckles)
Hey, maybe we could go on a hike?

507

No. No hikes.

508
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:14,000
We could just talk.

509
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:17,301

and don't take this personally--

510
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:19,500

a brilliant conversationalist--

511
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:21,433
Okay okay okay.

512
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:24,402
Why don't you just
give me your phone number?

513
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,700
Because l don't
want you to call me.

514
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:29,366
Whenever you're ready.

515

She's hot, huh?

516
00:30:42,332 --> 00:30:44,567

''l'll call you back.''

598
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,333
Doesn't that mean like 15 minutes
or something?

599
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,435
You say it all the time.
You don't call me back in 15 minutes.

600
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:45,901
- It's been like 12 hours.

And that sucks, doesn't it?

602
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:50,301
Right, look, you're-- you're mad
'cause you can't follow your own advice.

603

Okay, you can always call a girl.
You can't uncall her.

00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:02,401
Why does all my stuff

608
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:04,600
'Cause l don't want moths.

609
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:07,201
Well, what's worse,
moths or mothballs?

610
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:10,934
l don't know. If you don't like it,
you should take your shit.

611
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,534
Tell you man, between
your mothballs and your frogs.

612
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,200
What's wrong with the frogs?

613
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:18,933
(imitating Hermit)
l am Harry the frog here.

l have three frogs.
l have two tree frogs

615
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:22,800
and a bullfrog.

616
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:26,403
l don't have moths
because l have mothballs.

617
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:28,901
- All right. Get the fuck out, okay?
- Come on.

618
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,634
You come over here,
you start belittling me.

619
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,968
Just start thinking of a place
to store your shit

620
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,703
- and get the fuck out.
- It was a joke.

622
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,133

624
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,501

625
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,035
- Hello.
- Hey there. It's Heather.

626
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:26,066
- Hey.

627
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,601

00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,701
Will you ever forgive me?

634
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,600
Maybe someday
when l'm old and gray.

635
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:01,767
Let's get a table.

636
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:12,368
Take Camp David, for example.
There's no camping.

637
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:15,301
How much better would it be
if the four dignitaries

638
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:17,067
could just pitch a tent
and hang out?

639
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,034
- We'd have Israel, Palestine...
- (phone ringing)

640
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,801
...talking out their differences
over a campfire roasting marshmallows.

641
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:25,203
lt's just that there's a better way to
Iead a superpower into the 21st century.

642
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,267
Hey.

643
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,668
l'm with friends.

644
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,200
She's with the commander in chief.

645
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:33,567
(laughs)
What are you talking about?

646
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,734
You're a little monkey,
you know that?

647
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:40,834
All right.

648
00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:42,567
Okay.

649
00:39:45,265 --> 00:39:47,400
l'm sorry.
l have to go.

650
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:50,234
(chuckles)
What do you mean you have to go?

651
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,066
l gotta go. Rain check?

652
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:59,401
- (car door shuts)
- Hey.

653
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:01,000
- l'm sorry, l really am.
- What the fuck?

654
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,200
- What happened?
- l gotta go. Nothing.

655
00:40:04,232 --> 00:40:06,200
- (car starts)
- Where are you going?

656
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:09,234
- Will you call me?
- No.

657
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:11,600
- You sure?
- No, l don't think so.

658
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,734
Are you kidding me?

659
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:44,734
- Who are you fucking?
- Huh?

660
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:46,501
Who are you fucking?

661
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:49,134
(gasps)
Nobody.

662
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:54,868
Liar.

663
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,767
l need you to drive me
to the hospital.

664
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:01,401
- Nikki: What for?
- Just get dressed.

665
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,167
Why do you go to the hospital?

666
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,900
Not your business.

667
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:08,701
lt's none of my business.
All right.

668
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,202
Just drop me off.
Pick me up tomorrow.

669
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:13,467
(phone rings)

670
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:26,667
Oh hey, is Heather here?

671
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,901
No, Heather doesn't
work here anymore.

672
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,167
(phone rings)

673
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,534
''Are you alone?''

674
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,300
Yeah.

675
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,402
(loud splash)

676
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:06,968
l love your house.

677
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,068
What are you doing?

678
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,734
Am l interrupting anything?

679
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,834
Yeah. A peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

680
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,467
(chuckles)

681
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:18,033
What kind of jelly?

682
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:20,934
lt was jam actually.
Apricot.

683
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:24,100
l love that you know
the difference.

684
00:42:30,532 --> 00:42:33,434
Hey, what's your deal?

685
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:35,034
You're having
a good time with someone

686
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:36,766
and you just take off,
you split.

687
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:39,001
- What's that?
- Is that what you think?

688
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:41,901
What l think is that
you have a boyFriend.

689
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:43,934
- You're wrong.
- Oh right.

690
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:45,767
Then what was the big emergency?
Who's ''monkey''?

691
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:53,435
- My little brother.
- Oh. Right.

692
00:42:55,332 --> 00:42:57,300
You know, l just met you.

693
00:42:57,332 --> 00:42:59,100
You really need to know all this?

694
00:43:02,632 --> 00:43:04,600
He has MS.

695
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:07,167
He's 17 and... incontinent.

696
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,700
You know what that means?

697
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,600
Of course.

698
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,035
(Heather crying)

699
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:45,933
Hey.

700
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,667
l smoke sometimes.

701
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,567
Mm.

702
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,768
l'm allergic to cats.

703
00:44:05,799 --> 00:44:07,700
Okay.

704
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:15,368
l hate my last name.

705
00:44:18,132 --> 00:44:20,000
l really like you.

706
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:22,967
l don't want to rush this, okay?

707
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:28,900
Okay.

708
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,234
Will you just hold me?

709
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:38,701
Yeah.

710
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,500
l gotta move your car.

711
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:16,367
There's street cleaning.

712
00:45:22,265 --> 00:45:24,367
(alarm tweets)

713
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:40,235
Heather. Heather.

714
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:44,100
(moans softly)

715
00:45:45,132 --> 00:45:47,234
That's cute.
l made that move up.

716
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:48,899
Wake up.

717
00:45:48,933 --> 00:45:50,467
Go. Get the fuck out.

718
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:52,734
Go shake it off.
Go fuck monkey.

719
00:45:54,232 --> 00:45:56,200
What are you talking about?

720
00:45:57,232 --> 00:45:59,867
You're a little monkey,
you know that?

721
00:45:59,899 --> 00:46:01,600
You're a little monkey.

722
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:04,434
You're a fucking whore.
l asked you if you had a boyFriend

723
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:06,367
and you said no.

724
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:16,200
l'm waiting tables
and driving an $80,OOO car.

725
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,033
Did you actually
think it was mine?

726
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:19,800
Get out.

727
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,068
Hey. Hey.

728
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:41,102
- l missed you.
- You okay?

729
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:46,434
- Hi.
- Hl.

730
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:50,036
Let me just tell you a little bit
about vaginal rejuvenation.

731
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:53,835
What l did was, l took
fat cells from her thighs

732
00:46:53,866 --> 00:46:55,534
and l injected them

733
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:59,002
into the walls of her vagina
tightening it all up.

734
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:01,734
(slurps)
So that means no penetration

735
00:47:01,766 --> 00:47:03,400
for five days.

736
00:47:03,432 --> 00:47:05,600
But l think you'll find it
well worth the wait.

737
00:47:08,632 --> 00:47:10,433
- See you soon.
- Okay.

738
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:05,400
Hey.

739
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,401
You all right?

740
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:13,066
You didn't come home
all night.

741
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,601
You didn't call.
You didn't answer my calls.

742
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:18,735
You didn't leave me a note.

743
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,135
No, l'm not all right.

744
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:28,570
- l'm really sorry.
- You're not sorry.

745
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,233
You know what l meant.

746
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:32,100
No, l don't know
what you meant.

747
00:48:32,132 --> 00:48:35,568
l know what you fucking said.
Why don't you show some regret?

748
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,567
Why don't you show me
that you're sorry?

749
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,168
Fuck it.
This isn't working out.

750
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,434
Where'd you pick that up?
Junior high?

751
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,534
Oh you're gonna go?
You wanna go?

752
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:49,969
You're gonna go now? You better
take all the fucking shit l bought you.

753
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:53,034
- Come on.
- Gucci.

754
00:48:53,065 --> 00:48:55,367
- (clattering)
- $400 jeans--

755
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,900
- Stop it.
- And fucking--

756
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,534
Stop it.

757
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:01,135
- Prada--
- Stop it!

758
00:49:01,165 --> 00:49:02,966
l don't want it.

759
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,068
You don't want it?

760
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,401
Let me tell you something.

761
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:09,500
You are getting older.

762
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:11,166
You're losing your looks.

763
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,800
And your only charming
'cause you're cute.

764
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,435
You're not really charming.
You're not funny.

765
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:18,635
And you're not smart,
l hope you understand that.

766
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:21,402
You're nothing but six inches
and a prem face

767
00:49:21,432 --> 00:49:24,234
and you're gonna have to suffer
just like everybody else.

768
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,335
- It's seven.
- It's not seven.

769
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:46,467
(whispers)
It's okay.

770
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,768
You'll be okay.

771
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:54,768
You're gonna be okay.

772
00:49:56,532 --> 00:49:58,934
(sighs)

773
00:50:00,632 --> 00:50:03,034
You hungry?

774
00:50:03,065 --> 00:50:04,966
Want me to make you an omelet?

775
00:50:16,632 --> 00:50:18,400
(murmurs)

776
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,267
Where are you gonna go?

777
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,035
l don't know.

778
00:50:44,132 --> 00:50:47,368
How long do you think it'll be before
you come crawling back here?

779
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:50,034
l don't know.

780
00:50:50,065 --> 00:50:53,168
(patriotic ringtone playing)

781
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,634
S-- Samantha!

782
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:02,568
- Say goodbye to the little cunts.
- Fuck!

783
00:51:15,499 --> 00:51:17,334
(dogs barking)

784
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,302
lf you like me so much,
tell me what you like about me.

785
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:47,668
l like that you're smart...

786
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:49,734
and you're interesting...

787
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:51,534
and you don't take shit
from people...

788
00:51:53,566 --> 00:51:55,434
and l like who l am
when l'm with you.

789
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:57,434
(laughs)
See?

790
00:51:57,466 --> 00:51:59,768
lt's not even about me.
You don't give a shit about me.

791
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:02,535
- Well, that's not true.
- Yeah?

792
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:04,501
Then why don't you
ask me any questions?

793
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,334
Ask you any quest--
what do you mean?

794
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:09,601
- That's a question right there.
- No, l mean like

795
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:11,400
''Hey, Em, how's your band?''

796
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:14,067
''How's your sick mom, Emily?''

797
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,934
- Well, l'm not a question asker.
- (car door slams)

798
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,234
- You know what it's like?
- You're gonna say l'm not --

799
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:21,101
lt's just like l can't tell if you're--
l don't know if it's me,

800
00:52:21,132 --> 00:52:23,801
or if-- or if you're just afraid.

801
00:52:25,232 --> 00:52:26,800
Afraid? l'm afraid of what?

802
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,367
lntimacy.

803
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:30,267
- And you're not.
- No, l'm not.

804
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:32,934
Oh come-- all right, that's why
you're with someone right now?

805
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:34,734
(laughs)

806
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:39,536
Don't you ever think that maybe you
just haven't met the right person yet?

807
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:43,468
You know, l feel like
when l meet that person,

808
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:45,434
that l'll ask the right questions.

809
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:48,168
This is a waste of time.
You can't stay here.

810
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,967
You-- you tell me
that l'm afraid.

811
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,335
And then the minute l get real,
you're gonna kick me out.

812
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:54,434
- You want me to get real with you?
- Yeah.

813
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:57,402
Okay, l have always been
attracted to you, okay?

814
00:52:57,432 --> 00:52:59,901
But that is it.

815
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:03,002
'Cause l don't find you
remotely interesting.

816
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:07,001
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, l do. l think you're vacuous.

817
00:53:07,032 --> 00:53:09,834
And you fuck women for stu_?

818
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:14,100
You're a whore.

819
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:19,734

820
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,734

Hey, hi, how are you?
Hi, nice to meet you.

837
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,300
All right? Wow?

838
00:54:22,332 --> 00:54:24,233
- Will you rub your box for me?
- All right.

839
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:26,233

844
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:35,768
- That's not cool.
- Will you rub your box for me?

845
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,767
Just like rub your box for me
like you were in the shower.

846
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:39,800
- Nikki: Don't talk to her like that.
- Sean: No, they like that.

847
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,035
Did you wash your ass, actually?
Can l smell?

848
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:43,833
- What the fuck, man?
- That would be great.

849
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:46,034

00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:54,601
lt's a fucking strip club, man.

853
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:56,166
Come on, man.

854
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:58,801
That girl's straight off the bus
from like Hansas or whatever.

855
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,901
You don't talk to her like that.

856
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:02,434
She's a human being, man.

857
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,535
Are you kidding me?
You objecti_ women more than anyone.

858
00:55:05,566 --> 00:55:07,334
What if that girl
was your sister, man?

859
00:55:07,366 --> 00:55:09,768
Dude, l wouldn't let you within
10 miles of my sister, all right?

860
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:11,667
And you wouldn't even go after her
'cause she doesn't have the right car

861
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:14,001
or the right house, right?

862
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:17,601
Well, you should've told me that
before l fucked her.

863
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:21,768
Smelled like Teen Spirit, man.

864
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:23,901
Fuck you.

865

866
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:32,801
Here comes your boyFriend.

00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:52,602
- You're joking, right?
- It's not us tonight. It's a buyout.

871
00:56:00,766 --> 00:56:02,734

872
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:13,066
Come on, man.

873
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:15,134
You're always sorry.

874
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:17,333
l got nowhere to go, man.

875
00:56:17,366 --> 00:56:20,268
(sniffs)
l'm sure you're gonna figure it out.

876
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,735
#  Baby girl, hold on... # 

877
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:35,467
Unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.

878
00:56:35,499 --> 00:56:37,367
You guys have--

879
00:56:37,399 --> 00:56:40,235
- What'll you give me for the sweater?
- Nine bucks.

880
00:56:40,265 --> 00:56:42,634
Nine bucks?!
No, that's rob-- fine.

00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:47,068
#  You give it u-u-u-up #

886
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:01,002

Real good.

887
00:57:01,032 --> 00:57:03,167
Woman:
You've been out there for a long time.

888
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:05,768
Are you working?

889
00:57:05,799 --> 00:57:07,700
Yeah.

890
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:09,334
l'm up for a couple jobs.

891
00:57:09,366 --> 00:57:11,601
They're, um--

892
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:14,401
they're big campaigns actually,
so if l get one

893
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,300
it could be real good.

894
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:19,800
Hello?

895
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:25,034

Nikki's voice:
When l first came here,

909
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:14,869
l thought every day was
gonna be a Van Halen video--

910
00:58:14,899 --> 00:58:16,500
hot chicks wearing bikinis

911
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:18,367
riding around on roller skates

912
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:20,100
drinking cocktails by the pool.

913
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,434
Damn you, Van Halen.

914
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,067
(rock music playing)

915
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:46,735
#  All the fallen leaves will find
their branches again # 

916
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:50,136
#  Raindrops from the heavens,
l'll eventually swim # 

917
00:58:50,165 --> 00:58:53,468
#  A river, an ocean,
a wave in my heart # 

918
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:57,703
#  We got your money,
now we'll make a new start # 

919
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:07,336
#  All the fallen leaves

#  Heart... # 

927
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:52,768
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Swimming.

928
00:59:55,132 --> 00:59:56,733
Look,

929
00:59:56,766 --> 00:59:59,635
l'm sorry about what happened,
but this is not fucking cool.

930
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:02,168
What happened?

931
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:05,135
l called you an asshole.
l kicked you out.

932
01:00:05,165 --> 01:00:06,699
l called you a whore.

933
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:08,234
l'm sorry.

934
01:00:08,265 --> 01:00:10,066
(laughs)
That's strange.

935
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:13,202
'Cause it seems like you and l
are maybe playing the same cards.

936
01:00:13,232 --> 01:00:15,000
- Yeah.
- Last time l checked, you were living

937
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:17,901
in a $5 million house. Now you're
turning tricks for a sandwich.

938
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:21,069
- Nikki: l'm not turning anything.
- Tell me something, though--

939
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:23,234
out of everybody here, why her?

940
01:00:23,265 --> 01:00:26,635
l don't think you understand
my situation, okay?

941
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:30,336
l'm about to get evicted
from the Sahara Motor Inn.

942
01:00:30,366 --> 01:00:32,367
l'm selling my near-mint
sweaters for nine bucks.

943
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:35,235
And the club sandwich is gonna be
the first thing l've had to eat all day.

944
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:37,600
l don't really have time
to be picky.

945
01:00:40,399 --> 01:00:42,734
Going up to my suite.

946
01:00:42,766 --> 01:00:44,434
Are you coming?

947
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:50,068
He'd like to know if your AmEx
is silver or black?

948
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:56,770
l'll buy him a sandwich...
you ram bitch.

949
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:56,799
(laughing)

951
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:07,635
- This is us?
- Is that okay?

952
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,901
What? Are you scamming
a schoolteacher now?

953
01:01:11,132 --> 01:01:13,501
- Used car salesman.
- (chuckles)

954
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,900
l hate the furniture.
Don't look at it.

955
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:25,236
My roommate's a total pothead.
She never comes out of her room.

956
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,233
(laughs)

957
01:01:28,265 --> 01:01:31,368
- (woman coughing)
- So what happened to Mercedes?

958
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,834
l told her it wasn't working out.

959
01:01:38,065 --> 01:01:41,001
- What about the Porsche?
- Turned into an asshole.

960
01:01:41,032 --> 01:01:43,768
l got back at him though.

961
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:46,268
l sold his cigars on eBay.
(dialing)

962
01:01:52,899 --> 01:01:55,434
Dougie.

963
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,100
(giggles)
l don't know.

964
01:01:57,132 --> 01:01:59,033
Where you been looking?

965
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:03,735
Actually, l was on my way to do
some grocery shopping.

966
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:08,468
Bristol Farms on Doheny.

967
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:10,901
You said you wanted to see me.

968
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:13,068
Great.

969
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:14,934
When are you picking me up?

970
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,167
Perfect.

971
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,267
See you then, baby.
Ciao.

972
01:02:22,132 --> 01:02:23,933
What do you want for dinner?

973
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:39,333
Cheers to that.

974
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,134
(phone ringing)

975
01:02:46,766 --> 01:02:49,735
(groans)
This wine would be better after 2012.

976
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:52,834
Maybe we should wait.

977
01:02:52,866 --> 01:02:54,934
- (laughs)
- (answering machine beeps)

978
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:56,901
Heather's voice:
We're not in. Leave a message.

979
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:58,434
(beeps)

980
01:02:58,466 --> 01:03:00,768
Woman's voice: Hey, it's me.
You know Douglas Dukes,

981
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,435
that video game billionaire? l guess
he just broke up with what's-her-name.

982
01:03:04,466 --> 01:03:06,367
And he and his boys
are going to Les Trois tonight.

983
01:03:06,399 --> 01:03:08,567
l can't go,
but l put you on the list.

984
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:11,034
- Have fun.
- (beeps)

985
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,833
You gonna keep stepping
on my dress like that?

986
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:27,201
All night long l'm stepping
on your dress like that.

987
01:03:27,232 --> 01:03:29,100
Two shots of tequila, please.

988
01:03:30,399 --> 01:03:32,033
- Got him.
- Where?

989
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:34,367
12:OO.

990
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,301
Next to the girl in the yellow.

991
01:03:37,332 --> 01:03:39,033
Not bad.

992
01:03:40,232 --> 01:03:42,367
- Hmm.
- Can l have a gin and tonic?

993
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:44,567
- What are we drinking to?
- Trouble.

994
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:46,434
(laughs)

995
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:52,367
- Laugh.
- What?

996
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:54,734
l just said something funny.
Laugh.

997
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:56,901
(laughs)

998
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:02,768
Well done.

999
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,700
- l try.
- Any more moves?

1000
01:04:06,733 --> 01:04:09,869
- Can you dance?
- Can l dance?

1001
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,535
#  Why aren't you
coming anymore? # 

1002
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:39,202
#  Why aren't you
coming anymore? # 

1003
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:45,602
(vocalizing)

1004
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:01,334
(silent)

1005
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:10,102
Nikki's voice: They say you gotta kiss
a lot of frogs to find your prince.

1006
01:05:11,499 --> 01:05:14,235
But in this town,
everyone thinks they're royalty.

1007
01:05:14,265 --> 01:05:16,133
And the frogs
don't stand a chance.

1008
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,403
- l want 150/o.
- You're out of your mind.

1009
01:05:25,432 --> 01:05:27,600
Fine, 12.

1010
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,767
Four and that's my final offer.

1011
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:32,868
- What are you, my pimp?
- (keys jangle)

1012
01:05:32,899 --> 01:05:35,234
Look, l--

1013
01:05:41,265 --> 01:05:44,101
Oh man.
All l need's a blanket.

1014
01:05:44,132 --> 01:05:46,300
l don't need all those
sheets and everything.

1015
01:05:47,432 --> 01:05:49,367
l don't want you getting
your funk all over.

1016
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:52,235
(laughs)
My funk.

1017
01:05:52,265 --> 01:05:54,367
Yeah, you can't wash a couch.

1018
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:58,468
- Night.
- Hey, thank you.

1019
01:06:00,232 --> 01:06:01,766
l'd let you sleep in my bed,

1020
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:05,369
but, um, l wouldn't
want you to get confused.

1021
01:06:07,032 --> 01:06:08,867
Good night.

1022
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:43,933
(door closes)

1023
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:50,268
The, uh, couch is--

1024
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,434
the couch is a little short.

1025
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,701
So, l'm-- l'm just gonna--

1026
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:58,536
just gonna lie
down here like this.

1027
01:06:58,566 --> 01:07:00,534
- (laughs)
- l'm on the side, away from you.

1028
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:02,401
You won't even know l'm here.

1029
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:05,468
- Okay, l'll take the couch.
- No. No no no.

1030
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:07,400
No, wait. Wait.

1031
01:07:09,399 --> 01:07:11,734
- What?
- What are you afraid of?

1032
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,901
You really think l'm gonna
make a pass at you?

1033
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:18,369
- You're in my bed.
- And?

1034
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,635
You don't-- you don't think you can
keep your hands off me, huh?

1035
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:24,301
(laughs)
Please!

1036
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,401
We're adults. l think
we can control ourselves.

1037
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:31,800
Whatever.

1038
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,068
Sorry.

1039
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:53,267
For what?

1040
01:07:53,299 --> 01:07:55,734
What? l nudged you, didn't l?

1041
01:07:56,966 --> 01:07:58,567
l didn't feel anything.

1042
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:02,434
Well, l-- l-- l brushed up

1043
01:08:02,466 --> 01:08:04,634
against your foot like that.

1044
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,434
l felt that.

1045
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,601
Do you feel that?

1046
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,734
That tickles.

1047
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:32,901
Like good tickles or bad tickles?

1048
01:08:35,332 --> 01:08:36,933
Just tickles.

1049
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:42,401
l can tell you're smiling

1050
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,233
and l can't even see your face.

1051
01:08:45,532 --> 01:08:47,867
How many times
have you used that line?

1052
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,033
Oh, l don't know.

1053
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:55,235
But l'm not just saying it
to get your pants off.

1054
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:01,500
My pants are already off.

1055
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,267
Oh.

1056
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,900
(whispers)
What are we doing?

1057
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:18,768
(whispers)
Why do we have to be doing anything?

1058
01:09:20,966 --> 01:09:22,767
This is not a good idea.

1059
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:30,736
lf l don't kiss your right now,
my face is gonna fall off.

1060
01:09:36,099 --> 01:09:37,800
- All right.
- There.

1061
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:40,101
Oh, l need more than that.

1062
01:09:42,532 --> 01:09:44,867
For what?

1063
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:46,567
See if l like it.

1064
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,335
lf you like it?

1065
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:51,101
Yeah.

1066
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:02,334
Like it?

1067
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:05,769
- l didn't like that at all.
- (giggles)

1068
01:10:05,799 --> 01:10:08,468
- Really?
- Yeah.

1069
01:10:13,532 --> 01:10:15,367
(birds twittering)

1070
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:29,768
So none of that was true?

1071
01:10:29,799 --> 01:10:31,367
l don't have a brother.

1072
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:33,267
Well, l knew that.

1073
01:10:33,299 --> 01:10:34,900
But l'm from Canada.

1074
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:38,067
- l'm sorry about that.
- (laughs)

1075
01:10:39,799 --> 01:10:43,068
So when'd you decide to stop
playing Mata Hari with me?

1076
01:10:43,099 --> 01:10:45,968
What makes you
so sure l stopped?

1077
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,735
You're two drinks in

1078
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:50,301
and you're already bragging
about all your lies.

1079
01:10:50,332 --> 01:10:52,100
l could drink you
under the table.

1080
01:10:52,132 --> 01:10:53,933
- Oh come on.
- Oh my God--

1081
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:55,467
- Nikki, hi.
- Hey.

1082
01:10:55,499 --> 01:10:57,934
- How are you? Hi.
- Hey.

1083
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,034
Hey, remember me?

1084
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:01,866
Yeah, of course.

1085
01:11:02,899 --> 01:11:06,035
- What's my name?
- Your name.

1086
01:11:07,232 --> 01:11:09,467
My name.

1087
01:11:09,499 --> 01:11:11,868
l'm blanking out.
Um, l'm blanking.

1088
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:15,468
You don't remember.

1089
01:11:20,099 --> 01:11:21,934
(scoffs)
That was fucked up.

1090
01:11:22,966 --> 01:11:25,435
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

1091
01:11:25,466 --> 01:11:27,734
She's a jerk.

1092
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:29,701
Chew this into your food.

1093
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:37,067
- Mm?
- Yeah.

1094
01:11:39,032 --> 01:11:41,968
- Oh-- ah!
- Oh my God. Waiter!

1095
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,369
(grunts)

1096
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:46,434
- How can l assist?
- l don't want to cause a scene,

1097
01:11:46,466 --> 01:11:49,202
but there's garbage in the food.
We're leaving now.

1098
01:11:51,032 --> 01:11:52,800
- Wow.
- l'm sorry, sir.

1099
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,734
- Come on.
- Yeah, l'm coming, honey.

1100
01:11:56,666 --> 01:11:58,434
(ballad playing)

1101
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:23,267
How long do you think
it takes for it to set?

1102
01:12:23,299 --> 01:12:27,102
- l don't know, like 20 seconds?
- See the dolphin?

1103
01:12:27,132 --> 01:12:29,734
You see the dolphins?
There's freaking dolphins out there.

1104
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:31,300
- Oh!
- See it?

1105
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:33,067
- Yeah.
- There's freaking dolphins.

1106
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:37,701
#  When l'm lost # 

1107
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:39,935
#  You bring me back # 

1108
01:12:40,966 --> 01:12:43,601
#  When l don't know # 

1109
01:12:43,632 --> 01:12:45,166
#  Where to go # 

1110
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,601
#  And it feels # 

1111
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:50,700
#  Like l'm alone # 

1112
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:54,601
#  When l hang # 

1113
01:12:54,632 --> 01:12:56,133
- #  My head down low... # 
- Bye, baby.

1114
01:12:56,165 --> 01:12:57,666
Bye.

1115
01:12:57,699 --> 01:12:59,200
- #  l think of you... # 
- Where are you going?

1116
01:12:59,232 --> 01:13:01,367
Out. l'll be back in a bit.

1117
01:13:04,165 --> 01:13:06,467
#  Each night # 

1118
01:13:06,499 --> 01:13:09,535
#  You wait # 

1119
01:13:09,566 --> 01:13:13,436
#  Outside my door # 

1120
01:13:14,532 --> 01:13:17,368
#  'Cause you want to know # 

1121
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:20,135
- #  Oh, whoa... # 
- (car starts)

1122
01:13:20,165 --> 01:13:22,133
#  l think of you # 

1123
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:47,236
#  When l fall into a snare # 

1124
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:52,870
#  And it's all too much to bear # 

1125
01:13:54,299 --> 01:13:58,536
#  When l think nobody cares # 

1126
01:13:59,733 --> 01:13:59,733
#  l think of you. # 

1128
01:14:05,799 --> 01:14:07,367
Hey.

1129
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,634
Hey.

1130
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:16,468
You all right?

1131
01:14:16,499 --> 01:14:18,434
Hey.

1132
01:14:19,499 --> 01:14:21,200
What happened?

1133
01:14:21,232 --> 01:14:23,033
l just kinda broke up
with someone.

1134
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:27,834
(chuckles)

1135
01:14:27,866 --> 01:14:29,867
You gotta fucking
be kidding me.

1136
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:33,767
He's my fianc.

1137
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:37,933
Why didn't you tell me?

1138
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,601
l'm telling you now.

1139
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,801
When's the last time
you talked to him?

1140
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:51,133
Yesterday.

1141
01:14:52,165 --> 01:14:53,966
(sighs)

1142
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,935
When's the last time
you saw him?

1143
01:14:57,466 --> 01:14:59,000
- Don't do this.
- Don't do what?

1144
01:14:59,032 --> 01:15:00,967
What am l doing?

1145
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,968
Like it's a big surprise.

1146
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,568
He's rich.

1147
01:15:04,599 --> 01:15:07,368
- His family owns the Rangers.
- Which one,

1148
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:09,300
Texas or New York?

1149
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:10,866
New York.

1150
01:15:10,899 --> 01:15:12,867
Well, fuck, what'd you
break up with him for?

1151
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:15,034
He sounds like a fucking catch.

1152
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:17,000
- You know why.
- No, l don't.

1153
01:15:17,032 --> 01:15:18,666
Honestly, l don't
know what to think.

1154
01:15:18,699 --> 01:15:20,434
Because l love you.

1155
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:25,767
Happy? l said it.

1156
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:30,235
- Do you love him?
- No.

1157
01:15:33,165 --> 01:15:34,933
Well...

1158
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,901
l don't think l was
faking it all the time.

1159
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,901
Are you faking it with me?

1160
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,701
Why would l fake it?

1161
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,901
You don't have a dime
or a job or a fucking plan.

1162
01:15:53,933 --> 01:15:56,101
What would l fake for?

1163
01:16:05,766 --> 01:16:07,400
- Where are you going?
- l don't know.

1164
01:16:07,432 --> 01:16:09,233
l don't have a fucking plan.

1165
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:21,867
(rock music playing)

1166
01:16:51,599 --> 01:16:54,935
#  Punk's dead # 

1167

#  The world's grey # 

1168
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:03,169
#  The sun rules # 

1169
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,502
#  It sucks life out # 

1170
01:17:06,532 --> 01:17:09,868
#  Of each day # 

1171

#  l hate love... # 

1172
01:17:13,766 --> 01:17:15,267
Heather?

1173
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:18,635
#  It's soap stars # 

1174
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,768
- #  And fake pink... # 
- Heather's voice: ''Nikki, l'm going

1175
01:17:20,799 --> 01:17:22,433
to New York to try
to sort this out.

1176
01:17:22,466 --> 01:17:25,101
Don't burn down the house.
Big hug. Heather.''

1177
01:17:26,499 --> 01:17:28,300
Just come back.
You-- don't leave.

1178
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:30,167
l know you're not gone yet.
You can't be gone yet.

1179
01:17:30,199 --> 01:17:31,934
You couldn't have
gotten a flight that fast.

1180
01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:35,069
Just-- fuck. Just call me back
and come back.

1181
01:17:35,099 --> 01:17:38,969
#  Plastic matrix # 

1182
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,371
#  Of cartoon # 

1183
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:46,101
#  People # 

1184
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:50,802
#  Who talk loud # 

1185
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,603
#  And don't say anything # 

1186
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:57,368
#  But let her go. # 

1187
01:18:02,165 --> 01:18:04,834
Okay, this is hard to believe
it's not real meat.

1188
01:18:06,733 --> 01:18:09,869
- Do-- do you mind if l--
- Oh, please.

1189
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:11,934
(laughs)
Look who it is.

1190
01:18:11,966 --> 01:18:14,234
- Mr. Monday night!
- Hey.

1191
01:18:14,265 --> 01:18:16,800
Hey. What are you doing?

1192
01:18:18,032 --> 01:18:21,135
You want to watch the game?
(giggles)

1193
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:25,401
- All that beer for you?
- No.

1194
01:18:25,432 --> 01:18:27,433
Uh... this one's for me

1195
01:18:27,466 --> 01:18:29,701
- and then l got another one.
- (keys jangle)

1196
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:31,468
- Oh, here we go.
- Oopsie.

1197
01:18:33,566 --> 01:18:35,467
Do you, um--

1198
01:18:37,499 --> 01:18:39,601
what do you say
l drive you home?

1199
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

1200
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:46,301
Don't get sick in the car.
Here, l'll pull over.

1201
01:18:46,332 --> 01:18:48,834
l'm pulling over.
Just-- all right.

1202
01:18:48,866 --> 01:18:52,069
Open your door.
Open your door, don't--

1203
01:18:52,099 --> 01:18:53,900
(whimpers)

1204
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:55,501
Are you all right?

1205
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:59,101
- Do you want me to--
- (retching)

1206
01:19:03,499 --> 01:19:06,501
(phone ringing)

1207
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,634
Heather:
Are you mad?

1208
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:15,136
No, l was worried.
l called you like 17,OOO times.

1209
01:19:15,165 --> 01:19:17,100
lt's been hard to get away.

1210
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:20,333
Nikki:
Are you with him now?

1211
01:19:20,366 --> 01:19:22,201
No, l'm not with him.

1212
01:19:22,232 --> 01:19:25,401
Baby, l'm sorry.
l'm-- l-- look, l'm sorry

1213
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:27,834
l was such a dick.
l just-- come home.

1214
01:19:29,299 --> 01:19:31,567
Do you know what it's like
sleeping in your bed without you?

1215
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:33,334
No. What's it like?

1216
01:19:33,366 --> 01:19:35,267
Nikki: It's miserable.
l can-- l can smell you,

1217
01:19:35,299 --> 01:19:36,933
but l can't touch you.

1218
01:19:36,966 --> 01:19:40,102
- When are you coming home?
- Nikki--

1219
01:19:40,132 --> 01:19:42,467
Nikki:
Why can't you just leave now?

1220
01:19:42,499 --> 01:19:44,834
- It's complicated.
- Baby, l don't--

1221
01:19:44,866 --> 01:19:46,934
l-- l'm here. You're there
with this guy and l--

1222
01:19:46,966 --> 01:19:49,635
Heather: Who do you think's
been paying the bills?

1223
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:51,567
Who do you think bought the bed
we're sleeping in?

1224
01:19:52,966 --> 01:19:55,335
- Baby, look, that's over. It's done.
- Hey!

1225
01:19:55,366 --> 01:19:58,635
We're not gonna do that anymore.
l'm gonna-- we'll get a place.

1226
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,934
l'll-- l'll...

1227
01:20:00,966 --> 01:20:03,902
deliver pizzas or rob banks--
l'll become a cop or something.

1228
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,668
Hey!

1229
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:09,102
- Heather: l love you.
- l love you, baby.

1230
01:20:09,132 --> 01:20:11,434
- Let me in the car!
- Heather: Who's that?

1231
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,135
- It's a girl.
- Why didn't you tell me

1232
01:20:16,165 --> 01:20:17,833
you were with someone?
Who's the girl?

1233
01:20:17,866 --> 01:20:21,135
lt's-- she's just a friend.
l was-- she was drunk

1234
01:20:21,165 --> 01:20:23,667
and l didn't want her
to drive and so l--

1235
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:26,168
l told her that
l would take her home.

1236
01:20:26,199 --> 01:20:28,701
What kind of car does she have?

1237
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:30,801
This isn't funny anymore!

1238
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:33,435
lt's a Mercedes,
but it's not what-- baby--

1239
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:35,267
Heather:
l've gotta go.

1240
01:20:35,299 --> 01:20:37,100
No, baby, don't-- don't--

1241
01:20:39,366 --> 01:20:41,701
l was on the phone
with my girlfriend.

1242
01:20:41,733 --> 01:20:43,267
You're an asshole.

1243
01:21:16,599 --> 01:21:18,300
(woman coughing)

1244
01:21:21,733 --> 01:21:23,501
Woman:
Who is it?

1245
01:21:23,532 --> 01:21:26,368
Uh, it's Nikki.
l'm a friend of Heather's.

1246
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:30,434
(coughs)

1247
01:21:30,466 --> 01:21:33,435
- Hey.
- Hi. Is something wrong?

1248
01:21:33,466 --> 01:21:36,836
- Do you know where Heather is?
- Who are you?

1249
01:21:39,165 --> 01:21:40,733
l'm kind of your roommate.

1250
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:42,667
(classical music playing)

1251
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,501
What is that?

1252
01:21:45,532 --> 01:21:48,067
Sounds like music.

1253
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:50,601
Where's Heather?

1254
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:52,800
That's what l'm
trying to figure out.

1255
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:55,702
- What is your name?
- Nikki.

1256
01:21:55,733 --> 01:21:58,202
- l'm Eva.
- Hey.

1257
01:21:58,232 --> 01:22:00,267
Sure means certain.

1258
01:22:01,866 --> 01:22:03,767
Prem sure
doesn't mean anything.

1259
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:05,367
Okay, l'm sure.

1260
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:08,135
Okay. Then you need to act.

1261
01:22:11,132 --> 01:22:13,100
Like what?
Get on a plane?

1262
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:16,100
l mean, make a commitment.

1263
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,967
What kind of commitment?

1264
01:22:21,265 --> 01:22:23,200
A commitment.

1265
01:22:37,733 --> 01:22:39,234
Greene Street.

1266
01:22:41,432 --> 01:22:44,902
Believe me,
if the ring is the problem,

1267
01:22:44,933 --> 01:22:46,534
the ring is not the problem.

01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:50,534
(rock music playing)

1269
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:54,867
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1270
01:22:56,766 --> 01:22:59,001
#  Gonna take you out # 

1271
01:22:59,032 --> 01:23:02,034
#  Miss November # 

1272
01:23:04,132 --> 01:23:08,903
- #  Underneath a cloud so white... # 
- (dog barking)

1273
01:23:13,065 --> 01:23:14,900
#  We won't come back # 

1274
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:17,502
#  Until the daylight's # 

1275
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:19,166
#  In our eyes # 

1276
01:23:21,065 --> 01:23:24,768
#  l can feel your heart beat, baby # 

1277
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:29,270
#  l can feel your
heart beat fast # 

1278
01:23:29,299 --> 01:23:31,801
#  Gonna take you out # 

1279
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,901
- #  Ms. November... # 
- Actually, l don't know

1280
01:23:33,933 --> 01:23:35,434
how to thank you for this.

1281
01:23:35,466 --> 01:23:37,234
Just pay me back
some time, okay?

1282
01:23:37,265 --> 01:23:38,866
- You're a great friend.
- l know, l know.

1283
01:23:38,899 --> 01:23:40,867
- Okay, you're late, all right?
- Good luck.

1284
01:23:40,899 --> 01:23:43,167
Okay. l feel like l'm gonna puke.

1285
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,200
- That sounds about right.
- Go get her.

1286
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:47,901
-: Ah...:
- #  We won't be home # 

1287
01:23:47,933 --> 01:23:52,404
#  Until all the birds have flown # 

1288
01:23:53,766 --> 01:23:57,736
#  l can feel your heart beat, baby # 

1289

#  La la la la... # 

1292
01:24:07,265 --> 01:24:09,000
(car horns blaring)

1293
01:24:09,032 --> 01:24:11,768
#  La la la la la #

#  l can feel your

1301
01:24:48,966 --> 01:24:51,101
What are you doing here?

1302
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:54,068
- Is he here?
- No, but he could be.

1303
01:24:55,599 --> 01:24:57,867
Nothing happened
with that girl.

1304
01:24:57,899 --> 01:25:00,101
lt was completely innocent,
l swear to you.

1305
01:25:02,933 --> 01:25:04,601
Close the door.

1306
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,335
You shouldn't have come here.

1307
01:25:12,366 --> 01:25:15,869
l had to come here.
This isn't real.

1308
01:25:15,899 --> 01:25:18,301
You know this isn't real.
This is bullshit.

1309
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:22,501
l've been here.

1310
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:25,701
You can't be happy.

1311
01:25:29,899 --> 01:25:33,035
Come here.
Come here.

1312
01:25:34,466 --> 01:25:36,835
Come with me.
Let's go.

1313
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:39,901
Go get your stuff.

1314
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:41,901
(gasps)
l can't.

1315
01:25:42,933 --> 01:25:45,535
Why not?

1316
01:25:45,566 --> 01:25:47,734
Say we go back to LA.
Then what?

1317
01:25:47,766 --> 01:25:50,034
Get an apartment?

1318
01:25:50,065 --> 01:25:52,200
They want first, last and security.
That's five grand.

1319
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:54,000
Where do we get that?

1320
01:25:54,032 --> 01:25:55,566
Hmm?

1321
01:25:55,599 --> 01:25:58,702
- We'll figure it out.
- You're not a realist.

1322
01:26:00,099 --> 01:26:02,234
You're a dreamer
and it scares me.

1323
01:26:07,733 --> 01:26:10,569
lt's not a diamond.

1324
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:15,201
l want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1325
01:26:19,599 --> 01:26:22,201
Marry me.

1326
01:26:22,232 --> 01:26:23,766
Be my wife,

1327
01:26:23,799 --> 01:26:26,768
to have and to hold
and all that.

1328
01:26:29,733 --> 01:26:31,701
We're already married.

1329
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:47,735
No. You can get a divorce.

1330
01:26:47,766 --> 01:26:49,968
l can't.

1331
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,935
Why not?

1332
01:26:53,466 --> 01:26:55,701
l need this.

1333
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:00,400
Man:
Hey, l'm home.

1334
01:27:00,432 --> 01:27:02,867
- Where are you?
- Will.

1335
01:27:04,599 --> 01:27:08,069
Honey, um, do you have a five
for the grocery boy?

1336
01:27:09,132 --> 01:27:11,234
Oh sure, yeah, hey.

1337
01:27:12,265 --> 01:27:13,933
Thanks, man.

1338
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,766
- Thanks. Hey.
- Thank you!

1339
01:27:18,799 --> 01:27:20,901
- Hello.
- Hi.

1340
01:27:24,299 --> 01:27:26,267
(ballad playing)

1341
01:27:29,799 --> 01:27:32,701
#  Good morning, dear # 

1342
01:27:33,799 --> 01:27:37,035
#  l hope l didn't
wake you too soon # 

1343
01:27:39,799 --> 01:27:41,934
#  Because my mind # 

1344
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:44,735
#  Is growing tired # 

1345
01:27:44,766 --> 01:27:47,702
#  Too much thinking
what l should do # 

1346
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,500
#  l picture you # 

1347
01:27:52,532 --> 01:27:54,267
#  Out there # 

1348
01:27:55,632 --> 01:27:58,267
#  It must be beautiful # 

1349
01:27:58,299 --> 01:28:00,367
#  This time of year # 

1350
01:28:01,733 --> 01:28:05,269
#  All those East Coast leaves # 

1351
01:28:06,799 --> 01:28:09,301
#  Floating round like embers # 

1352
01:28:09,332 --> 01:28:11,967
#  From burning trees # 

1353
01:28:13,099 --> 01:28:15,434
#  Well, the weather out here # 

1354
01:28:15,466 --> 01:28:18,535
#  Is just the same # 

1355
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:21,201
#  But the garden # 

1356
01:28:21,232 --> 01:28:23,901
#  That you planted # 

1357
01:28:23,933 --> 01:28:26,035
#  Remains... # 

1358
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:40,033
Nikki's voice:
When you're a kid, it's LA

1359
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:41,699
that teaches you how to dream.

1360
01:28:43,099 --> 01:28:46,368
Tell me that you didn't learn more from
the movies than you did from school,

1361
01:28:47,432 --> 01:28:50,535
more from TV than you did
from your parents.

1362
01:28:50,566 --> 01:28:52,868
And what do we learn?

1363
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:54,867
We learn to believe in fairy tales.

1364
01:29:11,499 --> 01:29:13,567
Hey.

1365
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:16,868
- How are you?
- Do you want to-- l'm good.

1366
01:29:18,432 --> 01:29:20,534
You?

1367
01:29:20,566 --> 01:29:22,935
l'm great.

1368
01:29:29,933 --> 01:29:31,734
Thank you.

1369
01:29:33,065 --> 01:29:35,100
Take care, Nikki.

1370
01:29:36,299 --> 01:29:38,501
You too.

1371
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,501
(car starts)

1372
01:29:59,532 --> 01:30:03,202
#  'Cause everything
around me has changed # 

1373
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,235
#  But the garden # 

1374
01:30:07,265 --> 01:30:10,001
#  That you planted # 

1375
01:30:10,032 --> 01:30:12,100
#  Remains. # 

1376
01:30:16,699 --> 01:30:19,334
(frog croaking)

1377
01:30:25,933 --> 01:30:28,235
You know why the departures
and the arrivals at LAX

1378
01:30:28,265 --> 01:30:30,667
are on separate levels?

1379
01:30:30,699 --> 01:30:33,768
So the 30,OOO heartbreakers
that come here each month

1380
01:30:33,799 --> 01:30:36,768
don't notice the 30,OOO that are leaving
with their hearts broken.

1381
01:30:48,632 --> 01:30:51,401
My whole life, it was obvious
l was gonna end up in this city.

1382
01:30:54,065 --> 01:30:54,065
l'm still here.

1383

1395
01:31:37,099 --> 01:31:41,736
#  So come along
and pay the price # 

1396
01:31:45,065 --> 01:31:49,836
#  This ain't New York,
this tasty slice # 

1397
01:31:51,599 --> 01:31:54,034
