191
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,276
PROFESSOR: l'd like to discuss

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,278
the demand for money
by focusing on...

193
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,654
the money multiplier.

194
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,700
Add increases in currency,
deposits, reserves and bank credits.

195
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,743
Then we have the sum of
an infinite series.

196
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,371
Adding these components together,

197
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,958
we find that they add up
to one plus CU over CU plus RE.

198
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,627
That, simply stated,
is the money multiplier.

Now, moving on...

The essential technique of bartending:

201
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,301
Less is more.

202
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,136
The less you pour, the more you score.

203
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,763
The boss does better, we do better.

204
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,890
And the customer?

205
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,100
Think of a customer
as a hurdler thinks of a hurdle.

206
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,602
A means to an end.

We dazzle him with ice work.
We baffle him with bottle work.

208

fool a customer.

The speed rack shuffle. The hot shot.

00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,961
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna throw up.

646
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,965
No, I'm all right.

- Brian, I gotta hit the road, man.
- Okay.

649
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,353
Well, bye.

650
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,315
It has been an adventure.

for helping out yesterday.

That's all right.
How's she doing?

I'll have a beer.

Tell your old buddy how great he looks.

You look like a guy who dyes his hair
and shaves with a Brillo pad.

A guy who gets an erection

A daiquiri if you will, bartender.

I taught this young man
everything he knows.

What the hell are you doing down here?

This lad is the best bartender
south of 14th Street.

It's his downfall.

at something can be your downfall.

I grant you, it's not
an easy concept to grasp.

Now you take our hero, here.

708
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,452
I haven't seen him in a while
and I've never been here before,

of success manual behind the bar.

- Touché.

Always will be.

He doesn't realize the doors are shut
to people like us.

Maybe he wants to open them.

whose family owns half of Manhattan.

Some woman must have really
done a job on you.

Why does it always
have to be a woman?

It doesn't. Your friend,

01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,898
Come on in.

1128
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:20,794
Is this our waterfall?

1129
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,087
No.

1130
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,007
It's terrific.

1131
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,427
Yeah, it's all right.
Name's Mooney, not Monet.

1132
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:35,934
So, why did you humiliate me
like that in Jamaica?

1133
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,271
How did I humiliate you?

1134
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,648
Brian, I was there.

1135
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:44,109
I saw you go off with that woman.

1136
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,612
You're such an asshole.

1137
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,372
It's not as bad as it seems.

1138
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:00,208
Doug landed a rich chick,

1139
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:04,004
and that night he bet me
that I couldn't do the same.

1140
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,258
A rich chick? You'd go with a woman
just because she had money.

1141
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,302
No, it's not the money.

1142
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,972
He bet me that I wasn't
good enough to hustle her.

1143
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,516
Hustle her?

1144
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:18,268
I was worth so little to you

1145
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,520
that you could just take
some stupid juvenile bet?

1146
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:24,232
No. A guy lays down a dare,
you gotta take it.

1147
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,613
Brian, how do you think I felt
seeing you go off with some woman

1148
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,448
after the time we spent together?

1149
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:34,201
Hold on.
You were pushing me down there.

1150
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,787
You were coming on too strong, too fast.

1151
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,914
Oh, I was pushing you?

1152
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,916
You happened to be there, too.

1153
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,628
I thought we had something going.
I didn't play any games with you.

1157
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,806
I guess I just got spooked.

1158
01:13:56,933 --> 01:14:00,685
But now I know I can handle it.

1159
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,687
Oh, you can handle it, huh?

1160
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:06,191
What if you got spooked again?

1161
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,401
I won't.

1162
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:11,321
- I'll bet I can spook you.
- No way.

I'm pregnant.

1164
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,161
I'm spooked.

1165
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,832
It's mine?

1166
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:27,295
- I was only asking!
- You're not going to be burdened.

1167
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,382
You can still go out and make a million.
Don't worry.

1168
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,969
I'm not worried.
I mean, I am worried.

1169
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,763
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

1170
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:38,348
Just go!

1171
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,810
- Why?
- Because I want you to! Just go!

1172
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,191
You let me come up here just so
you could kick me out. Didn't you?

Mmm-hmm.

No, just get out!

I know you're upset,

1177
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:12,215
but if this is the way it's gonna be,
why'd you tell me about the baby?

1178
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,511
Because I knew it would be
the best way to get you out of my life.

Got time for a quick talk?

to a bartender for advice.

Nothing.

1281
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,770
Were you so honest?

1282
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,356
Why didn't you tell me
you were the original rich chick?

1283
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,733
Because you're so hung up on money,

1284
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:49,779
I was afraid I'd never know
how you felt about me.

1285
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:53,116
Me! How you'd really feel about me.

1286
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,829
See this?

1287
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:03,126
This is your father's idea
of how to get me out of your life.

1288
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:11,134
This is how hung up on money I am.

1289
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,470
As for the way I feel about you,

1290
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,225
I guess you'll never know.

1291
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,778
WOMAN 1: Let me in!

1292
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,363
WOMAN 2: Hey, what about us?

1293
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,115
We've been here for two hours!

1294
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,701
MAN: Let us in, Henry. It's cold out here.

1295
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:37,910
WOMAN 3: Henry? Remember me?

1296
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,912
WOMAN 4:
I'm Bruce Springsteen's cousin.

1297
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:41,914
- You look more like his couch.
- MAN: Henry!

1298
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:44,042
I'm Doug's friend.

1299
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:47,045
Mr. Coughlin doesn't have any friends
on a Saturday night.

1300
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,505
- BRIAN: Good evening, Henry.
- Hey!

1301
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,507
(POP SONG PLAYING)

1302
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,681
- Where's Doug Coughlin?
- Over there.

1303
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,351
Hey, you!

1304
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:02,852
Doug!

1305
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,480
- Coughlin! Doug!
- Flanagan!

1306
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,941
My best friend in the world!
My only friend!

1307
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,860
Piss off, Henry. It's okay.

1308
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,280
It's great to see you, my only friend.
Sit down.

1309
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:17,033
It looks like you've got
a lot of friends here this evening.

1310
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,868
- Proctologist's dream.
- What?

1311
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,953
- Wall-to-wall assholes.
- (CHUCKLING)

1312
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:24,832
- Great to see you, Flanagan.
- I've come to pay off my bet.

1313
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,251
- Brian!
- Kerry!

1314
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,089
What are you doing here?

1315
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:34,092
BRIAN: I've come
to beg and plead for a job.

1316
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:37,512
It'd be great to get some talent
behind the bar.

1317
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,569
Let's go somewhere where
we can appreciate this.

1318
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,113
Come on.

1319
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,164
DOUG: Get in there.

1320
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:07,333
Get in there and spend some money.

1321
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,585
Keep me in the manner
I'm accustomed to.

1322
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,755
Get in there and spend some money,
you two.

1323
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,258
What do you think of my rowboat?

1324
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,761
BRIAN: Jesus Christ!

1325
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:20,346
DOUG: Come aboard, ye landlubber!

1326
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,728
BRIAN: Baccarat crystal.

1327
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:29,939
Louis XIII. VoiIá.

1328
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,067
Should we let it breathe?

1329
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,779
It hasn't breathed in 50 years.
It's dead.

1330
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:38,573
Let's just drink it.

1331
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,505
- Health and friendship?
- Life and love.

1332
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:08,895
Douglas Coughlin,
your ship has certainly come in!

1333
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:09,979
(LAUGHS)

1334
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:13,816
My ship.

1335
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:19,238
My ship is going down,
and I'm going down with it.

1336
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,657
- How's that?
- All this is an illusion.

1337
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,787
I'm on my ass.
I haven't got a pot to piss in.

1338
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,205
Mmm.

1339
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,333
$100,000 a week. Painful.

1340
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:35,213
I should've read some of
your sacred books, young Flanagan.

1341
01:25:36,507 --> 01:25:40,927
The only thing I know about saloons is
how to pour whiskey and run my mouth.

1342
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,555
I knew nothing about insurance,

1343
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:51,813
or sales tax, or the building code,
or labor costs,

1344
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:55,441
or the power company,
or purchasing, or linens.

1345
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:58,027
Everyone with a hand
stuck it in my pocket.

1346
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,029
You must make enough to cover that.

1347
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:04,534
If I'd stuck to what I know best,
which is almost nothing.

1348
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,789
Instead I put all the cash
into commodities.

1349
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:13,042
And blew the fucking lot.

1350
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,293
(CHUCKLES)

1351
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:18,840
On the margin.
Buy, cover, buy, cover.

1352
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,385
I wanted it fast.

1353
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:27,682
See the headlines.

1354
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:32,645
"Douglas Coughlin:
From bartender to billionaire."

1355
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,730
(CHUCKLES MIRTHLESSLY)

1356
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,403
Hey, take it easy.

1357
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:41,571
Relax.

1358
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:46,325
The luck is gone, the brain is shot.

1359
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,995
But the liquor, we still got.

1360
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,542
KERRY: Doug?

1361
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,087
Are you down there?

1362
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:03,092
She knows nothing about this.
She thinks I'm a fucking hero.

1363
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:13,686
DOUG: My princess. My dream.

1364
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:16,606
Baby, not again.

1365
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,149
I want to go home.

1366
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:20,026
Come here.

1367
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:22,820
Toast, Flanagan.

1368
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:27,533
To the first and last person
I ever cared about.

1369
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,287
My wife.

1370
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,580
Doug?

1371
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,125
Doug, wake up.

1372
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,461
I want to go home.

1373
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:03,945
You know you're the only person
in the world Doug respects?

1374
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,491
We were a good team once.

1375
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:12,370
Walk me to my apartment.

1376
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,830
I hate going to that place alone.

1377
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,337
- I better check on Doug.
- Please?

1378
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:24,757
I want to talk about Doug.

1379
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:26,592
About his problems.

1380
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,633
Doug says
you're incredible with women.

1381
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:10,052
A real lady-killer.

1382
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:11,971
Is that what he says?

1383
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:15,182
What's your secret weapon?

1384
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:20,229
What you see is what you get.

1385
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:41,500
- Hold it.
- What'd you do that for?

1386
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,753
(SIGHING)

1387
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:49,967
I can't make it
with my best friend's old lady.

1388
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,138
Am I supposed to
live with the same man,

1389
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,557
day in and day out, forever,

1390
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,559
and have no one else in my life?

1391
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:01,145
Yes. It's called marriage.

1392
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,272
You wanted this as much as I did.

1393
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:05,066
That's why you're up here.

1394
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,692
But you can't do it now, can you?

1395
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:08,819
You're scared.

1396
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,532
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1397
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,534
- You're just scared!

DOUG: My dearest Brian,

1406
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,680
a guy like me looks in the mirror.

1407
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,725
He either grins
or he starts to fade away,

1408
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:48,604
and l haven't seen anything
to grin about in a long time.

1409
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:56,028
This may not be the most graceful exit,
but l know when the bottle's empty,

1410
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:59,031
that the only thing
l'm really gonna miss

1411
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:01,533
is the conversations we had going.

1412
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,122
At least l get the last word,
even if I had to maiI it in.

But l guess you knew that already.

- Mooney's apartment, Brian...
- I know who you are.

1419
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:55,254
I've been instructed
not to let you in here.

- If you'll just call...
- Leave now!

1421
01:33:58,008 --> 01:34:00,759
I just want to
talk to her for a few minutes,

1422

I don't want to cause any trouble.

- Send her a letter. Out!
- Get your hands off me, man.

Out!

Hey!

Please, there's so many things,

but he was too proud to let me help him.

1437
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,683
He was too proud to show
how he felt until it was too late.

1438
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:51,518
I don't want to make that same mistake.

...into the sitting room...

1440
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,233
I thought I told you to keep
that punk out of this house!

1441
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:00,361
- RECEPTIONIST: He got by me.
- Jordan, are you in there?

1442
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:04,323
I have saved money. I've worked out
a loan with my uncle for some more.

1443
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,868
With hard work, I know I can turn it
into something great.

1444
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:11,789
Brian, I know you can,
but it doesn't really matter.

1445
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:12,915
Listen to me!

1446
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:15,209
Get me the key!

1447
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,294
I love you! I want to marry you.

1448
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:20,255
I've loved you from the first moment
I saw you, Jordan.

1449
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:23,384
Please, come with me.

1450
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:27,179
Flanagan, get the hell out of my house!

1451
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,723
Jordan, wake up! Don't you see
why he's come back here?

1452
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:32,893
- One reason: for the money.
- I don't want a thing from you!

1453
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,687
You're not going to get one penny.
He's a loser!

1454
01:35:35,772 --> 01:35:37,981
I'm not a loser.
Please, Jordan, come with me.

1455
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,859
- Get him out of here.
- Stay out of this.

1456
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:43,362
- Please.
- RICHARD: Throw this bum out of here!

1457
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,072
Hold it!

1458
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:46,949
Jordan, don't go!

1459
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:49,952
If you walk out of this house,
don't bother coming back.

1460
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,122
- I love him, and I'm going!
- You're not going anywhere!

1461
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:55,290
Jordan! Stop her!

1462
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:57,251
- Get off of me!
- Don't fucking handle her,

1463
01:35:57,335 --> 01:35:58,710
she's pregnant!

1464
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:02,047
You asshole!

1465
01:36:17,856 --> 01:36:20,023
It didn't have to be this way, you know.

1466

You're on your own.

1467

It's the only way I want it.

I've been turned down
l've been pushed 'round

- Yes.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

You'll probably want to divorce me
in three weeks.

Probably. No, you'll want to divorce me.
