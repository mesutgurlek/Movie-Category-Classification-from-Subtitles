1
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,962
We should get moving. Got a big day.

2
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,934
Okay.

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,994
Sunday after Thanksgiving,
the busiest travel day of the year.

4
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:42,097
Can you remind me again, Blair,
why you're traveling today?

5
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,832
The year will fly by.
I'll be home next Christmas.

6
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,713
- I love you, Mommy.
- Sweetheart.

7
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,711
Enough of this. She's going to be fine.

8
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,612
Daddy.

9
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,822
I love you.

10
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,162
Bye, honey.

11
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,700
Love you.

12
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,407
I love you.

13
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,452
Think she'll be okay?

14
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:43,192
- She'll be better than okay.
- I meant in Peru. In the jungle.

15
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,158
Please stop worrying about this, okay?

16
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,430
The Peace Corps is not going to send her
someplace that's dangerous.

17
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,805
Just won't be the same.

18
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,706
What won't?

19
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,773
Christmas.

20
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,720
Did I tell you I'm doing dessert
for the art lunch tomorrow...

21
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,960
and I need a couple things from Chip's.
Here's a spot. Right there.

22
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,662
I need white chocolate and pistachios.

23
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,746
- I didn't bring the umbrella.
- I need that stuff from Chip's.

24
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,077
I didn't bring the umbrella.

25
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,548
- Well, I still need it.
- It's gonna have to wait.

26
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,817
- Look, you stay in the car, and I'll get a...
- I'll go.

27
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,056
Look, it's just sprinkling.

28
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,229
Listen, don't forget:
Dixon's white chocolate, one-pound bar...

29
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,462
and March Brothers pistachios.

30
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,996
Okay.

31
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,451
You could use an umbrella!

32
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,857
I just need some white chocolate.

33
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,242
What's the matter?

34
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,081
I just talked to Blair.
She called from the plane.

35
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,643
She called from the airplane?

36
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,714
Do you have any idea
how much it costs to call from an airplane?

37
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:58,185
- How is she?
- She's fine. She misses us.

38
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:04,065
- I'm standing over there. I can't...
- What? You didn't get the white chocolate.

39
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,767
They didn't have any.

40
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,431
Did you talk to Rex?

41
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,942
- Who's Rex?
- The butcher.

42
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:18,450
As odd as it sounds, I didn't think of asking
the butcher where the chocolate was.

43
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,089
- But I will.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,386
I'll go talk to Rex right now.
Maybe he'll wonder why I'm all wet.

45
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,502
You sure you don't need a...

46
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,411
- Buddy, can I get one of those?
- Sure. Thanks.

47
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,557
I really think you need an umbrella!

48
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,392
No! You know why I don't want one
of your stupid umbrellas? Because I...

49
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:14,730
Because I couldn't get any wetter!

50
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,370
Morning, Luther.

51
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,304
Hi, Mr. Krank.

52
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,778
Morning, Mr. Krank.

53
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,286
It'll be so different this Christmas,
won't it, Luther?

54
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,557
Yes, it will be so different.

55
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,990
Nothing will be the same.

56
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,737
For the first time in 23 years,
Blair won't be here.

57
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,004
Might even get depressing.

58
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,809
Lot of depression at Christmas, you know?

59
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,573
Yeah, well...

60
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,412
I would just love to forget about it.

61
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,364
What are you looking at?

62
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,494
Why are you looking at me like that?

63
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,837
Finish your pasta.

64
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,335
I'm finished with my pasta.
It's you I'm not finished with.

65
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,176
I'll be right back.

66
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,813
- You wait right there.
- Okay.

67
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,128
Luther?

68
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,935
What are you doing?
It's not even Saturday night.

69
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,679
- I have an idea.
- Yeah?

70
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,414
A brilliant idea.

71
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,227
Make sure you shut the curtains.

72
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,695
All right.

73
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,266
Come over here. Turn around.

74
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,530
What are you doing? Sit down.

75
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,735
Button up and sit down.

76
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,473
Look at this.

77
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,602
This is a little ledger
of what we spent last year for Christmas.

78
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:44,210
Look at some of this stuff.
What is this, $63 for ornament repair?

79
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,652
You got to be kidding me. Look at the total.

80
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,017
We spent $6,100 on Christmas last year.

81
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,057
$6,100 on...

82
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,754
I heard you the first time.

83
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,492
- With precious little to show for it.
- Where is this going?

84
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,759
The Caribbean.

85
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,607
<i>A 10-day luxury cruise on The Jubilee.</i>

86
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,805
The most luxurious ship in their fleet.

87
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,436
Cayman Islands.

88
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,575
Snorkeling. We go to Jamaica.

89
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,710
We windsurf, whatever the heck that is.
Look at the picture here.

90
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,882
The Bahamas. We sit in the sun.
10 days, luxury cruise, you and me.

91
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,593
- I might have to lose a little weight.
- Heck, I'll lose it for you.

92
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,323
What's the catch?

93
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,425
I wouldn't call it a catch.

94
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,767
We skip Christmas.

95
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,537
We skip Christmas?

96
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,672
We skip Christmas, save the money,
and spend it on us for a change.

97
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,045
I don't know.

98
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,813
Come on, please.
You and I go bask in the Caribbean sun.

99
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,722
- How much is this gonna cost?
- $3,000.

100
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:05,464
- We save money?
- Absolutely.

101
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,229
We can still give our charitable donations...

102
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,827
to Children's Hospital
and, of course, the church.

103
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,136
No, this is a total boycott, honey. Total.

104
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,707
It's $600.

105
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,108
It's a total boycott.

106
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,910
I'm afraid that's all I'm gonna say about that.

107
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,474
Well, then, no.

108
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,684
What a stupid idea.

109
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,623
You're gonna let a lousy $600
stand between us and a Caribbean cruise.

110
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,296
No. You are.

111
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,763
All right, look.

112
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,865
I'll match last year's contribution
to the church and to the hospital...

113
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,739
but not a penny more.

114
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,879
- When do we leave?
- High noon, Christmas day.

115
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,415
It's not even Saturday night.

116
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,755
I will not be celebrating Christmas this year.

117
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,827
As many of you know, Blair has joined...

118
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,361
the Peace Corps.

119
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,897
So Nora and I have decided to avoid
the rituals of Christmas...

120
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,740
save our money, and take a cruise.

121
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,282
<i>Therefore, I will not be participating
in the usual holiday rituals.</i>

122
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:37,052
<i>I will buy no gifts and accept none.
Thank you, anyway.</i>

123
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,953
<i>I will not attend
the firm's black-tie Christmas dinner...</i>

124
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,789
<i>nor will I be here for the office party.</i>

125
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,694
<i>I am not angry and I will not yell...</i>

126
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,101
<i>"humbug" at anyone who offers me
a holiday greeting.</i>

127
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,437
I am simply skipping Christmas.

128
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,145
- Hello, Mrs. Krank.
- Hello, Aubie, how are you?

129
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,623
I'm just a little worried
about your Christmas cards.

130
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,716
Why are you worried?

131
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,730
You always select the most beautiful cards.
You really should put your order in.

132
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,232
We're not gonna be ordering
Christmas cards this year.

133
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,029
- Do what?
- You heard me.

134
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,535
May I ask why not?

135
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,869
You know, I'm really quite late for lunch.
Bye-bye. Say hi to your mom.

136
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,475
But we always have
a live band at the auction.

137
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,877
Yeah, but last year, the band cost $15,000.

138
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,347
We hired a deejay for the Cancer Ball.

139
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,542
Ladies.

140
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,312
- Hi, Aubie.
- Hello.

141
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,350
Mrs. Krank, we forgot to talk about
your Christmas invitations.

142
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,687
We won't be needing those, either.

143
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,489
- No party?
- No Christmas Eve party?

144
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,886
No party this year.

145
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,131
She's not ordering Christmas cards either.

146
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,535
What's up?

147
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,268
We're...

148
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,302
taking a break.

149
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,209
We're not gonna do Christmas this year.

150
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,316
- How do you simply not do Christmas?
- You skip it.

151
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,348
But then what do we do Christmas Eve?

152
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,548
You'll think of something.
There are plenty of other parties.

153
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,389
But none like yours.

154
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,921
That's sweet.

155
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,464
- When do you leave?
- Christmas day.

156
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,291
That's an odd time to travel.

157
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,065
Apparently, not that many people travel
on December 25th...

158
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,231
and so Luther got us a great deal.

159
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,772
Then why don't you have the party anyway?

160
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,335
Because we don't want to, Merry.
We're taking a break.

161
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,610
One year off, no Christmas whatsoever.

162
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,184
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

163
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,801
Mr. Krank, I'm Randy Scanlon.

164
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,244
We're selling Christmas trees again
this year.

165
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,179
Got yours right here.

166
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,677
You got a Canadian blue spruce last year.

167
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,814
This one's a real beauty. Almost 10 feet tall.

168
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,319
Mrs. Krank likes the big ones.

169
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,485
Aren't they cute?

170
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,155
- How much is the big one?
- $90. We had to go up a little.

171
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,169
We're not buying a Christmas tree this year.

172
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,603
- Luther.
- We talked about this.

173
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,375
Sorry we had to go up on the price.

174
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,020
We're making less per tree than last year.

175
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,320
It's not about the money.
We're not doing Christmas this year.

176
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,690
We're gonna go away on a cruise.

177
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,459
We don't need a tree.

178
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,701
All right. Well, out of the frying pan...

179
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,436
and into the fire.

180
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,040
Luther.

181
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,944
- What?
- Come here.

182
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,277
- Why?
- Come here.

183
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,478
- What are they doing?
- Who?

184
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,258
- Spilling their guts to Frohmeyer.
- Not Frohmeyer.

185
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,330
Are you intimidated by Vic Frohmeyer?

186
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,232
Honey, he's like the unelected ward boss
of the street.

187
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,203
So Frohmeyer has a problem
with our skipping Christmas?

188
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,761
Who's he gonna call?

189
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,468
The Three Wise Men? Santa Claus?

190
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,140
Don't underestimate him, honey.

191
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,876
Vic Frohmeyer lives and breathes
for this neighborhood.

192
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,278
- You should've just bought the tree.
- No.

193
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,047
- You didn't have to put it up.
- No.

194
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,056
- You could've left it in the backyard.
- Quiet.

195
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,718
Why are you whispering? This is our house.

196
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,752
I'm whispering for the same reason
you're hiding behind that curtain.

197
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,298
Hey, Walt.

198
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,929
Luther Krank just stiffed the Scouts
on a Christmas tree.

199
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,136
Can you believe that, Mr. Frohmeyer?

200
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,437
Do not put it up there.
I want them on the back of the house.

201
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,509
Move it to the right. The other right.

202
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,572
- Becker's at it again.
- Evening, Vic.

203
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,815
Everybody's going to really miss Blair
this year.

204
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,286
The whole block's talking about it.
How is she doing?

205
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,188
She's doing just fine. Thanks for asking.

206
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,751
How's your family?

207
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,160
In great spirits.
We're putting up decorations tonight.

208
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,561
Wind it tight, Spike!

209
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,597
- Hi, Dad!
- Looks good, Mama!

210
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,230
It's the greatest time of year,
don't you think?

211
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,242
I couldn't be happier.

212
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,271
It's not gonna be the same
without Blair here.

213
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,904
Of course not.

214
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,116
Honey, are you okay?

215
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,216
- Come here. Honey!
- Give me a hand.

216
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:52,627
There are certain things around here
that I'm gonna miss at Christmas.

217
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,262
So you're...

218
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,361
really skipping out?

219
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,935
You got it.

220
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,195
Somehow, it just doesn't seem right.

221
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,639
That's really not up to you to decide, is it?

222
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,371
But I got to tell you,
the neighbors are pretty upset.

223
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,469
Really?

224
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,038
Christmas has always been a neighborhood
thing around here. You know that.

225
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:15,246
Everybody decorates.
Everybody bakes cookies, and swaps gifts.

226
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,684
I guess we do it for the kids.

227
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,225
If you're trying to make me feel guilty,
get off of it.

228
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,625
And you know what else?
I'd appreciate it if you...

229
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,630
and everyone else around here
would just respect my wishes.

230
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,723
Whatever you say, Luther.

231
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,677
Weather should be clear tomorrow.

232
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,445
Perfect time to put up Frosty.

233
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,113
Frosty?

234
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,051
Tell you what, truth is, if I'm gone, I'm...

235
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,023
Vic?

236
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,267
Frosty is a Christmas tradition.

237
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,007
Frosty is a Christmas decoration.

238
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,072
I will not be told by Vic Frohmeyer that
I have to decorate my house for Christmas.

239
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,946
Why won't you put up Frosty?

240
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,086
It's the principle thing. Do you understand?

241
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,286
We can forget about Christmas
if we damn well choose.

242
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,455
And nobody,
not even Vic Frohmeyer, can stop us.

243
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,292
I will not be forced into doing this.

244
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,638
Have a good day.

245
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,443
Hi, Nora.

246
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,645
- Morning, Bev. Hi, Walt.
- Hey, Nora!

247
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,622
It was an accident.

248
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,022
Walt, why don't you put
that cat of yours on a leash?

249
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,498
Only dogs wear leashes, old man.

250
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,763
Think you can run away from Christmas?

251
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,506
- I'm trying to.
- Guess it's a good way to save money.

252
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,972
- It's not about the money.
- Yeah, sure.

253
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:24,304
Muffles, be polite.
Will you two ever be friends?

254
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,882
You know, I'd like to say yes, but...

255
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,617
How you feeling today, Bev?

256
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,060
Have my good days and bad days.
Today's a good day.

257
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,263
I'm glad to hear that.

258
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,098
Come have your breakfast, dear.

259
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,425
I got to get to work.

260
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,836
Still working for the Man, huh?

261
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,408
As a matter of fact, it is a man I work for.

262
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,535
Thought they would've made you partner
by now.

263
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,077
I got to get to work.

264
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,375
Have a good one, old man.

265
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,449
One snowball with a little yellow spot on it.

266
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,694
Just skim the top of that little head of his.
Just like that.

267
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,161
"Old man."

268
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,935
Bah, humbug.

269
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,531
Good morning, Mr. Scrooge.

270
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,076
- Morning, Dox. Do I have any messages?
- Wal-Mart called.

271
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:33,516
Said I had to buy my own cheap perfume
since Santa Claus isn't coming this year.

272
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,114
Funny.

273
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,188
Nora Krank!

274
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,758
We're here for Frosty!

275
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,497
<i>- Hello.
- Luther.</i>

276
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,765
- Hey, babe.
- They're here.

277
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,863
<i>Who?</i>

278
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,933
Vic Frohmeyer, Wes Trogdon, Ned Becker,
and a gang of their kids.

279
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,875
We're here for Frosty!

280
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,806
- They want Frosty.
- They can't have him.

281
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,008
Nora!

282
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,511
Please give us Frosty.

283
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,282
Honey, where is Frosty?

284
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,451
- He's down behind the furnace. Why?
- They won't go away.

285
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,119
<i>Don't give them Frosty.</i>

286
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,028
You and Luther do not have to do anything!

287
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,733
Just leave Frosty on the front porch.
We'll put him up for you.

288
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,163
- They said they'll put him up for us.
- Absolutely not.

289
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,435
- Please, Luther.
- No!

290
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,307
We'll come back later.

291
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,043
And Frosty better be here.

292
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,048
They're gonna come back!

293
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,208
<i>Listen to you.</i>

294
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,548
You're panicking on the phone
in a locked house...

295
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,747
because the neighbors
are going door to door...

296
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:48,486
to set up a ridiculous
7-foot tall snowman!

297
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,827
Sure, easy for you to say.
Miles away in the safety of your office.

298
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:54,991
Yeah, well...

299
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,160
I am the one trapped here.
I am the one dealing with this!

300
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,763
All right, I agree. So maybe it's time
that you left the neighborhood.

301
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,866
Sure, honey.
How do you think I'm gonna do that?

302
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,878
The street is blocked
with all of our neighbors.

303
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,211
Walk to the garage, get in the car,
start it, drive to the mall...

304
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,750
I'll meet you at O'Leary's.

305
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,151
<i>Do it now! You can do this! Do it before...</i>

306
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,533
Bit more to the left.

307
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,101
That looks good.

308
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,279
- Hi, Mrs. Krank.
- Nora?

309
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,787
Vic, she's leaving!

310
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,291
What's she doing?

311
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,958
I'm so sorry.

312
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,431
Sorry!

313
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,970
Nora, stop the car.

314
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,978
Stop the car. Please, listen.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

315
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,741
Now, please, indulge me for a second.

316
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,813
Stop the car. Listen to me. Give us Frosty.

317
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,354
Stop the car.

318
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,625
We just want Frosty.

319
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,591
Talk to me. Please. Indulge me for a second.

320
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,446
It's us women who handle Christmas,
not men.

321
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,955
I am the one taking the brunt
for your harebrained scheme.

322
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,355
I am the one on the frontlines.

323
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,793
- I have a surprise for you.
- What?

324
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,057
Shut your eyes.

325
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,334
All right, open them.

326
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,975
- Honey, is this some kind of joke?
- No, I got one, too. What do you think?

327
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,014
A woman's bathing suit?

328
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,784
Probably belongs with that.
Nope, got my own.

329
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,119
Look at that. Little cliff-diver thing.

330
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,582
Honey, there is no way
we are wearing these on this cruise.

331
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,788
These aren't for the cruise.

332
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,730
You know what's odd?

333
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,895
Is when an Irish pub serves fish tacos.
I don't get that.

334
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,499
I got a little heartburn. I don't think I'm
gonna do that again. Here it is, right here.

335
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,812
Come on.
Follow me, and don't mention her eyes.

336
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,573
Hello, Mr. Krank.

337
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,210
- Hi, Daisy. This is my wife, Nora.
- Hello.

338
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,383
I really don't want to do this.

339
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,120
No, come on. I got a great deal.
$60, 12 visits.

340
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,292
Why would we get a tan before the cruise?

341
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,299
I thought the whole point was to get a tan
during the cruise.

342
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,962
Look at our skin.
We kind of look like uncooked chicken.

343
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,471
You look like a corpse.

344
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,105
And you could use a little help yourself.

345
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,875
Thank you.

346
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,107
Dear God, this should be outlawed.

347
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,758
Okay, calm down.

348
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,675
Excuse me.

349
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,345
Excuse me. Hello!

350
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,488
I need a BAND-AID.

351
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,720
Nora Krank?

352
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,100
Father Zabriskie. Hello.
What are you doing here?

353
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,067
It's a mall. I'm Christmas shopping.

354
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,805
Of course you are.

355
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,475
Are you okay?

356
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,737
Yes. Sort of.

357
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,437
You're bleeding.

358
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:40,473
Yes, it's just a scratch.
Could I get another towel, please?

359
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:44,587
I'm looking for a BAND-AID.
Jeez, lady, make up your mind.

360
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:54,621
Nora, I hear it from a good source
that you and Luther...

361
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,394
have decided not to observe Christmas
this year.

362
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,929
Yeah, sort of.

363
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,701
Father Zabriskie, Luther and I are fine.

364
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,939
Everything is fine,
and everything is completely normal.

365
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,549
Attendant said you were bleeding.
Are you all right?

366
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,586
- Luther.
- Hey, there.

367
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,150
Father Zabriskie.

368
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,551
Hey.

369
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,958
We've made the front page.

370
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,702
- Check it out.
- Hold on.

371
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,901
- "Skipping Christmas."
- Yep.

372
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,241
"The home of Mr. And Mrs. Luther Krank

How dare they!

385
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,151
What a bunch of losers.

386
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,354
You know what?

387
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:28,222
You know, I don't think I'm coming back
from this cruise.

388
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,257
Attagirl. Two more days
and we're out of here.

389
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,887
Two more, baby.

390
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,223
Jerks.

391
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,366
- Chocolate milk?
- Sure.

392
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,437
That's mine.

393
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,638
- Regular.
- Sorry I'm late.

394
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,473
Hey. What's wrong?

395
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,542
It's Bev Scheel.

396
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,608
- Could you cover for me?
- Sure.

397
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,954
- What happened?
- She went for a checkup yesterday.

398
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,512
The cancer's back for the third time.

399
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,923
- Has it spread?
- They think so.

400
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,358
That's awful.

401
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,394
This could be her last Christmas.

402
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,895
Sweetheart.

403
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,474
Well, if it isn't old Scrooge himself.

404
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,614
How do you think this photographer
got this shot?

405
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,486
- What photographer?
- The one that took this photograph.

406
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,651
- That one.
- Yeah, that one.

407
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,484
He climbed up.

408
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,786
- On your roof?
- Yeah.

409
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,924
- Why did you do that?
- I don't know.

410
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,635
He said he wanted to get a shot
of the whole street.

411
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,343
At least you're consistent.

412
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,037
I try to be, old man.

413
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,739
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

414
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,872
Stop calling me "old man."

415
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,210
You're, like, 10 years older than me.

416
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,513
- Am I?
- Yeah.

417
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,349
- Prove it.
- Walt.

418
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:09,181
I just heard about Bev. I am so sorry.

419
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,590
How's she doing?

420
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,999
Remarkably well. In good spirits.
Decorating the house, baking cookies.

421
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,368
Sure. If there's anything we can do,
let me know.

422
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,307
Thanks. I really appreciate that.

423
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,174
They're here for Frosty.

424
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,246
No.

425
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,029
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

426
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,700
- Good evening, Mr. Krank.
- Good evening, officers.

427
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,239
It's that time of year again.

428
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:34,309
Your Police Benevolent Association's
out there raising money for the community.

429
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,710
That's great.

430
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,477
You know, Toys for Tots, and we deliver
gift baskets for the underprivileged.

431
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,677
And ice skating for handicapped kids.

432
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,314
Every year, we deliver presents
for the elderly at the nursing homes...

433
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,585
and, of course, our war veterans.

434
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,320
Our big moneymaker is our calendar...

435
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,421
and you buy one every year, so here we are.

436
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,594
We don't need a calendar this year.

437
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,576
What a jerk.

438
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,406
He said he didn't need one.

439
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,943
Thank you for your contribution.
Merry Christmas.

440
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,183
Yeah, Merry Christmas. Good luck with it.

441
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,754
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

442
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:31,393
We're from St. Maria's Lutheran Church
out caroling. Are those folks home?

443
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes, they are.

444
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,703
- Are they Jewish?
- No.

445
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,243
- Buddhist or anything?
- No, none of that.

446
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,709
They're just trying
to avoid Christmas this year.

447
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,611
- Do what?
- You heard me. He's kind of weird.

448
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,888
Skipping Christmas so he can
save his money for a cruise.

449
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,081
No.

450
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,648
I think some Christmas cheer
would do them good.

451
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,387
- Really?
- Why don't you go ahead?

452
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,986
All righty then.

453
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,729
Drop.

454
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,097
Down!

455
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,686
Go!

456
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,733
This is fun.

457
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,700
Christmas carolers
right out next to our junipers.

458
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,904
How lovely.

459
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,845
It's not lovely. They're trespassing.
Somebody set us up.

460
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,849
- They're not trespassing.
- Yes, they are.

461
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,408
They're on our property.
They weren't invited.

462
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,683
Somebody told them to come.
Scheel or Frohmeyer.

463
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,884
- Christmas carolers are not trespassers.
- I know what I'm talking about here.

464
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,260
- Why don't you have them arrested, then?
- I just may do that.

465
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,565
Call your friends
down at the police department.

466
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,435
- That's funny.
- Not too late to buy a calendar.

467
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,237
This isn't a joke. This is military.

468
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,210
This is SEAL stuff.
I saw it on Discovery Channel.

469
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,625
Come on.

470
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,798
Just sit right here. Here you go. Right here.

471
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,436
There. That's perfect.

472
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,777
Quietest room in the house.
No one can find us down here.

473
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,390
Free Frosty! Free Frosty!

474
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,171
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Krank.

475
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,376
Luther!

476
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,984
"Every Who down in Who-ville
liked Christmas a lot.

477
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,528
"But the Grinch who lived
just north of Who-ville did not.

478
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,934
"The Grinch hated Christmas,
the whole Christmas season.

479
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,668
"Now, please don't ask why,
no one quite knows the reason.

480
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,144
"It could be his head
wasn't screwed on just right.

481
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,782
"It could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

482
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,820
"But I think
that the most likely reason of all...

483
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:55,052
"may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small."

484
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,189
<i>Luther, your face.</i>

485
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,899
- What about it?
- It's like it's frozen or something.

486
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,361
This?

487
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,003
I got a BOTOX injection today.

488
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,902
BOTOX treatment.

489
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,570
They take a big needle
and they inject it into your forehead.

490
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,910
It freezes your face like this.
I read it in a health magazine.

491
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,543
- How long are you gonna be like this?
- This is temporary.

492
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,855
And then you got all your wrinkles are gone.

493
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,387
- You should try this.
- You ought to get your money back.

494
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,258
- I can't live like this anymore.
- What?

495
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,562
We can't go out.

496
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,939
Everywhere we go,
people are whispering behind our backs.

497
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,070
I can't go home. It's too depressing.

498
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,647
I mean, there's no tree and no lights
and no music.

499
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,051
I can't talk to you.

500
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,220
- You're just consumed with yourself.
- That's not true.

501
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,658
- Look how far you've gone.
- Amazing.

502
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,857
- Turning our lawn into an ice rink.
- I can't feel anything.

503
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,766
Somebody could've broken
their leg or their neck.

504
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:15,465
- You could've put a caroler in the hospital.
- And that would be a bad thing?

505
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,009
I'm kidding.
I know this has been tough on you.

506
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,512
But in just one day, 24 hours,
we'll be on that trip.

507
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,078
And it's all gonna be better. I promise.

508
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,142
I don't know.

509
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:43,264
Do you think that Blair
will even think about Christmas?

510
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,793
Probably not.
I mean, she's in the rainforest...

511
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,499
and around people who worship trees...

512
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,633
and eat bark and frogs and that sort of stuff.

513
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,835
- You gonna wear that?
- Absolutely.

514
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,173
Nice.

515
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,708
<i>Free Frosty!</i>

516
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,049
I know this is you, Spike. Goodbye.

517
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,955
- Again? How many times is that?
- About five or six times.

518
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,456
Wish I had a snappy comeback
for that smart guy.

519
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,690
- Who cares?
- You're right.

520
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,692
The islands are calling.

521
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,770
<i>- Free Frosty! Free...
- Goodbye, Spike.</i>

522
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,434
- You're a genius.
- Thank you.

523
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:38,218
- All right, Frosty's dead.
- What? Dad, is that you?

524
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,414
<i>- Wait a minute. Blair?
- Yeah.</i>

525
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:45,326
Hi. No, that was a joke.
I thought that was somebody from work.

526
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,127
Your mom's getting on the other line,
then we have something fun to tell you.

527
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,666
- Blair.
- Hi, Mommy.

528
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,799
Hi, honey. It's Mommy.
How are you? Where are you?

529
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,307
I'm in Miami,
and I'm coming home for Christmas.

530
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,275
- What?
- Are you guys surprised?

531
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,574
- I'm stunned.
- Surprised.

532
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,108
- We landed about an hour ago.
- That's great!

533
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:09,380
- What do you mean "we"?
- I have another wonderful surprise.

534
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,013
- Yeah? What is it?
- I'm with Enrique.

535
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,852
<i>- What's a rique?
- Enrique.</i>

536
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,427
<i>He's a doctor. We went to Brown together.</i>

537
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,794
<i>You guys met him a couple of times.
At my dorms and at my graduation.</i>

538
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,457
- Of course.
- I don't remember.

539
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:24,831
He's Peruvian.

540
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,200
- Great. A Communist.
- Honey!

541
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,129
- Sometimes we called him Rick.
- Rick?

542
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,767
The guy that you went down there
to shack up with.

543
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,674
He lived in a separate hut, Dad.

544
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,679
Hut schmut. I want to see pictures
to prove that.

545
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,047
We've been friends for years.
And he's just so wonderful.

546
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,746
<i>We fell in love while working together...</i>

547
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,846
and he's asked me to marry him.

548
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,220
What?

549
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,191
And I really want to.

550
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,558
Honey!

551
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,858
Enrique has always gone home
for the holidays, so he's...

552
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,925
<i>never celebrated Christmas
in America. And he's so excited.</i>

553
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:02,097
I told him all about Christmas there.
The tree, the decorations...

554
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:05,903
<i>Frosty up on the roof. Everything.
Is it snowing, Daddy?</i>

555
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,274
You know,
Enrique has never seen a white Christmas.

556
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,609
No, but I sense a storm coming.

557
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,616
Okay, when do you land?
When do you get in?

558
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,152
- We land at 8:03.
- Tonight?

559
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,917
Yes, tonight. Just in time
for our big Christmas Eve party.

560
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,184
You are having the party, aren't you, Mom?

561
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,852
Of course we are.

562
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:30,025
<i>Great! Mom, you are going to love Enrique.</i>

563
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,301
He wants to have a houseful of kids.

564
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,001
Honey!

565
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,529
Oh, Mom, I can't wait to be home.
Pretty neat surprise?

566
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,239
I am speechless!

567
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,939
And your father is probably overwhelmed.

568
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,606
<i>Great. I love you, Mommy.</i>

569
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,414
I love you too, honey. Safe flight.
Okay, I'll see you here.

570
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,354
- She should've called sooner.
- But she didn't.

571
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,760
Why did you tell her
we're having that party?

572
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,297
Because we are.

573
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,889
I need my vest.

574
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,635
I don't know who's coming to the party
or what they're gonna eat...

575
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,105
but we're having a party.

576
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,368
What about our trip?

577
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,969
Don't even start with me.
This was all your stupid idea.

578
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,779
Stupid idea?
Five minutes ago, I was a genius.

579
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,116
- Now you're an idiot.
- How does one call change so much?

580
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,624
Don't dwell on the past, Island Boy,
we're having a party.

581
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,956
Cheese, wine and Blairey's favorite:
Hickory honey ham.

582
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,792
- Who's coming to this party?
- I haven't gotten that far yet.

583
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,059
- You're in charge of the tree.
- We don't have one.

584
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,566
Get one and put it up.

585
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,468
Then you will get your little brown butt
down to the basement and put up Frosty.

586
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,630
- No!
- Yes!

587
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:45,266
We are going to perform
a little Christmas miracle.

588
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,004
If we pull it off,
Blairey is never gonna know...

589
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,536
about your stupid, ridiculous,
childish scheme...

590
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,515
of skipping Christmas.

591
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,862
I'm sorry about this little ugly bush.

592
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,962
- Merry Christmas.
- It is, isn't it?

593
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,028
- Duke Scanlon.
- Hi, Duke.

594
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,472
The same guy who brought you...

595
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,976
that beautiful Canadian blue spruce
a few weeks back.

596
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:25,413
Okay, great! Merry Christmas to you.
I need another blue spruce just like that.

597
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:28,883
I really need a tree right now.
What do you got left?

598
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,387
Just one.

599
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,854
You know what? I like it. I'll take that one.

600
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,527
- Really?
- Yeah. How much is it?

601
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,957
- $75.
- It says $15 right there.

602
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,830
- Yeah. Supply and demand.
- That's kind of a rip-off, isn't it?

603
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:53,400
The Scouts could sure use
your $75 donation for their camporee.

604
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,335
What do you guys say I give you $25?

605
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,744
$75. Take it or leave it.

606
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,180
Yours?

607
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,945
- Hey, Wes.
- Hey, Luther. Merry Christmas.

608
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,424
Merry Christmas to you, too, man.
I'm in a little bit of a bind.

609
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,758
I got to be at my in-laws' by 5:00.
I should've left two hours ago.

610
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,993
Let me give you a hand.
This won't take long.

611
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,533
Listen to me. My plans have changed.

612
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,868
I got a call from Blair.
She's coming home tonight.

613
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,646
- What about the cruise?
- I don't know.

614
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,649
- I can't find a Christmas tree, though.
- So?

615
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,814
Can I borrow yours?

616
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:14,051
- Wes, we got to go.
- Be right there, T.

617
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,421
- You want my tree?
- Yeah.

618
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,017
I can get it back in your house
before you return.

619
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,230
- That's ridiculous.
- But I don't have a choice.

620
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:24,495
Everyone else needs their tree
tonight and tomorrow.

621
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,803
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Dead serious.

622
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,763
- Trish wouldn't like it.
- Trish doesn't have to know.

623
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,775
- Hey, Trish!
- Hi, Luther.

624
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:36,838
- Honey, we got to go.
- He's just saying Merry Christmas.

625
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,144
Please.

626
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,255
You break one ornament, we're both dead.

627
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:52,591
I will leave it just like I found it.
I appreciate this, I really do.

628
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,393
- This is funny, you know?
- Why am I not laughing?

629
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,456
Free Frosty! Free Frosty!

630
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,399
- Got to go.
- Thanks.

631
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,673
Guys! Fellas.

632
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,474
Guys, I'm sitting right over here.

633
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,604
- Scatter!
- Go!

634
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,408
- Wait.
- Run!

635
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,106
Wait, come here.

636
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,154
I just want to talk to you, Spike.

637
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,883
- Let me go!
- Bad little elf.

638
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:27,361
- Stop squirming around.
- Get off!

639
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,122
- Come on.
- Don't hit me.

640
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,963
It was a joke.
The Frosty sign, the phone calls.

641
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,765
I know. I'm not gonna hurt you,
I'm not gonna hit you.

642
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,204
But you do owe me.

643
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:40,771
- All I got is $20.
- I don't want your money.

644
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,542
I need a little help.

645
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:07,435
That is one huge tree.
It reminds me of this tree my dad got once...

646
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:11,133
That's interesting. Here's the plan.
Put the real delicate ones on the sofa.

647
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:15,372
- Is this against the law?
- Of course not. Just don't break anything.

648
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:32,886
Spike!

649
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,557
- Nothing valuable.
- What's it say on there?

650
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,725
"Baby's first Christmas."

651
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,028
Perfect!

652
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,834
- Hello?
- Hey, Walt. Ned here.

653
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,104
<i>- Merry Christmas, Ned.
- Merry Christmas, Walt.</i>

654
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,808
Say, I'm watching the Trogdons' house.

655
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,485
It appears as if Krank has lost his mind.

656
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:59,282
- How's that?
- He's stealing their Christmas tree.

657
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:07,588
Hello. Excuse me, I am looking for a ham.
A hickory honey ham.

658
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,394
If there are any left, they'll be back there.

659
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,368
Thank you very much. Merry Christmas.
Excuse me.

660
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,928
Happy holidays.

661
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:56,569
- Are you sure this isn't illegal?
- Are you a cop? Come on.

662
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,389
- Can I buy your ham?
- Pardon?

663
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,450
Your ham, it's the last one.

664
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:15,294
And my daughter, Blair, is coming home
all the way from Peru...

665
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,334
and hickory honey hams
are her absolute favorite.

666
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:22,201
- And I'd like to buy it from you.
- No, it's not for sale.

667
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:26,466
But she's in the Peace Corps.

668
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,980
And I'd be willing to pay anything
above sticker price.

669
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,174
No, we're not interested.

670
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:39,086
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about putting away...

671
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,592
a little something
for your child's college education.

672
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,295
You got it?

673
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:58,166
Come around here.
I want you to steer, I'll hold the back.

674
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,266
Ready? Come around the back.

675
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,004
Spike!

676
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,729
- Hello, Mr. Krank.
- Hey, fellas.

677
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,329
Where you going with that tree?

678
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:30,396
Spike and I are just taking it to my house.

679
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,701
Spike?

680
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,134
Yeah, the kid. Spike.

681
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:42,551
Did he just run that way? No? That's weird.

682
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:47,156
- Is this an imaginary friend?
- No.

683
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,991
Merry Christmas!

684
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,463
Stop!

685
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,600
Should've bought a calendar.

686
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,642
Gonna need it where you're going.

687
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:49,944
What do you want?

688
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,046
It's me, Spike Frohmeyer.
You know, Vic's kid.

689
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,317
Yeah.

690
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:58,419
If he says Trogdon loaned him the tree,
then he's telling the truth.

691
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,089
Here's the key. It's not a burglary.

692
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,225
Key.

693
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,728
Scram, Krank.

694
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,538
Thanks, Spike. I was kind of scared in there.

695
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,615
You'll be all right.
Try to relax, will you, Luther?

696
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,589
Get the tree.

697
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,761
- What happened?
- Unload the car.

698
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,003
- What's wrong?
- Nobody's coming.

699
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,505
I've called everybody we know,
they're all busy.

700
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,770
- We'll have to invite the neighbors.
- Over my dead body.

701
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,868
- How's the tree?
- Well...

702
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,209
It's a disaster.

703
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,413
Take it or leave it.

704
00:55:56,486 --> 00:56:01,185
Blue icicles and a Chicago Bear ornament?
Popcorn. Those aren't mine.

705
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:05,459
- Smoked trout.
- Better than frozen pizza.

706
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,526
What happened to the hickory honey ham?

707
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:16,297
Never say "hickory honey ham" again.

708
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,908
Hello. Blair! Hi, honey!

709
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,380
I'd like to talk to her
to send her back to Peru.

710
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,417
You're in Atlanta? Wow.

711
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:32,487
We're just busy cooking away here,
getting ready for the party.

712
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,091
Of course I'm making caramel cream pie,
your favorite.

713
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,818
We'll be there at 8:00 to pick you up.

714
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,888
I can't wait to see you, too. I love you. Bye.

715
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,868
It's 4:30. I need two pounds of caramel
and a jar of marshmallow cream.

716
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,465
The liquor store closes at 5:00
and they're holding a case of Pinot Noir.

717
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:53,975
A case of wine for the four of us?

718
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,012
Shut up. How long will it take you
to put up Frosty?

719
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,240
- Three days.
- Great!

720
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:01,909
When you finish, call all the neighbors
and invite them to the party.

721
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,384
What party?

722
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,693
Merry Christmas, Nora.

723
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,357
Merry Christmas to you, too.

724
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,764
Why are you out running around?

725
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,631
Just picking up last-minute stuff. You?

726
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,841
Picking up some stuff. Few things.

727
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,076
Big party tomorrow?

728
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:07,613
Actually, it's tonight. My daughter's
coming back from South America.

729
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:11,944
We're just throwing a little party.
She's bringing her new boyfriend.

730
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,449
Blair.

731
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,883
Yes.

732
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,898
Would you like to come?

733
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,392
You mean that?

734
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,305
Absolutely. I mean, it's just drop-in.

735
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,805
What time?

736
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,369
8:30.

737
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,712
- You're on Hemlock?
- Yes, 1482.

738
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,308
Thank you. Yes, thank you.

739
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,987
Who are you?

740
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,023
Not a clue.

741
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,361
You get heavier every year.

742
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,697
Up here!

743
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,436
Come on.

744
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,406
There we go.

745
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,246
I see Frosty.

746
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:26,652
Kids! Guys!
Mr. Krank is putting up his Frosty.

747
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,294
Let's go.

748
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,734
Come on. Straighten up there. Near perfect.

749
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,383
- Good evening, Luther!
- Hey!

750
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,878
You need some help, buddy?

751
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,015
No.

752
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,620
Luther, hold on.

753
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,657
Watch your balance!

754
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,461
Easy! Careful!

755
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,036
Careful, Luther!

756
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:14,066
Back. We got to go back that way.

757
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,121
Look out!

758
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,173
You okay?

759
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,502
Swell, Vic. Thanks. How about you?

760
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,980
I called 911. They're on the way.

761
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,381
- Thanks, Walt.
- Bev made me.

762
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:01,416
- It was up on the roof just a minute ago.
- Is he all right?

763
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,623
Poor Frosty.

764
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,628
Yeah, "poor Frosty" my eye.

765
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,865
He's okay!

766
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,294
You should just let me drop. Let me fall.

767
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,230
He's all right.

768
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,136
What on earth are you doing? Are you okay?

769
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,434
Actually, it was a suicide attempt.

770
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,740
Apparently, I misread the instructions.
Put my leg to sleep, though.

771
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,781
He was up there by himself,
trying to put up your Frosty.

772
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:31,715
- Sweetie, here they come.
- Here come the pros. Guys.

773
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,820
Just hold on. I guess you can't, can you?

774
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,723
Hurry up!

775
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:41,221
Back off, I'll be all right.
Move away. Let these guys handle it.

776
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,892
Thanks. Just a little problem with the rope.
If you could just untie it.

777
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:48,130
Get a ladder, that would be helpful.
But I don't know...

778
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:51,432
What are you gonna do
with those clippers, guys?

779
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:52,835
Got him?

780
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,674
You okay?

781
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,511
Dudes, over here.

782
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,853
Slow down. That's good. Over here, man.

783
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,115
Folks, move back.

784
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,452
What's going on here?

785
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:14,690
Luther here was up on the roof putting up
Frosty and then they both fell off.

786
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:15,958
Coming through.

787
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:19,433
I thought you were skipping Christmas
this year, Mr. Krank.

788
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:22,130
What about that? What's going on there?

789
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,506
Blair's coming home for Christmas.

790
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,438
And she's bringing her boyfriend.

791
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,680
- And she expects to see a Christmas tree?
- Yeah.

792
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,746
- And a Frosty?
- Of course.

793
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,381
And what about
the annual Kranks' Christmas Eve party?

794
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,189
That, too.

795
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,629
- When does she get in?
- Plane arrives about 8:00.

796
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,698
All right, people, listen up. Gather around.

797
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,901
We're about to have a party here
at the Kranks'.

798
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,211
A Christmas homecoming for Blair.

799
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,041
Great idea, Vic.

800
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,481
Drop what you're doing and pitch in.
Nora, do you have a turkey?

801
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,152
Smoked trout.

802
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,254
Smoked trout?

803
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:19,893
Anybody got a turkey?

804
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,954
- We have two, both in the oven.
- Beautiful. Get them.

805
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:26,160
Ned, go to Brixley's. Get his Frosty.
Get some lights, too.

806
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,998
We'll put them along Luther's boxwoods.

807
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:32,166
- Hold on. Why should we do this for him?
- Yeah. He's a jerk.

808
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:36,810
Regardless of how you feel about him...
A lot of you have mixed feelings about him.

809
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:40,315
But we're a community.
The people in a community stick together.

810
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,841
Even if one of them has been behaving,
for most of the holiday season...

811
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,252
like a spoiled, selfish little baby.

812
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,181
We're not doing this for him.
We're doing this for Blair.

813
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,058
Blair, who used to baby-sit all your kids.

814
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,362
Blair, who comes home every summer
and makes us all feel like family.

815
01:03:58,568 --> 01:03:59,762
That's right.

816
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,294
Why should the daughter pay
for the sins of the father?

817
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,872
Now, if we even have a hope of pulling
this off, you got to scatter.

818
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:12,404
Grab a change of clothes and all the food
you can, and get over here in half an hour.

819
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,881
- Let's go.
- Randy, Mike, let's go.

820
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,420
- Thank you!
- You're welcome, Nora.

821
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,886
Guys, better go to the airport.

822
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,717
- Why's that?
- Blair needs a ride home.

823
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,561
I don't know if we could do that.

824
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,632
Shall I call the chief?

825
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,164
We could do that.

826
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,509
Got a hold of Frosty there?

827
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,071
Easy. Up he goes.

828
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,774
There you go.

829
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,219
Finally.

830
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,387
There's nothing like a white Christmas.

831
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,790
Merry Christmas!

832
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,764
Hi, everybody!

833
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,835
- Hey, boss!
- Hey, guys. Come on in.

834
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,395
Aubie. Thank you.

835
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,106
What are these?

836
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:21,173
Honey.

837
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:24,078
These illegal?

838
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,692
Here. I have that one piece you need.

839
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,306
I think that should go over there.

840
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,271
Honey, look. Look. Mistletoe.

841
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,777
Hello?

842
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,047
- Hey, Blair.
- Blair?

843
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,787
- You're 55 minutes early.
- What?

844
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:06,085
That's a heck of a tail wind. Yeah.
That's great.

845
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:11,162
We're waiting right here.
Can't wait to see you.

846
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,291
Love you, honey.

847
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,700
That was your mom. We both love you.
Bye-bye.

848
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,536
- What are we gonna do? We'll never make it.
- No, I got an idea. Hold it.

849
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:22,601
Go!

850
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,109
Go, Spike!

851
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,681
Anything else that's in a box,
just put it down in the cellar.

852
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,650
You know what? It looks good.

853
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,891
- See them?
- I don't see my parents anywhere.

854
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:49,262
Honey.

855
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,370
Is that us?

856
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:04,550
Hi, I'm Blair. This is Enrique.

857
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:08,617
A police escort? I'm impressed.

858
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:12,892
I guess my dad was really generous
with his donation this year.

859
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,861
Yeah. You have no idea.

860
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,566
Thirty-seven minutes, my friends.

861
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:25,162
Welcome to the United States.
Hand me those bags.

862
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:29,337
Officer Frohmeyer here. Do you read me?

863
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:31,972
How many times I got to tell you, stay off...

864
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,278
This is serious. Can you talk?

865
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,379
- Yeah, go.
- We need to stall.

866
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,647
- Stall?
- We're ready.

867
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,712
We're not ready.

868
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,318
Okay. Stall.

869
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,520
I'll get it, thanks.

870
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,497
- Merry Christmas, Luther. Here's a ham.
- Can I help you?

871
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:56,060
I'm sorry. I'm a little bit early.
It's cold out there.

872
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:59,401
- Why don't you go in? Enjoy yourself.
- I'm so happy to be here.

873
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,742
Father Zabriskie,
it's so nice to see you again.

874
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:03,801
Thank you.

875
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,679
- I don't know who he is.
- He brings ham.

876
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,364
Why are you driving so slow?

877
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,671
Icy roads.

878
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:36,044
Want to celebrate Christmas
under a mistletoe or in a body bag?

879
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,223
- Can I help you with that?
- Thank you.

880
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,851
- Good.
- Here we go.

881
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:56,091
Honey, I talked to everyone.
No one knows that guy.

882
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,760
He knows them.

883
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,529
What is... How do... What?

884
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,002
Thanks, Father.

885
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,863
- Robbie, check that bottom string.
- Yes, sir.

886
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,101
That's good enough.
We don't have much time.

887
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,837
Randy, plug it in.

888
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,326
Sweet.

889
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,929
It's just the lights.

890
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:35,492
- I'll go check the breaker.
- I'd better go help Luther.

891
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,005
Do you know anybody at ComEd?

892
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:47,071
<i>Officer Frohmeyer here. Do you read me?
Hurry, I'm running on batteries.</i>

893
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,718
- What's up, Spike, sir?
- We need more time.

894
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:56,114
- Roger.
- What was that? Talking about time.

895
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,389
He said crime.

896
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:04,197
Possible domestic disturbance.
We'd better check it out.

897
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,127
What are you talking about?

898
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,980
We'll put those down here on the table,
I think, just as the entre.

899
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:27,047
Aubie, put the cookies over there
on the edge of the table.

900
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:32,960
- There was a box with some balls in it...
- You took the big box downstairs.

901
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,663
Finally!

902
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,896
Wonderful!

903
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:46,805
- It looks wonderful, everybody.
- Place looks great.

904
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,241
She's gonna be here any minute!

905
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:53,509
Honey, I need to do something
about your tan, and we need to change.

906
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:57,452
Will you please tell me
what the hell is going on here?

907
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,382
We got to stall.

908
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,414
Just for a few minutes
until they get the party started.

909
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:04,857
Okay.

910
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:10,264
See, it's fine. Just checkup.

911
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,492
Let's walk over to this door
like we're investigating something.

912
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,231
I'll put my hand on my gun,
make it look official.

913
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,073
Yeah, you do that, Mr. Terminator.

914
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,805
I look like my mother.

915
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,713
And she's been dead, what, 15 years?

916
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,819
That's enough time. Let's go back to the car.

917
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:33,946
Okay.

918
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,394
What was that? Looks like a break-in.

919
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,555
- No way.
- Yes way.

920
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,293
I don't need this. Not now.

921
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,029
Break-in rate is very high on Christmas Eve.

922
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:50,503
I know that, but we got a party to go to.

923
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,938
So, what do you want to do, ignore it?

924
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:57,905
We can't do that.

925
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,282
- There he is.
- Police!

926
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,747
Eat this!

927
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,646
Go get him. Go on, get going.

928
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:22,134
Get up! Come on, he's getting away.
Hurry up!

929
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,898
What are you doing lying there?
He's getting away.

930
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,005
All right, don't move.
Stay right where you are.

931
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,237
Police.

932
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,374
- Get him!
- Police.

933
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,645
All right! We got him.

934
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:52,832
Honey, this is gonna be
Enrique's first Christmas in America.

935
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,062
I hope we make a good impression.

936
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,002
Nora, are you sure about this?

937
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:01,601
- I look like a Mafia lieutenant.
- The black makes your skin look lighter.

938
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,814
And Blair is never to know about the cruise.
Do you understand?

939
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,213
I heard you the first 60 times.

940
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:16,047
Frohmeyer One to Frohmeyer Two.

941
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,889
<i>- The Eagle has landed.
- Roger.</i>

942
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,822
Ned! They're here!

943
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:24,525
- I'm not finished.
- Hide!

944
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,550
Guys, Blair's here!

945
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,183
I see her!

946
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,192
- They're here!
- What if we don't like him?

947
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,097
We raised a smart girl.

948
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,632
Welcome home!

949
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,599
They're getting out of the car!

950
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:02,865
She's home! Everybody, she's here!

951
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:04,300
Good to see you.

952
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,307
- Who's this?
- Enrique, my boyfriend.

953
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,606
- Vic Frohmeyer. Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

954
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,543
This is so exciting. Hi, guys.

955
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:16,277
Your parents are dying to see you.
Didn't Luther do a great job on the house?

956
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,545
Honey, they're here!

957
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:26,317
- I can't believe I'm home.
- We can't believe you're home, either.

958
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:27,589
Dad.

959
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:33,294
- Luther Krank. This is Nora, my wife.
- Hi, I'm Enrique DeCardenal.

960
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,528
Come here, you!

961
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:38,671
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

962
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:42,468
- You guys look great.
- We've been watching what we eat.

963
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,978
- And you've been in the sun.
- No, we have not.

964
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,845
No. I wear black to make me look lighter.

965
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,847
The party! Look, there's the party!
Come on, it's the party!

966
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:57,858
Everybody, look! Party!

967
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,084
Nice to see you.

968
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,628
I'll take the light one, you take the rest.

969
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,393
Hey, Aubie, how are you?

970
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:10,931
Kid.

971
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,373
Come here.

972
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,668
I'm freezing to death.

973
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,645
I'm starving out here.
I haven't eaten in seven days.

974
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,375
- Seven days?
- Yeah.

975
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,511
Any scraps I get, I give to the kids.

976
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,248
- What kids?
- My kids.

977
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:31,859
I got four: Annie, Billy, Tommy, and Chuck.

978
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,722
And all I wanted to do was give them
a real Christmas this year.

979
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,459
They deserve it.

980
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:46,268
Okay, you got 20 minutes inside.
Enough time to get warm, grab some food.

981
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,170
Then it's back to the police car.
No funny business, right?

982
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:52,374
Swear?

983
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,610
On my kids' lives.

984
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,378
Have to try hickory honey ham.

985
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,787
It's Blairey's absolute favorite. It's a classic.

986
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:08,759
- The food's that way.
- Thanks, son. I appreciate it.

987
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:12,024
- We've had ham since she was a little girl.
- Welcome home, Blair.

988
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:15,235
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

989
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,636
I suppose this is your boyfriend.

990
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,676
- Yes. Honey.
- Hi, I'm Enrique DeCardenal.

991
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,678
- Call me Marty.
- Houston, we have a name.

992
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,738
- Is that a Peruvian accent?
- How could you tell?

993
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:31,783
I lived there for five years. I miss it so much.

994
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:45,663
- I'm going to talk to Marty for a second.
- Okay. Go ahead.

995
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:47,326
He's charming.

996
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,667
- Who is that?
- You know Marty. Everybody knows Marty.

997
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,007
Merry Christmas.

998
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,243
Aren't you sweet?

999
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,512
Bless you.

1000
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:11,108
I would like to propose a toast, if I may.

1001
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:15,914
Here's to my new family and friends.

1002
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:20,391
Thank you for making me feel so welcome.

1003
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:36,566
And I just wanted to say...

1004
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,810
thank you to all of you.

1005
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:43,044
To our friends and our neighbors...

1006
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,914
for helping us make this...

1007
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,445
really, the most wonderful
Christmas Eve ever.

1008
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:53,620
You really have shown us
the true meaning of community.

1009
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,526
And thank you all so much.

1010
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:57,087
Merry Christmas.

1011
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,805
Same goes for me, double.

1012
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:19,781
Cheers.

1013
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,517
Fellas, how about a party tune?

1014
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:38,329
G.

1015
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,928
That was it?
That was the best you could come up with?

1016
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,538
I'm not really good at toasts.

1017
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,003
After all they've done...

1018
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:23,647
you couldn't just come up
with a simple "thank you"?

1019
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,545
I did. It was just short and sweet.

1020
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,024
You're still moping...

1021
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:38,657
because you don't get to go
on your precious little cruise.

1022
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,496
There's still time.

1023
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,793
- What?
- We could still go.

1024
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,005
Listen to me.

1025
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:49,670
Enrique and Blair can stay here,
have the house to themselves.

1026
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,577
We go, and we all have a romantic getaway.

1027
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:56,743
Your daughter just flew
thousands of miles home...

1028
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:59,614
with her very sweet future husband...

1029
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,815
to spend Christmas with us.

1030
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,221
You know...

1031
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:06,986
I've spent six weeks planning
for this vacation.

1032
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:09,724
That's longer than they've been dating.

1033
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:16,602
Everyone out there sacrificed
their Christmas Eve to help us.

1034
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:22,003
I thought maybe that might affect you.

1035
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:26,977
Maybe have you start thinking about
putting others first instead of yourself.

1036
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,713
But I really don't think that's possible.

1037
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,245
It's a shame.

1038
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:41,518
Why don't we move in a little?

1039
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:53,337
Hi, how are you? Merry Christmas to you.

1040
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:56,171
It's cold out there.

1041
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:24,469
Bravo!

1042
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,449
Luther!

1043
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,060
Frosty?

1044
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,443
Merry Christmas, Luther.

1045
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:11,644
Merry Christmas to you, too, Walt.

1046
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,019
- You're missing your party.
- Well, there's...

1047
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:17,955
How's Bev?

1048
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,926
She's having a good day. Yeah, thanks.

1049
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:25,832
We started over to see Blair,
but, you know, the snow started and...

1050
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:29,437
So how's the boyfriend?

1051
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:33,069
You know, actually,
he's a very nice young man.

1052
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:36,805
- Merry Christmas, Luther.
- Merry Christmas to you, too, Bev.

1053
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:40,177
- You feeling okay?
- That was a pretty nasty fall.

1054
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:44,113
It could've been worse.
I mean, that cord could've snapped and...

1055
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:48,186
You know, Nora wanted me to drop this by.

1056
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:53,190
I'm allergic to pork,
and Bev's not much of a meat-eater.

1057
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,856
Not to worry, because Mel's hams
are generally just filled...

1058
01:23:56,931 --> 01:24:00,389
with a gelatin and a fat-like substance.
Please.

1059
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:02,698
It's very thoughtful, Luther.

1060
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:10,603
You know, have a good one.

1061
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,726
Could I come in for a minute?

1062
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:40,261
Thanks.

1063
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:46,999
Blair's gonna be staying with us
for 10 days...

1064
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,506
so we're not taking the cruise.

1065
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:52,910
And Nora and I would like you guys
to have it.

1066
01:25:56,384 --> 01:25:58,318
Flight leaves at 12:00 noon tomorrow.

1067
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:01,150
You got to be there
two hours ahead of time.

1068
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:05,249
It's 10 days in the Caribbean.
Islands and beaches. The works.

1069
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:08,962
It's a dream vacation.

1070
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,534
We can't take it, Luther. It's not right.

1071
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,431
I didn't purchase the travel insurance.

1072
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:21,839
So if you don't take it,
the whole package is wasted.

1073
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,572
I'm not sure my doctor would allow it.

1074
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,909
I've got that Lexon deal on the front burner.

1075
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,383
Benny said he might stop by tomorrow.

1076
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,682
And we couldn't leave the cat.

1077
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,921
This is from us to you.

1078
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:40,290
This is a sincere, heartfelt...

1079
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:43,259
no-strings-attached Christmas offering...

1080
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:47,891
to two very selfless people
who are, at this moment...

1081
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,668
having a very difficult time
looking for an excuse.

1082
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,673
Benny did say he might stop by.

1083
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,877
Face it, Bev,
Benny hasn't been home in years.

1084
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,111
Look, I've got everything right here.

1085
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:12,148
I got airline tickets.
I got cruise passes. I've got a brochure.

1086
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:17,294
What's it cost? If we decide to go,
we'd want to reimburse you.

1087
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:19,432
This is a simple gift, Walt.

1088
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:23,934
No costs, no payback.
Don't make it complicated.

1089
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:33,436
- Our names aren't on the tickets.
- I know. I'll take care of that.

1090
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,277
What about the cat?

1091
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:39,144
Yeah, that's a problem, huh?
Too late to call the kennel.

1092
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,211
We can't just leave him.

1093
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:43,955
We could ask Jude Becker.

1094
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,017
She's allergic.

1095
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,158
I'll take the cat.

1096
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,893
- What?
- Are you sure?

1097
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,094
Yeah.

1098
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,871
Look at that.

1099
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:03,301
See? Maybe if you don't step on him
so often...

1100
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,872
Yeah. It'll be fine.

1101
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:13,718
- Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.

1102
01:28:14,989 --> 01:28:18,550
Well, I should get back to my party.

1103
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:32,001
This means so much.

1104
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,306
Thank you.

1105
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,470
You're welcome.

1106
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,776
Does this mean we have to start
being nice to each other?

1107
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:47,451
- Of course not.
- Good.

1108
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:51,483
Because I still don't like you
that much, old man.

1109
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:52,924
That's good.

1110
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,763
I'm not that fond of you, either.

1111
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:08,474
Bev, we gotta pack!

1112
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,439
Luther! Help me!

1113
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,083
Ned!
What in God's name are you doing up there?

1114
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,114
Blair came home.

1115
01:29:21,789 --> 01:29:23,984
Frohmeyer took down the ladder.

1116
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:26,856
He went inside, forgot about me.

1117
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:30,591
Have you been up there all this time?

1118
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:36,603
I'm frozen, stuck to Frosty!

1119
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,866
I'll get you down!

1120
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,017
What are you doing?

1121
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,719
You swore on your kids' lives!

1122
01:29:57,325 --> 01:30:00,692
- What kids?
- Help! Police!

1123
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:09,159
Easy, come on.

1124
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,839
Go on inside. Drink something hot.

1125
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,913
Get down from there. Get down off the roof!

1126
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:23,884
My car.

1127
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:25,584
You all right?

1128
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,851
What's in that bag?

1129
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,321
Not bad.

1130
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:38,995
Good job, Santa. All right, come on.
Get up here. Let's go.

1131
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:44,603
- You swore to me.
- I'm growing tired of catching you.

1132
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:52,236
- What's this all about? What's going on?
- I told you you could use an umbrella.

1133
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:53,973
What?

1134
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:01,821
- Marty.
- Yes.

1135
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:07,819
Wait. You're the guy that was selling
the umbrellas in the rain, aren't you?

1136
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:10,728
It's a living.
I meet a lot of nice people this way.

1137
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:14,427
I got to run because I can't pass up
this kind of weather.

1138
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,471
It's always good for business.
Thank you for the party.

1139
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,837
You're welcome.
I'm sorry you got to work on Christmas Eve.

1140
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:24,400
Santa always has to work on Christmas Eve.

1141
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:28,572
Yeah, I suppose he does.

1142
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:40,185
Merry Christmas!

1143
01:32:04,085 --> 01:32:05,985
Bev Scheel just called.

1144
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,383
Maybe I was wrong about you.

1145
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:22,500
This night is full of surprises.

1146
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:29,740
Skipping Christmas. What a stupid idea.

1147
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:32,240
Maybe next year.

1148
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:18,120
Merry Christmas!
