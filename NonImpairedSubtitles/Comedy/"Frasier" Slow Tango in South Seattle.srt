1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,120
(Frasier) Hello, Steven, I'm listening.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,877
(Steven) 'We're having a baby
and there seems to be different advice

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,999
'about whether it's OK to let your kid
get into bed with you in the morning. '

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,469
Stop right there, Steven. It's OK.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,270
All relationships require close and
undivided attention, don't they, Roz?

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,714
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,759
'What if you and your wife
enjoy making love in the mornings? '

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,755
Trust me, after the baby comes,
that won't be an issue any more.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,515
This is Dr Frasier Crane on KACL.
We'll be back after these messages.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,194
Roz, how can you be reading now?

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,558
It's something I picked up
in elementary school, and it stuck.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,315
- What is so captivating?
- ''Slow Tango In South Seattle''.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,199
Every woman I see
is carrying that book.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,194
It's impossible to put down.
Read the first paragraph.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,715
I guarantee you'll be hooked.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,590
''There are tangos that come flowing
from the wine-coloured sea...

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,911
''from the rust
of a hundred sunken ships.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,116
''This is one of those dances.''

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,560
- Well?
- There are books...

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,072
that make your stomach rumble
and thrust your lunch ever upward!

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,953
This is one of those books!

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,872
You men are all alike -
you have no soul.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,999
Except for this one - the future
Mr Roz Doyle, Thomas Jay Fallow.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,628
- My God, it's him!
- Do you know him?

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,679
Yes. He used to drop into a bar
I frequented in Boston.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,231
A bit pretentious, though -
stuck out like a sore thumb.

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,117
You used to drink
with Thomas Jay Fallow?

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,750
I helped him get through
his writer's block.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,072
ln future, I'll remember
to use my powers for good, not evil.

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,674
I don't care what you think.

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,674
He's on ''Bookchat'' tomorrow
and you're introducing him.

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,436
No! I'd have to say I liked his book.
It's hard to lie to someone's face.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,754
No, it's easy for someone as bright,
charming and articulate as you.

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,514
Well, perhaps you're right.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,115
See how easy it is?

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,196
(Eddie growls)

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,879
- Eight, nine... Stop it, Eddie!
- He just wants to play.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,430
Yeah, well, therapy is not a game.
Stop it! Stop it, I said!

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,397
(Doorbell rings)

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,314
If he keeps this up,
there's no point to these exercises.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,833
Attaboy!

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,677
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,031
- Hey, Niles!
- Ah, doing your exercises.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,555
Yes, and if someone doesn't let us
get on with them,

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,871
he'll get a spank on his fanny.

46
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,276
Don't...don't let me...

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,319
- Unless you want to!
- What's up?

48
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,430
ln your room, I noticed you had
pictures of Frasier and Frederick

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,475
and an autographed one from someone
named Ken Griffey Jr, but...

50
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,791
none of Maris and me.
So I brought you this.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,752
Thanks.

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,595
Why is Maris wearing jodhpurs?
Taken up horse riding?

53
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,797
No, she wanted to,
but her quadriceps are so tight

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,669
she can't straddle anything
larger than a Border collie.

55
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,069
- I can't believe this!
- What are you yapping about?

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,232
This book!
It's written by a man I knew.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,790
He's taken something
I told him in confidence

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,520
and turned it into this trash!

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,717
''Slow Tango''?
I've just started reading that.

60
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,395
You mean to tell me
that young man is based on you?

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,394
Yes. But did Thomas Jay Fallow
have the grace to thank me? No!

62
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,711
- Not even in the acknowledgements!
- What's it about?

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,952
- That is not important.
- His first time.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,519
- Thank you, Daphne!
- Your first time doing what?

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,833
Changing a flat tyre!

66
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,917
So this whole book's about
the night you conceived Frederick!

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,470
You'll be happy to know
that was not my first time.

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,234
And that it wasn't your only time!

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,434
- Who was this charitable lass?
- That is not important.

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,398
- His piano teacher.
- His piano teacher?

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,516
Thanks again, Daphne!

72
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,719
It's no secret.
It's all there in black and white.

73
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,269
About your awkward teenage lunging,

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,955
and how you used to call
your chest hair your ''rug of love''.

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,348
He did take some literary licence.

76
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,197
So you can't bring a woman to ecstasy
with your panther-like prowess?

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,279
That part he got right.

78
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,837
This really fries me. That woman
taking advantage of my kid.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,312
I paid $1 0 a week for piano lessons
so you could get your hedge trimmed.

80
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,918
Wait a minute!
Not Miss Warner?

81
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,516
This wasn't going on
during your lessons, too?

82
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,754
No, while Frasier was getting his
Rachmaninoffs, I was studying music!

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,629
Now, look! This was not some tawdry
older woman lusting after young flesh!

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,114
Clarice and I cared for each other.

85
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,238
She showed me a world
I'd never known.

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,475
And wouldn't know again
for six and a half years.

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,758
It's true. As Mr Fallow put it,
she saw your sensitive, poetic side

88
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,152
and you couldn't help noticing
how her bosom brushed your cheek

89
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,276
when she reached for the metronome.

90
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,638
How can a man who drank so heavily
remember so much?

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,436
- Yet forgets who told him the story.
- He'll get a little reminder today.

92
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,759
- No, no!
- I want it. Give it to me.

93
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,793
''I budded when you kissed me.

94
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,269
''I withered when you left me.

95
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,716
''I bloomed a few months
while you loved me.''

96
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,793
- Would you calm down?
- When I've exacted my pound of flesh.

97
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,916
Wait till I get my book signed.

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,799
- Let me. It's my story.
- Stop it!

99
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,669
You haven't told anyone?
They'd have a field day.

100
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,310
Frasier, give me credit
for a little discretion.

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,359
Hey, piano boy!
Way to pound those ivories!

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,999
Listen! It's imperative
that this not be commonly known.

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,355
Hey, Doc, it's no big deal.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,313
Anything for you? I've still got some
feeling on the other side of my head.

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,199
I had a similar experience
when I was 1 6.

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,955
An older woman introduced me
to the mysteries of love.

107
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,759
Of course, she was a hooker.

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,912
It was a birthday present
from my dad, OK?

109
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,870
Want to know the ironic thing?

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,713
All I wanted was a bike.

111
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,792
How could you expect me
not to tell anybody?

112
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,272
You can't keep something like that
bottled up. I only told one person.

113
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,159
- Hello, Frasier, Roz!
- Hi.

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,154
I was doing my restaurant review
this afternoon

115
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,632
when I came up with the
perfect sandwich, named after you:

116
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,756
Frasier Crane's Double Decker.

117
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,596
It consists of aged pheasant,
spring chicken and plenty of tongue.

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,432
Listen! ''I wept as our bodies
made the music of love.''

119
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,319
''I'm your rhapsody. Play me.''

120
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,870
''Crescendo, my young maestro,
crescendo.''

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,431
''My vessel yearns to dock
in the magnificence of your harbour.''

122
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,636
That's not in the book.

123
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,316
One thing I must ask you -

124
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,836
what was your inspiration
for this love story?

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,036
Ooh! It's his last chance!

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,151
It was actually given to me by God.

127
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,311
By God!

128
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,393
Do you believe his grandiosity?
I'm God, and he knows it!

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,712
We'll be back with the divinely inspired
Thomas Jay Fallow

130
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,916
right after this break.

131
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,276
Excuse me. I want to call my husband
and see if he can take a long lunch.

132
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,989
Thomas Jay Fallow.

133
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,157
Frasier!

134
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,788
Frasier Crane! I can't believe it!

135
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,839
I see my name hasn't entirely escaped
your sieve-like memory.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,879
- Why would it?
- It's not in your acknowledgements,

137
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,395
you egomaniacal thief!

138
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,835
You read my book!

139
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,228
I didn't have to read it. I lived it.

140
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,234
Not that anybody would know that
from your acknowledgements.

141
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,870
You mention your kindergarten teacher,
but not me!

142
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,838
I only gave you the story
which you have merchandised

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,675
into this $1 ,000,000 treacle machine!

144
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,589
I'm finished now.

145
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,916
I'm so sorry.

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,513
I don't know how I could have been
so thoughtless.

147
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,679
- I owe you everything!
- Oh, no, no!

148
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,838
Oh, my God! Frasier,
what did you do to the poor man?

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,391
- What happened?
- Frasier made him cry.

150
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,989
''Slow Tango'' has put thoughts
in Maris' head.

151
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,914
I found her cooing over the student
who skims the koi pond.

152
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,709
- I wouldn't concern myself.
- It's innocent flirting?

153
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,599
No. I just wouldn't concern myself.

154
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,756
- Hey, Frasier.
- Hi, Dad, Niles.

155
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,029
Congratulations. Maris heard Thomas
Fallow acknowledge his debt to you.

156
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,192
Yes, I had a chat with him
this afternoon.

157
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,432
- Was he properly contrite?
- I made him cry.

158
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,670
That's my boy!

159
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,954
You must be feeling pretty good.

160
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,398
Actually, the incident
has left me strangely unsatisfied.

161
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,914
I still feel sort of empty. I've been
turning it around in my mind all day.

162
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,358
You kill me. You got what you want
and you're still not happy.

163
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,910
Frasier, life is not hard.
You make it hard.

164
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,358
You don't just enjoy things.
You analyse everything.

165
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,873
(Eddie growls)

166
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,589
You could learn a big lesson
from this dog here.

167
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,309
You know what makes him happy?
A sock.

168
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,316
Come on, Eddie.

169
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,829
What's troubling you goes deeper
than your usual malaise.

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,356
- (Daphne ) Shame on you!
- What for?

171
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,590
You just ran out on her!

172
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,673
''Leaving her bed as empty
as a swallow's nest in fall.''

173
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,832
And you ask me what for!

174
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,793
I'd just been accepted to Harvard.

175
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,113
So you just leave in the night
without so much as a kiss.

176
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,034
- You never said goodbye?
- She was sleeping so peacefully.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,150
She had an early lesson.

178
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,116
I left a rose on her pillow.

179
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,990
- Aha.
- ''Aha'' what?

180
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,358
- ''Aha'' this: I have a theory.
- Why else would you say ''aha''?

181
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,513
You were angry at Thomas Fallow
for not thanking you

182
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,798
for your contribution to his life.
But you're really angry at yourself

183
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,589
for not thanking Miss Warner
for her contribution to your life.

184
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,273
I was only 1 7.
I'm sure she understood.

185
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,993
Perhaps she didn't. She was
vulnerable, lonely, middle-aged.

186
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,038
It's possible her feelings for you
ran deep,

187
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,512
feelings you crushed when you left
without a thank you or a goodbye.

188
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,240
Yes, well, thank you and goodbye.

189
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,078
All right. Fine.
I'll just leave you with this thought:

190
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,391
your encounter with Fallow
was unsatisfactory

191
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,516
because it didn't provide closure.

192
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,231
For that, you will have to make amends
with Miss Warner. Aha.

193
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,315
Very funny, Dad!

194
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,634
(Frasier)
''He had been a teenage Balboa,

195
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,113
''an explorer of the rising pinnacles
and gently curving slopes of my body.

196
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,078
''ln one explosive burst of discovery,

197
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,438
''he had staked claim to
the Pacific Ocean that was my soul.

198
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,870
''But now, he was leaving,

199
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,160
''going, vanishing, like
a solitary boat on the lonely horizon,

200
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,472
''departing like a train,
rolling ceaselessly through the night,

201
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,995
''exiting swiftly like...''

202
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,358
''And so, he was gone.''

203
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,478
''Now, in the cool of the evening,
I play my piano,

204
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,757
''and his last words
resonate through the notes:

205
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,953
''I'll come back to you,
my cherished one.'

206
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,115
''But he never did.

207
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,317
''And all that remains of him
are the withered petals

208
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,109
''of the rose he left upon my pillow.''

209
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,078
(''The Blue Danube'' plays)

210
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,631
Clarice.

211
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,237
Time, the subtle thief of youth.

212
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
Hello. May I help you?

213
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,239
- Ms Warner?
- Yes.

214
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,597
I... I'm Frasier Crane.

215
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,430
I'm sorry,
my memory's not what it used to be.

216
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,955
But, please, come in.

217
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,954
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, I would.

218
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,593
So, we know each other?

219
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,190
Well, we were friends.

220
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,276
More than friends.
You really don't remember?

221
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,477
I'm trying.

222
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,760
You must have some recollection
of a fair-haired boy outside your door?

223
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,356
At the piano?
On the piano?

224
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,711
No, I'm sorry.

225
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,076
Before the memories
come flooding back to you...

226
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,996
I should tell you we had a romance
that didn't have a happy ending.

227
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,588
That's why I'm here.

228
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,075
Our last evening together,
we walked through a summer storm

229
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,755
and I kissed the raindrops
off your nose

230
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,559
and promised we'd always be together.

231
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,028
But I broke that promise.

232
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,512
You helped a shy adolescent
take his first steps to becoming a man

233
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,151
and I repaid you by running off
and leaving you with just memories.

234
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,596
And not many of those, either.

235
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,309
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Oh, you're so sweet!

236
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,439
- Of course I can forgive you.
- Thank you.

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,433
It's such a relief
to get that off my chest.

238
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,639
- (Woman) 'Mother? I'm going now!'
- You run along, Clarice!

239
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,279
Clarice?

240
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,957
Excuse me.

241
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,636
Dear, this is Frasier Crane.

242
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,678
Apparently, we were
quite an item once.

243
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,919
Frasier Crane?
What are you doing here?

244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,753
Obviously,
making an enormous mistake.

245
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,678
Mother, would you get us
some iced tea?

246
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,999
She's getting rid of me,
but I'll be back.

247
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,077
My God!

248
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,629
I can't believe you're here.

249
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,270
- It's got to be 20...
- 25.

250
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,512
25 years!

251
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,271
And look at you!

252
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,000
Look at you! You look incredible.

253
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,038
Well, sure, compared to my mother.

254
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,954
No.

255
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,915
That's not what I mean.

256
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,832
You look...

257
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,829
- stunning.
- Well, thank you.

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,118
And you, you've become
a very handsome man.

259
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,995
- And successful, too.
- Thank you.

260
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,272
You're here because of that book,
aren't you?

261
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,671
Yes, and I'd like to apologise
right off.

262
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,838
I told that story in confidence.
lt was never meant to be in print.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,276
There's no need to apologise.

264
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,035
That was a lovely time in my life.

265
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,509
It was nice to relive it.

266
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,915
So...are you married?

267
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,155
- Divorced. You?
- I never married.

268
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,270
I came to apologise
about more than just the book.

269
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,910
I never felt quite right
about the way I left things.

270
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,272
I abandoned you.
It was selfish and cowardly.

271
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,479
Oh, Frasier, relax.

272
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,599
I always felt guilty for short-changing
you on your music lessons.

273
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,990
Do you still keep it up?

274
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,312
Oh, the piano? Yes.

275
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,512
I was so nervous about coming here
and now it just feels like old times.

276
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,516
Sit at middle C.

277
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,798
Then...the metronome.

278
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,995
(Metronome ticks)

279
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,355
I, well...
Maybe I should get going.

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,869
At the risk of sounding forward,
would you have a coffee with me?

281
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,640
Thanks, but I'll have to say no.

282
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,314
The age difference
is no longer an issue.

283
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,993
(Door knocks)

284
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,275
- Hi, honey. Ready to go?
- I'll be right out.

285
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,876
- Are you and he...?
- Uh-huh.

286
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,353
I wasn't interested in 40-year-old
men then and I guess I'm still not.

287
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,750
It's great to see you again, though.

288
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,558
Bye, Mom!

289
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,278
Good. Now we're alone.

290
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,715
See what I did?
I put a raindrop on my nose!

291
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,073
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

292
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,673
# Oh, my!

293
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,393
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

294
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,509
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

295
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,797
# They're calling again #

296
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,599
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
