00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,559 
"Stone Village Pikchers" is: 

2 
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,640 
Production Tayp Hey Films " 

3 
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:32,685 
"Tatira Ektiv" 
together with the "Grovenor Park Media." 

4 
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:04,046 
My parents knew from childhood not want. 
Aristocrats, blue blood, tightly-stuffed purses. 

5 
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:05,362 
You are expecting a boy or girl? 

6 
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,205 
We are satisfied with both. 

7 
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:12,078 
In their permanent house guests were kings, 
ministers and other power Province. 

8 
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,325 
They tended not to the yellow pages of newspapers. 

9 
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,243 
Therefore, they do not have 
against attention to the fact 

10 
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:22,644 
that was to be 
the most happy day in their lives. 

11 
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:24,440 
Derzhis, nice, you fare. 

12 
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:27,037 
O Lord! 

13 
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:47,766 
But according to local legend on the family Uilhern 
it was imposed curse. 

14 
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:56,038 
When my pra-pra-pra-pradeda Ralph 
coeur occurred with the Tale Clara, 

15 
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:04,118 
that soon became pregnant, he told 
his family plans to marry Clara 

16 
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,558 
and soon realized how stupid received. 

17 
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,919 
Clara, in the end, 
it was only a servant, 

18 
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:12,319 
at the same time prone 
to reckless act. 

19 
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:20,323 
Sir Ralph married at a particularly appropriate, 
but Clara jumped from cliffs. 

20 
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:28,756 
That night, mother Clara, Witch City, 
there Uilhernov front of the house, 

21 
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,642 
determined to complete fools these aristocrats. 

22 
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,644 
She nakoldovala on animal intestines, 

23 
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,484 
next to a daughter Uilhernov 
born with the men in black pig. 

24 
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:42,477 
And only when someone 
from your circle will say "yes" 

25 
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:47,557 
after "until death do not you razluchit" 
curse be lifted. 

26 
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:54,922 
Time went. 

27 
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:01,359 
They Fortunately, the next five 
Uilhernov born only sons, 

28 
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:05,159 
whose sons were born, too. 

29 
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,999 
And their sons-sons. 
And their sons-sons. 

30 
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:18,118 
Finally, Elly 
Hugh Leonard and the Uilherna born daughter. 

31 
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,835 
Century unrest proved unfounded. 

32 
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:28,995 
They, of course, did not know that Ella zachala 
not from Uilherna it zachala from Jones. 

33 
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:38,919 
That means 
that first daughter Uilherna I became. 

34 
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:57,723 
"Penelope." 

35 
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:08,679 
And Penelope, Penelope pretty expensive, 
I hope to find the woman left, 

36 
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:15,196 
who really understands me, 
I left all hope has not met you. 

37 
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,365 
I knew well. 
This is it. 

38 
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,206 
Very can be. 

39 
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:26,441 
Understand, much of life as you, 
I feel like in prison. 

40 
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,959 
The truth? 
And why? 

41 
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,365 
Because appearance and loudly name? 

42 
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:36,596 
That is true. 

43 
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:39,162 
It seems no one managed 
through this painless. 

44 
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:41,121 
None. 

45 
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:49,115 
And Penelope, dear, nice Penny, 
no matter, there is a curse or not. 

46 
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:53,923 
Yet I am more than appearance and name. 
And you, of course, too. 

47 
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:03,686 
Vpusti me. 
Oh, Penelope, vpusti me. 

48 
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,596 
No! 

49 
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,320 
Hello. 

50 
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:10,955 
What? 

51 
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,006 
Help, help. 

52 
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:20,877 
This is a pig. 
This is the real pig! 

53 
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,084 
Help somebody, help! 

54 
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,046 
Why, Penelope, why? 

55 
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,198 
As you can see, Mom, I have not escaped. 

56 
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:32,524 
Of course, dear, they ubegut, 
if both of them refused to walk. 

57 
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:37,965 
Do you think that I showed your cell 
his father birthmarks on the same third visits. 

58 
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,635 
No, dear, no, I was mad enough to wait 
until we pozhenimsya. 

59 
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:44,317 
I showed him no birthmarks, mama, 
I found him a person. 

60 
00:05:58,247 --> 00:05:59,566 
Mama. 

61 
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:08,086 
Oh, nice, you really liked him. 

62 
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,244 
No, Mama, do not like. 

63 
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:15,235 
No, it is not just like your nose. 
But you - it's not just the nose. 

64 
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:18,239 
But it is precisely in the men in black. 

65 
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:22,082 
No, this is your nose 
pra-pra-pra-pradeda by the father. 

66 
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:27,403 
He did this with you, with us. 
You and your nose is different things. 

67 
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,035 
You are not you. 

68 
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:35,317 
You are a different person inside you who 
waiting for the moment when the can go outdoors. 

69 
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:40,675 
For many years, reminded me, 
that I am not the only victim of a curse. 

70 
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,116 
A child with pig snout. 

71 
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:43,282 
Uilherny hiding. 

72 
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:44,842 
To begin ... 

73 
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,997 
Along with the birth of my 
aunt Ella eluded coeur. 

74 
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,920 
Be damned, Ella. 

75 
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:02,640 
But no one suffered more than my mother. 

76 
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,360 
This happens constantly. 

77 
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,436 
Who? 

78 
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,237 
And you know 
some are born with zhabrami? 

79 
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,316 
How? 

80 
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,006 
Since zhabrami, nice, as a fish. 

81 
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,926 
Oh! Oh! 
So you can cut? 

82 
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,566 
An interesting case. 

83 
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:21,601 
But sleepy artery passes directly through the nose. 
Or nozzle, as is the case here. 

84 
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,916 
Any intervention may become fatal. 

85 
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:29,803 
For ... , sleepy ... what you? 
What he, Franklin, as he said? 

86 
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:34,515 
She will die, nice. 
He said it will die. 

87 
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,280 
Sorry. 
Nozzle remain. 

88 
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:41,041 
Oh you ... 
This is not true. 

89 
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,001 
My mom had good intentions, 
very good. 

90 
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:51,605 
She had always done it, 
that thought fit to protect me. 

91 
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,760 
First of reporters. 

92 
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,364 
Oh, my eye, fifth, sixth. 

93 
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,402 
Because the public demanded Show 
my face, and this could lead to problems 

94 
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:06,966 
my mother did that to her place 
make any loving mother. 

95 
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,165 
She scenario my death. 

96 
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:13,281 
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 

97 
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,166 
I was cremation. 

98 
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:21,444 
As long as my people are mourning the tragic care, 
me securely hiding from the outside world. 

99 
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:27,081 
Now it remains only worry 
that, to protect me from my father, 

100 
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:30,564 
that hardly adapt 
the new morning's menu. 

101 
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:32,999 
Why not me bacon? 

102 
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,917 
Because we love bunting. 
Is Dad does not like bunting? 

103 
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,198 
No, I love bacon. 

104 
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,597 
And of insensitivity 
the new Jake Butler. 

105 
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:45,078 
This went on the market. 
And this little Gilt stayed home. 

106 
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,917 
And this kushala Rostbeef mumps, but ... 

107 
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,038 
Jake. 
Oh, Jake, ICAs. 

108 
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:52,962 
Poor child. 

109 
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:56,040 
And from time to time she had 
Protect me from the menu itself. 

110 
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,366 
So I mostly played 
in their room, 

111 
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:33,846 
smth and where a friend 
and learned to entertain themselves. 

112 
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,476 
Until my mother, not smykaya eyes, prepared me. 

113 
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:52,446 
Drafted me to the role of the bride for men 
that would obviate the incantation. 

114 
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,080 
Kehl etil op? (What time is it?) 

115 
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,767 
And in my eighteenth birthday 
she hired Wanda, 

116 
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,285 
marital agency which served 
the most privileged, 

117 
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,678 
elected representatives aristocracy. 

118 
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:08,126 
Hoping to find me one. 
My circle. 

119 
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:11,406 
Who would withdraw spell, 
My taking what I have. 

120 
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,202 
Hello. 

121 
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:25,160 
Following the resignation of them now invited to the house 
and keep suggested language for a tooth. 

122 
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,046 
So lasted long. 

123 
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,363 
And the mother took the time to understand 
the need for some amendments. 

124 
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:45,157 
Glass glass and shoes for Jake. 

125 
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,682 
Today ... 

126 
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,160 
This is a pig! 

127 
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,236 
... no different from the rest. 
Apart from the ... 

128 
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:55,721 
I have not drawn level with him. 

129 
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,441 
I always said that they should 
give the non-subscription 

130 
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,877 
before it will see. 
Not once. 

131 
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:03,236 
Do not worry. 
We poymaem it. 

132 
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:04,522 
Try. 

133 
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,240 
The police station. 

134 
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,561 
Nozzle? 

135 
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:12,796 
Yes. 

136 
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:19,483 
And fangs, understand? 
I know that I have seen clearly? 

137 
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,166 
So you arestuete it or not? 

138 
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,478 
On what basis? 
The girl was face-ache? 

139 
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:25,722 
If it was a crime deformities, 

140 
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,076 
I would have had to arrest 
half of the inhabitants of the city. 

141 
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:31,522 
I know what you think: Uilherny. 
Nice family, as well? 

142 
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,242 
I myself thought so. 

143 
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,884 
And when Penny mentioned the curse, 
I thought, it's simple metaphor. 

144 
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,444 
This is not a metaphor, and they do not loveable. 

145 
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:49,320 
I say to you: if I did not ubralsya time 
from there, this monster would remember me alive. 

146 
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,966 
Enough. 
Let ponochuet in obezyannike. 

147 
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,036 
Let us, friend. 

148 
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,122 
Who am I? 

149 
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,198 
You do not understand. 
I have a statement. 

150 
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,597 
It was not Vandermen? 

151 
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,600 
Yes. Edward. 
Svihnulsya guy. 

152 
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:04,516 
That must be it. 

153 
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:05,922 
None. 

154 
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,922 
You know that because Edward 
already should be home. 

155 
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:17,963 
Hey, anyone. 
Did anyone will call my mother? 

156 
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,077 
Vandermen-mladshy suffering from a nervous breakdown. 

157 
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,359 
Oh you! 

158 
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:55,045 
It is time to stand. 
Stand, stand. 

159 
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:59,364 
Let us, dear, we leave. 

160 
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:01,802 
Franklin! 

161 
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:03,756 
Mama? 

162 
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,076 
Rising, rising. 

163 
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,158 
- What? We leave? 
- Agha. 

164 
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,640 
Where Bontsa Larry? 
Huh? 

165 
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,561 
Protection. 

166 
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,084 
Poor Edward. 
I had no notions. 

167 
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,602 
No, not that. 

168 
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:27,278 
He prividelas abhorrent girl 
with pork snout. 

169 
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,642 
Huh? 

170 
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,280 
You know, they talk about the coma? 

171 
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,079 
Without the concept. 
This could be any woman in the city. 

172 
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,081 
I am waiting for the presidency of government. 

173 
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,242 
You understand 
as the story to affect me? 

174 
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:43,485 
With my father do? 

175 
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,636 
This is not my problem. 

176 
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,242 
Okay. 

177 
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:53,364 
I am not a raving lunatic, so it? 
So. 

178 
00:13:56,407 --> 00:14:05,122 
So you type or rebuttal, or I 
vypuschu you colorectal outside, one after another. 

179 
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,400 
Protection. 

180 
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:09,800 
All will be like twenty-five years ago. 

181 
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,766 
Again reporters will be to dart about, 
Penelope open secret, 

182 
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:15,959 
and then, and then that will be with us? 

183 
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:18,196 
We could move on the coast. 

184 
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:19,916 
Good idea. 

185 
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:20,956 
Or to France. 

186 
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,276 
You could popraktikovatsya in French. 

187 
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,920 
"I could popraktikovatsya in French. 
- Ugu. 

188 
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:31,003 
Mercy. Bonjour. Penelop syui same. 
(Spasibo. Good day. My name is Penny) 

189 
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:37,645 
Nothing, all normal. 
Wanda! Wanda! 

190 
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:43,078 
I demand rebuttal. 
You polomali me life. 

191 
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:46,644 
I say to you, it was a pig. 
Pigs. 

192 
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,355 
I say to you, it was pork snout, 
I am not crazy. 

193 
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,763 
Why no one believes me? 

194 
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,007 
To wait a little. 
Pogodite-ka, Wick, Victor. 

195 
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:00,163 
I think this person will with me. 

196 
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,006 
Who? 
I? 

197 
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:07,083 
Okay. 
First-Hubert Straus. 

198 
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:08,756 
Okay. 
Who else? 

199 
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,236 
- Bo. 
- Excellent. 

200 
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:11,721 
- Jack. 
- Fine. 

201 
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,287 
- Ripper? 
Super - who else? 

202 
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,276 
Guess what? 

203 
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,199 
Why would I simply did not say: 
these are twelve men Trust me. 

204 
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,443 
Excellent, let's talk about the dowry. 
I think it needs to be doubled. 

205 
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:20,115 
If they now do not make my appearance, 

206 
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:21,601 
why do you think, 
that will help double the attached here? 

207 
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,162 
Well, you know, with this approach ... 

208 
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,204 
Yes, this is my approach, mama. 

209 
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:32,597 
This guy enormous potential. 
I know he is going to look at it. 

210 
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,842 
What do you think about it? 
He likes you? Huh? 

211 
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:39,839 
Oh, dear. 

212 
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:47,436 
I know, I know, this is not my face. 
This person is my pra-pra-pra-pradeda. 

213 
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,001 
And it is not me, and I am not he, and I, I did not. 

214 
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:52,635 
And never forgetting to do so. 

215 
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:11,037 
Because of this history, I lost the right eye 
and neither feature of this is not poimel. 

216 
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,242 
And this terrible woman 
still me in a nightmare. 

217 
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:15,482 
I think you will not see it. 

218 
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:18,406 
Hm-m. 
No, Penelope, her mother. 

219 
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:23,360 
The child only kraeshkom eye. 
I decided that I hallucinations. 

220 
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:25,843 
Well, thank God, even though I believe someone. 

221 
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:28,999 
Unfortunately, it 
I believe that you will not help us. 

222 
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,924 
We require evidence 
to wash stain on our reputation. 

223 
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,798 
Do you think you can go back? 

224 
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:43,566 
Oh, I do not ... I do not know. 
That is, if ... 

225 
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,235 
None. 

226 
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:52,555 
Sure? 
Only a snapshot. 

227 
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,525 
I did not go there. 

228 
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:59,757 
Okay. 
Naidu someone who will. 

229 
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:03,323 
Bring them to the agency, 
who sent you. 

230 
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,404 
No, they deal only 
with cash bags, with the aristocracy. 

231 
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,166 
This is part of a curse. 

232 
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,363 
I do not think 
which one of them will want to help us. 

233 
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:10,562 
They do not particularly need the money. 

234 
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,598 
Well, why? 
Sometimes even the aristocracy needed. 

235 
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:29,842 
Take. 

236 
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:32,516 
Bid. 

237 
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,686 
Let the losers cry. 

238 
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:39,600 
O features! 

239 
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:47,318 
Maxwell Kempion plays today? 

240 
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:50,400 
He won there. 
Five-table poker room. 

241 
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,164 
Hey, buddies, wait. 

242 
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,396 
I know you? 

243 
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:15,639 
No, but I know you. 
Held a small investigation. 

244 
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,682 
And, it seems, in several years 
you have to lose all state 

245 
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,606 
who created generations of your family. 

246 
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,716 
Hey, Follow, I can help you. 

247 
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,601 
You do not contacted so. 

248 
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,163 
Five thousand you satisfied? 

249 
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,805 
We need your signature on the last page. 
The standard contract of confidentiality. 

250 
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,765 
You are not telling, we are not talking. 

251 
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:43,801 
How urodliva this girl? 

252 
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:46,966 
I think young ladies waiting. 

253 
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,724 
This guy just takes time to me. 

254 
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,920 
Oh, it is here. 

255 
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:02,955 
Listen, sorry, that was late. 

256 
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,805 
Ok, let's. 
Remove the jacket. 

257 
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,918 
Okay. 

258 
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:09,996 
Hi! 

259 
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:12,203 
- Ok, listening? 
- Yes, yes. 

260 
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:14,443 
Camera-on lapel. 
- Agha. 

261 
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:16,365 
Equipment in the sleeve. 
Wear. 

262 
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,686 
Sitting on your excellent. 

263 
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:20,679 
To make the frame, simply raise a hand. 

264 
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:23,605 
Not now. 

265 
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:25,076 
Ok, sorry. 

266 
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,041 
Izvinyayu. 
You that have played all night? 

267 
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:31,399 
Yes, I have remained chips. 
Well, as I? 

268 
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,006 
Normally, gone. 

269 
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,639 
Oh, I ... 

270 
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:44,927 
Do not worry, I raise. 

271 
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:45,916 
And you ... 

272 
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,476 
I Kempion max. 
I was sent the agency. 

273 
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:51,725 
Oh yes, of course. 
Campion. 

274 
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,201 
That is true. 
Devil. 

275 
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:54,516 
Sorry? 

276 
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,365 
Devil. 

277 
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:21,316 
Devil damned. 

278 
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,403 
So, dear, we did as you requested. 
They are in the wings. 

279 
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:30,916 
Vse-vse? 

280 
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,162 
Yes. All. 

281 
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:35,319 
But I do not understand why you do not want 
talk to them one at a time. 

282 
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,166 
I have said to you, mama, 
so it would be easier to get rid of the weak links. 

283 
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:48,955 
Hello. 
I Penelope. 

284 
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:53,957 
And you must ... 
Do not stay at the tea? 

285 
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,081 
Jake! 

286 
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:01,802 
They run! 
Flee! 

287 
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:04,322 
They all saw it. 
They all saw it. 

288 
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:07,081 
Where is the max? 
Edward, seeing Max? 

289 
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:11,003 
Max can not see. 
It's not there. No Max. 

290 
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:25,435 
How could you? 

291 
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,161 
Just accelerated interchanges. 

292 
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:28,720 
Like piggishly behave? 

293 
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:30,042 
That alone gave birth. 

294 
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:31,362 
Should. 

295 
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,046 
This was the last. 

296 
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,563 
Where is your credit card? 
Come to the store. 

297 
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,885 
No, no, no, not you ... 
If you want more, I will send Jake. 

298 
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:42,443 
I am mature enough, 
to buy everything itself. 

299 
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,235 
And I zahvati cigarettes. 

300 
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,681 
Penny, another people. 
Just one. 

301 
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,997 
He, too, run. 
They always run away. 

302 
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,796 
How can you not accept this? 
I have seven years of watching their shiny heel resting. 

303 
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:59,198 
Even though you know that while I feel? 
Understand? 

304 
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:02,679 
Sorry, but we can not stop everything. 

305 
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:03,842 
No, it can. 

306 
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,242 
We can, 
because how would I either wanted to believe in it, 

307 
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:11,123 
that there is even one man, 
that does not flee, a man who ... 

308 
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:18,916 
Smiluysya over us, merciful God. 

309 
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,560 
He saw? 

310 
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:24,967 
Must be. 
He is here. 

311 
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:25,956 
Who is he? 

312 
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,116 
What is the difference, Idi. 

313 
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,641 
Yes, Idi. 

314 
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:33,722 
Devil. 

315 
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,556 
You still here? 

316 
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:43,639 
Yeah. 
Ah, yes. 

317 
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,036 
You saw? 

318 
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:47,242 
Videla? 

319 
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,402 
Not seen? 

320 
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:49,756 
Not seen? 

321 
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:50,836 
So you ... 

322 
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,116 
What am I? 

323 
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:53,442 
Do not confuse me. 

324 
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:55,000 
What? 
I confusing you? 

325 
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:56,716 
Why are you still here? 

326 
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,042 
All else? 

327 
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,325 
Ok, why you are here? 

328 
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,364 
Sorry, I withdraw? 

329 
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,521 
None. None. 

330 
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:12,162 
You Rokhema fan George? 

331 
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:14,556 
Who? 

332 
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:17,965 
You have his book in his pocket. 

333 
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,199 
And so you noticed. 

334 
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,763 
Well yes, yes, a different book. 

335 
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:30,721 
So you read it? 

336 
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:32,996 
Well yes. 

337 
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,082 
Strange. 

338 
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,919 
I thought 
this was the only preserved copy. 

339 
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:41,520 
You know, I want to read, 
but the library is closed permanently. 

340 
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:48,877 
And I saw that the first edition and decided 
that this should be something that lies ahead. 

341 
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,161 
So you stole it? 

342 
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:55,765 
Well yes, I stole it. 

343 
00:23:57,127 --> 00:23:58,765 
So you love money? 

344 
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:04,441 
I am very fond of money 
although they do not pay me to reciprocate. 

345 
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:06,605 
Maybe you simply not made for each other? 

346 
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,398 
There could be verified. 
If the damage brought. 

347 
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,999 
In one room 
three hundred and twenty-six first editions. 

348 
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:19,600 
Of these, three hundred faces 
more than fifty thousand. 

349 
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:26,762 
About a dozen more than twenty-five thousand, 
and, I fear, only one less than the hundreds. 

350 
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:28,636 
Only one? 

351 
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:30,764 
Little novel, 
written by a young man 

352 
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,759 
to whom nothing has been achieved. 

353 
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:36,355 
Yes you? 
Less than a hundred? 

354 
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:41,364 
I am afraid that case. 
And, I am afraid, it means that the time had come ... 

355 
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,761 
But that is your favorite. 

356 
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:44,476 
What? 

357 
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,320 
I said, this is your favorite? 

358 
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,801 
I have heard. 

359 
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:56,164 
Upper regiment, third on the left. 
"Moby Dick". 

360 
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:01,719 
This is the first edition. 
Wait until I leave, but not something you will see. 

361 
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:08,082 
Will see? What? 

362 
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:16,566 
Au, Au. 

363 
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:44,566 
Get. 

364 
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,675 
No? 

365 
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:55,762 
Penelope? 

366 
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:05,920 
Penelope? 

367 
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,406 
You have to give tomorrow? 

368 
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:34,717 
I knew well. 
I know that you are here. Yes. 

369 
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:45,440 
He will return. 

370 
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,116 
Come back. 

371 
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:51,716 
Hello. 

372 
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,122 
Well? 

373 
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:54,362 
Oops. 

374 
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,763 
How could you not get? 
Half the men in this city ... 

375 
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:59,317 
Relax, I will come back tomorrow. 

376 
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:02,124 
O door. 
Try. 

377 
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,202 
See you tomorrow. 

378 
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,202 
See you. 

379 
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,763 
Honey, what happened? 

380 
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:29,316 
I thought he knew 
but he just saw an inscription. 

381 
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,918 
Penelope likes George Rokhema. 

382 
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:33,726 
But he also chose her. 

383 
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:36,879 
Of the two thousand books, he has chosen a single, 
which you are loved. 

384 
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:45,802 
You play? 

385 
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,199 
Ideally you would stop it. 

386 
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:51,796 
You play? 

387 
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:54,885 
At this? 
No, although I always like. 

388 
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:57,206 
But you are in fact something to play. 

389 
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:00,921 
Why are you so decided? 

390 
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:02,721 
What do you play? 

391 
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:08,596 
Guess. 

392 
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,041 
This is really necessary? 

393 
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:14,521 
She is looking for his instrument. 

394 
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,598 
Is not the man to do so? 

395 
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:19,195 
And again, and two, and again. 

396 
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:27,440 
You are my sunshine, you are my light at the window, 
prinosish me happiness when there is no sun. 

397 
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:31,444 
And you do not know how you want me ... 

398 
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:32,762 
You even on this play? 

399 
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:35,682 
Not otnimayte my sunlight. 

400 
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,320 
Ok, enough is enough. 
Ok, it is not bass. 

401 
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:38,476 
No? No? 

402 
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:39,796 
Try drums. 

403 
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:40,916 
Okay. 

404 
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,845 
Sunshine. 

405 
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,519 
Not otnimayte my sunlight. 

406 
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:56,077 
Ok, Ok. 
No More drums. 

407 
00:29:56,407 --> 00:29:57,681 
No? 

408 
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,605 
Without drums, clearly not drums. 

409 
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:02,236 
Okay. 

410 
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:04,006 
A saxophone, saxophone! 

411 
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:05,995 
Do you want Sachs? 

412 
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:13,640 
Once, two times, two ... 

413 
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:22,001 
Enough! Enough! 
Enough! Enough. 

414 
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:25,078 
No? 

415 
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,436 
Try guitar. 

416 
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:30,318 
Guitar. Guitar. 
It should be a guitar. 

417 
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,682 
Not sure that the guitar play that way. 

418 
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:45,355 
You are my sunshine, you are my light at the window, 
prinosish me happiness when there is no sun. 

419 
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:54,525 
And you do not know how you want me ... 
Not otnimayte my sun light .... 

420 
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:57,522 
Ok, enough is enough. 
Stop. 

421 
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:00,759 
Stop. 
Please ostanovis. 

422 
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,040 
Yes. 

423 
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,677 
About God. 
This was, it was awful. 

424 
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:08,162 
Thus, the people, pomashem, 
pomashem otvesim and Penelope cool. 

425 
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:10,325 
And cool. 

426 
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:14,880 
I know, I know guys, 
you also have hard, but you are fantastic. 

427 
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:16,522 
Thank you for all the great. 

428 
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:17,995 
Weather, weather, I still do not succeed. 

429 
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:21,836 
Ok, enough with me. 
You play what? 

430 
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,963 
Do you want to be the garden ... by whom? 

431 
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:29,682 
For plants. 

432 
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:31,519 
Know? 
Those who work with plants. 

433 
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,002 
Clearly. 

434 
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:34,882 
What's funny? 

435 
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,606 
No, the plants are healthy. 

436 
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,402 
You simply more 
police came to work. 

437 
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:42,083 
You know, after 
as you arranged all these interrogations. 

438 
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,679 
Shut, your turn. 

439 
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:47,080 
Okay. 

440 
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,760 
Oh, you did not happen because of this. 

441 
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:51,441 
Why not? 

442 
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:52,802 
Because I am renting it. 

443 
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,122 
And I will ask if there is not? 

444 
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,483 
Anyway renting. 
Naprashivaeshsya himself. 

445 
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:00,798 
For example, beer. 
Never saw beer? 

446 
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,640 
Why, saw. 

447 
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:03,756 
Draft? 

448 
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,156 
No, no. 

449 
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:06,402 
So, never saw. 

450 
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,161 
Knight does not go. 

451 
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,556 
Knight? 

452 
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,836 
Horse. 

453 
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:12,236 
Ok. 

454 
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:17,241 
How about that walk together 
in the pub "Kloverdilli now? 

455 
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,006 
Pub "Kloverdilli"? 

456 
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:22,404 
Yes. Best beer, 
Better Blues, the best gam in the city. 

457 
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,120 
Thank you can, then. 

458 
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:31,760 
Penelope, I forgot. 
Hey? 

459 
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,398 
Let us, 
the same must hold from time to time. 

460 
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:43,281 
So it? 
What do you expect? 

461 
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:05,880 
A. .. 
You know, in truth you lose a little. 

462 
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:12,279 
The truth? 
Pub "Kloverdilli" sounds tempting. 

463 
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,239 
Yes, but better zamnem. 

464 
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,562 
A fair? 

465 
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,998 
I have heard, 
selling in the streets remarkable things. 

466 
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:22,198 
You know, 
sellers also remarkable of its kind. 

467 
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:23,921 
Oh, a park? 

468 
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:25,920 
Park just super. 

469 
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:31,842 
I once visited there every weekend, 
sitting on the bench, stupid wrote songs about love. 

470 
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:34,399 
There have been? 
More than byvaesh? 

471 
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,406 
None. 

472 
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:40,601 
And what do you do instead? 

473 
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,757 
Obygryvayu you in chess. 

474 
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,480 
I said I need to renting. 

475 
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,561 
Well, cool, because, 
as soon as my kids will see what you did ... 

476 
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,246 
The game is finished, I am renting your queen. 

477 
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:57,120 
But korol-to still alive, but? 

478 
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,641 
Without the queen, King unprotected. 

479 
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:01,476 
Why is this? 

480 
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:05,117 
I do not know. 
Maybe not for combat forces. 

481 
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:07,240 
King really liked the Queen, you know? 

482 
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:12,366 
Yes, it is understandable. 

483 
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,677 
My Queen against thy. 
Shah and mat. 

484 
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:41,245 
Lord, what this guy? 

485 
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,166 
I have a slow time. 

486 
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:46,966 
It is specifically. 
Because of the dowry. 

487 
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,562 
I would like to find myself a girl with a dowry. 

488 
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,235 
Give me a chance. 

489 
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:55,127 
What can you delay so? 
I opened it immediately. 

490 
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:57,955 
You know what? 
You like it more. 

491 
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:02,445 
Why sweat because of the five thousand, 
if you can get five? 

492 
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:04,076 
Maybe you forgot? 

493 
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,647 
I saw it. 
It is a monster. 

494 
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,682 
Putting it. 

495 
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:10,156 
I say, it does not potseluesh. 
An ugly, terrible, abominable. 

496 
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,200 
Listen, you verme. 

497 
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:16,444

498 
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,238 
Lord, he liznul me. 

499 
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:20,716 
- Edward. 
- What? 

500 
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,401 
Not Max-skiing. 
- Sorry. 

501 
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:26,719 
Listen, you can not blame us for having 
we approached. 

502 
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,036 
Excellent, find someone else. 

503 
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:29,396 
Excellent, faithful us money. 

504 
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:47,482 
It starts, starts. 
Turn down a bit. 

505 
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:54,080 
Thus, realized piano. 
You play the piano. 

506 
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,676 
I now head to amputation. 

507 
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:56,996 
Okay. 

508 
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:58,925 
Please, never spor with a player. 
Yes. 

509 
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:04,881 
He had another jacket? 

510 
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,080 
And again, and two, and again. 

511 
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:27,677 
You are my sunshine, you are my light at the window, 
prinosish me happiness when there is no sun. 

512 
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:29,600 
No, si-bemole. 

513 
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:32,958 
You are my sun. 

514 
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:34,356 
B flat right. 

515 
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,523 
You are my light in the window. 

516 
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,201 
No, right. 

517 
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:44,802 
Okay. 
You are my sun. 

518 
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:51,163 
You are my light at the window, prinosish me ...

00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:55,124 
Understand, left hand remains fixed, 
podbiraesh a right chord. 

520 
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:57,486 
You are my ... 

521 
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:01,516 
Clearly? 

522 
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,086 
Yes, yes, so much the better. 

523 
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,316 
Devil. 

524 
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:46,642 
I monster. 

525 
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,798 
None. 
This is not true, Penelope. None. 

526 
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:04,164 
Penelope! Stand with Max. 
Pretty please, do not, do not. 

527 
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:07,237 
I said, I told you. 

528 
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,239 
No, you escaped. 
This time it was you. 

529 
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:10,436 
He said: "similarities". 

530 
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:11,487 
And similarities with him. 

531 
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:12,476 
I said it twice features. 

532 
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:16,236 
And then just stood there and stared at me. 
So nobody has done before. 

533 
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:18,558 
If you only gave bednyazhke 
chance accustomed. 

534 
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:22,840 
That is, Put yourself on ... 
What do you do? 

535 
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:23,876 
What? 

536 
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:24,962 
I said to stay with it. 

537 
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:26,036 
Is it? 
I have not heard, not heard. 

538 
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:32,446 
When you said: "Stand, Max" ... 

539 
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,120 
I said: "Stand with Max." 

540 
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,686 
You do not say: "Wanda, stay with him." 

541 
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:37,002 
I said. 

542 
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,566 
Sorry, I did not hear. 

543 
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:46,322 
Mama. 

544 
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,319 
Do not worry, dear, he could not go far. 

545 
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:51,756 
Well made? 

546 
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:53,640 
Yes, yes, did. 

547 
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,563 
Hey, I want these pictures. 

548 
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:00,723 
It is not what Edward talked about it. 
Leave her alone. 

549 
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:05,360 
Lemón? Oh! 

550 
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:08,642 
Who is this? 

551 
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:09,676 
Close the gate. 

552 
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:11,645 
None. No, there is no need not close the gate! 

553 
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:19,962 
Penelope! 

554 
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,236 
Max? 

555 
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:22,961 
Penelope, I have to tell you something! 

556 
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,007 
No, he spies. 

557 
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:25,042 
No, that is yes. 

558 
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,404 
He works at the Lemon, the reporter, 
that prompted me to bury you. 

559 
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,642 
You told me cremation. 

560 
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:30,676 
And cremation. 

561 
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,356 
I hope you are well paid, because 
you can bid farewell to their condition. 

562 
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:34,882 
Wait. 

563 
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:37,322 
We still have a chance, 
he can still lift curse. 

564 
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:41,722 
Max, I know that person you offs. 

565 
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:45,676 
And I can not dream that 
that you took it ... 

566 
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:46,996 
No, no, no, Penelope. 

567 
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:48,082 
But this is not me. 

568 
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:51,040 
This, I internally, 
and just waiting for graduation outdoors. 

569 
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:56,637 
And you can help this. 
When the curse will be lifted, I would become like all. 

570 
00:39:57,247 --> 00:40:00,603 
And if not? 
And if not curse away? 

571 
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:03,080 
What if it could not withdraw altogether? 

572 
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,156 
So I end with a. 
I promise. 

573 
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:07,795 
I break them. 

574 
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:14,637 
Married to me, Max. 
Married to me. 

575 
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:25,362 
I can not. 

576 
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:30,876 
Get out. 

577 
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:32,836 
Y. .. 

578 
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,236 
Get out. 

579 
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,159 
Get out won. 
Immediately. 

580 
00:41:01,407 --> 00:41:03,079 
So, that is what we will do. 

581 
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:07,124 
I feel, 
as thousands of abandoned women at the same time. 

582 
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:13,039 
We were not through such. 
Penny, may try again? 

583 
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:20,517 
I do not sdamsya, dear. 
Never, Penelope. 

584 
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:25,165 
Never, Penelope. 

585 
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,322 
I chuyala heart ... 

586 
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:28,355 
Never. 

587 
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,160 
As it seriously. 

588 
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,438 
We both always known that there is no guarantee. 

589 
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:43,127 
We both did not know that there is no guarantee. 

590 
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:45,876 
We trained her for so long for the day 
when all was to change 

591 
00:42:46,407 --> 00:42:49,240 
and not trained to 
all that will remain. 

592 
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:55,527 
Maybe 
enough go marry and give her puppy, but? 

593 
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:01,245 
Expensive? 
Penelope, it is you? 

594 
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:03,399 
Yes, Mom, I have to prepare myself cocoa. 

595 
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,361 
Okay. 

596 
00:43:07,887 --> 00:43:09,639 
Puppy. 

597 
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,277 
Okay. 

598 
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:18,117 
And what do I say? 
Sorry, that contacted me. 

599 
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:22,002 
Sorry that you plunged into it. 
I know I have a bad heredity. 

600 
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:24,602 
I am one of Uilhernov. 
And I know that. 

601 
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:27,243 
Curse at me. 
And I have a curse. 

602 
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:29,643 
That I, I, I, me. I, Y. 

603 
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:33,726 
Dear, dear, dear, I think 
your daddy, too, would prigodilos cocoa. 

604 
00:43:35,327 --> 00:43:36,601 
Okay, Mom. 

605 
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:43,960 
Yes, and I would not refused from the calyx. 

606 
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:48,875 
Penelope? 

607 
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,925 
Penelope! 

608 
00:44:35,287 --> 00:44:36,515 
She ran away. 

609 
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:38,921 
Gone. 

610 
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:40,276 
Lord, it just has me. 

611 
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:41,556 
You must commit itself to hand. 

612 
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:43,606 
Okay. 

613 
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:14,236 
What do you do? 

614 
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:16,597 
We need help. 
Yes, I would like to announce my daughter wanted. 

615 
00:45:16,887 --> 00:45:18,605 
You have that in mind down? 
And if it will? 

616 
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:20,681 
And so I insisted, Jessica. 

617 
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:50,846 
I need the toilet, went with me. 
I can not leave you alone with your phone. 

618 
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:55,240 
You know, dear, before I would be happy 
praised for such a proposal, but not now. 

619 
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:03,522 
Hello. 

620 
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:04,636 
Mama. 

621 
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:05,802 
Stay on the line. 

622 
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:07,122 
Mama? 

623 
00:47:07,247 --> 00:47:08,236 
Call for your account of Penelope. 

624 
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,356 
Yes, we agree. 

625 
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:10,682 
Mama? 

626 
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,887 
You can say it. 

627 
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:12,956 
Hello. 

628 
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,522 
Penelope that damned, you arranged? 
You saw someone? 

629 
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:17,160 
No, Mama, no. 

630 
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:18,681 
Okay, fine. 
Where are you? 

631 
00:47:18,887 --> 00:47:19,922

632 
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:24,518 
I call just to say, 
that love you and farewell. 

633 
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:26,202 
Penelope, do not ... 

634 
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:34,199 
At least we know 
that it all in order. 

635 
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:38,765 
And you do not need the toilet? 

636 
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,486 
No, dear. 
No need. 

637 
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:55,762 
Thank you. 

638 
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:57,122 
Enjoy the evening. 

639 
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:07,600 
Well, thank you much. 

640 
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:15,320 
I can you register? 

641 
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,803 
Hello. 
Can I room? 

642 
00:48:24,247 --> 00:48:26,442 
Of course. 
Number eight is free. 

643 
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:27,955 
Thank you. 

644 
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,246 
So you need a room? 

645 
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,405 
Yes, I, I need a number. 

646 
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:36,764 
In such a case, you would not be able to come, 
so that I can register you. 

647 
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:40,556 
Thank you. 

648 
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:42,081 
How will you pay for the room? 

649 
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:48,719 
Thank you, Jessica. 

650 
00:49:31,207 --> 00:49:33,767 
Ok. I zakruglyayus, guys.

More nostril. 
As snout. 

652 
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:53,998 
Hey, Hey, guys. Enough. 
Let's round off. 

653 
00:49:54,247 --> 00:49:55,236 
And such OSCAL. 
Yes, yes. 

654 
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,683 
Dates deadlines. 
Print need. 

655 
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:00,326 
Even worse, worse. 

656 
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:01,676 
Ivande Mona Lisa. 
Faster. 

657 
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:08,562 
Your newspaper, Madame. 

658 
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:09,796 
Thank you, Jake. 

659 
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:12,565 
Lord God, a-a-ah. 

660 
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:16,962 
You saw this pig? 
Five thousand dollars for the photos.

661 
00:50:17,487 --> 00:50:18,476 
The devil, Edward. 

662 
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:19,762 
Pope, they all think that I am crazy. 

663 
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:21,235 
And what? 
Help? Huh? 

664 
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:30,278 
You also mentioned, I thought it proves. 
Try to remember, I am your son. 

665 
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:32,638 
I would just like to forget about it. 

666 
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:01,485 
Thank you, ma'am. 
God? 

667 
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,237 
Well, how are you doing in this great day? 

668 
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:12,800 
I thought you went home. 

669 
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:13,922 
So I did. 

670 
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,646 
Pospal eight hours, 
children prepared breakfast, 

671 
00:51:15,927 --> 00:51:21,160 
kiss goodbye to his wife, 
and apparently you raise. 

672 
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:26,841 
So you put? 

673 
00:51:29,807 --> 00:51:31,240 
Do you play or not? 

674 
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:34,240 
He is survived chips. 
He plays. 

675 
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:42,522 
Let him think. 
He plays, it should be easy to think. 

676 
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:45,883 
Give else. 
Bleach great. 

677 
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:50,686 
He is survived chips. 
He plays. 

678 
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:37,038 
To begin, I want a photograph. 

679 
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,236 
No photos. 

680 
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:39,276 
Generally, no? 

681 
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:41,318 
None. 
All burned. 

682 
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:45,162 
Then a detailed description. 

683 
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:48,640 
Chestnut hair ... 

684 
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:49,722 
M hm-m. 

685 
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:52,600 
Chestnut hair, Agha. 
Karim eye. 

686 
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:54,639 
Yeah. 

687 
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:58,402 
Drawing attention to appearances. 

688 
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:00,520 
As a pig. 

689 
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:02,362 
That is it complete. 

690 
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:03,642 
Not quite. 

691 
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,485 
Jessica. 
Only not with humans. 

692 
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:07,844 
Not glupi. 
He knows that this nevserez. 

693 
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:09,082 
This is not so, Madame. 

694 
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,755 
I could not say anything, 
but I have all recorded. 

695 
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:14,319 
So therefore, it is not complete. 

696 
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,518 
What is the significance? 
Just find it. 

697 
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:20,444 
Our daughter is unclear where, 
it Falcons and terrified. 

698 
00:53:22,207 --> 00:53:24,198 
Sex shop "Ekstsentrik." 

699 
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:40,841 
You did not give me any information. 
No photos, no friends, no work. Neither appearances. 

700 
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:43,118 
About the case, but without canines. 

701 
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:44,676 
Franklin! 

702 
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:46,115 
Do you want to find it, or not? 

703 
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:50,837 
But without canines. 
They would indeed be thrown into the eyes. 

704 
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:53,605 
Jake, purse. 

705 
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,116 
G-r-r-r. 

706 
00:53:57,007 --> 00:53:58,440 
Guess what? 
Do not take in the head. 

707 
00:53:59,007 --> 00:54:03,762 
What we need you? 
Where is my ... Who took my wallet? 

708 
00:54:29,047 --> 00:54:30,196 
This is our daughter. 

709 
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:32,882 
Please help us, 
please, I ask you. 

710 
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,882 
He asked, 
you gave us the keys immediately. 

711 
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:37,442 
Sorry. but ... 

712 
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:40,081 
Rooms designed for me. 
Paid my credit card. Who resident? 

713 
00:54:40,287 --> 00:54:41,766 
J. 
I am your customer. 

714 
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:50,756 
You two, ahead. 
I am not an expert on the canine. 

715 
00:54:57,967 --> 00:55:00,435 
At least, she did not die from hunger. 

716 
00:55:28,807 --> 00:55:31,480 
No, no, not just any pig. 

717 
00:55:31,847 --> 00:55:34,759 
Okay. Yes. 
Better stop talking. 

718 
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,236 
Hello? 

719 
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:40,966 
Yes, exactly. 

720 
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:45,366 
Penelope? 

721 
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:47,042 
Who is this? 

722 
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:51,039 
It was Penny from ... From ... 

723 
00:55:54,127 --> 00:55:55,321 
Sale snapshot? 

724 
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:56,642 
Ehh. 

725 
00:55:57,567 --> 00:56:03,278 
Then why hanged tube? 
Edward, what ... what's wrong? Are you that ... 

726 
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:04,596 
None. 

727 
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:07,801 
Okay. 

728 
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,046 
Penelope. 

729 
00:56:15,527 --> 00:56:16,642 
How did you find out that I am? 

730 
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:18,764 
Just guessed. 
Do you have something to sell us? 

731 
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:20,446 
Yes, there is. 

732 
00:56:20,807 --> 00:56:22,718 
May I ask why you are doing this? 

733 
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:24,076 
Not your business. 
Yet you need ugly. 

734 
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:27,283 
No one said "ugly". 

735 
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:29,120 
So you need them or not? 

736 
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:30,636 
Yes. Absolutely. 

737 
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:33,118 
Yes, yes. 
Thank you. 

738 
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:38,881 
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,680 
Look grandmother, pig.

00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:09,595 
Very nice. 

741 
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:10,203 
Fangs? 
There is no canines. 

742 
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:18,879 
Must be they rooted in the skull. 

743 
00:58:19,127 --> 00:58:23,325 
Edward, I thought a lot about it. 
You know, I know. Maybe enough. 

744 
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:27,760 
Lemón half of the residents 
the city considers me insane. 

745 
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:32,602 
I must prove that it is not. 
Sorry. 

746 
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:34,881 
I must do it. 

747 
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:41,842 
Ladies and gentlemen, the girl with pig snout. 
See? 

748 
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:44,840 
I am not crazy. 

749 
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:48,119 
I crazy? 
No, not crazy. 

750 
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:49,921 
The girl with pig snout. 

751 
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:52,246 
It is the truth! 
Penelope free! 

752 
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,005 
She issued themselves, but why? 
Where is it? 

753 
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,598 
Does she like? 
Or it hryushka only in the city? 

754 
00:59:01,687 --> 00:59:03,166 
You were right. 

755 
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:09,725 
Kloverdilli. 

756 
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:16,441 
What you like? 

757 
00:59:17,047 --> 00:59:18,685 
Draft beer, please. 

758 
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:23,485 
Of course. No problem. 
Now will. 

759 
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:28,401 
You were supposed to catch. 

760 
00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:30,120 
Oops, sorry. 

761 
00:59:33,127 --> 00:59:34,116 
Now ready? 

762 
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:37,435 
Another thing. 

763 
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:38,961 
Thank you. 

764 
00:59:42,767 --> 00:59:43,836 
Some problems? 

765 
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:47,526 
Do you have toddlers? 

766 
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:51,886 
Absolutely. 
Please. 

767 
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:09,001 
This is half of what you gave me. 
The rest get when I can give. 

768 
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:10,886 
Maybe kvity? 

769 
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:14,005 
No, kvity. 
It is not because of what can be traded. 

770 
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:15,726 
She sold me a snapshot of herself. 

771 
01:00:16,887 --> 01:00:22,405 
Yes, obviously, it is in itself. 
Strives for independence. 

772 
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:48,756 
Hi, Jack. 

773 
01:00:49,207 --> 01:00:50,242 
Annie. 

774 
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:51,800 
Lucky. 
Last order.

01:00:52,327 --> 01:00:53,362 
How are you? 

776 
01:00:53,647 --> 01:00:55,239 
You just ask you, or interesting? 

777 
01:00:55,687 --> 01:00:56,676 
Just ask alike. 

778 
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:57,956 
I am his "Vespu." 

779

781 
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:07,037 
As he could not see me? 
I have to "Vespe" latest model. 

782 
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:08,276 
Ha. 

783 
01:01:08,527 --> 01:01:10,757 
Is not such zametish? 
Zametish, so it? 

784 
01:01:11,007 --> 01:01:12,326

What? 

786 
01:01:13,687 --> 01:01:14,722 
Yes. 

787 
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:16,485 
Clearly? 
I am not to miss. 

788 
01:01:16,687 --> 01:01:18,086 
You have to navigate to it, Bill. 

789 
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:20,564 
The hour is late. 
Raspishis here. 

790 
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:22,921 
Billy moved to the suburbs. 

791 
01:01:23,007 --> 01:01:23,996 
Yes? 

792 
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:25,522 
Yes.

793 
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,080 
Yes. 
We would be with him it does not work. 

794 
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:28,481 
He was such a nerd, you know. 

795 
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:30,564 
Podumay himself, 
Is beggar will meet with me? 

796 
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,521 
If he does not Crazy, 
but with choknutymi I no longer meet. 

797 
01:01:33,927 --> 01:01:36,316 
If only it does not want itself. 
Clearly? 

798 
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:37,516 
Clearly. 

799 
01:01:37,887 --> 01:01:38,876 
Clearly? 

800 
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:40,036 
Clearly. 

801 
01:01:40,327 --> 01:01:41,760 
I did not hear her because of the pieces on the face. 

802 
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:43,600 
Astronomer. 

803 
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,005 
As usual. 
For my account. 

804 
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:48,963 
Thank you, Jack. 
You are the best. 

805 
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,600 
Your health. 

806 
01:01:58,327 --> 01:02:00,795 
Pryacheshsya from justice 
plastic or abortive operation? 

807 
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,201 
Plastic operation. 

808 
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:10,396 
And you do not know, coincidence 
how could such a cost? 

809 
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:12,356 
Absolutely nothing. 

810 
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:13,476 
Free? 

811 
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:14,596 
M h-m. 

812 
01:02:15,087 --> 01:02:19,000 
I just thought 
may I also worth something done? 

813 
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:20,556 
Operation at the nose? 

814 
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:23,356 
Well yes, like that. 
Only on the ears. 

815 
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:27,124 
They stick out to me a bit. 
I am not, of course, Penelope, but ... 

816 
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:30,883 
You have a beautiful ears, it is very beautiful. 
Just remarkable. 

817 
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:31,996 
Are you that napilas?

01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:33,156 
Napilas.

01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:37,043 
Hey, Jack, pour even my girlfriend with Scarf. 

820 
01:02:37,807 --> 01:02:38,796 
Beg. 

821 
01:02:41,127 --> 01:02:42,321 
What is a "Vespa"? 

822 
01:02:42,887 --> 01:02:45,447 
What? 
You never lift the "Vespe"? 

823 
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:50,200 
Hi, Sam, have not seen. 

824 
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:51,722 
Look who came. 

825 
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:55,284 
Listen, guys saw? 

826 
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:58,555 
They tour. 
There seems to have good prospects of the group. 

827 
01:02:58,887 --> 01:03:00,479 
Not to joke? 
This is cool. 

828 
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:02,242 
Why here again? 

829 
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,284 
Yes, so, you know, just prismatrivayus. 

830 
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,517 
In fact, the mere thought 
play can start again? 

831 
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:09,926 
Yes? 
Ok, good luck to you. 

832 
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:13,806 
Yes. Listen, Sam. 
I would not even asked if ... 

833 
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,044 
Are you that, to joke? 
After all your failures? 

834 
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,566 
Do not keep me for durak. 

835 
01:03:19,887 --> 01:03:22,640 
Listen, I am confused. 
Sorry. 

836 
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:26,840 
Say so, I have not been able to assess what had. 

837 
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:29,319 
And now appreciate? 

838 
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,480 
Now appreciate. 

839 
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:45,566 
For example, and not withdraw their scarves? 

840 
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:46,642 
None. 

841 
01:03:49,527 --> 01:03:50,926 
Well, Ok. 
Zalezay. 

842 
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:47,880 
Okay, let's put me to the end of the street. 

843 
01:04:57,687 --> 01:04:58,676 
Hey, Mozart. 

844 
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,807 
Listen, Sorry, it would not be repeated. 

845 
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:04,362 
Ok, traveled. 

846 
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:18,840 
So you can lose the whole person. 

847 
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:22,562 
My brother once was riding on a bicycle 
type and smashed into the parked car 

848 
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:25,879 
and so it has withdrawn from themselves 
the bonnet type of teeth and bleeding, 

849 
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:29,364 
he sat back on the bike 
and went to the cinema. 

850 
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:31,001 
Yeah. 
Oh, please. 

851 
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:35,476 
Veratrum eastern, stunning flowers. 
Lilac even in winter. 

852 
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,684 
Cool. 

853 
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:39,958 
Raised without assistance. 

854 
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:43,885 
Just as my former Bridesmaid, 
if you understand what my drift. 

855 
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,195 
Well yes. 

856 
01:05:46,727 --> 01:05:47,716 
You know it? 

857 
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:49,316 
Yes. 

858 
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:53,685 
The truth? 
Yes you did not understand? 

859 
01:05:54,727 --> 01:05:56,046 
More Talk. 

860 
01:05:57,847 --> 01:05:58,962 
Another card. 

861 
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,885 
I still. 
What's in it? 

862 
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:02,162 
Rides on the skaters. 

863 
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,402 
Enough, I am still. 

864 
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:04,562 
Circus. 

865 
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:05,802 
Many months have passed. 

866 
01:06:05,847 --> 01:06:06,836 
Zoo. 

867 
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:08,719 
How they can do it all, 
while remaining unnoticed? 

868 
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,243 
Oh, dear, what are we to do? 

869 
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:22,799 
This is her scarves, see. 

870 
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,436 
Penelope! 

871 
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:26,882 
Penelope! 

872 
01:06:27,127 --> 01:06:28,162 
Hey, Hey, Hey! 

873 
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:44,323 
No, it ran there. 

874 
01:06:55,647 --> 01:06:57,478 
Excellent, you are here. 
Your turn. 

875 
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:00,646 
Ok, sovrala, I buy. 

876 
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,566 
O Lord! 

877 
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:06,358 
Did anyone, remove it with scarves, 
she could not breathe! 

878 
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:07,762 
No, no! 

879 
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:16,680 
Hey, Penny. 

880 
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:47,356 
They did not run away. 

881 
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:54,681 
And, no! 
Penny, no, no, no, no, dear. 

882 
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:55,962 
Otvernis. 

883 
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:58,196 
It goes. 

884 
01:07:58,447 --> 01:07:59,482 
Here it is. 
Penny, here. 

885 
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:01,086 
This, Penelope. 

886 
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,806 
Penelope, Penelope. 

887 
01:08:03,047 --> 01:08:04,400 
The truth that you kept bound in the basement? 

888 
01:08:08,807 --> 01:08:10,001 
Not potakay them. 

889 
01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:11,926 
Penny, 
yet you have any pork bodies? 

890 
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:13,396 
None. 

891 
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,163 
With such a large nose, you obonyaete, 
probably better than we are. 

892 
01:08:16,447 --> 01:08:17,675 
I do not know, you highlight. 

893 
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:21,996 
Penelope. 

894 
01:08:22,287 --> 01:08:23,402 
Annie! 

895 
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:24,756 
Mama, can you lend a little? 
Money is running out. 

896 
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:26,201 
In no case, sending in a car. 

897 
01:08:27,087 --> 01:08:29,601 
Mama, they want to know 
whether related kept me in the cellar. 

898 
01:08:32,927 --> 01:08:35,566 
Three weeks is a long time. 
The operation at the bow is a Hemorrhoid. 

899 
01:08:37,407 --> 01:08:40,604 
No, of course not. 
So far, nice. 

900 
01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:43,960 
So far. 
Let there be so expensive. 

901 
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:45,566 
Penny, 
you want to say something the public? 

902 
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,280 
O, greetings. 

903 
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:49,686 
Penny said "Hi". 

904 
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:52,360 
Mayor: "Hi, Penelope." 

905 
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:55,837 
News Flash: City welcomes Penelope. 

906 
01:08:56,487 --> 01:08:58,045 
Scarves are sold every success. 

907 
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:01,163 
Bonjour: Penny said in French. 

908 
01:09:02,327 --> 01:09:04,204 
Penelope tree planting. 

909 
01:09:07,007 --> 01:09:11,922 
Pope, so what you say? 
I know I say that all I know. 

910 
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:16,599 
Was it, 
that you have been accusing Penelope in the attack? 

911 
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:18,406 
I got a police record. 

912 
01:09:18,767 --> 01:09:20,325 
No comment, ladies and gentlemen, 
without comment. 

913 
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:24,845 
Ok, I ulazhu. 
This woman, this creature, a place in the cell. 

914 
01:09:27,727 --> 01:09:28,716 
What bastard. 

915 
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:30,121 
Sorry. 

916 
01:09:33,487 --> 01:09:34,966 
You have that in mind down? 

917 
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:37,762 
You also saw it, it is a monster. 

918 
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:39,605 
The audience loves this girl. 

919 
01:09:40,367 --> 01:09:41,641 
They do not know her as I do. 

920 
01:09:41,847 --> 01:09:44,520 
Our shareholders, the ordinary people, 
and we like what he likes, Usec? 

921 
01:09:47,807 --> 01:09:48,796 
And what do you predlagaesh?

And what do you want me to do? 

924 
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,316 
Just ulad all. 

925 
01:09:58,007 --> 01:09:59,520 
Let us, Penelope, you are in my team. 

926 
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:01,046 
But I am a bad player. 

927 
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:05,440 
Penelope. Penny, Penny, Penny. 
Kill, I forgot. 

928 
01:10:15,247 --> 01:10:17,078 
I said. 
I am a bad player. 

929 
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:20,841 
Hello. 

930 
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:25,126 
Hello. 
You get on. 

931 
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:32,526 
That is, you look excellent. 
You look happy. 

932 
01:10:33,247 --> 01:10:34,316 
Thank you. 

933 
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,084 
You know, you inspired me. 

934 
01:10:39,567 --> 01:10:42,240 
When you are doing what you are doing, 
came as think fit, I, I did not ... 

935 
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:46,196 
I need to go. 

936 
01:10:46,407 --> 01:10:50,082 
Yes, of course. 
Y. .. I just ... 

937 
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:54,919 
Penelope, Penelope. 

938 
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:59,761 
Oh, nice, I am so glad that you found. 
You must be home immediately. 

939 
01:11:01,207 --> 01:11:02,845 
I have a great surprise for you. 

940 
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:03,996 
Mama, I need to go back. 

941 
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:05,566 
Penelope. 

942 
01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:07,396 
What is this? 

943 
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:11,196 
Simple, that I ran away from their feelings. 

944 
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:16,204 
And because of that you escaped? 
And I am sure that from me. 

945 
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:18,199 
Only because of my feelings for you. 

946 
01:11:18,847 --> 01:11:20,041 
This is a joke? 

947 
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:25,443 
Penelope not unizhay boy. 
Look at him, he could lift the curse. 

948 
01:11:25,647 --> 01:11:26,875 
Something has changed. 
Mama, I ... 

949 
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,236 
It simply can not imagine. 

950 
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:32,276 
Why? 
Because you are in all the newspapers? 

951 
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,245 
No, because I have friends. 

952 
01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:36,324 
This is not friends, dear, this is crazy. 

953 
01:11:36,807 --> 01:11:40,243 
You have heard: "Pigs speaks ten languages" 
"Oh, poglyadi, pig plays the piano." 

954 
01:11:40,647 --> 01:11:43,081 
For these people, you just 
speaking pig. 

955 
01:11:43,487 --> 01:11:45,205 
Speaking pig. 

956 
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:49,682 
Edward wants to marry you. 

957 
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:55,756 
Are you ready to lose 
single chance? 

958 
01:11:56,727 --> 01:11:59,844 
Single chance 
on a normal life? 

959 
01:12:09,247 --> 01:12:11,363 
You get me, Penelope? 

960 
01:12:14,327 --> 01:12:17,876 
Obrucheny. 
Edward Vandermen married Penelope. 

961 
01:12:24,447 --> 01:12:25,436 
Hey, Lemon. 

962 
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:26,596 
Yes? 

963 
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:31,204 
I think you can help me with the history 
Kempionom with Max, which I do. 

964 
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:33,316 
What history? 

965 
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:37,321 
Something type of Duke in the mud. 
Aristocrats become a bandit. 

966 
01:12:37,727 --> 01:12:39,957 
In looters? 
Yes Ok, Max Campion? 

967 
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,123 
Yes, I was just calling. 
He has already confessed. 

968 
01:12:44,967 --> 01:12:46,036 
What? 

969 
01:12:56,407 --> 01:12:57,442 
Lift. 

970 
01:13:01,087 --> 01:13:02,520 
You, a lawyer, who sent my mother? 

971 
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:04,519 
This is a mistake. 
I came to the max Kempionu. 

972 
01:13:05,007 --> 01:13:06,725 
Yes, greetings, I-Max Campion. 

973 
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:07,802 
No, you do not it. 

974 
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:08,876 
No, this is me. 

975 
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:10,401 
No, Max Campion. 

976 
01:13:10,607 --> 01:13:13,758 
I am not deaf, I hear you. 
I-Max Campion. 

977 
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:17,761 
But you ... 

978 
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,522 
O. O-o-o. 

979 
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:31,757 
Well, well, well. 
No, no. 

980 
01:13:32,127 --> 01:13:34,436 
What about the guy, 
that you play poker? 

981 
01:13:35,687 --> 01:13:41,080 
E-e, shaggy, medium build, 
does not know how to stop. 

982 
01:13:41,287 --> 01:13:44,167 
And, as is Johnny Martin. 

983 
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:45,156 
Johnny Martin? 

984 
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:46,846 
Johnny Martin. 
The complete lusers. 

985 
01:13:47,727 --> 01:13:50,560 
Record, Martin, in the Pirate shalmane. 

986 
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:55,436 
Okay. 

987 
01:13:55,687 --> 01:13:57,325 
And you have ... 

988 
01:14:14,007 --> 01:14:16,362 
It was so beautiful, 
so well, is it not? 

989 
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:18,247 
Yes, fine. 

990 
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:19,236 
Yes, it was perfect.

991 
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:20,356 
We necessarily have to repeat. 

992 
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:23,639 
And now that we have become almost family, 
I think this is just the beginning. 

993 
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:24,962 
Yes, I podgonyu limousines. 

994 
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,282 
Well, well, well. 

995 
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:28,681 
Can me my coat? 

996 
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:32,239 
Oh, Franklin, we always go in the same theater. 
Why stopped? 

997 
01:14:32,447 --> 01:14:33,926 
I think because of deformities daughter. 

998 
01:14:34,487 --> 01:14:39,607 
We all refused, 
because we have an ugly daughter. 

999 
01:14:39,967 --> 01:14:41,116 
May I help you, Sir. 

1000 
01:14:41,967 --> 01:14:42,956 
Thank you. 

1001 
01:14:44,407 --> 01:14:45,442 
It won there. 

1002 
01:14:45,687 --> 01:14:46,722 
Ok, go. 

1003 
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:47,756 
But my coat! 

1004 
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:49,116 
Buy you another. 

1005 
01:14:49,367 --> 01:14:51,881 
Edward, what you are doing, where are we going? 

1006 
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:52,956 
Hello. 

1007 
01:14:53,007 --> 01:14:54,042 
Max. 

1008 
01:14:54,087 --> 01:14:55,122 
Hi Penny. 

1009 
01:14:55,327 --> 01:14:56,316 
We are just going to leave. 

1010 
01:14:56,487 --> 01:14:57,476 
As the case, Edward? 

1011 
01:14:58,047 --> 01:14:59,036 
Not always. 

1012 
01:14:59,647 --> 01:15:03,322 
And before all this seemed absurd, 
and even omerzitelno. 

1013 
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,876 
That you are familiar? 

1014 
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,202 
Actually yes. 

1015 
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:07,760 
Choosing because it? 

1016 
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,886 
Yes there is, rather, Bedford. 
Furgonchik "Bedford." 

1017 
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:14,124 
Should. 
You little of what you have done with it. 

1018 
01:15:14,287 --> 01:15:15,322 
In the toilet quickly. 

1019 
01:15:15,607 --> 01:15:16,756 
Edward, I ... 

1020 
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:18,567 
Penny, Edward let himself pursue. 

1021 
01:15:18,567 --> 01:15:19,567 
But Mom ... 

1022 
01:15:19,567 --> 01:15:20,556 
I am sick of you. 

1023 
01:15:20,607 --> 01:15:25,886 
I give her what she wants. 
And I do not see it is willing to commit themselves. 

1024 
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:28,317 
Apart from that of you. 

1025 
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,596 
This ... 

1026 
01:15:29,847 --> 01:15:30,916 
- Are you ready? 
- It is not that. 

1027 
01:15:31,087 --> 01:15:32,236 
- It is in this. 
- It is not that. 

1028 
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:36,999 
Listen, if you want to go to her and say, 
that single person, 

1029 
01:15:37,247 --> 01:15:40,523 
she finished by saying "yes" 
still appearing from one thought that, 

1030 
01:15:40,847 --> 01:15:48,435 
to her kids, please 
but you do not happen to me pain, but it. 

1031 
01:16:02,967 --> 01:16:07,324 
Johnny Martin. 
Son plumbing. Huh? 

1032 
01:16:09,047 --> 01:16:10,321 
You have long searched for me. 

1033 
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:12,926 
You nadul me. 

1034 
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:23,721 
It seems 
in the end, you decide to give it a service. 

1035 
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:26,806 
Seen this? 

1036 
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:28,845 
Hr. 
Beautiful couple. 

1037 
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,526 
Yes, Penelope and the monster. 

1038 
01:16:31,527 --> 01:16:33,404 
They both get what want, so it? 

1039 
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:36,156 
I know that he gets. 
And what gets it? 

1040 
01:16:36,607 --> 01:16:40,486 
Day, who had been waiting all his life - 
the lifting of the curse. 

1041 
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:44,886 
Yet you do not have faith in it, right? 

1042 
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:46,036 
And you? 

1043 
01:16:46,127 --> 01:16:47,116 
None. 

1044 
01:16:47,327 --> 01:16:49,477 
No? 
Then that you driven all these years? 

1045 
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:53,756 
I do not know. 
Offended ego and lost an eye, I think. 

1046 
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:57,676 
Curse? 
Should. 

1047 
01:16:57,887 --> 01:16:59,081 
Yes. 
Who knows? 

1048 
01:16:59,287 --> 01:17:01,278 
After so much time for the poker table, 
you start to believe in everything. 

1049 
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:03,966 
It is not too late to stop Edward. 

1050 
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,284 
She wants it so. 

1051 
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:08,361 
Weather. 

1052 
01:17:08,567 --> 01:17:11,923 
If marriage-all you need, 
to remove the curse, why not you? 

1053 
01:17:12,607 --> 01:17:14,404 
You forgot. 
I do not max. 

1054 
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:15,636 
And? 

1055 
01:17:16,407 --> 01:17:17,840 
One of its terms ... 

1056 
01:17:40,807 --> 01:17:43,799 
Hey, here. 
I took a seat. Here is pure. 

1057 
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:45,646 
Hey, Annie, but you pohoroshela. 

1058 
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,116 
Weddings are cool, right? 

1059 
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,925 
Yes, especially strangers. 

1060 
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:55,396 
Exactly. 

1061 
01:17:55,607 --> 01:17:56,722 
Jessica, just a couple of words. 

1062 
01:17:57,087 --> 01:17:58,202 
Something happened? 

1063 
01:18:01,247 --> 01:18:02,805 
Edward A very gracious. 

1064 
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:05,639 
Mama, I am afraid vyrvet me. 

1065 
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:09,601 
Remember, just a few minutes 
the curse will be lifted. 

1066 
01:18:09,967 --> 01:18:13,323 
There is no curse. 
The only who are here - I cursed. 

1067 
01:18:20,727 --> 01:18:21,796 
To begin ... 

1068 
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:24,396 
Eye you lost fault of their own, damned. 
And what now? 

1069 
01:18:24,847 --> 01:18:26,200 
I. .. I just want to apologize. 

1070 
01:18:26,407 --> 01:18:31,003 
Apologies are not accepted. 
What? I have a wedding begins. 

1071 
01:18:32,847 --> 01:18:34,200 
Meet: John Martin. 

1072 
01:18:39,687 --> 01:18:41,040 
I said: no need to rush. 

1073 
01:18:41,247 --> 01:18:42,396 
This changes nothing. 

1074 
01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:45,916 
How can you say so? 
Not only Edward ... 

1075 
01:18:46,487 --> 01:18:48,318 
As you said herself, 
he does this round. 

1076 
01:18:48,967 --> 01:18:52,167 
Fine. 
What Max, or Johnny, or as it is? 

1077 
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,156 
With "how"? 

1078 
01:18:53,367 --> 01:18:54,959 
You do not think, 
that Penny has the right to know? 

1079 
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:56,475 
What? 
What he continually lied to it? 

1080 
01:18:56,687 --> 01:18:58,598 
What he loves her, 
but not being able to lift the curse. 

1081 
01:18:58,807 --> 01:19:00,001 
Yes it is to know why? 

1082 
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:03,843 
This is probably the only reason 
to which he said "no". 

1083 
01:19:04,687 --> 01:19:06,917 
I do not know, you do not know. 

1084 
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:10,000 
But if this is true, God bless him. 
He had been right. 

1085 
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:12,085 
The devil, Jessica, I will not be able to just ... 

1086 
01:19:12,367 --> 01:19:13,846 
Leave everything as it is. 

1087 
01:19:15,927 --> 01:19:18,087 
I am really happy for her. 
True, true. 

1088 
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,122 
Yes. 

1089 
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:20,481 
And you are glad for it, right? 

1090 
01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:21,802 
If she is happy, then I am happy. 

1091 
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:23,241 
Mama. I feel very stupid. 

1092 
01:19:23,487 --> 01:19:28,038 
You do not look stupid. 
Are you not look foolish. 

1093 
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:53,481 
Do you agree, Edward Vandermen,

1094 
01:19:54,007 --> 01:20:01,561 
to be with her in joy and sorrow, 
in wealth and poverty, sickness and health? 

1095 
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:09,926 
To love and care for it on that day, 
yet death is not razluchit you? 

1096 
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,640 
Yes. 

1097 
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:23,126 
And you, Penelope Uilhern, according to whether 
take Edward Humphrey Third Vandermena 

1098 
01:20:23,647 --> 01:20:26,878 
in legitimate husbands, 
to be with him in joy and sorrow, 

1099 
01:20:27,687 --> 01:20:33,637 
in wealth and poverty, sickness and health? 

1100 
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:42,197 
To love and care for it on that day, 
yet death is not razluchit you? 

1101 
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:49,241 
Penelope? 

1102 
01:20:58,287 --> 01:20:59,561 
None. 

1103 
01:21:00,487 --> 01:21:01,602 
None. 

1104 
01:21:08,567 --> 01:21:16,485 
Stay on the ground, everything is in place. 
Penny, the weather, Penelope, I stand. 

1105 
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:19,521 
Look at me. 

1106 
01:21:19,847 --> 01:21:20,836 
Watching. 
What's wrong, dear? 

1107 
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:22,202 
No, see me. 

1108 
01:21:22,407 --> 01:21:24,602 
No, I watch. 
I do not understand what's going on? 

1109 
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:28,244 
You ... Sorry. 

1110 
01:21:34,327 --> 01:21:35,726 
Penelope, it is too late. 

1111 
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:37,680 
Nice, mama. 

1112 
01:21:42,247 --> 01:21:43,726 
I said nice. 

1113 
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:46,841 
Honey, please, please. 

1114 
01:21:47,727 --> 01:21:50,241 
One is Your "yes", and will start a completely 
new life, and you will be very new. 

1115 
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:53,482 
But I do not want to become a new mother. 

1116 
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:56,042 
Honey, please, please. 

1117 
01:21:56,567 --> 01:21:58,319 
I imagine such likes what I eat. 

1118 
01:22:39,407 --> 01:22:40,999 
Penelope. 

1119 
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:10,004 
Penelope provizzhala no. 
Penelope disappears. Where is it? 

1120 
01:23:23,247 --> 01:23:24,475 
He no longer grow. 

1121 
01:23:25,887 --> 01:23:27,081 
And why do you think that ... 

1122 
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:31,195 
I feel the same, I remember that you are you. 

1123 
01:23:39,727 --> 01:23:44,039 
Oh, Penelope. 
One of your circle. 

1124 
01:23:44,807 --> 01:23:46,559 
I just assumed ... 

1125 
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:48,399 
No, we all know mother. 

1126 
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:50,718 
No, dear. None. 
Are you not understand? 

1127 
01:23:51,087 --> 01:23:54,397 
I could remove the curse of many years ago, 
if only I was a good mother 

1128 
01:23:54,607 --> 01:23:56,882 
and to give you all the love, 
where you had been denied. 

1129 
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,317 
You also did not know. 
Not aware. 

1130 
01:24:14,727 --> 01:24:15,876 
Look. 

1131 
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:20,242 
You know, nice, 
since sleepy artery is not there, 

1132 
01:24:20,647 --> 01:24:24,083 
I think it may be a little more correct. 

1133 
01:24:24,647 --> 01:24:26,444 
Podumay, as well? 

1134 
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:29,316 
Are you mad came down. 

1135 
01:24:31,727 --> 01:24:35,276 
This abnormally when a young woman is not 
want to fix anything in their appearance. 

1136 
01:24:36,687 --> 01:24:38,723 
This is a good idea, right? 
I am her mother. 

1137 
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:42,402 
That's what mothers and daughters behave. 
They give advice on appearance. 

1138 
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:45,084 
Still, I was sorry mum on the day. 

1139 
01:24:45,687 --> 01:24:47,245 
Why are you so otnosishsya to this? 
Now I am poor. 

1140 
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:50,045 
She was expecting so much change at once. 

1141 
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:51,436 
All went ashes. 

1142 
01:24:53,647 --> 01:24:56,798 
I was preparing to leave, 
and after twenty-five years of living with the family ... 

1143 
01:24:57,647 --> 01:25:00,445 
Jake, where you Trump? 
Jake, I say to thee. 

1144 
01:25:00,847 --> 01:25:02,405 
And why do you with your bag? 
Jake! 

1145 
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,162 
Not Hami. 
Povernis when I was chatting with you. 

1146 
01:25:06,447 --> 01:25:07,562 
It seems I ... 

1147 
01:25:15,767 --> 01:25:19,726 
Poplach. Poplach. So must .. 

1148 
01:25:54,327 --> 01:25:56,761 
But I have to be very 
to cope with these changes. 

1149 
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:03,440 
And while I lost the person who brought me 
so many problems, the world has not stood on the spot. 

1150 
01:26:03,847 --> 01:26:04,882 
Penelope is still not found. 

1151 
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:07,636 
Taxes are rising. 

1152 
01:26:08,887 --> 01:26:10,320 
In laundry malchik-gorilla found. 

1153 
01:26:11,527 --> 01:26:17,796 
I was determined to regain my "I" 
and always follow the cry of my heart ... 

1154 
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:20,323 
Look. 
My zatsvel Narcissus. 

1155 
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:22,359 
And I found chemeritsu. 

1156 
01:26:24,727 --> 01:26:26,001 
... and their conscience. 

1157 
01:26:28,127 --> 01:26:31,244 
Dear Edward, at the first day 
in the library, you said 

1158 
01:26:31,527 --> 01:26:34,166 
you are a major part of his life 
feel like in prison. 

1159 
01:26:34,687 --> 01:26:37,804 
In retrospect, I now believe 
you said that the heart of the net. 

1160 
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:40,835 
I am afraid that fought themselves 
with you on the day wrong. 

1161 
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:43,921 
I knew that you escape. 
I myself want this. 

1162 
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,635 
But perhaps 
if I had enough patience to listen to you, 

1163 
01:26:48,327 --> 01:26:50,238 
we would have found a way to help each other out. 

1164 
01:26:50,807 --> 01:26:52,479 
Sorry me. 

1165 
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:56,596 
I hope this letter and this obruchalnoe 
ring will find you in good health. 

1166 
01:27:03,327 --> 01:27:07,923 
Edward, Edward? 
Your father wants to know what you are doing there. 

1167 
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:11,686 
And then come Helouin. 

1168 
01:27:12,607 --> 01:27:15,963 
Thus, all beginning to ten minutes, 
so let us, wearing their costumes. 

1169 
01:27:16,327 --> 01:27:17,362 
Okay?

01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:19,327 
Pereodevaytes stroytes and at the entrance, 
quickly. 

1171 
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:20,316 
That to me. 

1172 
01:27:20,647 --> 01:27:21,966 
Hey. Hey, only without a fight. 

1173 
01:27:22,247 --> 01:27:23,396 
I can be, whom want. 

1174 
01:27:23,687 --> 01:27:25,439 
Girls, please. 

1175 
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:29,685 
But she also knew that I would be Penelope. 

1176 
01:27:30,847 --> 01:27:35,967 
Ok, girls, going out with class. 
Going out and stroytes. 

1177 
01:27:36,447 --> 01:27:38,802 
Let us, stroytes. 
Faster. 

1178 
01:27:40,207 --> 01:27:42,675 
Let us. 
Alice, nice, what's wrong? 

1179 
01:27:43,447 --> 01:27:48,043 
All odelis in Penelope, 
but I am frightened electric. 

1180 
01:27:48,407 --> 01:27:50,716 
And you know, I like the original. 

1181 
01:27:51,487 --> 01:27:54,718 
Well Ok, a nice, derzhis with me

Life or purse. 

1183 
01:28:00,527 --> 01:28:01,960 
All greetings. 

1184 
01:28:03,247 --> 01:28:04,885 
Oh, I like this, this is my favorite. 

1185 
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:06,805 
Hey, Jess, I think you enjoy it. 

1186 
01:28:07,007 --> 01:28:08,042 
Not too much? 

1187 
01:28:12,127 --> 01:28:13,355 
So far. 

1188 
01:28:21,447 --> 01:28:23,677 
And then Wanda 
no longer able to conceal this secret. 

1189 
01:28:48,487 --> 01:28:53,197 
Hey you, you are everywhere. 
Where you? 

1190 
01:28:54,127 --> 01:28:55,799 
For example, three hundred and fifty-seventh. 

1191 
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:57,316 
That is true. 

1192 
01:28:58,127 --> 01:29:00,561 
Derzhis. 
What? 

1193 
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:04,162

1195 
01:29:06,447 --> 01:29:07,436 
Okay, go. 

1196 
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,758 
You can. 
Are you ready? 

1197 
01:29:18,487 --> 01:29:20,159 
Hi, I am ... 

1198 
01:29:21,447 --> 01:29:23,165 
It must sign. 
Have you got a toilet? 

1199 
01:29:23,527 --> 01:29:24,721 
I still cook Punsch. 

1200 
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:26,282 
No! 

1201 
01:29:28,007 --> 01:29:32,637 
Yes. All normal. 
Come. 

1202 
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:44,603 
A good party. 
Why are you not there? 

1203 
01:29:45,727 --> 01:29:46,762 
I need to meet. 

1204 
01:29:47,207 --> 01:29:48,845 
So you pereezzhaesh? 

1205 
01:29:50,847 --> 01:29:55,523 
Yes, rabotenka outside the city. 
Just at the time wanted to leave here. 

1206 
01:29:58,247 --> 01:29:59,362 
Away from the crowd? 

1207 
01:30:00,047 --> 01:30:03,642 
Yes, from the crowd and from poker tables. 

1208 
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:05,595 
So you player? 

1209 
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:09,000 
Former. 
Moving from temptation. 

1210 
01:30:14,647 --> 01:30:17,605 
Well, this is cool. 
Are you man. 

1211 
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:22,607 
I had a friend once, 
that also likes gambling. 

1212 
01:30:24,207 --> 01:30:25,925 
At least, I said so. 

1213 
01:30:26,607 --> 01:30:28,245 
And you know, it is constantly 
have a monitor. 

1214 
01:30:28,327 --> 01:30:29,316 
Take the mask. 

1215 
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,082 
What? 

1216 
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:35,240 
Sorry. 

1217 
01:30:37,047 --> 01:30:41,404 
The whole Halloween, I always natalkivayus at ... 
in total, per person. 

1218 
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:45,119 
Sorry, silly. 

1219 
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:52,759 
It mean a lot to you? 

1220 
01:30:54,967 --> 01:30:59,802 
Yes. 
Very much. 

1221 
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:02,885 
And what happened? 

1222 
01:31:05,687 --> 01:31:07,325 
I could not give her what she wanted. 

1223 
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:10,280 
And what she wanted? 

1224 
01:31:14,527 --> 01:31:16,040 
Be free. 

1225 
01:31:17,607 --> 01:31:19,837 
Oh you shit! 
You lied to me! 

1226 
01:31:20,247 --> 01:31:22,283 
I succeed piano, and you say ... 

1227 
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:33,644 
Penelope, I am sorry. 

1228 
01:31:33,887 --> 01:31:35,559 
I know. 

1229 
01:31:35,767 --> 01:31:36,995 
Not in my power to lift the curse. 

1230 
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:43,919 
Nothing. I did so myself. 
This, I, Max. 

1231 
01:31:46,127 --> 01:31:47,526 
My name is Johnny. 

1232 
01:31:48,767 --> 01:31:50,325 
I know. 

1233 
01:31:52,327 --> 01:31:54,204 
I am still me. 

1234 
01:32:20,087 --> 01:32:25,366 
So all happened. 
And we have since lived happily. 

1235 
01:32:27,527 --> 01:32:30,121 
At least until happily. 

1236 
01:32:31,527 --> 01:32:33,245 
I did not understand what that means? 

1237 
01:32:34,327 --> 01:32:35,806 
A po-tvoemu what that means? 

1238 
01:32:36,127 --> 01:32:37,242 
- Rich sediments. 

1239 
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:39,885 
Always blame mom. 

1240 
01:32:41,647 --> 01:32:43,080 
We all curse? 

1241 
01:32:43,807 --> 01:32:46,924 
It is not valid curse, 
a valid your faith in him. 

1242 
01:32:47,327 --> 01:32:49,079 
What do you say, small insect? 

1243 
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,205 
It is not small insect, durak. 

1244 
01:32:51,327 --> 01:32:52,316 
He, too small insect. 

1245 
01:32:52,527 --> 01:32:54,643 
This is not good. 

1246 
01:32:54,847 --> 01:32:58,681 
Very well, Billy. 
So, now cover at the tables. 

1247 
01:32:59,927 --> 01:33:02,919 
After a break to go walk 
and see what we can gather. 

1248

Keep together.
