1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,761
In this picture
there are 47 people.

2
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,121
None of them can be seen.

3
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:23,082
In this film,
we hope to show you...

4
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:25,322
how not to be seen.

5
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:30,363
This is Mr. E. R. Bradshaw
of Napier Court...

6
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:33,484
Blackline Road, London, SE 14.

7
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:35,604
He cannot be seen.

8
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,565
Now I'm going to ask him
to stand up.

9
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:40,445
Mr. Bradshaw,
will you stand up, please?

10
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:49,567
This demonstrates
the value of not being seen.

11
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:53,408
In this picture, we cannot see
Mrs. B. J. Smegma...

12
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,128
of 13 The Crescent, Belmont.

13
00:00:56,168 --> 00:00:59,129
Mrs. Smegma,
will you stand up, please?

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,731
This is Mr. Nesbitt
of Harlow. Newtown.

15
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,451
Mr. Nesbitt,
will you stand up, please?

16
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,213
Mr. Nesbitt has learned
the first lesson of not being seen:

17
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,333
not to stand up.

18
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:25,054
However, he has chosen
a very obvious piece of cover.

19
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:31,455
Mr. E. W. Lambert of Homely,
The Burrows. Oswald Street...

20
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:33,536
has presented us with a poser.

21
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:36,456
We do not know
which bush he is behind.

22
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,537
But we can soon find out.

23
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,379
Yes. It was the middle one.

24
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,700
Mr. and Mrs. Watson of Hull...

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,140
chose a very cunning way
of not being seen.

26
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,061
When we called at their house, we found
they had gone on two weeks holiday.

27
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:02,822
However, a neighbor told us
where they were.

28
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:08,143
And here is the neighbor
who told us where they were.

29
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:13,584
And here is where he lived.

30
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:17,145
And this is
where he was born.

31
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:34,588
And now for something
completely different.

32
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh. Good evening.

33
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,320
Ladies and gentlemen...

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,361
we apologize that the feature was
not quite as long as we'd anticipated.

35
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,762
Therefore,
there will be a short interval.

36
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:49,964
In the meantime, we are pleased
to be able to show you a short film...

37
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:52,844
starring a man
with a tape recorder up his nose.

38
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:28,451
And now...  And now
a film starring a man...

39
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:31,372
with a tape recorder
up his brother's nose.

40
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:57,937
And now in stereo

41
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:20,222
Thank you.
That is the end of the interval.

42
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:22,422
Will you kindly return
to your seats?

43
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:25,783
We will now be proceeding
with the program as advertised.

44
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:31,824
Darling, you were wonderful.

45
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,105
Oh, really?

46
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:39,186
In 1971 the British Empire
lay in ruins.

47
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:42,906
Foreigners frequented the streets,
many of them Hungarians.

48
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,187
Not the streets.
The foreign nationals.

49
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:50,268
Anyway, many of these Hungarians went
into tobacconist's to buy cigarettes.

50
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,668
There you are, sir.
Thank you.

51
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,150
Good morning, sir.

52
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,431
"I will not buy this record.
It is scratched."

53
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:06,471
I'm sorry?

54
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:10,232
I will not buy this record.
It is scratched."

55
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:13,833
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a tobacconist's.

56
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:15,353
Tobacconist's.

57
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:20,674
"I will not buy this tobacconist's.
It is scratched."

58
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:23,555
No. Tobacco.
Um, cigarettes.

59
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:24,995
Cigarettes?

60
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:32,676
- "My hovercraft is full of eels."
- What?

61
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:35,717
"My hovercraft
is full of eels."

62
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:39,758
- Ah, matches.
- Yeah! Matches.

63
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:43,879
- "Do you want..."
- "Do you want."

64
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,399
Want.

65
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,120
"Do you want to come back to my place?
Bouncy, bouncy."

66
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,160
That'll be
six shillings, please.

67
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,121
"If I said you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?"

68
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:59,402
"I am no longer infected."

69
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:01,322
May I?

70
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,883
Costs six shillings.

71
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,165
Help!

72
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:34,129
- What's all this. Then?
- "You have beautiful thighs."

73
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,689
- What?
- He hit me.

74
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,330
"Drop your panties, Sir Arthur.
I can not wait till lunchtime!"

75
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,731
- Right!
- "Oh, my nipples explode with delight!"

76
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:45,251
The Hungarian gentleman
was subsequently released...

77
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,932
but his information led to the arrest
and trial of the real culprit.

78
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,212
I am.

79
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:53,173
You are hereby charged
that on the 28th day of May...

80
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,893
you did will fully
and with malice aforethought...

81
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,894
publish an alleged
English-Hungarian phrase book...

82
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:01,935
with intent to cause
a breach of the peace.

83
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:05,175
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

84
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:08,056
Mr. York, on the 28th of May...

85
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:11,697
- you published this phrase book.
- I did.

86
00:08:11,737 --> 00:08:14,897
With Your Lordship's permission,
I would like to quote an example.

87
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:19,578
The Hungarian phrase meaning, "Can you
direct me to the railway station?"...

88
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:22,579
is here translated
by the English phrase...

89
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,059
"Please fondle my buttocks."

90
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,860
"Please fondle...

91
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,061
my buttocks."

92
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,981
Ah, yes.
It's past the post office...

93
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,462
200 yards down
and then left at the light.

94
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:44,343
Left at lights.

95
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:46,756
Meanwhile, not far away...

96
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:50,997
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey were
about to enter an unfamiliar office.

97
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:52,517
Next.

98
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:19,242
Oh. Are you the marriage
guidance counselor?

99
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:22,163
- Yes. Good morning.
- Morning.

100
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:28,604
And... good morning
to you, madam.

101
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:34,606
- Name?
- Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey.

102
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:41,567
And what is the name of your...
ravishing wife?

103
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,927
Wait. Don't tell me.

104
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:47,408
It's... It's something
to do with moonlight.

105
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,689
Goes with her eyes.

106
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,809
It's soft and gentle...

107
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,210
warm and yielding.

108
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,130
Deeply lyrical, and yet...

109
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,531
tender and frightened,
like a tiny, white rabbit.

110
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:02,331
It's Dierdre.

111
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:07,492
What a beautiful name.

112
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:11,213
What a beautiful...

113
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,334
beautiful name.

114
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:21,055
And what seems to be the trouble
with your marriage, Mr. Putey?

115
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,855
It started when we went
to Brighton on holiday together.

116
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:26,776
Dierdre - that's my wife - and I,
we've always been close companions...

117
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:29,737
and I never particularly
anticipated any marital strife.

118
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:32,337
The very idea of consulting
a professional marital advisor...

119
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,338
has always been of
the greatest repugnance to me.

120
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:38,738
Although, far be it from me
to impugn the nature of your trade or...

121
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,659
or profession.

122
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,420
- Do go on.
- We've always been close companions...

123
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,101
sharing the interests,
the gardening, the holiday money.

124
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:53,902
Twice a month of an evening, we settle
down to do the accounts together...

125
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:57,502
something which Dierdre -
that's my wife -

126
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,423
and I particularly look forward to
on account of her feet.

127
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:04,264
I should have said at the start that
I noted for having a grand sense of humor.

128
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:08,224
Although I've kept myself very much
to myself over the last couple of years.

129
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:11,905
It's only been as comparatively recently
as recently that I've begun to realize--

130
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:14,466
Well, perhaps "realize"
is too strong a word.

131
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:19,627
Uh, imagine that, uh,
I was not the only thing in her life.

132
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,747
You suspected your wife?

133
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,188
Well...

134
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,788
frankly, yes.

135
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:29,989
A bit.

136
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,429
Her behavior did seem to me--

137
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:35,590
Her behavior did seem to me.
who was there to see...

138
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,071
to be a little odd.

139
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:39,671
- Odd?
- To an extent.

140
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,031
I'm not by nature
a suspicious person.

141
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,872
I've got a reputation of an after-dinner
speaker, if you get my meaning.

142
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:47,392
I certainly do.

143
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:50,793
And in the area where people know me,
I'm very well known.

144
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,314
- Fine. Would you--
- Certainly.

145
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:56,274
It was time to face the facts,
stop beating about the bush...

146
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:58,955
or I'd never be able to look myself
in the bathroom mirror again.

147
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:03,116
Would you mind running along for 10--
make it 20 minutes. All right?

148
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,556
Yes. I'll wait outside,
shall I?

149
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,838
Yes, that-that's perhaps
the best thing.

150
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,918
Certainly set my mind at rest
on one or two scores there.

151
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,802
Arthur Putey!

152
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:39,443
Are you a man or a mouse?

153
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,123
You've been running too long,
Arthur Putey.

154
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:47,285
It's time to stop, time to turn
and fight like a man.

155
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,805
Go back in there,
Arthur Putey.

156
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:53,966
Go back in there
and pull your finger out.

157
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,886
Yes! Yes, you're right.

158
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:59,647
This is it, Arthur Putey!

159
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,888
This is your moment,
Arthur Putey!

160
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,968
At last you're a man!

161
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:12,690
Come out of there. Dierdre!
I know you're in there.

162
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,290
- Go away!
- Righto.

163
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:44,056
Oh, what a lovely little

164
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:55,818
Oh, what a lovely little--

165
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,221
- Oh, what a lovely little--
- Stop it! Stop right there!

166
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:13,142
This is absolutely disgusting,
and I'm not going to stand for it!

167
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,102
There. Kill

168
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:15,034
Cut! That's it. We're not going to allow
this sort of smut on the screen.

169
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,075
This depraved and degrading spectacle
is going to stop right now.

170
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:21,556
- Do you hear me? Stop it!
- Damn I Just when it was getting good.

171
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:30,678
Evening, squire.

172
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,320
You married?

173
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:48,561
- Yes.
- I'm a bachelor myself.

174
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,002
Is-- Is your wife a goer?

175
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,082
Eh? Know what I mean?
Nudge, nudge.

176
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:55,483
- Know what I mean? Say no more.
- I beg your pardon?

177
00:16:55,523 --> 00:17:00,124
Your wife, does she go? Eh?
Know what I mean? Does she go?

178
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:02,684
- She sometimes goes.
- I'll bet she does.

179
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:05,565
Say no more.
Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge.

180
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:08,365
- I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.
- Follow me.

181
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,446
That's good. A nod's as good
as a wink to a blind bat.

182
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:16,647
- Look, are you selling something?
- Selling. Selling. Very good.

183
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:18,807
Know what I mean?

184
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:22,048
Oh, wicked. You're wicked, eh?
Nudge, nudge.

185
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,969
A nod's as good as a wink
to a blind bat.

186
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,329
- But...
- Your wife a sport, eh?

187
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,210
- She likes sport, yes.
- I bet she does.

188
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,211
She's very fond of cricket.

189
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,891
Who isn't, eh?
Likes games.

190
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:39,332
Knew she would.
Who doesn't. Eh?

191
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:41,332
She's been around a bit. Eh?

192
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:43,332
She's traveled.
She's from Purley.

193
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,973
Oh! Say no more.

194
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:50,454
Know what I mean?
Say no more.

195
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:56,815
Your wife interested in,
uh, photography, eh?

196
00:17:56,895 --> 00:18:00,256
"Photographs, eh?"
he asked him knowingly.

197
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:03,496
- Photography?
- Yeah. Snap. Grin. Wink. Nudge.

198
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,897
- Holiday stamps?
- Could be taken on holiday. Could be.

199
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:09,618
Swimming costumes.
Nudge, nudge.

200
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:13,258
- Candid photography.
- No. I'm afraid we don't have a camera.

201
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:15,179
Oh. Still.

202
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,620
Look, are you trying
to insinuate something?

203
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:27,061
- Yes.
- Well?

204
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:29,862
Well, I mean,
you're a man of the world, aren't ya?

205
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,543
I mean, you know, you've, uh...
you've been around. You've been there.

206
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:36,783
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, you've...

207
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,304
You've done it, uh, with a lady.

208
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,184
- You've slept with a lady.
- Yes.

209
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,585
What's it like?

210
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:48,025
Well, I think it's overrated.

211
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,226
Shut up, you!

212
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:55,987
- Good evening, class!
- Good evening.

213
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:58,428
- Where's all the others, then?
- They're not here.

214
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:01,508
I can see that!
What's the matter with'em?

215
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:03,549
- Don't know.
- Perhaps they've got flu.

216
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:06,749
Flu! They should eat
more fresh fruit!

217
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,951
Right! Now, self-defense!

218
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:16,231
Tonight I shall be carryin' on
from where we got to last week...

219
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:20,632
when I was showin' you how to
defend yourselves against anyone...

220
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:24,513
who attacks you armed
with a piece of fresh fruit.

221
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,154
- You said we wouldn't do fruit again.
- What do you mean?

222
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:31,514
We've done fresh fruit
for the last nine weeks.

223
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:35,115
What's wrong with fruit?
You think you know it all, eh?

224
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:36,715
Can't we try something else?

225
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:38,956
Like someone who attacks you
with a pointed stick.

226
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,876
Pointed stick?

227
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:47,518
We want to learn how to defend ourselves
against pointed sticks, do we?

228
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:50,438
Gettin' all
high and mighty, eh?

229
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:53,279
Fresh fruit not
good enough for you, eh?

230
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,799
Well, let me tell you
somethin', my lad!

231
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:00,480
When you're walkin' home tonight
and some great homicidal maniac...

232
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,361
comes after you with a bunch of
loganberries, don't come cryin' to me!

233
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:09,642
Right!
And now the passion fruit.

234
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:13,443
When your assailant lunges at you
with a passion fruit, like thus--

235
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:16,203
- We done the passion fruit.
- What?

236
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:20,364
- We've done the passion fruit.
- We done oranges, apples, grapefruits...

237
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:24,445
- Whole and segments.
- Greengages, pomegranates.

238
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,926
- Grapes, passion fruit.
- Lemons.

239
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:30,766
- Plums.
- And mangoes in syrup.

240
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:33,447
- How about cherries?
- We done them.

241
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:35,647
- Red and black?
- Yes.

242
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:38,568
All right, then.

243
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:44,329
Bananas. We haven't
done bananas, have we?

244
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,569
- No.
- Right!

245
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,650
How to defend yourself
against a man armed with a banana!

246
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,571
Catch. Now, it's quite simple
to deal with a banana fiend.

247
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:59,132
First of all, you force him
to drop the banana.

248
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:02,813
Then you eat the banana,
thus disarming him.

249
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:04,733
You have now
rendered him helpless!

250
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,694
- Suppose he's got a bunch.
- Shut up.

251
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,694
- Suppose he's got a pointed stick.
- Shut up!

252
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:13,935
Right! Now you, Mr. Apricot.

253
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:16,496
- Harrison.
- Sorry. Mr. Harrison.

254
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,496
Come at me with that banana.

255
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:23,017
Be as vicious as you Iike with it.
Come on. Attack me!

256
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:25,657
No, no, no!
Put something into it, for God's...

257
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:28,058
Hold the banana like that.

258
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:30,498
That's better.
Now scream.

259
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:32,819
Good. Right.
Now attack me.

260
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,259
Come on, man,
attack me!

261
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,541
Next, I eat the banana.

262
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:47,142
Now, I would just like
to point out...

263
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,223
that this film is displaying
a distinct tendency to become silly.

264
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:55,343
Now, nobody likes
a good laugh more than I do.

265
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:59,264
Except, perhaps,
my wife and some of her friends.

266
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:01,065
Oh, yes,
and Captain John son.

267
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,905
Come to think of it, most people
like a good laugh more than I do.

268
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:08,266
But that's beside the point. I'm warning
this film not to get silly again.

269
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:12,747
Right. Now, Director,
on the command "Cut"...

270
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:15,027
cut to the next scene.

271
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:18,108
- Director...
- This is a frightened city.

272
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:20,629
Wait for itl

273
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,949
Director, cut!

274
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,590
This is a frightened city.

275
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,630
Over these streets, over these houses,
hangs a pall of fear.

276
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,231
An ugly kind of violence is rife,
stalking the town.

277
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:40,473
Yes, gangs of old ladies
attacking fit, defenseless young men.

278
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:04,958
They just come up to you
and push you, like.

279
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,158
Shove you off the pavement. There's
usually about four or five of them.

280
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:12,559
Yeah, sometimes
it's three or four of them.

281
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:16,320
It's not even safe to go out
down to the shops anymore.

282
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,761
Grannies are no respecter
of race, creed or sex.

283
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:24,281
Theirs is a harsh.
ruthless world...

284
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,122
a tough world, a world in which
the surgical stocking is king.

285
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:32,123
But what are they in it for,
these senile delinquents...

286
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,484
these layabouts in lace?

287
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:37,604
- Oh, the violence.
- The prestige, mainly.

288
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:40,885
- The free gifts.
- Poking the knee in the groin.

289
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:43,245
We like pulling the heads
off sheep.

290
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:46,046
And tea cakes.

291
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:49,407
We have a Iot of trouble with grannies.
Pension day is the worst.

292
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:51,287
Soon as they get it,
they blow the lot...

293
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:54,648
on milk, tea, sugar,
a tin of meat for their cat.

294
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,568
The whole crux
of the problem, uh...

295
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:00,529
lies in the basic
dissatisfaction...

296
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:04,410
of these senile delinquents
with the world as they find it.

297
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,690
They begin to question, uh,
the values of their society.

298
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,931
They see their sons
and daughters growing up...

299
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:14,132
to become accountants, uh,
solicitors, sociologists even.

300
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:17,012
And they begin to wonder,
"Is it all worth it? Is it all..."

301
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:32,095
Another prime target for vandalism
is telephone boxes.

302
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,696
But mostly,
they just live for kicks.

303
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:52,419
But there are other kinds
of violence abroad...

304
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:54,860
other gangs, equally vicious,
equally determined...

305
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,780
such as the baby snatchers.

306
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:03,101
Hey What is this?

307
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:05,262
Hey! Help!

308
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:09,143
I left him outside for a few moments
while I got some Brillo Pads.

309
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:12,783
When I came back, he was gone.
He was only 48!

310
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:16,384
And also vicious gangs
of "Keep Left" signs.

311
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,986
Right! Stop that!

312
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,666
It's silly.
Very silly, indeed.

313
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:30,347
It started off as a nice little idea
about old ladies attacking young men...

314
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:32,587
but now it's just got silly.

315
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:34,628
His hair's too long
for a vicar too.

316
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:39,069
And you can tell those are not proper
"Keep Left" signs. Clear off, the lot of you!

317
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:40,989
You, come with me.

318
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,111
Right. Now Iet's see something decent
and military: some precision drilling.

319
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:52,311
Squad! Camp it up!

320
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:55,312
Ooh, get her! Whoops!

321
00:25:55,352 --> 00:26:00,393
I've got your number, but you
couldn't afford me, dear, two, three.

322
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,834
I'll scratch your eyes out.

323
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:06,194
Don't come the bigger
dear bitch with us. dear.

324
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:10,395
We all know where you've been,
you military fairy, two, three.

325
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:13,116
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

326
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,516
Whoops!
Don't look now, girls.

327
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:18,877
The maid is just mince
in that jolly color, Sergeant.

328
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,957
Two, three. Ooh!

329
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:24,718
Right! Stop that. Silly.

330
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:28,079
And a bit suspect, I think.
Time for a cartoon.

331
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,599
Once upon a time...

332
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:34,200
there was an enchanted prince...

333
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,081
who ruled the land
beyond the Wobbles.

334
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:43,922
One day he discovered
a spot on his face.

335
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:46,883
Foolishly, he ignored it.

336
00:26:46,963 --> 00:26:50,643
And three years later,
he died of cancer.

337
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:52,564
The spot, however, flourished...

338
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:55,444
and soon set out
to seek its fortune.

339
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:31,652
Agnes, did you just see
who moved in next door?

340
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,652
Yes. Black as the ace of spades,
they were.

341
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:37,453
Oh, well,
there goes the neighborhood.

342
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,373
Oh, yes.

343
00:27:58,537 --> 00:28:00,417
Next, please.

344
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:05,098
One at a time, please.

345
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,499
There is only me, sir.

346
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,221
So there is.
Take a, um...

347
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,581
- Seat?
- Seat. Take a seat.

348
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:24,262
So, you want to join
my mountaineering expedition, do you?

349
00:28:25,823 --> 00:28:28,423
Who, me, sir?

350
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:31,664
- Yes, I'd very much like to, sir.
- Jolly good.

351
00:28:32,664 --> 00:28:34,544
And how about you?

352
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:38,425
There is only me, sir.

353
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:47,307
Well, bang goes
his application then.

354
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:50,308
Now, let me fill you in.
I'm leading this expedition...

355
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:54,348
and we're going to climb
both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.

356
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:57,109
I thought there was
only one peak, sir.

357
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:12,352
Well. That I save a bit of time.
Well done.

358
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:15,193
Now, the object of
this year's expedition...

359
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:18,673
is to see if we can find any trace
of last year's expedition.

360
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:21,474
- Last year's expedition?
- Yes. My brother was leading that.

361
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:24,835
They were going to build a bridge
between the two peaks.

362
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,076
My idea, I'm afraid.

363
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:35,197
I ought to tell you that I have almost
everyone I need for this expedition.

364
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:37,957
But what special qualifications
do you have?

365
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,518
- Well, sir...
- Yes, you first.

366
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:42,758
- There is only me, sir.
- I wasn't talking to you.

367
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:46,759
- Carry on.
- I'm a fully qualified mountaineer.

368
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,400
Mountaineer?

369
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:58,161
Mouse. Moun...

370
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:02,642
Mountaineer: two men skilled
at climbing a mountain.

371
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:05,243
By Jove, that'd be useful.

372
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:08,403
Well, you're in.
Congratulations.

373
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:11,204
Both of you.
Now, what are your names?

374
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:13,124
Arthur Wilson.

375
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,725
Well, look.

376
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:20,006
I'll call you Arthur Wilson One
and you Arthur Wilson Two...

377
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:21,926
just to avoid confusion.

378
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:24,087
Are you actually leading
this expedition?

379
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,847
Yes, we are leading
this expedition to Africa.

380
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:30,208
- What routes will you both be following?
- Good questions.

381
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:33,888
We'll be leaving on one or other
of the January the 22...

382
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,049
and taking the following routes:

383
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:38,529
from Manchesters,
down through Oxfords...

384
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:41,450
taking the M1.5
through Londons to Purleys...

385
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,411
then the A25s
from Purleys to Dovers.

386
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:47,131
Thence Africas to Nairobis.

387
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:51,652
We take the south roads out of Nairobis
for about 12 miles and then ask.

388
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:54,693
- Does anyone speak Swahili?
- Most of them do down there.

389
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:57,533
No. Does anyone in our party
speak Swahili, sir?

390
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:00,334
- Well, Matron's got a smattering.
- Apart from the two Matrons.

391
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:02,734
Good Lord.
I forgot about her.

392
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:05,255
Apart from them, who else
is coming on our expedition?

393
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:08,415
Well, we've got
the Arthur Brown twins,...

394
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:11,896
two botanists called Madchen,
the William Johnston brothers...

395
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:14,857
- Two of them.
- Four. Pair of identical twins.

396
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:17,617
Two of the Harry Baker quads
and you two.

397
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:21,458
- And none of these are mountaineers?
- Well, you two are.

398
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:24,099
And we've got a brace of guides
called Jimmy Blankensoft...

399
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,379
because Kilimanjaro
is a pretty tricky climb.

400
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,420
Most of it's up,
till we reach the very top...

401
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,980
and then it tends
to slope away rather sharply.

402
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,541
But Jimmy's put his heads together
and worked out a way up. Jimmy

403
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:41,222
Jimmy Blankensoft, Arthur Wilson.
Arthur Wilson, Jimmy Blankensoft.

404
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:42,862
Jimmy Blankensoft Two,
Arthur Wilson Two.

405
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,103
Arthur Wilson Two,
Jimmy Blankensoft One.

406
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:48,344
- Carry on, Jimmy.
- Don't worry about the...

407
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:50,584
We'll get him up, all right.

408
00:31:56,665 --> 00:32:01,106
Well, I'd better describe the route.
We start off simply up Kilimanjaro...

409
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:06,187
Quite simple.
No problem there, basically.

410
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:10,468
And then we go on to
the main face itself of Kilimanjaro.

411
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:12,869
It's a bit difficult
here because...

412
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:19,470
There's a difficult bit 'round here
when you've got to go...

413
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,871
from the end of the mantel-piece
onto the coffee table.

414
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:25,871
It's a bit of a difficult jump.
We don't need those.

415
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:29,472
Then you've got the rail up here,
which is quite a good fortune.

416
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:33,593
There's a terribly easy bit
over the floor up onto the chair.

417
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:35,633
And then we've got...

418
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:39,354
We get down.
We go quite simplistic.

419
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,875
He'll be Ieading
the first assault.

420
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:48,476
I'm afraid I shan't be coming
on your expedition, sir...

421
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:52,837
'cause I have absolutely no confidence
in anyone involved in it!

422
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,357
Oh. dear.

423
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,358
- What about you?
- I'm game, sir.

424
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:02,279
Jolly good.

425
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:05,919
Good Lord!

426
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,405
And now for something
completely different.

427
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:36,646
- Inspector!
- Yes, sir?

428
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:39,206
I was sitting on a park bench
and I put my coat down.

429
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:43,367
When I picked it up, I found my wallet
had gone and £15 had been stolen.

430
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:46,808
- Did you see anyone?
- No, no one at all.

431
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:51,489
Well, there's very little
we can do about that, sir.

432
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,091
Do you want to come back
to my place?

433
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:09,252
Yeah, all right.

434
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:48,100
And so Miss Spume
returned to her typing...

435
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,220
and dreamed
her little dreamy dreams...

436
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,261
unaware of the cruel trick
fate had in store for her.

437
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:56,702
For Miss Spume was
about to fall victim...

438
00:34:56,782 --> 00:35:00,983
of the dreaded international
Chinese communist conspiracy

439
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:03,223
Yes, these fanatical fiends...

440
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:06,824
under the leadership
of the so-called Mao Tse-tung...

441
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:11,025
had caught Miss Spume off guard
for one brief but fatal moment...

442
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,426
and destroyed her...

443
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:19,906
just as they are ready to go
anytime free men anywhere...

444
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:22,667
waver in their defense
of democracy.

445
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:34,149
Once again, American defense...

446
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:37,230
proves its effectiveness
against international communism.

447
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,511
Using this diagram of a tooth
to represent any small country...

448
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:42,871
we can see how
international communism works...

449
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:45,392
by eroding away from within.

450
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:51,993
When one country, or tooth...

451
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:56,634
falls victim to international communism,
its neighbors soon follow.

452
00:35:56,714 --> 00:36:00,115
In dentistry, this is known
as the domino theory.

453
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:04,676
But with American defense,
the decay is stopped before it starts.

454
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:09,396
That's why nine out of ten
small countries choose American defense.

455
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:13,637
Or Crelm toothpaste
with the miracle ingredient Frauduline.

456
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:16,198
The white car represents
Crelm toothpaste...

457
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:18,238
with the miracle ingredient
Frauduline.

458
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:21,479
The not-white car represents
another toothpaste.

459
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:26,400
Both cars provide 30% protection.

460
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,961
At 60% protection,
both cars are doing well.

461
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:34,962
At 90% protection... Wait.

462
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,722
The not-white car is out...

463
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:40,483
and Crelm toothpaste goes on
to win with 100% protection.

464
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:43,163
Yes. Do like all smart motorists.

465
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,284
Choose Crelm toothpaste!

466
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:49,645
Or Shrill petrol,
with the new additive GLC-9424075,...

467
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:52,045
after 6:00 p.m., 9424047.

468
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,646
Using this white card
to represent engine deposits...

469
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:59,447
and this black card to represent
Shrill's new additive, GLC-9424075,...

470
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:01,927
after 6:00 p.m., 9424047...

471
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:05,128
we can see how the engine deposits
are pushed off the face of the earth...

472
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,368
by the superior forces
available to Sh--

473
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:14,890
This is the police.

474
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,890
We know you're in there,
so come out with your hands up.

475
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,251
You'll never take me alive
copper!

476
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,731
All right, then. Sergeant!

477
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:44,016
Conrad Poohs and His Dancing Teeth.

478
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:34,186
Thank you, thank you,
Conrad Poohs and His Exploding Teeth.

479
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:37,747
A smile, two fangs
and an "Excuse me".

480
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:40,387
And next tonight,
gentlemen and ladies...

481
00:38:40,427 --> 00:38:43,708
here at the Peephole Club
for the very first time...

482
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,628
we're very proud to welcome...

483
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:49,629
Ken Ewing and His Musical Mice.

484
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:59,351
Thank you, thank you.

485
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:02,952
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have in this box...

486
00:39:03,032 --> 00:39:05,392
23 white mice...

487
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,753
mice which I have
painstakingly trained...

488
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,673
over the past few years...

489
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:13,714
to squeak at a selected pitch.

490
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,714
This one is "A"-Sharp...

491
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,275
and this one is "G".

492
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:23,036
"G", "A"-Sharp.
You get the general idea.

493
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:27,117
Now, these mice are so arranged
upon this rack...

494
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:30,277
that when played
in the correct order...

495
00:39:30,357 --> 00:39:32,038
they will squeak...

496
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:34,958
"Three Blinded White Mice."

497
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:38,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you, on the mouse organ...

498
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,799
"Three Blinded White Mice."

499
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,520
Thank you.

500
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,041
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody stop him.

501
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:12,446
Ten seconds, studio.

502
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:16,847
Stop him!
Stop that bastard!

503
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:24,248
Hello, and welcome to another
edition of It's the Arts.

504
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:28,449
And we kick off this evening
with a look at the cinema.

505
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:32,690
One of the most prolific film directors
of this age, or indeed, of any age...

506
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,331
is Sir Edward Ross, back in this country
for the first time in five years...

507
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:40,171
to open a season of his films
at the National Film Theatre.

508
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:43,772
And we are indeed fortunate to have him
with us in the studio this evening.

509
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:45,852
- Good evening.
- Edward...

510
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:48,293
- You don't mind if I call you Edward?
- Not at all.

511
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,613
It does seem to worry some people.
I'm not sure why.

512
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:54,134
Some are sensitive, so I do take the
precaution of asking on these occasions.

513
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:57,615
- No, that's fine.
- So Edward it is. Splendid.

514
00:40:57,695 --> 00:41:00,695
- I'm sorry to have brought it up.
- No. Edward it is.

515
00:41:00,776 --> 00:41:03,376
Thank you very much
for being so helpful.

516
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:07,217
- At times it's more than my job's worth.
- Quite.

517
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:11,018
Makes it hard to establish a rapport,
to put the other person at his ease.

518
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:12,938
- Quite.
- Quite.

519
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,619
Silly little point,
but it does seem to matter.

520
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:19,979
Still Iess said the better.
Ted, when you first went in the film...

521
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:22,660
You don't mind if I call you Ted,
as opposed to Edward?

522
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,740
- No. Everyone calls me Ted.
- Splendid.

523
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,501
- Because it's much shorter, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

524
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:30,822
- Much Iess formal.
- Ted, Edward, anything.

525
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:33,262
Splendid.
Incidentally, do call me Tom.

526
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:36,143
I don't want you bothering with
any of this "Thomas" nonsense.

527
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:41,544
Fine. Where were we?
Eddie baby, when you first...

528
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:45,385
I'm sorry. I don't like
being called Eddie baby.

529
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:48,705
- I beg your pardon?
- I don't like being called Eddie baby.

530
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:50,746
Now get on with your interview.

531
00:41:51,866 --> 00:41:55,187
- Did I call you Eddie baby?
- Yes, you did.

532
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:58,187
I don't think I did.
Did I call him Eddie baby?

533
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,828
Yes, you did!

534
00:42:00,908 --> 00:42:03,188
I didn't call you Eddie baby,
did I, sweetie?

535
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:05,589
- Don't call me sweetie.
- Can I call you sugar plum?

536
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:07,149
- No!
- Pussycat?

537
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:09,429
- No!
- Angel drawers?

538
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,670
No, you may not.

539
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,870
- Now get on with it.
- Can I call you Frank?

540
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:18,551
- Why Frank?
- Frank's a nice name.

541
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:21,392
President Nixon's got
a hedgehog called Frank.

542
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:24,873
- What is going on?
- Frank. Frankie. Fran. Frannie.

543
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:28,193
- Little Frannie Boo.
- That's it. I'm leaving.

544
00:42:28,273 --> 00:42:30,834
Had enough of this.
I've never been so insulted.

545
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:33,914
- Tell us about your film, Sir Edward.
- What?

546
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:37,915
Tell us about your latest film,
Sir Edward, if you'd be so kind.

547
00:42:37,995 --> 00:42:41,556
- None of this pussycat nonsense?
- Promise.

548
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:43,516
Please. Sir Edward.

549
00:42:44,837 --> 00:42:46,717
- My latest film?
- Yes, Sir Edward.

550
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:53,238
I first had the idea, funnily enough,
when I joined the industry in 1919.

551
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:55,799
Of course, in those days
I was only a tea boy...

552
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,599
Oh, shut up.

553
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,800
- There he is!
- Get him.

554
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:13,002
Stop him!

555
00:43:13,082 --> 00:43:15,083
He's a murderer!

556
00:43:15,163 --> 00:43:17,883
Come back, you fiend! Fiend!

557
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:19,804
He's a murderer!

558
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,860
"The room is full of milkmen...

559
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:45,901
some of whom are...

560
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:50,422
are very old."

561
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:57,784
This man is Ernest Scribbler...

562
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:00,144
manufacturer of jokes.

563
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:03,985
In a few moments he will think
of the funniest joke in the world...

564
00:45:04,065 --> 00:45:07,826
and as a result
he will die laughing.

565
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:51,594
It was obvious
the joke was lethal.

566
00:45:51,674 --> 00:45:54,075
No one could read it and live.

567
00:45:54,155 --> 00:45:57,356
Scribbler's mother, alarmed by
the unusual sounds of merriment...

568
00:45:57,436 --> 00:46:01,436
entered the room and found
what was, apparently...

569
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:03,397
a suicide note.

570
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:33,203
The war against the Hun
continues...

571
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:35,643
and as Britain's brave boys
battle against the Bosch...

572
00:46:35,723 --> 00:46:38,804
their leaders are on the lookout for
new breakthroughs that could provide...

573
00:46:38,884 --> 00:46:41,685
the ultimate weapon
in the war against the Hun.

574
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:47,446
Here, in this little house in Pinchley,
they think maybe they've found it.

575
00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:51,567
It's a joke so deadly, it could have
Fritz's forces falling about.

576
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:07,050
Tests on Salisbury Plain confirm...

577
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,850
the joke's devastating effectiveness
at a range of up to 50 yards.

578
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:42,257
Fantastic!

579
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:45,818
All through the winter of '43...

580
00:47:45,898 --> 00:47:49,298
we had translators working
in joke-proof conditions...

581
00:47:49,378 --> 00:47:53,339
to try and manufacture
a German version of the joke.

582
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:56,700
They worked on one word each
for greater safety.

583
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,141
One of them saw two words by mistake and
had to spend several weeks in hospital.

584
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:03,901
But apart from that,
things went ahead pretty fast.

585
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:06,382
And by January
we had the joke in a form...

586
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:10,263
which our troops couldn't understand,
but which the Germans could.

587
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:13,103
So on July the 8th, 1944...

588
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:15,384
the joke was first told
to the enemy...

589
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:17,304
in the Ardennes.

590
00:48:18,664 --> 00:48:21,585
Squad, tell the joke!

591
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,310
In action, it was deadly.

592
00:49:24,598 --> 00:49:26,598
The German casualties
were appalling.

593
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,281
It was a fantastic success
over 80,000 times as powerful...

594
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:42,121
as Britain's great prewar joke,
which was used at Munich...

595
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:44,042
and one which Hitler
couldn't match.

596
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:56,324
I would like to apologize
for the rather poor taste...

597
00:49:56,404 --> 00:49:58,244
of the previous item.

598
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,645
And excuse me, please.

599
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,572
Fleet Street, please.

600
00:50:38,613 --> 00:50:40,453
All right, everybody,
stay close.

601
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:42,533
Don't lag behind.
Keep together, everybody.

602
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:45,174
Remember. Watch out
for the killer cars.

603
00:50:49,455 --> 00:50:51,255
Yes, the killer cars.

604
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:56,096
For years the city had been plagued by
ever-increasing pedestrian congestion.

605
00:50:56,176 --> 00:50:58,297
In an attempt to eliminate
this problem...

606
00:50:58,337 --> 00:51:00,537
certain fanatical cars,..

607
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:03,418
had taken the law
into their own hands.

608
00:51:06,698 --> 00:51:09,059
But the days of the killer cars
were numbered...

609
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,379
thanks to the miracle
of atomic mutation.

610
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:30,583
Thank you!
You've saved our city!

611
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:32,504
But at what cost?

612
00:51:37,785 --> 00:51:41,185
Just then as it looked for certain,
that the city was about to be eaten...

613
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:44,546
the earth trembled and the sun
was blotted out from the sky.

614
00:51:45,906 --> 00:51:48,467
Suddenly, swarms of giant
bees filled the air...

615
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:52,548
and 300 million armored horsemen covered
with coats of 1,000 different colors...

616
00:51:52,628 --> 00:51:55,468
appeared at every street corner
attacking the monster cat...

617
00:51:55,508 --> 00:51:57,709
in a scene of such
spectacular proportions...

618
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:01,349
that it could never in your life be seen
in a low-budget film like this.

619
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:03,590
If you'd notice,
my mouth isn't moving either.

620
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,950
But just as the monster cat
was starting to weaken...

621
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,511
the earth split apart
with a deafening roar and...

622
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,041
Hello. I wish
to register a complaint.

623
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:02,322
- Hello. Miss?
- What do you mean, "miss"?

624
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:07,003
Oh, I'm sorry. I have a cold.
I wish to make a complaint.

625
00:53:08,563 --> 00:53:10,643
Sorry.
We're closing for lunch.

626
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:13,804
Nevermind that, my lad.
I wish to complain about this parrot...

627
00:53:13,884 --> 00:53:17,045
what I purchased not half an hour ago
from this very boutique.

628
00:53:17,085 --> 00:53:20,125
Oh, yes, the Norwegian blue.
What's wrong with it?

629
00:53:20,205 --> 00:53:22,286
I'll tell you what's
wrong with it, my lad.

630
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,046
It's dead.
That's what's wrong with it.

631
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:27,767
No, it's resting. Look.

632
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:32,248
Look, my Iad, I know a dead parrot when
I see one and I'm looking at one now.

633
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:34,528
No, that's not dead,
it's resting.

634
00:53:34,608 --> 00:53:36,809
- Resting?
- Yeah, resting.

635
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:39,729
Remarkable bird, the Norwegian blue,
isn't it? Beautiful plumage.

636
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:43,730
The plumage don't enter into it.
It's still dead.

637
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,731
No, it's resting.

638
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:50,571
All right, then.
If it's resting, I'll wake it up.

639
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:52,172
Hello, Polly!

640
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:58,293
I've got a nice, fresh cuttlefish for
you if you wake up, Mr. Polly Parrot!

641
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:01,174
- There, he moved.
- No, that was you pushing the cage.

642
00:54:01,254 --> 00:54:03,414
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did

643
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:05,414
Hello, Polly!

644
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:09,575
Wakey, wakey!

645
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:13,696
Rise and shine.

646
00:54:13,736 --> 00:54:16,417
This is your 9:00 alarm call.

647
00:54:21,218 --> 00:54:23,058
That's what I call
a dead parrot.

648
00:54:24,058 --> 00:54:26,459
- No, he's stunned.
- Stunned?

649
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:28,899
Yeah, you stunned him
just as he was wakin' up.

650
00:54:28,939 --> 00:54:32,140
- Norwegian blues stun easily.
- I've had enough of this.

651
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,101
That parrot is definitely deceased,
and when I bought it a half hour ago...

652
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:38,741
you assured me that
its total lack of movement...

653
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:43,222
was due to it being tired
and shagged out after a long squall.

654
00:54:43,302 --> 00:54:46,023
Well, he's pining
for the fjords.

655
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:53,664
Pinin' for the fjords?
What kind of talk is that?

656
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:57,065
Look, why did it fall flat on its back
the minute I got it home?

657
00:54:57,145 --> 00:55:00,946
Well, the Norwegian blue prefers
keeping on its back. Beautiful plumage.

658
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:04,987
Look, I took the liberty of examining
that parrot and I discovered...

659
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:08,627
the only reason it had been sitting
on its perch in the first place...

660
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:11,708
was that it had been
nailed there.

661
00:55:11,788 --> 00:55:13,628
Oh, well, of course
it was nailed there.

662
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,989
If I hadn't nailed it there, it would
have muscled up to those bars and boom.

663
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:19,590
Look here mate.

664
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,951
This parrot wouldn't boom
if you put 4,000 volts through it.

665
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:27,151
It's bleedin' demised.

666
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:30,192
No, it's pining.

667
00:55:30,232 --> 00:55:34,032
It's not pining,
it's passed on.

668
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:37,313
This parrot is no more.

669
00:55:37,393 --> 00:55:39,674
It has ceased to be.

670
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:43,034
It's expired and
gone to see its maker.

671
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:45,995
This is a late parrot!

672
00:55:46,955 --> 00:55:48,555
It's a stiff.

673
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:51,516
Bereft of Iife.
It rests in peace.

674
00:55:51,596 --> 00:55:55,477
If you hadn't nailed it to the perch,
it would be pushing up the daisies.

675
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:59,038
It's run down the curtain
and joined the choir invisible.

676
00:55:59,118 --> 00:56:03,758
This is an ex-parrot.

677
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,719
Well. I'd better
replace it then.

678
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,480
If you want to get anything done in
this country you've got to complain...

679
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,680
till you're blue in the mouth.

680
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,841
Sorry, squire.
We're right out of parrots.

681
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:17,881
I see.
I get the picture.

682
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:23,162
- I've got a slug.
- Does it talk?

683
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:26,483
Not really.

684
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:29,524
Well, it's scarcely
a replacement then, is it?

685
00:56:32,164 --> 00:56:35,885
Listen. I didn't want
to work in a pet shop.

686
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:38,205
I wanted to be a lumberjack.

687
00:56:40,806 --> 00:56:42,646
Sorry. This is irrelevant.

688
00:56:42,726 --> 00:56:42,726
Yes, a lumberjack!

689
00:56:42,726 --> 00:56:45,167
Yes, a lumberjack!

690
00:56:45,247 --> 00:56:49,728
Leaping from trees as they float down
the mighty rivers of British Columbia.

691
00:56:49,768 --> 00:56:52,128
The giant redwood!

692
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:54,169
The larch!

693
00:56:54,249 --> 00:56:57,649
The fir!
The mighty Scotch pine!

694
00:56:57,729 --> 00:56:59,570
What about my bloody parrot?

695
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,490
The smell of fresh-cut timber!

696
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,291
The crash of mighty trees.

697
00:57:05,371 --> 00:57:10,012
With my best girl
by my side, we'd sing!

698
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,453
I'm a lumberjack
and I'm okay

699
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,094
I sleep all night
and I work all day

700
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:21,454
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

701
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:23,895
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

702
00:57:23,975 --> 00:57:26,375
I cut down trees
I eat my lunch

703
00:57:26,455 --> 00:57:28,816
I go to the lavatory

704
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:31,136
On Wednesday
I go shopping

705
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:33,577
And have buttered scones for tea

706
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,497
He cuts down trees
He eats his lunch

707
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,778
He goes to the lavatory

708
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:41,138
On Wednesday
he goes shopping

709
00:57:41,218 --> 00:57:44,019
And has buttered scones for tea

710
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:46,419
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

711
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:48,940
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

712
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,580
I cut down trees
I skip and jump

713
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,061
I like to press wild flowers

714
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,621
I put on women's clothing

715
00:57:56,661 --> 00:57:59,222
And hang around in bars

716
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:01,862
He cuts down trees
He skips and jumps

717
00:58:01,942 --> 00:58:04,183
He likes to press wild flowers

718
00:58:04,223 --> 00:58:06,623
He puts on women's clothing

719
00:58:06,703 --> 00:58:09,464
And hangs around in bars

720
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:11,864
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

721
00:58:11,944 --> 00:58:14,385
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

722
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:17,105
I cut down trees
I wear high heels

723
00:58:17,186 --> 00:58:19,466
Suspenders and a bra

724
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:22,066
I wish I'd been a girlie

725
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:24,747
Just like my dear papa

726
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:27,548
- I cut down trees, I wear high heels
- He cuts down trees

727
00:58:27,628 --> 00:58:30,228
Suspenders and a bra

728
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:32,429
I wish I'd been a girlie

729
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,589
Just like my dear papa

730
00:58:35,669 --> 00:58:37,470
Oh, Brevers!

731
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,470
And I thought
you were so butch

732
00:58:41,991 --> 00:58:43,671
Oh, you pansy!

733
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:55,593
And now for something
completely different.

734
00:59:03,395 --> 00:59:05,395
Hello, darling.
Sorry I'm so late.

735
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,636
That's all right, darling.
I'm 20 minutes late myself.

736
00:59:07,716 --> 00:59:10,836
- Let's not start worrying about that.
- It's nice here, isn't it?

737
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:13,397
Yes. A very good restaurant.
Five stars, you know?

738
00:59:13,477 --> 00:59:15,397
- Really?
- Oh, yes. Terrific reputation.

739
00:59:15,477 --> 00:59:18,278
Good evening, madame.
Good evening, sir.

740
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:21,158
May I say what a pleasure it is
to see you here again, sir?

741
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:25,279
Thank you. Apparently,
the boeuf en croute is fantastic.

742
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:27,840
If I may recommend, sir,
the faisan a la reine.

743
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,800
The sauce is one of the chef's
most famous creations.

744
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,121
- Mmm, that sounds very good.
- Sounds lovely.

745
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:35,641
Anyway, darling,
have a look at the menu.

746
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:37,882
See what you want.
Take your time.

747
00:59:37,962 --> 00:59:41,563
By the way, I've got a bit of a dirty
fork. Could you get me another one?

748
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:45,483
- I beg your pardon?
- It's dirty. Could I get another fork?

749
00:59:45,563 --> 00:59:49,124
- Sir, I do apologize.
- No need to apologize. Doesn't worry me.

750
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:51,525
No. I do apologize, sir.

751
00:59:51,565 --> 00:59:54,125
I will fetch the headwaiter
immediatement.

752
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:56,526
No, please.
No need to do that.

753
00:59:56,566 --> 00:59:58,966
Oh no.
I feel sure the headwaiter...

754
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:02,207
he will want to apologize
to you himself, personally.

755
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:06,888
I cannot think how this has happened.
I will fetch him at once.

756
01:00:06,928 --> 01:00:09,768
Well, you certainly
get good service here, don't you?

757
01:00:09,808 --> 01:00:11,969
Yes, they really
look after you here.

758
01:00:12,049 --> 01:00:14,689
This all looks delicious.

759
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,730
Excuse me, sir, madame.

760
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,051
This is filthy.
Who the hell washes up?

761
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:24,931
Find out who washes up and give
them their cards immediately.

762
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:27,612
No! On second thought,
we can't take any chances.

763
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:31,413
- Sack the entire washing-up staff
- I don't want to cause any trouble.

764
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:35,454
It's quite right that you bring
this sort of thing to our attention.

765
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:39,014
Find the manager and tell him
what has happened immediately!

766
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:42,055
- Please, I don't want to make any fuss.
- Oh, no, there's no fuss.

767
01:00:42,135 --> 01:00:44,495
We simply wish to ensure
that nothing interferes...

768
01:00:44,535 --> 01:00:46,616
with your complete
enjoyment of the meal.

769
01:00:46,696 --> 01:00:49,976
I'm sure it won't.
It was only a dirty fork.

770
01:00:50,056 --> 01:00:54,537
I know, and I'm sorry.
Bitterly sorry.

771
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:58,938
But I know nothing I can say can alter
the fact that in this restaurant...

772
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:03,539
you have been given a dirty,
filthy, smelly piece of cutlery.

773
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:05,940
- It wasn't smelly.
- It is smelly.

774
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,340
And obscene and disgusting.
I hate it.

775
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,701
- That's enough, Gilberto.
- Dirty, nasty, smutty!

776
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:15,702
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, madame.

777
01:01:15,742 --> 01:01:19,382
I'm the manager.
I've only just heard what's happened.

778
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:22,023
- May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

779
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:28,864
I want to apologize
humbly, deeply and sincerely...

780
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:30,785
about the fork.

781
01:01:30,865 --> 01:01:34,425
No. Really, it was only a tiny piece
of dirt. You can hardly see it.

782
01:01:34,505 --> 01:01:39,306
Oh, you're good, kind,
fine people for saying that.

783
01:01:39,386 --> 01:01:43,267
But I can see it.
To me it's Iike a boulder...

784
01:01:43,347 --> 01:01:45,468
a vast bowl of pus.

785
01:01:46,308 --> 01:01:51,109
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- No, it gets me here.

786
01:01:51,189 --> 01:01:54,069
I can't give you any excuses.
There are no excuses.

787
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:56,870
I've been meaning to spend
more time in the restaurant...

788
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:01,791
but I haven't been well recently and
things have been going badly back there.

789
01:02:01,871 --> 01:02:04,312
Poor old Mrs. Dalrymple
who prepares the salad...

790
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:07,072
can hardly move
her poor, swollen fingers.

791
01:02:07,112 --> 01:02:10,433
And then, of course,
there's Gilberto's war wound.

792
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:13,353
But they're good people,
and they're fine people...

793
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:16,834
and together we were beginning
to get over this bad patch.

794
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:19,515
There was light
at the end of the tunnel...

795
01:02:19,595 --> 01:02:22,155
when this...

796
01:02:22,235 --> 01:02:25,516
when this happened!

797
01:02:25,596 --> 01:02:29,437
- Can I get you some water?
- It's the end of the road!

798
01:02:31,837 --> 01:02:34,398
You bastards!

799
01:02:34,478 --> 01:02:35,958
You mean us?

800
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:39,399
You vicious,
heartless bastards!

801
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,079
Look what you've done to him.

802
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,160
He's worked his fingers to the bone
to make this place what it is!

803
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,481
And you come in here
with your petty...

804
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:53,642
vicious, heartless quibbling...

805
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:57,122
and you grind him
into the dirt.

806
01:02:59,523 --> 01:03:02,603
This fine, honorable man...

807
01:03:02,683 --> 01:03:06,484
whose boots you
are not worthy to kiss!

808
01:03:08,925 --> 01:03:12,365
Oh, it makes me mad.

809
01:03:21,127 --> 01:03:22,927
Easy, Mongo! Easy.

810
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:26,128
Stark, stirring mad.

811
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,849
No, Mongo! Oh!
Oh, the wound!

812
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:31,369
They destroyed him!

813
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:34,770
It's the end! The end.

814
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,651
He's dead.

815
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,571
They killed him!

816
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,531
Revenge.

817
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:47,572
No, Mongo!
Never kill a customer.

818
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:50,133
Oh, the wound again.

819
01:03:50,213 --> 01:03:52,573
They ruined him!

820
01:03:58,175 --> 01:04:00,975
Lucky I didn't tell'em
about the dirty knife.

821
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:41,943
Good morning.
I'm a bank robber.

822
01:04:42,023 --> 01:04:44,824
Please don't panic.
Just hand over all the money.

823
01:04:44,904 --> 01:04:47,505
This is a Iingerie shop, sir.

824
01:04:52,106 --> 01:04:53,626
Fine, fine.

825
01:04:57,387 --> 01:04:59,547
Adopt, adapt and improve.

826
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:04,028
- Well, what have you got?
- We've got corsets, stockings...

827
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,029
suspender belts, tights, bras,
slips, petticoats, knickers...

828
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:09,149
socks and garters, sir.

829
01:05:09,229 --> 01:05:10,749
Fine.

830
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,990
No large quantities
of money in safes?

831
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:18,431
No, sir.

832
01:05:18,511 --> 01:05:21,792
No piles of cash
in easy-to-carry bags?

833
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:24,072
No, sir.

834
01:05:24,152 --> 01:05:25,672
Fine.

835
01:05:35,634 --> 01:05:37,475
Just a pair of panties then,
please.

836
01:05:46,997 --> 01:05:49,037
And now for something
completely different.

837
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:56,279
Hey, did you see that?

838
01:05:58,479 --> 01:06:01,720
Did you see something
go past the window?

839
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,680
What?

840
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,880
Somebody went past
that window, downwards.

841
01:06:10,681 --> 01:06:12,402
Another one.

842
01:06:14,482 --> 01:06:16,723
Another one just went past,
downwards.

843
01:06:17,963 --> 01:06:19,043
What?

844
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:21,484
Two people have just fallen
past that window!

845
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:24,484
Fine.

846
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:29,005
Look, two people...three people
have just fallen past that window.

847
01:06:31,806 --> 01:06:33,886
Must be a board meeting.

848
01:06:33,966 --> 01:06:36,287
Oh, yeah.

849
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:40,247
- That was Wilkins of finance.
- No, that was Robertson.

850
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:43,008
- Wilkins.
- It was Robertson.

851
01:06:45,729 --> 01:06:48,529
- That was Wilkins.
- Oh, yeah.

852
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:50,610
Bet Parkinson next.

853
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,410
- Bet you it won't.
- How much?

854
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:58,451
- What?
- How much do you bet it won't? Fiver?

855
01:06:58,531 --> 01:07:01,532
- Yeah, all right.
- Right. Done. You're on.

856
01:07:01,612 --> 01:07:03,572
Parkinson next.

857
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:08,813
- Come on, Parky!
- Don't be silly, Parky!

858
01:07:08,893 --> 01:07:11,454
- Come on, Parky! Jump!
- Don't be stupid, man!

859
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:14,894
Dear Sir, I would like to complain
about that last scene...

860
01:07:14,974 --> 01:07:17,255
about people falling
out of high buildings.

861
01:07:17,295 --> 01:07:20,456
I myself have worked all
my life in such a building...

862
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,576
and have never once...

863
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:32,310
Psst. All clear.

864
01:08:41,112 --> 01:08:44,673
Vocational guidance counselor.

865
01:08:55,195 --> 01:08:58,996
Ah, Mr. Anchovy.
Do sit down.

866
01:08:59,076 --> 01:09:01,956
Oh, thank you. Take the weight
off the feet, eh?

867
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:03,957
Yes.

868
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:06,317
Lovely weather
for the time of year, I must say.

869
01:09:06,397 --> 01:09:09,678
Enough of this gay banter. Mr. Anchovy,
you asked us to advise you...

870
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:12,318
which job in life
you were best suited for.

871
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,639
- That is correct.
- Well. I have the results here...

872
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,479
of all the interviews and the aptitude
tests that you took last week...

873
01:09:17,559 --> 01:09:21,760
and from them we've built up clear
impression of the person you are...

874
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,721
and I think I can say
without fear of contradiction...

875
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:27,161
that the ideal job for you
is accountancy.

876
01:09:28,201 --> 01:09:29,642
But I am an accountant.

877
01:09:29,722 --> 01:09:32,682
Jolly good. Well, back
to the office with you then.

878
01:09:32,762 --> 01:09:34,603
No, no,
you don't understand.

879
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:37,003
I've been an accountant
for the Iast 20 years.

880
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:40,004
But I want a new job, something
exciting that will let me live.

881
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:42,324
But accountancy
is quite exciting.

882
01:09:42,404 --> 01:09:45,365
Exciting? No, it's not.

883
01:09:45,445 --> 01:09:47,965
It's dull, dull, dull!

884
01:09:48,045 --> 01:09:50,366
My God, it's dull.

885
01:09:50,406 --> 01:09:53,287
It's so deadly dull
and tedious...

886
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:57,167
and stuffy and boring
and desperately dull!

887
01:09:57,247 --> 01:10:00,008
I can't stand it any longer.
I want to live.

888
01:10:00,088 --> 01:10:03,369
Well, yes, Mr. Anchovy, but,
you see, in your report here...

889
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:06,729
it says that you are
an extremely dull person.

890
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,210
Our experts describe you as...

891
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:13,051
"an appallingly dull fellow",
"unimaginative",...

892
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:16,531
"timid, spineless, "
"easily dominated",...

893
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:19,292
"no sense of humor",
"tedious company"...

894
01:10:19,372 --> 01:10:21,572
and "irrepressibly
drab and awful".

895
01:10:21,612 --> 01:10:24,613
And where as in most professions
these would be considerable drawbacks...

896
01:10:24,693 --> 01:10:26,853
in accountancy
they are a positive boon.

897
01:10:26,933 --> 01:10:30,494
I'm only as awful as this
because accountancy does this to people.

898
01:10:30,574 --> 01:10:33,095
Can't you help me?

899
01:10:33,135 --> 01:10:35,135
Any idea of what you want to be?

900
01:10:35,215 --> 01:10:37,856
- Yes. Yes, I have.
- What is it?

901
01:10:37,936 --> 01:10:40,296
A lion tamer.

902
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:45,337
Yes. Of course,
it's a bit of a jump, isn't it...

903
01:10:45,417 --> 01:10:47,818
accountancy to lion taming
in one go?

904
01:10:47,898 --> 01:10:51,858
Don't think it'd be better to work your
way towards lion taming via banking?

905
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:54,139
- Or insurance?
- No! I don't want to wait.

906
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,499
I want to start immediately.
Tomorrow morning at 9:00...

907
01:10:56,539 --> 01:10:58,660
I want to be in there, taming.

908
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,940
Yes, but what qualifications
do you have?

909
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,581
- I've got a hat.
- A hat?

910
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:07,462
Yes, a lion taming hat, a hat
with "Lion Tamer" written on it...

911
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:10,702
and it lights up, saying "Lion Tamer"
in big red neon letters...

912
01:11:10,742 --> 01:11:12,663
so you can tame them
after dark.

913
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:15,183
- I see.
- During the day, you switch it off...

914
01:11:15,223 --> 01:11:18,504
and you can claim it as reasonable wear
and tear under "allowable expenses"...

915
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:20,464
under paragraph 335...

916
01:11:20,504 --> 01:11:23,465
Yes. I follow.
But, you see, the snag is...

917
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,865
if I now call the service
and say to them...

918
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:30,066
"I've got a 45-year-old accountant
who wants to become a lion tamer"...

919
01:11:30,146 --> 01:11:34,027
their first question is not going to be
"Does he have his own hat?"

920
01:11:34,107 --> 01:11:38,068
They're more likely to ask
what experience you've had with lions.

921
01:11:38,108 --> 01:11:41,628
- I've seen'em at the zoo.
- Good.

922
01:11:41,709 --> 01:11:45,589
Little brown, furry creatures with
short, stumpy legs and great long noses.

923
01:11:45,629 --> 01:11:48,230
I could tame one of those.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

924
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,390
Look pretty tame
to start with.

925
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:53,031
And these lions,
how high are they?

926
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:56,912
Oh, about so high.
They don't frighten me at all.

927
01:11:56,992 --> 01:11:59,112
And do these Iions eat ants?

928
01:11:59,192 --> 01:12:01,032
Yes, that's right.

929
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:07,354
Well, I'm afraid what you've got hold of
there, Mr. Anchovy, is an anteater.

930
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:10,514
- A what?
- An anteater, not a lion.

931
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:12,875
You see a lion,
is a huge savage beast...

932
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:15,035
about ten-foot long,
five-foot high...

933
01:12:15,115 --> 01:12:17,476
with masses of sharp,
pointy teeth...

934
01:12:17,516 --> 01:12:19,636
and nasty, long,
razor-sharp claws.

935
01:12:19,716 --> 01:12:21,677
It looks like this.

936
01:12:23,717 --> 01:12:27,198
- Now. shall I call the circus?
- No!

937
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:30,118
I like your idea
of making the move...

938
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:32,119
to lion taming
by easy stages...

939
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,999
say by insurance
or banking.

940
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:37,400
- Banking?
- Yes, banking. I see it now.

941
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,520
It's a man's life, isn't it?
Travel. excitement...

942
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,561
decisions affecting people's lives,
romance, thrills.

943
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:45,721
I'll put you in touch
with the bank.

944
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:49,842
Probably.

945
01:12:49,922 --> 01:12:53,283
I'd like a couple of days to think
about it, 'cause it is a big decision.

946
01:12:53,363 --> 01:12:55,523
Or maybe, maybe a week,
at most, you know?

947
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:59,644
But I do want to make this decision.
I'd like to do banking...

948
01:12:59,724 --> 01:13:01,285
It's sad, isn't it...

949
01:13:01,325 --> 01:13:04,285
that this is what
accountancy does to people?

950
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:08,086
The only way that we can fight this
terrible, debilitating social disease...

951
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:11,327
I only want to be famous.
I only want to see my name in lights.

952
01:13:11,407 --> 01:13:13,287
And so you shall.

953
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:23,049
Cue!

954
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:31,331
Hello, good evening,
and welcome to "Blackmail."

955
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,851
To start tonight's program,
we go north to Preston in Lancashire...

956
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:36,772
and Mrs. Betty Teal.

957
01:13:38,292 --> 01:13:42,853
Hello Mrs. Teal.
Now, Mrs. Teal, this is for $15...

958
01:13:42,933 --> 01:13:46,694
and is to stop us revealing
the name of your lover in Bolton.

959
01:13:46,774 --> 01:13:49,774
So, Mrs. Teal, send us $15
by return of post, please...

960
01:13:49,854 --> 01:13:53,615
and your husband Trevor and your lovely
children Diane, Janice and Juliet...

961
01:13:53,655 --> 01:13:57,816
need never know the name
of your lover in Bolton.

962
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:06,178
Now, a letter, a series
of photographs...

963
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:09,498
and a hotel registration book
which could add up to divorce...

964
01:14:09,538 --> 01:14:12,339
premature retirement and
possible criminal proceedings...

965
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:14,780
for a company director
in Bromsgrove.

966
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,900
He's a Freemason
and a conservative M.P.

967
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:20,501
So, Mr. S. of Bromsgrove,
that's $3,000, please...

968
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:24,902
to stop us revealing your name, the name
of the three other people involved...

969
01:14:24,982 --> 01:14:27,062
the youth organization
to which they belong...

970
01:14:27,102 --> 01:14:29,342
and the shop where
you bought the equipment.

971
01:14:36,664 --> 01:14:39,825
Well, we'll be showing you more of that
photograph later in the program...

972
01:14:39,905 --> 01:14:43,585
unless we hear
from Charles or Michael.

973
01:14:43,665 --> 01:14:46,066
Now it's time for
our "Stop The Film" spot.

974
01:14:46,146 --> 01:14:47,986
The rules are very simple.

975
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,427
We have taken a film which
contains compromising scenes...

976
01:14:50,467 --> 01:14:54,428
and unpleasant details
which could wreck a man's career.

977
01:14:54,508 --> 01:14:57,628
But the victim may phone me
at any time and stop the film.

978
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:00,749
But don't forget, the money increases
as the film goes on...

979
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,669
so the longer you leave it,
the more you have to pay.

980
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:08,470
So, with the clock at  $300 this week's
"Stop the Film" visited Temstead.

981
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,961
He's a very brave man.

982
01:16:07,322 --> 01:16:09,883
No, sir. No.

983
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:12,443
I'm sure you didn't, sir.
No, that's all right.

984
01:16:12,523 --> 01:16:15,244
We don't morally censure.
We just want the money.

985
01:16:15,324 --> 01:16:17,324
And here's the address
to send it to:

986
01:16:21,525 --> 01:16:23,926
Thank you, sir.

987
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:28,847
Ah. There you are.

988
01:16:28,887 --> 01:16:31,247
Well, that's quite
enough of that.

989
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:33,168
And now...

990
01:16:36,048 --> 01:16:40,769
a local civic group reenacts
a famous scene from history.

991
01:16:40,849 --> 01:16:44,970
This week, the Townswomen Guild
of Sheffield in Yorkshire.

992
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:46,530
Miss Rita Fairbanks...

993
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:49,411
you organized this representation
of the Battle of Pearl Harbor.

994
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:50,931
Why?

995
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:54,012
Weve always been extremely
interested in modern works.

996
01:16:54,092 --> 01:16:58,573
We were the first townswomen's guild
to perform "Camp on Blood Island"...

997
01:16:58,653 --> 01:17:00,213
and, of course, last year...

998
01:17:00,293 --> 01:17:04,334
we did our extremely popular
reenactment of Nazi war atrocities...

999
01:17:04,414 --> 01:17:07,375
so this year we thought we'd do
something in a much lighter vein.

1000
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,575
I can see that you're all ready to go,
so I'Il just wish you good luck...

1001
01:17:10,655 --> 01:17:13,136
in your latest venture,
"The Battle of Pearl Harbor."

1002
01:17:13,216 --> 01:17:16,536
Thank you very much
indeed, young man.

1003
01:17:42,702 --> 01:17:44,302
Oh, Brian.

1004
01:17:44,382 --> 01:17:46,222
Oh, Elsbeth.

1005
01:17:56,264 --> 01:17:58,945
Be gentle with me.

1006
01:18:30,511 --> 01:18:34,952
Oh, Brian, are you gonna do anything
or just show me films all evening?

1007
01:18:34,992 --> 01:18:36,593
Just one more, dear.

1008
01:18:47,315 --> 01:18:49,995
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Brantley Park...

1009
01:18:50,035 --> 01:18:52,996
just as the competitors are
running out onto the field...

1010
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:55,836
on this lovely winter afternoon
with the going firm under foot...

1011
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:57,797
and very little sign of rain.

1012
01:18:57,877 --> 01:19:00,237
Looks like we're in for
a splendid afternoon sport...

1013
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:04,078
on this, the 127th
"Upper Class Twit of the Year" show.

1014
01:19:04,118 --> 01:19:07,599
There's a big crowd here today
to see these prize idiots in action.

1015
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,159
Vivian Smith Smythe Smith.

1016
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,320
He's in the Grenadier Guards,
and can count to four.

1017
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,080
Simon Zinc Trumpet Harris.

1018
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,961
He's an old Italian and married
to an attractive table lamp.

1019
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,841
Nigel Incubator Jones.
His best friend is a tree...

1020
01:19:18,881 --> 01:19:21,002
and in his spare time
he's a stockbroker.

1021
01:19:21,082 --> 01:19:23,642
Javais Brookhamster.
He's in the wine trade...

1022
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:26,043
and his father uses him
as a wastepaper basket.

1023
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:29,043
And finally, Oliver Singen Mollusk,
another old Italian.

1024
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:32,044
His father was a cabinet minister
and his mother won the derby.

1025
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:34,724
He's thought by many to be
this year's outstanding twit.

1026
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:37,605
And now the twits are moving
up to the starting line...

1027
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:40,486
and any moment now they'll be
under starter's orders.

1028
01:19:40,566 --> 01:19:42,406
I'm afraid they're facing
the wrong way at the moment...

1029
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,326
the wrong way at the moment,
but the starter will sort this out.

1030
01:19:44,406 --> 01:19:49,327
Any moment now they're going to have the
big off. This is always a tense moment.

1031
01:19:49,407 --> 01:19:51,128
And they're off!

1032
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:54,768
No, they're not. They didn't realize
that they had to start with the gun.

1033
01:19:54,848 --> 01:19:58,049
I think the starter has explained to
them. Several are beginning to point.

1034
01:19:58,129 --> 01:20:00,450
And ready again,
and off again!

1035
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:02,370
This time, yes,
a really fast start!

1036
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:05,811
It's Vivian going for the lead
Oliver's running wide to the right!

1037
01:20:05,891 --> 01:20:08,451
And to the left but,
he'll soon pick up the line...

1038
01:20:08,531 --> 01:20:11,172
into the first event which is,
walking along a straight line.

1039
01:20:11,252 --> 01:20:13,852
The twits have to walk along these lines
without falling over.

1040
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,373
This is Oliver's worst event.
He's having a little trouble.

1041
01:20:16,453 --> 01:20:19,253
Simon's coming through.
Nigel's coming through.

1042
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,454
Oliver's over at the back. Never mind.
He'll get up. He's a great fighter.

1043
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:24,454
He's having...
Oh dear, never mind.

1044
01:20:24,534 --> 01:20:27,335
We're coming to the second event,
the matchbox jump.

1045
01:20:27,415 --> 01:20:30,816
Two layers of matchboxes for the twits
to clear. Nigel and Simon are over!

1046
01:20:30,856 --> 01:20:32,896
And Vivian has refused.

1047
01:20:32,976 --> 01:20:35,177
And now,
it's "Kicking the Beggar".

1048
01:20:35,257 --> 01:20:39,177
And Nigel to put the brogue in there!
Oh, beautifully placed!

1049
01:20:39,257 --> 01:20:41,578
The beggar is down,
and the crowd really loved it!

1050
01:20:41,658 --> 01:20:44,298
And here it's Oliver.
He hasn't cleared the jump.

1051
01:20:44,378 --> 01:20:46,619
Oh, if only his father
could understand.

1052
01:20:46,699 --> 01:20:49,179
And now it's
"Running Over the Old Lady".

1053
01:20:49,259 --> 01:20:52,740
Simon in the lead and he's done
it beautifully, right in the midriff.

1054
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,661
Back to Oliver.
Oh, he's magnificent, this man.

1055
01:20:55,701 --> 01:20:57,981
He doesn't know when he's beaten. He
doesn't know what he's winning either.

1056
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:02,022
He has no sort of sensory apparatus
known to man. Bad luck. Oliver.

1057
01:21:02,102 --> 01:21:04,983
And now, it's "Waking the Neighbor".
Simon's there at the front.

1058
01:21:05,063 --> 01:21:09,304
He's slamming that door, and woken
the neighbor Simon's moved into first.

1059
01:21:09,384 --> 01:21:11,224
The crowd is really excited!

1060
01:21:11,304 --> 01:21:13,264
And now it's
"Shooting the Rabbits".

1061
01:21:13,344 --> 01:21:17,025
These rabbits have been staked to the
ground so they can't move too much...

1062
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:20,386
as this is only
a one-day event.

1063
01:21:20,466 --> 01:21:23,826
There's mist there which I think is
causing the twits a bit of trouble.

1064
01:21:23,906 --> 01:21:26,427
And Javais is using
the butt of his rifle!

1065
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:28,988
Vivian's going in with a fist,
and Javais is first away!

1066
01:21:29,068 --> 01:21:31,548
And Oliver
has run himself over!

1067
01:21:31,628 --> 01:21:33,468
What a great twit!

1068
01:21:33,548 --> 01:21:36,909
And now, it's "Taking the Bras off
the Debutantes from the Back".

1069
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:39,990
This is a particularly difficult
event for most of the twits...

1070
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:42,950
one of the ones that takes the most time
on this exacting course.

1071
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:47,311
The crowd are getting excited, and I
think the twits are getting excited too.

1072
01:21:47,391 --> 01:21:51,112
And it's Simon into the lead,
closely followed by Nigel!

1073
01:21:51,192 --> 01:21:53,192
And it's the final event now!

1074
01:21:53,272 --> 01:21:56,193
They have to shoot themselves
to become upper class twit of the year.

1075
01:21:56,273 --> 01:21:59,714
Simon can't get the bra off his finger
it's Nigel there!

1076
01:21:59,794 --> 01:22:01,834
Nigel misses!
Simon's missing!

1077
01:22:01,914 --> 01:22:04,715
Nigel misses again!
And Javais has shot himself!

1078
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,755
Javais is
upper class twit of the year!

1079
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:09,996
Vivian is there!
He's not having any luck!

1080
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:13,156
Simon shoots.
Simon has shot Vivian!

1081
01:22:13,236 --> 01:22:15,797
Simon has shot Vivian
into second place.

1082
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:18,518
And Simon shoots himself.
Simon is third.

1083
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:22,038
And Nigel clubs himself
into fourth place!

1084
01:22:22,078 --> 01:22:23,959
And so, the final result:

1085
01:22:23,999 --> 01:22:25,879
first and upper class
twit of the year...

1086
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:27,959
Javais Brookhamster of Kensington...

1087
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:30,560
runner up, Vivian Smith Smythe Smith
of Mayfair...

1088
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,281
and third, Simon Zinc
Trumpet Harris of Kensington.
