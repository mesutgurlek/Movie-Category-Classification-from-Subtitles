1
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,884  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:519
I'll knock your block off, you big stiff!
You're a bum!

2
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:32,251  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:519
Strike! You're out!

3
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,161  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:522
Elmer, here it is.

4
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:00,764  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I knew you'd find it.
-Boy, I could sure use a drink.

5
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:05,566  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:524
I wonder if any big shots
are getting married today?

6
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:10,890  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:524
Looks like the same suckers
get married every day.

7
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:12,041  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:519
Come on.

8
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,482  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

9
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,210  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now what's he hiding from?

10
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:31,045  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:522
-Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?
-Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic?

11
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:35,806  X1:071 X2:646 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, it's not him. But what a scoop it'd be!

12
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:40,323  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:524
The guy who wrote The Bachelor's Bible
getting hooked. It's too good to be true.

13
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:42,767  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:524
Let's snap the mayor
in his new fire helmet and go.

14
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,808  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let's stick around, see who the guy is.

15
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:47,452  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Two by two they come and go"

16
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,803  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:524
Good morning, children.
Your name, please?

17
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:51,803  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Elaine Harper.
-Speak a little louder.

18
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:53,086  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:524
Elaine Harper.

19
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,005  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you. Yours?

20
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,688  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Mortimer Brewster.
-How's that?

21
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,691  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mortimer Brewster.

22
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,525  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
Speak up, sonny.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

23
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,570  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
I want to keep this undercover.

24
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,849  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:524
Love her? Of course you love her.
You're marrying her, right?

25
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,684  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:519
You don't understand. Come here.

26
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,808  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't want this to get out for a while.

27
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:22,610  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:519
I'm Mortimer Brewster.

28
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:24,247  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:519
You're who?

29
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:25,726  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mortimer Brew--

30
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:30,687  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:519
That's him!

31
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:33,126  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mr. Brewster!

32
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,245  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:062 Y2:102
Now, look--

33
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,360  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:062 Y2:104
Goodbye, dear.

34
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:51,249  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't you understand?
How can I marry you?

35
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,523  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:524
Me, the symbol of bachelorhood.
I've sneered at every love scene.

36
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:57,162  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've written four million words
against marriage!

37
00:03:57,252 --> 00:04:01,291  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
Not only hooked, but to a minister's
daughter, and a girl from Brooklyn.

38
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:04,648  X1:069 X2:648 Y1:448 Y2:524
Look at the way you look!
What is that contraption you've got there?

39
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:08,647  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:524
A pin I borrowed from your aunts.
You know, "Something borrowed--"

40
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:11,565  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
I know, "Something borrowed,
something blue." Old, new.

41
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,086  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
Rice and old shoes.
Carry you over the threshold.

42
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,164  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:519
Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe.
Is this what I've come to?

43
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:19,971  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:524
I can't go through with it.
I won't marry you. That's that.

44
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,885  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Yes, Mortimer.
-What do you mean, "Yes, Mortimer"?

45
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,367  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:524
Aren't you insulted?
Aren't you going to cry?

46
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:28,330  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:522
-No, Mortimer.
-And don't "No, Mortimer" me, either!

47
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,283  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
Marriage is a superstition.

48
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:32,369  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:519
It's old-fashioned. It's....

49
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:18,440  X1:067 X2:650 Y1:482 Y2:524
O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't realize...

50
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:21,444  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:524
...l'm turning over to you
the nicest, best beat in Brooklyn.

51
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:24,330  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:519
Now look at that old church.
And them old houses.

52
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,008  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did George Washington ever sleep here?

53
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:30,721  X1:064 X2:654 Y1:448 Y2:524
Of course he did. This whole neighborhood
just stinks with atmosphere.

54
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:34,244  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:524
-And look at that old house.
-The original owners still there?

55
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:36,641  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:519
Don't crack wise
about the Brewster sisters.

56
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:40,771  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:519
They're two of the dearest, sweetest
old ladies that ever walked the earth.

57
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,604  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're out of this world.

58
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:46,563  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're like pressed rose leaves.

59
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:48,126  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:519
Pressed rose leaves?

60
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,523  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:524
The old girls must be kind of hard up.

61
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,448  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:519
Their old man left them fixed for life.

62
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,602  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't you call them "the girls," either.

63
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,284  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:524
Brophy. Is Lieutenant around?

64
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,169  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
So what are they renting rooms for?

65
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:03,369  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:524
They don't. But you can bet
if anybody came looking for a room...

66
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:06,649  X1:062 X2:654 Y1:448 Y2:524
...they wouldn't go away
without a good meal and a couple of bucks.

67
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,360  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's their way of digging up people
to do good to.

68
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:21,129  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:524
Reverend Harper, I do hope
you don't disapprove of Mortimer...

69
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:25,444  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:524
...because he's a dramatic critic
and takes your daughter to the theater.

70
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:28,292  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's not that I disapprove
of his being a critic...

71
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:31,728  X1:064 X2:654 Y1:482 Y2:524
...but no man with this published attitude...

72
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:36,724  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:524
...should take any man's daughter
anyplace, at any time.

73
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,970  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
I must be catching cold.

74
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:44,010  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, dear. It was Reverend Harper
who sneezed. Bless you.

75
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,642  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
We mustn't be angry with Mortimer.

76
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:51,725  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:524
He's so very much in love with her.
Sister Martha and I are so happy.

77
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,049  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:524
He used to come to see us
only occasionally, and now...

78
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:57,442  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:524
...he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

79
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,968  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:524
Remember now, watch your language.

80
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,009  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know I'm not a swearing man.

81
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:05,845  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:524
You'd be surprised
what they'd consider swearing.

82
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:11,841  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:524
Will you excuse me?
No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

83
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:18,167  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Come right in, Mr. Brophy.
-Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

84
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,886  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:524
This is Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my beat.

85
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:23,930  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:524
-How do you do, miss?
-Welcome to our neighborhood.

86
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:26,162  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:524
Gentlemen, what news
have you brought me?

87
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:28,568  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
Colonel, we have nothing to report.

88
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,282  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, absolutely nothing to report.

89
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:35,366  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:524
Splendid!

90
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,688  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you, gentlemen. At ease.

91
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:42,084  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:519
You know the Reverend Dr. Harper
from the church next door?

92
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:45,482  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:519
Hello. This is Officer O'Hara,
the new man on the beat.

93
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:48,086  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:482 Y2:524
How do you do, sir? It's nice to meet you.

94
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:55,000  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
The toys are on the chair up here,
by the library door.

95
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:02,808  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:524
Teddy, run upstairs and bring down your
Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room.

96
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,291  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're all packed.

97
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:10,448  X1:066 X2:652 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's splendid work you men do, fixing up
discarded toys for the kids at camp.

98
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:11,607  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:524
Charge!

99
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:24,247  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:524
It gives us something to do at the station.
You get tired of playing cards.

100
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,125  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:524
-So these are the toys?
-How's Mrs. Brophy?

101
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,931  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:522
She's better, thank you.
But a little weak, still.

102
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:39,651  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll get some beef broth
for you to take to her.

103
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,451  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:524
Please don't bother.
You've done so much already.

104
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,961  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
Stop the nonsense! I won't be a minute.

105
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:54,563  X1:080 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:524
Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness
and absolute generosity are...

106
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,531  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:519
...it's because I've known
the Brewster sisters.

107
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,846  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
Teddy, you promised me
you wouldn't do that anymore.

108
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:07,924  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:524
But I have to call a Cabinet meeting
to get those supplies.

109
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,446  X1:069 X2:650 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now don't do that again. Do you hear me?

110
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,085  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
He used to do that at night...

111
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:18,811  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
...and the neighbors raised Cain.
They're afraid of him.

112
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,282  X1:077 X2:643 Y1:448 Y2:519
Look, Sarge, I promised I wouldn't swear,
but what the heck--

113
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:24,206  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's going on here?

114
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,886  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He's quite harmless.
-He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.

115
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:29,770  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:519
There's a lot of worse guys
he could think he was.

116
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,286  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's right.

117
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,767  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll make a note.
He's an interesting character.

118
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,570  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:522
Isn't it a shame, Father....

119
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:42,091  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:524
Isn't it a shame, Reverend, that this nice
family should be hatching a cuckoo?

120
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,886  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, now, isn't this nice!

121
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:48,486  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.
-How do you do?

122
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:51,245  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Good afternoon.
-Reverend, how do you do?

123
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:54,011  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:524
Miss Martha, Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my duties.

124
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,207  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:524
How do you do?

125
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,522  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I'm very glad to know you.
-Thank you.

126
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,125  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
Martha, you're back.

127
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,249  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:524
Here's the broth for Mrs. Brophy.
Be sure it's good and hot.

128
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:05,641  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:524
You bet I will, and thank you very much.

129
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:08,041  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:524
The Army and Navy are ready for action.

130
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:11,085  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
Colonel, this is grand.
It'll make a lot of kids happy.

131
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,083  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's this? The Oregon?

132
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:15,163  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Teddy, dear, put it back.

133
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,972  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:524
-But the Oregon goes to Australia.
-Now, Teddy....

134
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,804  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, it goes to Australia.

135
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,964  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:519
-These are lovely. Thank you.
-Not at all.

136
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:28,250  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:519
-The children will go crazy.
-Don't mention it.

137
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:29,845  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:524
So long, Colonel.

138
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,246  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, Sarge.

139
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,886  X1:316 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:519
Yes.

140
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:36,721  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:519
Dismissed!

141
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:40,320  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Goodbye and thank you.
-Don't mention it.

142
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:43,211  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Careful of the step with the toys.
-Good night.

143
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:49,681  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

144
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:55,251  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
Goodbye.

145
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,883  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Well, I must be going.
-Charge!

146
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,410  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
Charge the blockhouse!

147
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,161  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:519
Blockhouse?

148
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,407  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
The stairs are always San Juan Hill.

149
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:17,521  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bless you!

150
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:20,041  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:519
Have you tried to persuade him
he wasn't Roosevelt?

151
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:23,329  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Oh, no!
-He's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

152
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,808  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
Do you remember, Martha?

153
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:29,402  X1:063 X2:654 Y1:448 Y2:524
Once, a long time ago,
we thought if he'd be George Washington...

154
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:32,211  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
...it might be a change for him,
and we suggested it.

155
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,323  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
And do you know what happened?

156
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:37,802  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:524
He just stayed under his bed for days
and wouldn't be anybody.

157
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:42,162  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
Well, if he's happy, and what's
more important, you're happy....

158
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,852  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:524
Our only worry for Teddy
is after we're gone.

159
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,282  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem.

160
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,840  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:524
Mortimer's made all the arrangements
for Teddy...

161
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:52,969  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
...to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium
after we pass on.

162
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,441  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
Splendid idea! A very pleasant place.

163
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:01,803  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

164
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:07,762  X1:067 X2:651 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know, Martha,
I do believe he's beginning to see the light.

165
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,683  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sure we needn't worry about him.

166
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,969  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:519
He won't interfere with our plans
for Mortimer and Elaine.

167
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,684  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did you just have tea?

168
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:16,728  X1:316 X2:401 Y1:482 Y2:519
Yes.

169
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,211  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
And dinner's going to be late, too.

170
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,570  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:524
So, why?

171
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:28,284  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
Good news for you.

172
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,921  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're going to Panama
and dig another lock for the canal.

173
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,124  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:524
Delighted!

174
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:36,283  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's bully! Just bully!

175
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,921  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:524
I shall prepare at once for the journey.

176
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,007  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:524
Charge!

177
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,088  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
Abby! While I was out?

178
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,606  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you.

179
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,923  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
I didn't know when you'd be back,
and Reverend Harper was coming.

180
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:59,049  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:524
-But all by yourself.
-I got along fine.

181
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,772  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:522
-I'll run right downstairs and see.
-No, dear.

182
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,969  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:519
There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

183
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:08,962  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:519
Well?

184
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,206  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:519
Just look in the windowseat.

185
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:28,248  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:524
-It's Elaine!
-Hello, darlings.

186
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,043  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:519
-But, Elaine!
-What did she mean?

187
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:35,402  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
You don't suppose they've gone and--

188
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:41,047  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:524
Listen, buddy.

189
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,602  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:524
-This old cab has seen osculation but....
-You ain't seen anything yet.

190
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,286  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You've got to drive us to the station.
-Take her hat.

191
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,962  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:519
Wait a minute. And her brooch.

192
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:52,845  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:519
If you find her hairpins, keep them.
Hold on to that.

193
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:58,120  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:524
There they are.

194
00:13:58,692 --> 00:13:59,966  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
Here's your hat.

195
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:03,280  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
Just throw it.
I don't like that look in your eyes.

196
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:07,206  X1:065 X2:652 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What's the matter with it?
-Father preached about it only last Sunday.

197
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:09,324  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
He did? What did he say?

198
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:12,091  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He was against it.
-But that was only Sunday.

199
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,563  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:519
Please! For heaven's sake!

200
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,326  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
But, Mortimer, right out here
with everyone looking?

201
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,880  X1:071 X2:645 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, right out here with everyone looking.

202
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,247  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

203
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:37,884  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:524
But, Mortimer, you're going to love me
for my mind, too?

204
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,570  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524
One thing at a time.

205
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:41,290  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's that look again!

206
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:46,449  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:524
"There's that look again, Mortimer! "
You better get used to it.

207
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,251  X1:068 X2:649 Y1:482 Y2:524
You'll see it often. It goes just before this.

208
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:53,168  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know what we're doing?
Wasting time.

209
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,288  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your....

210
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:58,728  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, don't tell your father.
You'll run his cold into a pneumonia.

211
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,888  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:519
I can handle Father. He's a dear.

212
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:03,770  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
Look, why don't we wire him
from Niagara Falls?

213
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,571  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:524
Niagara Falls?

214
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,128  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's why you stopped at your office.

215
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:10,601  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes, certainly!
We're going to go the whole hog.

216
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:13,126  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:524
Niagara Falls!
Everybody ought to go there.

217
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,721  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:524
You should've seen my secretary's face.

218
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,690  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:519
We've a room on the train,
the bridal suite in the hotel...

219
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,525  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:524
...and tomorrow morning
we go over the falls in a barrel.

220
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:24,410  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

221
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:27,245  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:524
I don't have to.
I started packing the day after I met you.

222
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:29,129  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
There, you see! You see?

223
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:32,130  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:519
That's what I mean.
That's what I hate about women.

224
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,568  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
I wonder what Mary's doing now?

225
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:45,164  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:519
-The train leaves in an hour, hurry.
-It'll be a few minutes.

226
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:48,210  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Father may want to pray over me.
-Whistle when you're ready.

227
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:51,043  X1:063 X2:655 Y1:482 Y2:524
When you whistle, open the front door fast.

228
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:54,488  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:519
If you see a tall, dark streak of light,
it's me.

229
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,127  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:519
What? Now?

230
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,361  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:522
No, not now!

231
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,523  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look surprised when he tells us.

232
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:09,491  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hold on to your bustles.

233
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:11,961  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:519
We're married. Elaine and I are married.

234
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,724  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, darling, how wonderful!

235
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,882  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
Isn't it wonderful? They're married!

236
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:19,442  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't pretend to be so surprised either,
you two old frauds.

237
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:22,208  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Can I use the telephone?
-Of course.

238
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,806  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:522
Isn't it too, too wonderful?

239
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:27,884  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:524
And to think that it happened
right here in this room!

240
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,280  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:522
Now, here.

241
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,642  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:519
Benson's Florists?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

242
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,405  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:519
Did you send those roses
to Mrs. Brewster? Good.

243
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:38,802  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:448 Y2:519
Send four dozen more to drawing room A,
Grand Central Station.

244
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:41,690  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
Hurry. And throw in a flock
of orange blossoms.

245
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:44,246  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:519
But before you go,
we can have our celebration.

246
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,482  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing.

247
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,324  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
And we'll invite a few neighbors in.

248
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:51,961  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:519
-And, of course, a wedding cake.
-You won't have time to bake a cake.

249
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:54,287  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
We're going to Niagara Falls.
A taxi's waiting.

250
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,681  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's all ready. It's been ready since--

251
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:59,240  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:524
I bet it's been ready
since the first day I met her.

252
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:01,892  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
Did everybody know
I was getting married, except me?

253
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,486  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:524
We knew you'd find out about it in time.

254
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:08,482  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've got the two nicest aunts in the world.

255
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,245  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
Of course, you've got
the nicest nephew in the world, too.

256
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:14,252  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
Well, I'll run along
and get everything ready.

257
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:17,770  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend
isn't too angry.

258
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,570  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know how your books upset him.

259
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:23,440  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm going to burn all my books.
I'll let the Reverend light the first match.

260
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,042  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
Did I leave some notes here
for my new book?

261
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,088  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
You mean Mind Over Matrimony?

262
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:29,721  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where are they?

263
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:32,167  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I hid them someplace--
-Come along.

264
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,207  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now you behave.

265
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,681  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:519
Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

266
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,128  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:522
Hello, Mortimer!

267
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:46,562  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:524
-How are you, Mr. President?
-Bully, thank you. Just bully.

268
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:50,082  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What news have you brought me?
-The country's squarely behind you.

269
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,208  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

270
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:55,290  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

271
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,370  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
Goodbye, Mr. President.

272
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,608  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
A new lock for the canal, you know.

273
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,162  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:522
"Oh, tell the news to Mother"

274
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:06,252  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Oh, dear.
-Find those notes? What's wrong?

275
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:09,091  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
There's a baby picture
of your brother Jonathan.

276
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:13,883  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:524
You ought to put that in the fire
with my books. My, what a face!

277
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,487  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:524
I remember now.
He'd scare grownups with it.

278
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:18,847  X1:065 X2:652 Y1:482 Y2:524
Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me.

279
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,402  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:519
Do you remember how he used to cut
worms in two with his teeth?

280
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:27,287  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
Jonathan? He's probably in prison
or hanged or something by now.

281
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,803  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:519
I saw a play, had a character in it,
reminded me of Jonathan.

282
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:31,847  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:524
Really?

283
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:36,331  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:519
A honey of a lunatic. One of those
whodunits called Murder Will Out.

284
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:37,448  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, dear!

285
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,965  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, what a play.

286
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:44,121  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:524
When the curtain goes up,
the first thing you see is a dead body.

287
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:45,811  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:524
The next thing--

288
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,241  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, mister.

289
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:32,241  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Happy bridegroom!
-Congratulations, darling!

290
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,008  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:519
Never mind that now.

291
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,850  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, listen, darlings.

292
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:43,522  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know how we've always planned
to send Teddy to Happy Dale?

293
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:46,001  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

294
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:48,925  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:519
Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper
about it.

295
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:52,767  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:519
Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now.
At once!

296
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:56,731  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He's in the cellar. Get him up here now.
-There's no such hurry as that.

297
00:19:57,012 --> 00:20:00,766  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:524
When Teddy's working on the canal,
you can't get his mind on anything else.

298
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,005  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, look, darlings.

299
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:06,164  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm frightfully sorry,
but I've got an awful shock for you.

300
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:08,608  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
Teddy's killed a man, darlings!

301
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,601  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:519
Nonsense!

302
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,643  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's a body in the windowseat!

303
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:14,962  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, dear. We know.

304
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,162  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You know?
-Of course.

305
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,806  X1:079 X2:637 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

306
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:26,485  X1:080 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it.

307
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,722  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
Forget you ever saw the gentleman.

308
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:30,322  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:524
Forget?

309
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,687  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
We never dreamed you'd peek.

310
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:34,606  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:482 Y2:519
What the....

311
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,761  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:519
Who is he?

312
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,884  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:519
He's a Mr. Hoskins. Adam Hoskins.

313
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:44,082  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's really all I know about him,
except that he's a Methodist.

314
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:46,447  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:519
He's a Methodist? lsn't that nice.

315
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,807  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's all you know?
What's he doing here?

316
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,883  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:519
-What happened to him?
-He died.

317
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:54,489  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:519
Aunt Martha, men just don't get
into windowseats and die.

318
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,365  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:522
No, dear. He died first.

319
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,290  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
Wait! Stop all this.

320
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:02,330  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:522
Now look, how did he die?

321
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:05,012  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive.

322
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:10,202  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:524
The gentleman died because he drank
some wine with poison in it.

323
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,368  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
How did the poison get in the wine?

324
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,886  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:519
We put it in wine
because it's less noticeable.

325
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:19,406  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:522
When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

326
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,766  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:524
You mean you....

327
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:24,211  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
You put it in the wine?

328
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:27,648  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:519
Yes. And I put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat...

329
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:30,007  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
...because Reverend Harper was coming.

330
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,530  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look at me, darling.

331
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:40,047  X1:064 X2:654 Y1:448 Y2:524
You knew what you'd done and didn't want
Reverend Harper to see the body?

332
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,204  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
Well, not at tea.
That wouldn't have been very nice.

333
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,291  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's first-degree.

334
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,921  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:524
Now, Mortimer, you know all about it
and just forget about it.

335
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:55,171  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:448 Y2:519
I do think that Martha and I have the right
to our own little secrets.

336
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:02,247  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:519
Abby, while I was out I dropped in
on Mrs. Schultz. She's much better.

337
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:04,687  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:524
But she wants us to take Junior
to the movies again.

338
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:06,888  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
We must do that, tomorrow or next day.

339
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,930  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes, but this time we'll go
where we want to go.

340
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:14,211  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:524
Junior's not going to drag me
into another one of those scary pictures.

341
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:18,731  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:524
They ought not to be allowed
to make pictures just to frighten people.

342
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:39,007  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:524
Operator?

343
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:41,243  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
Can you hear my voice?

344
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:43,201  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:519
You can?

345
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:44,846  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:524
Are you sure?

346
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:47,246  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:519
Then I must be here.

347
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:17,090  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:519
The dears. Isn't Halloween
a wonderful time for them?

348
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,766  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

349
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,527  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient.

350
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,007  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:519
-We'll let you lick the bowl.
-Lick the bowl?

351
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,560  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:524
I don't want to.
I want to know what we're going to do!

352
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:30,290  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're going to celebrate.

353
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:33,131  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:519
Celebrate? There's a body
in the windowseat!

354
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,009  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, dear. Mr. Hoskins.

355
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,369  X1:078 X2:641 Y1:448 Y2:524
I know what his name is. I want to know
what we're going to do.

356
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:41,444  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:524
-We can't turn you over to the police.
-Stop worrying about it.

357
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:43,643  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:524
We told you to forget the whole thing.

358
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:47,964  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:524
Forget? Can't I make you realize
that something has to be done?

359
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,883  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, Mortimer, you behave.

360
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:53,004  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're too old
to be flying off the handle like this.

361
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,047  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:522
-But Mr. Hodgekiss--
-Hoskins, dear.

362
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,600  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:524
Whatever his name is,
you can't leave him in there.

363
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:00,205  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:522
We don't intend to, dear.

364
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:03,329  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:524
Teddy's down in the cellar now,
digging the lock.

365
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:11,367  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're going to bury
Mr. Hodgekiss in the cellar?

366
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:14,046  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:519
Yes, dear.
That's what we did with the others.

367
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,242  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:522
Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't....

368
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:20,685  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Others?
-The other gentlemen.

369
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:24,846  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:524
When you say "others,"
do you mean "others"?

370
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,766  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:522
-More than one "others"?
-Yes, dear.

371
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:30,884  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let me see now. This is 1 1, isn't it, Abby?

372
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:33,162  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:522
No, dear. This makes 12.

373
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:37,121  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:524
Abby, dear, I think you're wrong.
This one is only 1 1 .

374
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:40,802  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:519
No, dear, because I remember
when Mr. Hoskins first came in...

375
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:43,929  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
...it occurred to me
that he'd make just an even dozen.

376
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:49,651  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:524
But, Abby, dear, I really don't think
you should count the first one.

377
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:52,889  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:519
I was counting the first one,
and that makes it 12.

378
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,281  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:482 Y2:519
It does?

379
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:58,884  X1:065 X2:652 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is.

380
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:00,963  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
I get them mixed up sometimes.

381
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:02,521  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:519
Makes it 12.

382
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:10,521  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:519
Hello.

383
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:16,451  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:524
Whatever is the matter
with Mortimer today?

384
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:18,409  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:524
Why, Abby,
what do you think happened to him?

385
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:20,248  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:482 Y2:519
Hello?

386
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:29,245  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
Not now. For heaven's sake,
keep your shirt on!

387
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:33,130  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:522
Elaine, I didn't mean--

388
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,563  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:522
Now, let's see. Where were we?

389
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:39,971  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:519
Twelve. Twelve!

390
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:41,401  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, dear.

391
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:44,131  X1:069 X2:648 Y1:482 Y2:524
Abby thinks we should count the first one.

392
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,487  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:519
Never mind about that. Just sit down.

393
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:48,528  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:522
Tell me, who was the first one?

394
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:51,286  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mr. Midgely. He was a Baptist.

395
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:53,602  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
He was such a lonely, old gentleman.

396
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,242  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:519
All his kith and kin were dead.

397
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:58,288  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
We felt so sorry for him.

398
00:25:58,532 --> 00:26:01,444  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:522
And then, when his heart attack came...

399
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:04,808  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:519
...and he sat there dead in that chair...

400
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:08,682  X1:065 X2:653 Y1:482 Y2:524
...looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha?

401
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:12,001  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:482 Y2:524
We made up our minds, then and there...

402
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:15,050  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:524
...that if we could help
other lonely, old men...

403
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:17,322  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
...to find that same peace...

404
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:18,721  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:519
...we would.

405
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,040  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why, you poor....

406
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:23,891  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
You mean, he dropped dead
right in this chair?

407
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:30,043  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:448 Y2:524
And then, you see,
Teddy came up from digging in Panama...

408
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,369  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:524
...and he thought Mr. Midgely
was a yellow-fever victim.

409
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:36,570  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:524
And that meant
he had to be buried immediately.

410
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:39,884  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:522
So, we all took him down to Panama...

411
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:43,891  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:524
...and put him in the lock
and gave him a decent Christian burial.

412
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:48,524  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:524
There, now you see? That's why
we told you not to bother about it...

413
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,365  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:519
...because we know exactly
what's to be done.

414
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,606  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:519
Wait a minute!

415
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:58,286  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:519
Come here, darling.
What about the others?

416
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:01,121  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
All 12 of them didn't walk in here
and drop dead.

417
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:03,130  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:522
No, dear. Of course not!

418
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:04,361  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, so....

419
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:13,291  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Mortimer.
-What?

420
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,330  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:519
Do you remember those jars of poison
on the shelves...

421
00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:18,687  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:524
...in Grandfather's laboratory
all these years?

422
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:21,570  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know your Aunt Martha's knack
for mixing things.

423
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,961  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

424
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:27,569  X1:064 X2:653 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine...

425
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:30,246  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
...l take one teaspoonful of arsenic...

426
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,641  X1:065 X2:654 Y1:482 Y2:524
...then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine.

427
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:36,361  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:524
And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

428
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:40,044  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
Should have quite a kick.

429
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:45,129  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:524
As a matter of fact,
one of our gentlemen found time to say:

430
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:46,406  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:519
"How delicious! "

431
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,801  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:522
He did? Well, wasn't that nice of him?

432
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:51,890  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:524
Abby, we mustn't be standing here
gossiping all night.

433
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:53,485  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
We must get that cake frosted.

434
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,450  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't worry about the cake.
I couldn't eat a thing.

435
00:27:56,732 --> 00:28:00,520  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
You newlyweds! A sip of wine
will give you an appetite.

436
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,445  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:524
That'd be nice, darling, a sip of....
A sip of wine!

437
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:04,801  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:519
Wine!

438
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,972  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

439
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:32,611  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:524
He's wonderful. Happy as a lark.
Singing away, digging locks.

440
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:35,126  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:482 Y2:524
Got him working on a yellow-fever victim.

441
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:37,364  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:519
I can see the headlines now:

442
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:40,762  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
"Murder lncorporator Rides Again"
right across the front page.

443
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:42,720  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:519
Let me see....

444
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:46,091  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:524
Teddy! Of course.
Everybody knows he's crazy.

445
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:49,883  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
Let me see. Who can I call up?
Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell?

446
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:51,610  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, Winchell's no good.

447
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:53,646  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
Old Judge Cullman!

448
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,609  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
I wonder if I got his number.

449
00:28:56,492 --> 00:28:58,369  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
What am I doing with tickets?

450
00:28:58,572 --> 00:28:59,721  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:519
Information.

451
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,407  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:519
Information?

452
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:09,962  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:524
Get me the number of Judge Cullman
on North Shore Road, Brooklyn.

453
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:11,326  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, would you call me back?

454
00:29:14,932 --> 00:29:17,002  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:519
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if he wasn't there?

455
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:19,806  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, you!

456
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,726  X1:067 X2:650 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

457
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,525  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
What are you doing here?

458
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:28,325  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
What am I doing here?
Didn't you hear me whistle?

459
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:29,811  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:524
Whistle? Oh, yes.

460
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,611  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:524
I heard you whistle.

461
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,884  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:519
-How do I look?
-You look fine.

462
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,361  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Run on home. I'll call you up tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

463
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:39,250  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know I always call you up
every day or two.

464
00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:42,768  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:524
You and your gags! Where's your hat?
The bags are in the taxi.

465
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:45,452  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Come on!
-I'm so sorry. Something's happened.

466
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:47,410  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
What'd you do, lose your nerve?

467
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,960  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
Where's that look
I was going to see so often?

468
00:29:52,132 --> 00:29:54,441  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:524
Stop! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

469
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:56,604  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's wrong? Look at your hair.

470
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:58,762  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:519
What color is it? Has it turned?

471
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,124  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:524
Darling, what's the matter?
What happened?

472
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,404  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:519
Those flowers are so beautiful.

473
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:08,484  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:519
If I could only tell you, Elaine.
You smell so nice.

474
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:10,760  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:524
You better go home!

475
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:14,128  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:524
-But, darling, we were married today.
-Go to bed, get some rest!

476
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,088  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:519
Rest?

477
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:19,049  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who? Judge Cullman?

478
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:23,885  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:524
This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you
why I called you. It's about Teddy.

479
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,008  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've got to come over
and see you right away.

480
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,969  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:524
It won't wait until tomorrow, Judge.

481
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:31,203  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's very, very important.
We've got to do something immediately.

482
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,248  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:519
But it's a matter of life and.... Elaine!

483
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,161  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
Will you get out of here?

484
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,005  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:519
What on earth is going on here?
I don't know where I stand!

485
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:41,765  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Anywhere, but don't stand there!
-But Niagara Falls!

486
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:44,452  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:519
-If it does, we'll let it!
-Wait a minute! Listen.

487
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,602  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:519
You can't marry me
and then throw me out!

488
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:50,162  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm not throwing you out of the house!
Will you get out of here?

489
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:56,369  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, Judge. A thing happened.

490
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:58,404  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
Judge, about Teddy, he's--

491
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,691  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's his bugle blowing.

492
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,730  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:519
The police want to throw
him into a state institution.

493
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,605  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
How do you like that?

494
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:10,650  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I read an ad here about a room to rent.
-Shut up!

495
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:21,121  X1:074 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:524
If you sign the papers and Teddy commits
himself, we can get him to Happy Dale.

496
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,884  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a wonderful place.

497
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:23,961  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:519
You will?

498
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,686  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:519
Fine! I'll be over
as soon as I've made another call.

499
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,450  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
Doorbell's ringing, dear.

500
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:36,684  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:524
How do you do? Come in.

501
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,201  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
I understand you've got a room to rent.

502
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,924  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:524
Do step in.

503
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:44,363  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:522
-Are you the lady of the house?
-Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

504
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,682  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
Operator? Give me long distance, please.

505
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,650  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:519
And this is my sister.
Another Miss Brewster.

506
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:52,963  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:522
-My name's Gibbs.
-Well, do sit down.

507
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,090  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm sorry,
we're just setting the table for dinner.

508
00:31:56,772 --> 00:32:00,481  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:519
Now, this would be
a nice comfortable chair.

509
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:05,000  X1:098 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
Long distance? I want the Happy Dale
Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

510
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,926  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Is Brooklyn your home?
-I live in a hotel. Don't like it.

511
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:12,647  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
Are your family Brooklyn people?

512
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:16,008  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Haven't got any family.
-All alone in the world?

513
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:20,170  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Well, Martha....
-No, Happy Dale.

514
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,570  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, you've come to just the right house.

515
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,165  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Do sit down.
-Dale.

516
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:27,608  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
"D" Iike in "dig," when you dig a lock.

517
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:30,650  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:519
That's right.
"A" Iike in "arsenic." Got that?

518
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:33,123  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
Is there always this much noise?

519
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,930  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:519
He doesn't live with us.

520
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:37,242  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:519
I can see the headlines now. Please.

521
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:41,490  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:519
I'd like to see the room.
I don't think I'll like it.

522
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,005  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
The room's upstairs.

523
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:46,323  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:524
Won't you try a glass of our wine
before we start up?

524
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:47,811  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:519
Never touch it.

525
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:52,130  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:524
Well, we make this ourselves.
It's elderberry wine.

526
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,687  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:524
Elderberry?

527
00:32:57,252 --> 00:33:00,005  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:524
I haven't tasted elderberry wine
since I was a boy.

528
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,411  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Thank you.
-Operator!

529
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:04,882  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:524
I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry!
I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium!

530
00:33:04,972 --> 00:33:08,442  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:522
Sanitarium! Sanitarium!
Yes, like a broken record!

531
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:13,168  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Have your own elderberry bushes?
-No, but the cemetery's full of them.

532
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:15,410  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, skoal.

533
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:18,251  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hello, operator! What's taking so long?

534
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,800  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:519
It's only across the river!
I could swim it faster!

535
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:21,722  X1:314 X2:400 Y1:482 Y2:519
Yes!

536
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:23,806  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:519
Hello! Hell--

537
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:25,202  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:482 Y2:519
What--

538
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,725  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524
What, they're busy?

539
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:27,927  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:482 Y2:524
Busy?

540
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:30,090  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're busy and you're dizzy!

541
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:33,209  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, I'm not drunk, madam,
but you've given me an idea!

542
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,362  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
Darling, I'm nervous. Don't do that.

543
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,486  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:519
Not that.

544
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:57,208  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
Get out of here! Do you want
to be poisoned, murdered, killed?

545
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:02,840  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're nuts!

546
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:05,045  X1:227 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're telling me!

547
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:15,445  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, you can't do things like that!

548
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:25,010  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
Now I don't know
how I can explain this to you...

549
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:30,321  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:524
...but it's not only against the law,
it's wrong.

550
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,204  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, piffle!

551
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,409  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's not a nice thing to do.

552
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:38,403  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:519
People wouldn't understand.
He wouldn't understand.

553
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:42,564  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:519
What I mean is....

554
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:46,810  X1:085 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:524
This is developing into a very bad habit!

555
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:56,523  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who? Happy Dale Sanitarium?

556
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:58,444  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's amazing, operator.

557
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,486  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:524
Happy Dale?
Let me talk to Mr. Witherspoon, please.

558
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,210  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mr. Witherspoon speaking.

559
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:06,201  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:524
How do you do, Mr. Brewster?
How are you?

560
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,883  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
Mr. Witherspoon, do you--
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

561
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:15,361  X1:076 X2:644 Y1:448 Y2:524
Do you remember our conversation about
committing my brother to Happy Dale?

562
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:18,205  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:524
You do? Well, we want
to commit him there immediately.

563
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:19,322  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, dear.

564
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,170  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, dear. That's too bad.

565
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:25,089  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:524
Well, I'd hoped we wouldn't have him
for some time yet.

566
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:28,284  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:519
We have several Theodore Roosevelts
at the moment...

567
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:30,448  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:519
...and it would lead to trouble.

568
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:33,843  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, now, if he thought that--

569
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:37,521  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:524
Mr. Brewster, we're a bit short
of Napoleons at present.

570
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,723  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bonaparte. And if--

571
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:43,530  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, I see. Of course.

572
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,531  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, if your mind is made up. Yes.

573
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,725  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
Have you had the papers drawn up?

574
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:51,610  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, but I'll do it now
and call you as soon as I have them.

575
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:53,611  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you, Mr.-- What?

576
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,088  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right. Thank you, Mr. Witherspoon.

577
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:59,362  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:522
Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear.

578
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:04,328  X1:076 X2:644 Y1:448 Y2:524
Now listen, I'm going to Judge Cullman's,
but I want you to promise me something.

579
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,880  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, we'd have to know what it was first.

580
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,123  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
I love you both very much.

581
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,527  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know I'd do anything for you,
don't you?

582
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:12,681  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, dear.

583
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:15,360  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:524
I want you to do one thing for me,
like good girls.

584
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:16,851  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
What do you want us to do?

585
00:36:16,932 --> 00:36:19,969  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't do anything.
I mean, don't do anything!

586
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:23,404  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:519
Don't let anyone in the house
and leave Mr. Whosit where he is.

587
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:27,007  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:519
Get off that thing. I can't talk to you....
I can't concentrate.

588
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:30,010  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
I wouldn't want anything
in the world to happen to you.

589
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:32,447  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
What on earth could happen to us?

590
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:33,806  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, darling....

591
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:36,571  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:448 Y2:524
Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me,
won't you?

592
00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:38,809  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where's my hat? There it is.

593
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:40,530  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:519
-But, Mortimer.
-What?

594
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:43,968  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:519
We were planning to hold services
before dinner.

595
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,127  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Couldn't that wait until I get back?
-You could join us in the hymns!

596
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:51,329  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes, darling, I'll sing with you,
I'll dance with you, anything.

597
00:36:51,972 --> 00:36:55,009  X1:070 X2:648 Y1:448 Y2:524
Remember, don't let anybody in the house
until I get back.

598
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:56,241  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:524
You promise?

599
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:57,447  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:482 Y2:519
Good.

600
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:00,567  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:482 Y2:519
What?

601
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:04,164  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
Stop that. What is it?

602
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:05,845  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mr. Hoskins' hat!

603
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:14,165  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Do you still want me to wait?
-Yes! Call me a cab!

604
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:17,961  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Hey, cab! Here you are.
-Don't open it. I'll sit with you!

605
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:21,528  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yeah, that's right.
I can go faster that way. Sure.

606
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,763  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
Wait a minute! What am I doing?

607
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:31,567  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:524
Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat
all mussed up.

608
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:34,652  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:519
Shame! Such a nice hat.

609
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:39,929  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know, Mortimer didn't seem
to be quite himself today.

610
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,047  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, well.

611
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,241  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
What were you saying about Mortimer?

612
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:56,130  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:524
I think I understand why
he seemed so upset.

613
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:57,202  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why?

614
00:37:57,732 --> 00:37:59,609  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's just been married.

615
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,610  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:519
I believe that always makes
a man a little nervous.

616
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,330  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes. The poor dears.

617
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:10,088  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm so happy for Elaine.

618
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:11,882  X1:305 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:524
Abby!

619
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:16,131  X1:067 X2:652 Y1:448 Y2:524
If Mortimer's coming back for the services,
we'll need another hymnal.

620
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:18,124  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's one up in my room.

621
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:22,130  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll go, dear.

622
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:26,564  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:524
We promised Mortimer
we wouldn't let anyone come in.

623
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:34,441  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:519
It's two men,
and I've never seen them before.

624
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:36,409  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

625
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:39,248  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Let me look.
-You look.

626
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,930  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Do you recognize them?
-No, they're strangers to me.

627
00:38:48,732 --> 00:38:51,292  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:519
We'll just have to pretend
we're not at home.

628
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:22,725  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:522
Come in, doctor.

629
00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:28,689  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
This is the home of my youth.

630
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:33,009  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:519
As a boy, I couldn't wait to escape
from this house.

631
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:36,646  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now I'm glad to escape back into it.

632
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:40,042  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

633
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:43,723  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
The family must still live here.

634
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:49,887  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:524
I hope there's a fatted calf
awaiting the return of the prodigal.

635
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:51,366  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:519
A fatted calf?.

636
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,203  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
Johnny, I'm so hungry.

637
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:56,762  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, Johnny. Drink.

638
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:59,483  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
As if we were expected.

639
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,921  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:524
A good omen.

640
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,050  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who are you?

641
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:05,050  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
What are you doing here?

642
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,121  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha.

643
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:12,126  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:519
It's Jonathan.

644
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:14,245  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:524
You get out of here!

645
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:16,644  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm Jonathan, you know.

646
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,924  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Your nephew, Jonathan.

647
00:40:19,132 --> 00:40:20,360  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, you're not.

648
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:23,529  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're nothing like Jonathan,
so don't pretend you are.

649
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:25,330  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
You just get out of here.

650
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:28,404  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:524
I see you're still wearing
the lovely garnet ring...

651
00:40:28,532 --> 00:40:31,000  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
...that Grandma Brewster
bought in England.

652
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,685  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:524
And you, Aunt Martha,
still the high collar...

653
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:38,242  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:524
...to hide the scar
where Grandfather's acid burned you.

654
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:41,845  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

655
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:46,566  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
Have you been in an accident?

656
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,005  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:524
My face.

657
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:51,931  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dr. Einstein is responsible for that.

658
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,850  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's a plastic surgeon.

659
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:56,721  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:519
But I've seen that face before.

660
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,563  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:524
Do you remember when we took
the little Schultz boy to the movies...

661
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:04,244  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and I was so frightened?

662
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:05,685  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:519
It was that face.

663
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,043  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy.

664
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:14,329  X1:135 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't worry. The last five years,
I give him three different faces.

665
00:41:14,412 --> 00:41:16,482  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
I give him another one right away.

666
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:20,162  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:524
That last face. I saw that picture, too...

667
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:24,644  X1:068 X2:651 Y1:482 Y2:524
...just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

668
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,292  X1:072 X2:645 Y1:482 Y2:524
You see, doctor, what you've done to me?

669
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:30,604  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Even my own family think I'm--
-Johnny, Johnny!

670
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:34,407  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
You are home in this lovely house.

671
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,046  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:519
You know...

672
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:40,046  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:524
...how many times he tells me...

673
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:43,728  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:519
...about Brooklyn, about this house
and about his aunts...

674
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:45,370  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:519
...he loves so much?

675
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:46,841  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:482 Y2:524
They know you.

676
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:48,650  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:519
Please tell him so.

677
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,164  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:519
Jonathan...

678
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:55,090  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:524
...it's been a long time.

679
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,806  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bless you. It's good to be home again.

680
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:05,691  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:519
We mustn't let what's on the stove
boil over.

681
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,932  X1:066 X2:652 Y1:482 Y2:524
If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan.

682
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:13,528  X1:071 X2:647 Y1:482 Y2:524
Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere.

683
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:34,083  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where do we go from here?

684
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:38,127  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know, we got to think fast.

685
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:43,084  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
The police got pictures of that face.
I got to operate on you right away.

686
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:45,210  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:524
We got to find someplace.

687
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,570  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
We got to find someplace
for Mr. Spenalzo, too.

688
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:52,448  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't waste any worry on that rat.

689
00:42:52,732 --> 00:42:55,610  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

690
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,730  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:524
Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

691
00:42:58,052 --> 00:43:01,249  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:524
But, Johnny, we can't leave
a dead body in the rumble seat.

692
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:03,604  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:519
You shouldn't have killed him.

693
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:07,002  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
Just because he knows something
about us, what happens?

694
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:12,924  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:519
We come to him for help
and he tries to shake us down.

695
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:19,845  X1:071 X2:648 Y1:482 Y2:522
Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff.

696
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:24,524  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's your work, doctor.

697
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:26,011  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:519
You did that to me.

698
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:28,003  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
Please, Johnny, take it easy.

699
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:31,363  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:524
We'll find some place
and I'll fix you up right away.

700
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:34,012  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

701
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:37,210  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
This time, I want the face
of an absolute nonentity.

702
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:40,689  X1:072 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

703
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:44,162  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:524
You see, I'm going to take this piece here
and lift it up--

704
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:46,322  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:519
Be careful about the stitches this time.

705
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:48,084  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
You leave that up to me.

706
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:49,685  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll give you nice ears and--

707
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:52,491  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You were careless last time.
-And new stitches.

708
00:43:52,612 --> 00:43:55,809  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt.
That's my specialty.

709
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:59,163  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I take it together like this--
-Leave the eyes alone.

710
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:00,924  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:519
Leave the nose alone.

711
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,605  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:524
Poor Teddy.

712
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:05,248  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I imagine it's for the best.

713
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:11,048  X1:072 X2:647 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Ours not to reason why, ours but to do--"

714
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:13,640  X1:066 X2:651 Y1:482 Y2:524
Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me.

715
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:15,251  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:524
Right there.

716
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:19,240  X1:062 X2:656 Y1:448 Y2:524
Sometimes I think,
with the world in its present chaotic state--

717
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:23,166  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale.
I sign here as next of kin, don't l?

718
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:27,047  X1:066 X2:652 Y1:482 Y2:524
Only last week I created a mild sensation...

719
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:30,044  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:522
...at the Bar Association, when I said--

720
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:32,208  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

721
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:36,251  X1:064 X2:654 Y1:448 Y2:524
Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week.
I've been feeling rather lonely.

722
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:39,205  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:524
No! Never tell them
you've been lonely. Never!

723
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:41,681  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Why, I don't--
-Judge!

724
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:44,602  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
Tell me, are you a drinking man?

725
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:47,565  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why, no. I never indulge.

726
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:49,603  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
Good! Then you'll live longer.

727
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:51,808  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:519
Of course a little wine now--

728
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:54,042  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:522
No! For heaven's sake, no wine!

729
00:44:56,692 --> 00:44:59,126  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

730
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:04,602  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
Well, I'm sure you both want to get
to wherever you're going.

731
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:09,005  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:524
My dear, sweet aunties,
I'm so full of your delicious dinner...

732
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:12,887  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:522
-...l'm unable to move a muscle.
-Yes, it's nice here.

733
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:14,491  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:519
I found it!

734
00:45:16,852 --> 00:45:18,365  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:522
Gentlemen, be seated.

735
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:24,364  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
Here it is, gentlemen.
The story of my life, my biography.

736
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:27,524  X1:075 X2:644 Y1:448 Y2:519
Here's the picture I was telling you about.
Here we both are.

737
00:45:27,612 --> 00:45:30,206  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:448 Y2:519
President Roosevelt and General Goethals
at Culebra Cut.

738
00:45:30,372 --> 00:45:32,488  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's me, General, and that's you.

739
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:35,488  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
My, how I've changed!

740
00:45:36,252 --> 00:45:40,404  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:519
That picture hasn't been taken yet.
We haven't started work on Culebra Cut.

741
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,011  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're still digging locks.

742
00:45:42,092 --> 00:45:45,846  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:524
And now, General, we will both go
to Panama and inspect the new lock.

743
00:45:45,932 --> 00:45:48,002  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

744
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,971  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:524
Maybe some other time, Mr. President.
Panama is a long ways off.

745
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,805  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Nonsense! It's just down in the cellar.
-The cellar?

746
00:45:55,332 --> 00:45:58,563  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:519
We let him dig the Panama Canal
in the cellar.

747
00:45:59,212 --> 00:46:01,203  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:522
-General Goethals?
-Yes, sir.

748
00:46:01,412 --> 00:46:04,370  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
As President of the US, Commander
in Chief of the Army and Navy...

749
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:06,408  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and the man who gave you this job...

750
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:10,041  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:524
...l demand that you accompany me
on the inspection of the new lock.

751
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:12,441  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think it's time for you to go to bed.

752
00:46:12,932 --> 00:46:16,208  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
I beg your pardon. Who are you?

753
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:18,203  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:519
I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

754
00:46:20,412 --> 00:46:23,563  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, you're not Wilson.
But your face is familiar.

755
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:28,285  X1:068 X2:651 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're not anyone I know now.
Perhaps later, on my hunting trip to Africa.

756
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:31,125  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:524
You look like someone
I might meet in the jungle.

757
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:34,889  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:524
I think, perhaps,
you had better go to bed, Teddy.

758
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:37,850  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:519
He and his friend want to get back
to their hotel.

759
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:40,329  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:524
General Goethals, inspect the canal.

760
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:43,846  X1:072 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, Mr. President, we go to Panama.

761
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:46,685  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bully, bully! Follow me, General.

762
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:52,003  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's down south, you know.

763
00:46:55,252 --> 00:46:56,651  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, bon voyage!

764
00:47:01,692 --> 00:47:03,842  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
I must correct your misapprehension.

765
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,769  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:519
You talked of our hotel.

766
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:10,407  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:482 Y2:524
We have no hotel. We came here directly.

767
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:14,771  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:524
This is not your home,
and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

768
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:22,721  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dr. Einstein and I need a place to sleep.

769
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:26,324  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:524
You remember that, as a boy,
I could be disagreeable.

770
00:47:27,172 --> 00:47:30,403  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
It would not be pleasant for any of us if....

771
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:33,245  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't have to go into details, do l?

772
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:36,280  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:524
Perhaps we'd better let them
stay here tonight.

773
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:39,890  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:519
Come here. Quick.

774
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:41,041  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:524
I forgot to tell you...

775
00:47:41,132 --> 00:47:45,330  X1:087 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:524
...Doctor and I are turning Grandfather's
laboratory into an operating room.

776
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:47,528  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:524
We expect to be very busy.

777
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,966  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Down here, what do you think I find?
-What?

778
00:47:54,052 --> 00:47:55,849  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:519
The Panama Canal.

779
00:47:56,532 --> 00:47:58,602  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
And it just fits Mr. Spenalzo.

780
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:02,768  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:524
See the hole he's digging.
Four feet wide, six feet long.

781
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:04,205  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:524
He just fits!

782
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:07,642  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:524
You'd think he knew
we were bringing Mr. Spenalzo along.

783
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:09,570  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's hospitality.

784
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,889  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
Rather a good joke on my aunts.

785
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,248  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:524
They're living in a house
with a body buried in the cellar.

786
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:19,723  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
How do we get him in here?

787
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:23,925  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes, we can't just walk
Mr. Spenalzo in through the door.

788
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:28,523  X1:080 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:524
We'll get the car and after they're in bed,
we'll bring him in through the window.

789
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:29,488  X1:317 X2:402 Y1:482 Y2:519
Bed.

790
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:35,288  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:524
We're moving the car behind the house.
You'd better get to bed.

791
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:37,966  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:524
The car is all right where it is
until morning.

792
00:48:38,052 --> 00:48:42,011  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
I don't want to leave it in the street.
That might be against the law.

793
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:49,409  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
What are we going to do?

794
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:53,525  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:524
We're not going to let them spend
more than one night in this house.

795
00:48:53,732 --> 00:48:55,484  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
What would the neighbors think?

796
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:59,042  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
People coming in here with one face
and going out with another.

797
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:02,406  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:519
What are we going to do
about Mr. Hoskins?

798
00:49:02,972 --> 00:49:04,564  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mr. Hoskins!

799
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:07,730  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:519
It can't be very comfortable
for him in there.

800
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,084  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:524
And he's been so patient, the poor dear.

801
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:16,525  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
I think Teddy had better take
Mr. Hoskins downstairs right away.

802
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:21,730  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:524
General Goethals was very pleased.
He said the canal was just the right size.

803
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:26,967  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:524
Teddy, there's been
another yellow-fever victim.

804
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,642  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:519
Dear me!
This will be a shock to the General.

805
00:49:31,372 --> 00:49:34,125  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, we must keep it a secret.

806
00:49:35,612 --> 00:49:36,806  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:519
A state secret?

807
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,763  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, a state secret.

808
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:39,961  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:519
Promise?

809
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:43,445  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:519
You have the word of the President
of the United States.

810
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:47,002  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:522
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Now, let's see.

811
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:50,041  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
How are we going to keep it a secret?

812
00:49:50,252 --> 00:49:53,688  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:448 Y2:519
Teddy, I think you'd better get back down
into the cellar.

813
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:55,001  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:519
And then...

814
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:58,761  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
...when I turn out the lights,
when everything's dark here...

815
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:01,771  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:524
...you come up and take
the poor man down to the canal.

816
00:50:01,852 --> 00:50:03,001  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now get along.

817
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:06,130  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:519
And we'll come down later
and hold services.

818
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:09,441  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Where is the poor devil?
-In the windowseat.

819
00:50:09,532 --> 00:50:10,931  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
It seems to be spreading.

820
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:13,572  X1:068 X2:650 Y1:482 Y2:524
We've never had yellow fever there before.

821
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:20,650  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:519
I've never even seen Mr. Hoskins!

822
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:24,088  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
My goodness! That's right, you were out.

823
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:28,283  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:519
You just come right along
and see him now.

824
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:33,848  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know, he's really very nice looking,
considering that he's a Methodist.

825
00:50:49,972 --> 00:50:52,327  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're bringing the luggage through here.

826
00:50:58,612 --> 00:51:02,161  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
Your room is waiting for you.
You can go right up.

827
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:06,806  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours.
You two run along to bed.

828
00:51:07,052 --> 00:51:10,089  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:482 Y2:524
But you must be very tired. Both of you.

829
00:51:10,252 --> 00:51:14,245  X1:071 X2:647 Y1:448 Y2:524
-And we don't go to bed this early.
-It's time I came home to take care of you.

830
00:51:14,492 --> 00:51:16,323  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
Take the bags upstairs.

831
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:19,291  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:522
For the instruments, I'll come back later.

832
00:51:19,572 --> 00:51:20,846  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:524
Good night.

833
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:22,805  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, we'll all go to bed.

834
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:26,601  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll wait until you're up
and then turn out the lights.

835
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,089  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Run along, Aunt Martha.

836
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:32,522  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

837
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,440  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:524
-All right, Aunt Abby.
-I'll be right up.

838
00:51:42,612 --> 00:51:44,842  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now! Turn out the lights.

839
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,811  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aunt Abby.

840
00:54:16,932 --> 00:54:18,160  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's all right, Johnny.

841
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:30,250  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll open the window.
You go round and hand him through.

842
00:54:30,452 --> 00:54:32,727  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
But he's too heavy for me.

843
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:37,602  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:524
You go outside and push,
and I'll stay here and pull.

844
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:40,531  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:519
And then together we take him
down to Panama.

845
00:54:41,052 --> 00:54:44,601  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:519
All right. We must be quick.
I'll take a look around outside the house.

846
00:54:44,812 --> 00:54:47,280  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:524
When I tap on the glass,
you open the window.

847
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:48,327  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:519
Yeah.

848
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:57,604  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:519
It's dark in here.

849
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,687  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:519
Where am l?

850
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:13,847  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:519
Here I am.

851
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,572  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who left this open?

852
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,610  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, wait a minute. Hand him over.

853
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:28,372  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now I have him. Allez, up!

854
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:33,526  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:524
Now, wait a minute.
You lost a leg somewhere.

855
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:37,849  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Help me. He's so heavy.

856
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:41,203  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now I have him. Now I got him.

857
00:55:42,132 --> 00:55:45,329  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Be careful.
-But his shoe came off.

858
00:55:46,332 --> 00:55:49,130  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Help me. He's so heavy.

859
00:55:49,332 --> 00:55:51,448  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now I've got him!

860
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:56,169  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:524
Johnny, somebody's at the door.
Go open, quick.

861
00:55:56,372 --> 00:55:59,444  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick!

862
00:56:12,532 --> 00:56:13,521  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mortimer!

863
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,281  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aunt Abby!

864
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:22,366  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:519
Aunt Martha!

865
00:56:27,532 --> 00:56:28,567  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:519
Who is it?

866
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,085  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:524
Is that you, Teddy?

867
00:56:30,172 --> 00:56:31,127  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who are you?

868
00:56:31,212 --> 00:56:33,442  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

869
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:35,330  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
What are you doing here?

870
00:56:35,412 --> 00:56:37,721  X1:070 X2:647 Y1:482 Y2:524
I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.

871
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,962  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why did you say your name was Harper?

872
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:41,963  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
It is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster.

873
00:56:42,052 --> 00:56:44,646  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:519
I'm not very used to it.
I'm a brand-new Brewster.

874
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:45,687  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:482 Y2:519
Doctor!

875
00:56:46,932 --> 00:56:48,763  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's all right. It's okay.

876
00:56:58,012 --> 00:57:00,480  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:524
Maybe you'd better explain
what you're doing here.

877
00:57:00,572 --> 00:57:02,528  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
We happen to live here.

878
00:57:02,812 --> 00:57:04,291  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:519
You don't live here.

879
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:06,966  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm in this house every day,
I've never seen you before.

880
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:10,124  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:524
Where are Martha and Abby?
What have you done to them?

881
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:13,601  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:524
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves.

882
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:16,526  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:524
May I present Dr. Einstein?

883
00:57:16,972 --> 00:57:18,928  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:519
Dr. Einstein?

884
00:57:19,092 --> 00:57:21,481  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
A surgeon of great distinction.

885
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:25,842  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
And something of a magician.

886
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:30,281  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I suppose you'll tell me you're Boris--
-I am Jonathan Brewster.

887
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,921  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You're Jonathan.
-You've heard of me?

888
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:38,004  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Yes, they talk about you.
-What do they say about me?

889
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:41,448  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:522
Just that there's another brother
named Jonathan, that's all.

890
00:57:42,132 --> 00:57:45,169  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:524
That explains everything.
Now that I know who you are...

891
00:57:45,332 --> 00:57:48,768  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
...l'll just be running along
if you'll kindly unlock the door.

892
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:04,682  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
"That explains everything."
Just what do you mean by that?

893
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:07,280  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:524
Why do you come here
at this time of night?

894
00:58:07,412 --> 00:58:11,087  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:524
I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up.
I suppose it was you.

895
00:58:14,212 --> 00:58:16,521  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:482 Y2:524
You thought you saw someone drive up?

896
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:19,645  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes. Weren't you just outside?
lsn't that your car?

897
00:58:19,732 --> 00:58:22,121  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You saw someone at the car?
-Yes.

898
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,971  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:522
-What else did you see?
-Just that, that's all!

899
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:27,925  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:524
I see. Is that why you came over here?

900
00:58:28,012 --> 00:58:31,448  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:522
No, I came to see Mortimer.
But if he's not home, I'll run--

901
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:33,528  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:524
-You've given two names.
-You're hurting me!

902
00:58:33,612 --> 00:58:35,682  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think she's dangerous.

903
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,167  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
No visitors. It's going to be
a private funeral.

904
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:45,322  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Tell these men who I am!
-That's my daughter, Alice.

905
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:46,448  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:482 Y2:519
No!

906
00:58:47,772 --> 00:58:50,491  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't be a tomboy.
Don't play rough with the gentlemen.

907
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:51,561  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:524
Charge!

908
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:01,931  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:522
Doctor, the cellar.

909
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:05,410  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let go of me!

910
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:07,804  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let go of me!

911
00:59:08,852 --> 00:59:11,047  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
What's the matter?
What's happening down there?

912
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:17,286  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
What's the matter?
What are you doing there?

913
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:20,962  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
We caught a burglar, a sneak thief.
Go back to your room.

914
00:59:21,132 --> 00:59:24,761  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:524
-We'll call the police.
-I'll handle this. Go back to your room.

915
00:59:25,452 --> 00:59:26,680  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:524
Do you hear me?

916
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:30,851  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:519
Don't answer that.

917
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:33,285  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:519
Don't answer that!

918
00:59:46,212 --> 00:59:50,000  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:524
Where's Teddy? ls he upstairs?
Never mind that now, darling.

919
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:52,731  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:524
What are you doing
with your best clothes on?

920
00:59:53,252 --> 00:59:55,322  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:524
Holy.... What's that?

921
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:59,972  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:524
What's that thing that looks like
a cigar-store dummy?

922
01:00:00,052 --> 01:00:04,489  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
-It's your brother and Dr. Einstein.
-Didn't I tell you not to let anybody in?

923
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:07,723  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Who did you say it was?
-It's your brother, Jonathan!

924
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:15,325  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I've come back home, Mortimer.
-What?

925
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:17,523  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:522
I've come back home, Mortimer.

926
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:20,729  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:522
"I've come back home, Mortimer."
Listen, it talks!

927
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:23,724  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, I talk.

928
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:28,370  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:524
Mortimer, have you forgotten
the things I used to do to you...

929
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,802  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
...when you were tied to the bedpost?

930
01:00:30,892 --> 01:00:34,282  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
The needles under your fingernails.

931
01:00:34,492 --> 01:00:36,403  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Mortimer, he--
-Wait a minute.

932
01:00:44,132 --> 01:00:45,724  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
Holy mackerel!

933
01:00:45,932 --> 01:00:46,967  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:519
It is Jonathan!

934
01:00:47,052 --> 01:00:48,849  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm glad you remember, Mortimer.

935
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:51,851  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yeah, I remember.

936
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:53,930  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
How could I forget you?

937
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:56,647  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where'd you get that face? Hollywood?

938
01:00:57,292 --> 01:01:01,570  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't you two boys start quarreling
the minute you've seen each other.

939
01:01:01,652 --> 01:01:04,928  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:524
We invited Jonathan
and Dr. Einstein to stay.

940
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:07,363  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What?
-Just for tonight.

941
01:01:07,492 --> 01:01:09,369  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, I'm staying here tonight.

942
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:12,052  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:519
-In fact, I'm staying here from now on.
-What about me?

943
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:14,088  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's no room for anybody else here.

944
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:15,571  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:524
Please, just a moment.

945
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:17,927  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
So take that little squirt and beat it!

946
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,771  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:524
Where's Teddy?
I've got to see him right away.

947
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,604  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
We don't take up much room.

948
01:01:23,692 --> 01:01:26,889  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:524
Johnny can sleep on the sofa,
and I'll sleep on the windowseat.

949
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:28,246  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:524
Nothing to....

950
01:01:28,532 --> 01:01:29,885  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:519
Windowseat?

951
01:01:30,652 --> 01:01:32,165  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:482 Y2:524
Certainly not on the windowseat.

952
01:01:32,252 --> 01:01:34,482  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm going to sleep on the windowseat.

953
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:36,683  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll sleep on the windowseat from now on.

954
01:01:38,772 --> 01:01:39,761  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:519
Now look.

955
01:01:40,732 --> 01:01:42,165  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, be a good fellow.

956
01:01:42,252 --> 01:01:44,971  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:524
Here's $10. Go out
and haunt yourself a hotel.

957
01:01:47,492 --> 01:01:51,451  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:524
Mortimer, you know what I do
to people who order me around.

958
01:01:54,652 --> 01:01:56,165  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mr. Spenalzo.

959
01:01:56,372 --> 01:01:57,248  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:482 Y2:519
What?

960
01:01:57,372 --> 01:02:00,569  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's going to happen to Mr. Spenalzo?

961
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:04,485  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:519
We can't leave him here
in the windowseat.

962
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:13,208  X1:130 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
Doctor, I've completely lost track
of Mr. Spenalzo.

963
01:02:13,372 --> 01:02:15,761  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Wait! Who's this Mr. Spenalzo?

964
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,241  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:524
A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

965
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:20,800  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:522
Don't bring anyone else in here.
Now, beat it!

966
01:02:20,892 --> 01:02:22,245  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's all right, Johnny.

967
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:24,926  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:524
While we are packing,
I'll tell you about him.

968
01:02:31,132 --> 01:02:34,204  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll take care of you, Mortimer,
in just a little while.

969
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:36,566  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
How do you like that?

970
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,928  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
The guy stays away for 20 years
and picks tonight to come back.

971
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:41,923  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
Elaine, what are you doing here?

972
01:02:42,052 --> 01:02:44,247  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Mortimer!
-What's the matter, darling?

973
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:47,324  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I almost got killed.
-Killed?

974
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,725  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha!

975
01:02:51,092 --> 01:02:52,764  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:519
No! It was Jonathan!

976
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,168  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:519
He mistook her for a sneak thief.

977
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:57,368  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Oh, that.
-It was worse than that.

978
01:02:57,492 --> 01:02:59,210  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:519
He's some kind of a maniac.

979
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,645  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:519
I'm afraid of him.

980
01:03:00,732 --> 01:03:03,371  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:524
Darling, don't worry about it.
I'm here now. Forget it.

981
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:06,450  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:524
We were married today,
we were going over Niagara Falls...

982
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,888  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
...your brother tries to strangle me,
a taxi's waiting...

983
01:03:10,092 --> 01:03:12,287  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:519
...and now you want to sleep
on a windowseat!

984
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,203  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
Windowseat. Witherspoon.

985
01:03:14,452 --> 01:03:16,408  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You'd better run along home.
-What?

986
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,211  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:524
Go on home like a good girl.
I got things to do.

987
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:20,566  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:448 Y2:519
-But--
-Please.

988
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:23,366  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:524
Operator?
Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

989
01:03:23,652 --> 01:03:26,041  X1:066 X2:653 Y1:482 Y2:524
But didn't you hear what I was just saying?

990
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:29,169  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
Your own brother Jonathan,
he was trying to strangle me!

991
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,567  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Please! This is important!
-That?

992
01:03:32,252 --> 01:03:34,402  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:519
Mr. Witherspoon?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

993
01:03:34,492 --> 01:03:36,528  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, Mr. Brewster.

994
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:39,361  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I don't understand you.

995
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:42,285  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:522
-He was going to kill me!
-Wait, I can't hear the man.

996
01:03:42,372 --> 01:03:44,522  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
Well, look.
I've got the papers all drawn up.

997
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:48,969  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:524
I know it's late, but come down here
and get my brother immediately!

998
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,127  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:524
Please, darling.

999
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:54,046  X1:071 X2:647 Y1:448 Y2:524
By the way, you've had the papers signed
by your brother and the doctor, of course?

1000
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:55,281  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:482 Y2:524
By the doctor?

1001
01:03:55,412 --> 01:03:58,245  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, holy mackerel! I forgot the doctor!

1002
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:03,084  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:524
Please, be quiet! Can't you see
I've got to get a doctor?

1003
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,408  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:524
What kind of a doctor? A family doctor?

1004
01:04:05,492 --> 01:04:08,848  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
You can take your honeymoon,
wedding ring, taxi, windowseat...

1005
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:11,810  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:524
...put them in a barrel,
and push them all over Niagara Falls!

1006
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:13,564  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

1007
01:04:13,652 --> 01:04:16,086  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why don't you come down here anyway?

1008
01:04:16,172 --> 01:04:19,721  X1:065 X2:652 Y1:448 Y2:524
While you're getting here,
I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures.

1009
01:04:21,052 --> 01:04:24,044  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll get both signatures.
Yeah, well, come right away.

1010
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,404  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:519
What's the matter with her?

1011
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:39,330  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:524
Let me sit down.
Let me think about this thing.

1012
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:43,205  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
Doctor, Teddy, signature....

1013
01:04:43,972 --> 01:04:45,200  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:519
Hoskins!

1014
01:05:03,012 --> 01:05:05,128  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ye gods! There's another one!

1015
01:05:06,452 --> 01:05:07,805  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha!

1016
01:05:07,892 --> 01:05:10,008  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Come in here!
-We're busy.

1017
01:05:10,092 --> 01:05:12,083  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, you come in here now!

1018
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:16,406  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, dear, what is it? Where's Elaine?

1019
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,807  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:524
Didn't you promise not to let anyone in?

1020
01:05:18,892 --> 01:05:21,122  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Jonathan just walked in.
-I don't mean Jonathan!

1021
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:24,170  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:519
I don't mean Dr. Einstein!
Who is that in the windowseat?

1022
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:25,924  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
We told you. Mr. Hoskins.

1023
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:28,367  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:519
It is not Mr. Hoskins!

1024
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,047  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:482 Y2:519
There!

1025
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:33,451  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:519
Who can that be?

1026
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:39,328  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Are you saying you've never seen him?
-I certainly am.

1027
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:41,130  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
This is a fine how-do-you-do!

1028
01:05:41,212 --> 01:05:43,567  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:519
It's getting so anyone thinks
he can walk in!

1029
01:05:43,692 --> 01:05:47,571  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't you try to get out of this!
That's another one of your gentlemen!

1030
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,802  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
How can you say such a thing?

1031
01:05:50,172 --> 01:05:52,242  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
That man's an impostor.

1032
01:05:53,172 --> 01:05:57,085  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:522
And if he came here to be buried
in our cellar, he's mistaken.

1033
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:00,960  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:519
You admitted you put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat.

1034
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:01,848  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, I did.

1035
01:06:01,932 --> 01:06:04,651  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:519
This man couldn't have got the idea
from Mr. Hoskins!

1036
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:08,168  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:524
-By the way, where is Mr. Hoskins?
-He must have gone to Panama.

1037
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:10,010  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What? You buried him?
-Not yet.

1038
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,970  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:524
He's down there
waiting for the services, poor dear.

1039
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:16,442  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:519
We haven't had a minute,
what with Jonathan in the house.

1040
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:19,328  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, dear.

1041
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:22,962  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:519
We've always wanted
to hold a double funeral.

1042
01:06:23,172 --> 01:06:26,801  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:524
But I will not read services
over a total stranger!

1043
01:06:27,812 --> 01:06:30,610  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
A total stranger. How can I believe you?

1044
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:33,490  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
There are 12 men down there,
you admit you poisoned them!

1045
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:37,531  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes, I did. But you don't think
I'd stoop to telling a fib!

1046
01:06:39,132 --> 01:06:41,088  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
What do you think has happened?

1047
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:42,651  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:519
"A fib! "

1048
01:06:58,012 --> 01:07:02,210  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:524
This may interest you, Mortimer.
I've decided that we're staying.

1049
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:06,644  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:448 Y2:519
And I've also decided that you're leaving,
and I mean now.

1050
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:09,770  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood
to debate the question.

1051
01:07:09,852 --> 01:07:12,924  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:524
Are you getting out,
or am I throwing you out on your ear?

1052
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:15,242  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've led a strange life.

1053
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,764  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:524
Martha, you come straight along here.

1054
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:20,605  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:519
You just look and see
what's in that windowseat.

1055
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:23,720  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:519
No. Don't....

1056
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:48,931  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:519
Let Aunt Martha see
what's in the windowseat.

1057
01:07:52,812 --> 01:07:55,770  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

1058
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:59,248  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've got some very good news for you.
Jonathan is leaving.

1059
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:04,406  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
And he's taking Dr. Einstein
and that cold companion with him.

1060
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:12,570  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:524
Listen. You're my brother,
you're a Brewster.

1061
01:08:12,652 --> 01:08:15,803  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll give you a chance to get away
and take the evidence with you.

1062
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:18,202  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:519
You can't ask for more than that.

1063
01:08:19,132 --> 01:08:20,121  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:519
Well?

1064
01:08:22,692 --> 01:08:25,684  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
All right, in that case,
I'll have to call the police.

1065
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:29,729  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't reach for the telephone.

1066
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:33,561  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:524
Remember, what happened
to Mr. Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

1067
01:08:33,772 --> 01:08:35,046  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:524
Spenalzo?

1068
01:08:35,252 --> 01:08:37,527  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
I knew he was a foreigner.

1069
01:08:38,252 --> 01:08:40,129  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
Put down that telephone.

1070
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:49,881  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:519
Officer O'Hara!

1071
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:52,725  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:524
I saw the lights and thought
you might have sickness....

1072
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:54,643  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:482 Y2:524
You got company? Sorry I disturbed you.

1073
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:57,087  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:522
-No! Come in.
-Yes, do come in.

1074
01:08:57,172 --> 01:09:00,005  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:524
Come right in, Officer.
This is our nephew, Mortimer.

1075
01:09:00,092 --> 01:09:01,969  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Pleased to meet you.
-Glad to see you.

1076
01:09:02,052 --> 01:09:05,681  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:524
-And this is another nephew, Jonathan.
-Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1077
01:09:06,052 --> 01:09:09,010  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:524
Your face is familiar.
Haven't I seen a picture of you?

1078
01:09:09,092 --> 01:09:10,844  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:519
I don't think so.

1079
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:13,969  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I'll be running along.
-Why? Stay until my brother leaves.

1080
01:09:14,052 --> 01:09:15,405  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
I got to ring in, Mr.--

1081
01:09:15,492 --> 01:09:18,564  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:519
Are you "the" Mortimer Brewster,
the writer and dramatic critic?

1082
01:09:18,692 --> 01:09:19,488  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, why?

1083
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:23,406  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:524
What a break for me! I'm a playwright.
I'm working on a play now.

1084
01:09:23,532 --> 01:09:26,763  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:522
You are? Well, well, well!

1085
01:09:26,972 --> 01:09:30,044  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Maybe I can help you with it.
-Would you? What a break!

1086
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,521  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:524
I get wonderful ideas,
but I can't spell them.

1087
01:09:32,612 --> 01:09:34,967  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:524
I can spell like the dickens.
Constantinople?

1088
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:37,612  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:519
Let's go into the kitchen.
You can tell me all about it.

1089
01:09:37,732 --> 01:09:39,643  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
Couldn't you whip up a sandwich?

1090
01:09:39,732 --> 01:09:42,963  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:524
I hope you don't mind
eating in the kitchen, Officer O'Hara.

1091
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:44,969  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
And where else would you eat?

1092
01:09:46,132 --> 01:09:47,611  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
See you in a moment.

1093
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:51,005  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
This is your last chance.

1094
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:53,652  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll keep O'Hara busy
to give you a chance to get out.

1095
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:56,121  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:524
All three of you:
you, Dr. Einstein and Spenalzo.

1096
01:09:56,212 --> 01:10:00,490  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
If you don't leave here, I'll introduce
Officer O'Hara to Mr. Spenalzo.

1097
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,005  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
My play takes place in--

1098
01:10:02,092 --> 01:10:04,560  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll be right with you, O'Hara.
Right with you.

1099
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:07,404  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
Just give me one moment.

1100
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:10,646  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now get going! All three of you.

1101
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:23,369  X1:070 X2:651 Y1:448 Y2:524
This affair between my brother and myself
has got to be settled.

1102
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:27,127  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:524
But we've got trouble enough as it is.
Come, let's go.

1103
01:10:27,332 --> 01:10:30,324  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:524
We're not going.
We're sleeping right here in this house.

1104
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:34,291  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
What? With a cop in the kitchen
and Spenalzo in the windowseat?

1105
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:38,041  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's all he's got on us. We'll take
Spenalzo and dump him in the bay.

1106
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:41,522  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:519
After that, we're coming back here.
Then if he tries to interfere--

1107
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,364  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, no, Johnny. No, please.

1108
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:46,489  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:519
We've got a wonderful setup here.
We can make a fortune.

1109
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:51,083  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:524
Two old ladies as a front.
Only Mortimer stands in our way.

1110
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:53,601  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:519
I never did like Mortimer.

1111
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:55,922  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Please, take it easy. Please!

1112
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:58,168  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:524
Doctor, you know
when I make up my mind--

1113
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:00,931  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
When you make up your mind,
you lose your head.

1114
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,249  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

1115
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:07,721  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, Johnny. Okay!

1116
01:11:09,252 --> 01:11:12,608  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:519
Take the instruments and hide them
in the cellar. Move fast.

1117
01:11:14,932 --> 01:11:18,004  X1:066 X2:651 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.
-I don't know.

1118
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:20,851  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
-My mother was an actress.
-Legitimate?

1119
01:11:20,932 --> 01:11:22,570  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:524
Of course. She was my mother.

1120
01:11:22,652 --> 01:11:24,688  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Excuse me.
-Peaches La Tour was her name.

1121
01:11:26,332 --> 01:11:28,129  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Come quick!
-What's the matter?

1122
01:11:28,212 --> 01:11:30,328  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You know that hole in the cellar?
-Yes.

1123
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:32,801  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, we got an ace in the hole.

1124
01:11:34,652 --> 01:11:37,450  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's no fly-by-night idea.
I worked on it for 12 years.

1125
01:11:37,852 --> 01:11:40,047  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, rehash it. I'll be back in a minute.

1126
01:11:40,132 --> 01:11:41,770  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Swell.
-I like the first act.

1127
01:11:41,852 --> 01:11:43,729  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
I didn't tell you the first--

1128
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:52,764  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:524
I thought I told you....

1129
01:11:57,452 --> 01:11:59,170  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, Mortimer.

1130
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:04,045  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:524
What are you doing still here?
I thought I said beat it.

1131
01:12:04,132 --> 01:12:05,326  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're not going.

1132
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:07,050  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You're not going?
-No.

1133
01:12:07,252 --> 01:12:08,651  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:524
You stay out of this.

1134
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:11,087  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, you asked for it.

1135
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:12,884  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Officer O'Hara?
-Coming.

1136
01:12:13,732 --> 01:12:16,121  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:519
If you tell O'Hara
what's in the windowseat...

1137
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:18,203  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:519
...l'll tell him what's in the cellar.

1138
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,247  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:482 Y2:519
Cellar?

1139
01:12:19,532 --> 01:12:23,127  X1:080 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:524
There's an elderly gentleman down there
who seems to be very dead.

1140
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:27,246  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What were you doing there?
-What's he doing there?

1141
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:29,607  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now what are you going to tell O'Hara?

1142
01:12:29,932 --> 01:12:33,163  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
Your aunts want to hear the rest.
Shall I bring them in here?

1143
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:35,852  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:524
You can't do that now.
You'd better ring in.

1144
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:38,725  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:524
The heck with ringing in!
I want to tell you the plot.

1145
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,167  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:519
You can't tell me
in front of those two fellas.

1146
01:12:41,252 --> 01:12:42,287  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:522
Lowbrows, huh?

1147
01:12:42,412 --> 01:12:45,722  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:524
Let's go where we can be alone.
I'll meet you there later.

1148
01:12:45,852 --> 01:12:48,127  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:524
How about the backroom at Kelly's?

1149
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:51,244  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:519
Fine place. Bohemian atmosphere.
Genius at work.

1150
01:12:51,332 --> 01:12:53,243  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:524
You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

1151
01:12:53,372 --> 01:12:55,567  X1:071 X2:647 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why don't you both go down in the cellar?

1152
01:12:55,652 --> 01:12:57,483  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's all right with me.

1153
01:12:57,612 --> 01:13:00,763  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:524
There's a much more literary atmosphere
in Kelly's, I assure you.

1154
01:13:00,852 --> 01:13:02,126  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
This opening will kill you.

1155
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:04,328  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm waiting to be born and the doctor--

1156
01:13:04,412 --> 01:13:05,561  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:519
The doctor!

1157
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:08,126  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

1158
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:11,130  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
You won't stand me up, will you?
This is a great play.

1159
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:13,203  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I'll see you down there.
-Can't wait!

1160
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:14,486  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:522
Doctor, doctor.

1161
01:13:14,652 --> 01:13:17,007  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where are those papers? There they are.

1162
01:13:18,452 --> 01:13:22,127  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're smug, aren't you? You think
you've got it over me. You haven't.

1163
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:26,166  X1:070 X2:648 Y1:448 Y2:522
You think I'm afraid to tell about Spenalzo
because of Hoskins. Well, I'm not!

1164
01:13:26,252 --> 01:13:27,605  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
The moment I get Spenalzo....

1165
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:30,923  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:519
The moment the doctor signs,
I don't care who knows about Hoskins.

1166
01:13:31,012 --> 01:13:34,288  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
And you better feel the same way
about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo!

1167
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:37,170  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Where are you going?
-To the doctor's. Where do you....

1168
01:13:37,252 --> 01:13:40,005  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:524
When I come back,
I expect to find you gone. Wait for me!

1169
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:42,569  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:519
We'll wait for him.

1170
01:13:43,572 --> 01:13:45,164  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did he look guilty!

1171
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:49,003  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:519
Well, Martha,
I think we can start the services now.

1172
01:13:50,572 --> 01:13:52,164  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
We thought we heard you leave.

1173
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,210  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:524
Perish the thought, dear aunties.
That was just Mortimer.

1174
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:57,123  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
And speaking of services...

1175
01:13:57,252 --> 01:14:01,484  X1:062 X2:655 Y1:448 Y2:524
...will you make us some coffee
while we take Spenalzo down to the cellar?

1176
01:14:02,132 --> 01:14:04,692  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, Jonathan.
You've got to take him with you!

1177
01:14:04,812 --> 01:14:08,009  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:524
There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs
waiting for him.

1178
01:14:08,132 --> 01:14:11,283  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:522
-A friend of Mortimer's?
-Take his feet, Doctor.

1179
01:14:11,772 --> 01:14:14,491  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
Mr. Spenalzo and he
will get along fine together.

1180
01:14:14,572 --> 01:14:16,005  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're both dead.

1181
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,524  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:519
He must mean Mr. Hoskins.

1182
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:20,131  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mr. Hoskins?

1183
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:27,128  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:519
You know about what's down there?

1184
01:14:27,252 --> 01:14:30,483  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:519
Of course we do.
And he's no friend of Mortimer's.

1185
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:33,206  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He's one of our gentlemen.
-Your gentlemen?

1186
01:14:33,412 --> 01:14:37,121  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes. And we won't have
any strangers buried in our cellar.

1187
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:40,284  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:524
-But Mr. Hoskins--
-Mr. Hoskins is no stranger.

1188
01:14:40,412 --> 01:14:42,846  X1:070 X2:649 Y1:482 Y2:524
Besides, there's no room for Mr. Spenalzo.

1189
01:14:42,932 --> 01:14:44,763  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:524
The cellar's crowded already.

1190
01:14:44,852 --> 01:14:46,285  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:519
Crowded? With what?

1191
01:14:46,412 --> 01:14:49,006  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
There are 12 graves down there now.

1192
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:56,491  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:524
Twelve graves.

1193
01:14:56,572 --> 01:14:59,723  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:524
That leaves very little room
and we're going to need it.

1194
01:15:00,052 --> 01:15:02,646  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:519
You mean, you and Aunt Martha
have murdered 12--

1195
01:15:02,772 --> 01:15:05,889  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:519
Murdered? Certainly not.
It's one of our charities.

1196
01:15:05,972 --> 01:15:08,691  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why, what we've been doing is a mercy.

1197
01:15:08,812 --> 01:15:12,964  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:519
So you just take your Mr. Spenalzo
out of here.

1198
01:15:17,692 --> 01:15:19,728  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:519
You've done all that...

1199
01:15:20,212 --> 01:15:24,046  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:519
...right here in this house
and buried them in the cellar?

1200
01:15:25,412 --> 01:15:27,846  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's wonderful, Johnny!

1201
01:15:28,132 --> 01:15:30,362  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:519
We've been chased all over the world...

1202
01:15:30,452 --> 01:15:34,411  X1:097 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:524
...and they stay right here in Brooklyn,
and they do just as good as you do.

1203
01:15:34,532 --> 01:15:35,567  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:482 Y2:519
What?

1204
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,082  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
You got 12, they got 12.

1205
01:15:39,572 --> 01:15:40,687  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've got 13.

1206
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:44,089  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:519
-No, Johnny, 12. Don't brag.
-Thirteen.

1207
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:47,768  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:519
There's Mr. Spenalzo.
Then the first one in London.

1208
01:15:47,972 --> 01:15:50,770  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:519
Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney,
one in Melbourne...

1209
01:15:50,852 --> 01:15:53,491  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:522
...two in San Francisco,
one in Phoenix, Arizona.

1210
01:15:53,572 --> 01:15:54,561  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:482 Y2:519
Phoenix?

1211
01:15:54,812 --> 01:15:57,201  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:524
-The filling station.
-Filling....

1212
01:15:57,332 --> 01:16:00,165  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
Three in Chicago and one in South Bend.

1213
01:16:00,372 --> 01:16:01,646  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:519
That makes 13.

1214
01:16:01,732 --> 01:16:05,042  X1:078 X2:638 Y1:448 Y2:524
You cannot count the one in South Bend.
He died of pneumonia.

1215
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:07,965  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:519
He wouldn't have died of pneumonia
if I hadn't shot him.

1216
01:16:08,052 --> 01:16:10,043  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:519
You cannot count him.

1217
01:16:10,372 --> 01:16:12,727  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
You got 12, they got 12.

1218
01:16:12,852 --> 01:16:16,162  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
The old ladies is just as good as you are.

1219
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:20,923  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:524
They are, are they?

1220
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:24,406  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, that's easily taken care of.

1221
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:27,046  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:519
All I need is one more.

1222
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:30,005  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:519
That's all. Just one more.

1223
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:34,762  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
And I've a pretty good idea who it is.

1224
01:16:35,372 --> 01:16:38,489  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:522
I'm a lucky man to have caught you
at home, Dr. Gilchrist.

1225
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:40,244  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
This is most irregular.

1226
01:16:40,372 --> 01:16:43,967  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed,
but only you can help me.

1227
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:47,601  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:524
I know Teddy blows bugles,
but I can't commit a man just on that.

1228
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:49,085  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:524
If you'd talk with him...

1229
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:51,970  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:519
...l'm sure you'd be convinced.
Here's the house l--

1230
01:16:54,452 --> 01:16:56,204  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:519
-There goes Hoskins.
-Who?

1231
01:16:56,332 --> 01:16:58,209  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:524
What? Did I say....

1232
01:17:00,212 --> 01:17:01,645  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:519
-You better wait.
-Here?

1233
01:17:01,732 --> 01:17:02,960  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll bring Teddy out.

1234
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:05,930  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:524
I wouldn't want to alarm the old ladies,
seeing a doctor.

1235
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:08,162  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:524
-You wait here.
-In the cemetery?

1236
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:09,566  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:519
It's Halloween.

1237
01:17:09,652 --> 01:17:11,927  X1:071 X2:646 Y1:482 Y2:524
The pixies won't be out till after midnight.

1238
01:17:12,012 --> 01:17:15,687  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:524
Make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right back.

1239
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:17,770  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Hey, $22.50!
-What?

1240
01:17:17,892 --> 01:17:18,881  X1:297 X2:418 Y1:482 Y2:521
$22.50!

1241
01:17:19,012 --> 01:17:21,207  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, yes, looks good on you!

1242
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:23,604  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:522
Not the suit, the meter!

1243
01:17:24,972 --> 01:17:27,770  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Looks good on me." $22.50.

1244
01:17:31,692 --> 01:17:34,764  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:522
-Did you give him a 21-gun salute?
-Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

1245
01:17:34,852 --> 01:17:36,888  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
Five more bucks and you'll own it.

1246
01:17:36,972 --> 01:17:39,167  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:522
No, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

1247
01:17:40,932 --> 01:17:43,844  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Mr. President, may I present--
-Dr. Livingstone!

1248
01:17:43,932 --> 01:17:46,969  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Livingstone?
-That's what he presumes.

1249
01:17:47,092 --> 01:17:49,811  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
The doctor would like
to have a few words with you.

1250
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:52,770  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
Certainly. Welcome to Washington.

1251
01:17:52,932 --> 01:17:55,685  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:524
Arlington is beautiful
at this time of year, is it not?

1252
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,125  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, indeed.

1253
01:18:02,212 --> 01:18:04,487  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well now, that's that.

1254
01:18:04,692 --> 01:18:06,683  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
It gives me a chance to rest.

1255
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:11,731  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:482 Y2:524
So far, so good.

1256
01:18:14,452 --> 01:18:15,726  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:524
Not so good.

1257
01:18:21,612 --> 01:18:23,523  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:524
Do you or do you not love me?

1258
01:18:25,332 --> 01:18:28,847  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
How can you say such a thing?
Darling, of course I love you.

1259
01:18:28,932 --> 01:18:30,604  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Do you?
-Yes, darling.

1260
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:34,088  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:524
Then why have you been treating me
the way you have?

1261
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:40,846  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:524
Darling, I love you so much,
I can't go through with our marriage.

1262
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:44,690  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Have you suddenly gone crazy?

1263
01:18:44,772 --> 01:18:47,491  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:524
I don't think so,
but it's only a matter of time.

1264
01:18:47,572 --> 01:18:51,087  X1:079 X2:640 Y1:448 Y2:519
Darling, would you want to have children
with three heads?

1265
01:18:51,172 --> 01:18:55,051  X1:067 X2:651 Y1:448 Y2:524
You wouldn't want to set up housekeeping
in a padded cell.

1266
01:18:55,212 --> 01:18:58,249  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What are you talking about?
-Well, I don't quite know.

1267
01:18:58,452 --> 01:19:01,762  X1:064 X2:655 Y1:448 Y2:524
I probably should have told you this before,
but you see...

1268
01:19:01,852 --> 01:19:05,003  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
...well, insanity runs in my family.

1269
01:19:06,092 --> 01:19:08,083  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
It practically gallops.

1270
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:12,406  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:519
Just because Teddy's strange,
that doesn't mean--

1271
01:19:12,492 --> 01:19:14,926  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, darling. It's way back before Teddy.

1272
01:19:15,132 --> 01:19:18,807  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:524
This goes back to the first Brewster
who came over on the Mayflower.

1273
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:22,926  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know how in those days
the lndians used to scalp the settlers?

1274
01:19:23,372 --> 01:19:25,408  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
He used to scalp the lndians.

1275
01:19:26,252 --> 01:19:28,004  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
Darling, that's ancient history.

1276
01:19:28,092 --> 01:19:31,562  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:519
Doctor, I'll run for a third term,
but I won't be elected.

1277
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:34,485  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:519
That'll mean the last of the Roosevelts
in the White House.

1278
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:37,928  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
-That's what you think.
-Of course, if the country insists....

1279
01:19:38,012 --> 01:19:40,207  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
Darling, all this doesn't prove a thing.

1280
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:43,170  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:524
Look at your aunts.
They're Brewsters, aren't they?

1281
01:19:43,252 --> 01:19:45,925  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
They're the sweetest,
sanest people I've ever known.

1282
01:19:48,332 --> 01:19:51,130  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, even they have their peculiarities.

1283
01:19:51,212 --> 01:19:54,090  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
What of it? So your family's crazy.
So you're crazy.

1284
01:19:54,172 --> 01:19:55,969  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's the way I love you.

1285
01:19:56,332 --> 01:19:58,641  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm crazy too, but kiss me.

1286
01:19:58,972 --> 01:20:00,530  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:522
No, no. I....

1287
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:07,368  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:524
Goodbye, Ambassador.
I've enjoyed this little talk very much.

1288
01:20:07,452 --> 01:20:10,842  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:524
Anytime you're in Washington,
drop in to see me at the White House.

1289
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:19,285  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Those papers.
-Go away. Papers!

1290
01:20:19,452 --> 01:20:21,886  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I'll commit him to any place.
-You will?

1291
01:20:21,972 --> 01:20:24,202  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:519
I've just been appointed
Ambassador to Bolivia!

1292
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:26,886  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
You see? Didn't I tell you?

1293
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:30,044  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't worry about that.
Just go on signing the papers.

1294
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,161  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you.

1295
01:20:34,332 --> 01:20:38,007  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:519
All right! We'll find out
whose house this is!

1296
01:20:38,132 --> 01:20:40,726  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm warning you, you better stop it.

1297
01:20:40,812 --> 01:20:44,248  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:524
There's no use doing what you're doing.
It'll just have to be undone.

1298
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:45,970  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aunt Abby, go to bed!

1299
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:50,005  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's a terrible thing to do to bury
a good Methodist with a foreigner.

1300
01:20:50,092 --> 01:20:51,491  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where have you been?

1301
01:20:51,572 --> 01:20:54,132  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:524
Getting some papers signed.
Is Teddy in his room?

1302
01:20:54,212 --> 01:20:55,930  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
What is the matter with you?

1303
01:20:56,012 --> 01:20:58,924  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:519
Running around getting papers signed
at a time like this.

1304
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:01,128  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
Martha and I are going for the police.

1305
01:21:01,212 --> 01:21:02,167  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:482 Y2:519
Police!

1306
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,041  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:482 Y2:519
Wait!

1307
01:21:04,132 --> 01:21:06,441  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:522
-You can't go for the police.
-Oh, no?

1308
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:08,244  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know what Jonathan's doing?

1309
01:21:08,332 --> 01:21:11,210  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:524
He's putting Mr. Hoskins
and Mr. Spenalzo in together.

1310
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:12,520  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, let him.

1311
01:21:12,612 --> 01:21:15,251  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
This is all fixed up nice now.

1312
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:17,807  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:519
Nice and smooth like a lake.

1313
01:21:17,972 --> 01:21:21,965  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:519
The President will be very proud
of his Panama Canal.

1314
01:21:23,932 --> 01:21:25,888  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bed feels good already.

1315
01:21:25,972 --> 01:21:29,521  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:519
You know, we didn't get any sleep
for 48 hours.

1316
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:31,370  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're forgetting, Doctor.

1317
01:21:32,612 --> 01:21:35,888  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
If Jonathan and Mr. Spenalzo
aren't out this house before morning...

1318
01:21:35,972 --> 01:21:37,724  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
...we're going for the police.

1319
01:21:37,812 --> 01:21:39,450  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll get them out, I promise!

1320
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:43,445  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Then you get the wedding silver.
-Remember, no police! No police!

1321
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,843  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, go to bed, will you?

1322
01:21:45,972 --> 01:21:49,442  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:519
Get out of those clothes!
You look like a double blackout.

1323
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:51,967  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:524
My brother, Mortimer.

1324
01:21:52,252 --> 01:21:53,970  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
I just heard him upstairs.

1325
01:21:54,612 --> 01:21:57,046  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:519
No! I am tired.

1326
01:21:57,132 --> 01:22:01,410  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:524
You forget, I got to operate
on your face tomorrow.

1327
01:22:01,612 --> 01:22:04,410  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:519
You are going to operate tomorrow,
Doctor.

1328
01:22:04,572 --> 01:22:07,245  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:519
But tonight we are taking care
of Mortimer.

1329
01:22:07,372 --> 01:22:10,409  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
But Johnny, not tonight! I'm sleepy.

1330
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,926  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'll do it tomorrow. Or the next day.

1331
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,203  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:522
Look at me, Doctor.

1332
01:22:16,052 --> 01:22:19,761  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
You can see that it's got to be done,
can't you?

1333
01:22:20,012 --> 01:22:23,482  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yeah, I know that look.

1334
01:22:23,692 --> 01:22:26,968  X1:067 X2:650 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

1335
01:22:27,172 --> 01:22:29,561  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, Johnny. Okay, we'll do it.

1336
01:22:29,692 --> 01:22:32,889  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
But the quick way, huh?
The quick twist like in London.

1337
01:22:33,092 --> 01:22:37,051  X1:161 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, Doctor. I think this calls
for something special.

1338
01:22:37,732 --> 01:22:41,122  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

1339
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,965  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
Not the Melbourne method, please!

1340
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,764  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:519
Two hours!

1341
01:22:45,932 --> 01:22:48,287  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:522
And then when it was all over, what?

1342
01:22:48,492 --> 01:22:52,246  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:519
The fellow in London was just as dead
as the fellow in Melbourne.

1343
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:55,564  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:522
Don't do that, Mr. President.

1344
01:22:55,652 --> 01:22:58,530  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:524
But I cannot sign anything
without consulting my Cabinet.

1345
01:22:58,612 --> 01:22:59,840  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:519
This must be secret.

1346
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:02,571  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:524
A secret proclamation? How unusual.

1347
01:23:02,772 --> 01:23:05,605  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:519
Yes, it's the only way
we can outsmart the other fellow.

1348
01:23:05,692 --> 01:23:07,922  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Who's the other fellow?
-That's the secret.

1349
01:23:08,012 --> 01:23:09,764  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, I see!

1350
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:11,520  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:524
Very clever.

1351
01:23:11,852 --> 01:23:14,366  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:524
A secret proclamation
has to be signed in secret.

1352
01:23:14,452 --> 01:23:17,410  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Of course, Mr. President.
-I'll put on my signing clothes.

1353
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,608  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:482 Y2:524
You already have them on, Mr. President.

1354
01:23:19,692 --> 01:23:21,922  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:519
So I have. Wait here.

1355
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:27,208  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, Mr. Brewster.

1356
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:28,845  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:522
What is it, mice?

1357
01:23:31,932 --> 01:23:34,844  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:524
-You get out of this house.
-Can't you see I'm busy?

1358
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:45,164  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you, Mr. President.

1359
01:23:45,732 --> 01:23:48,371  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:524
What a load off my mind.
Boy, could I use a drink!

1360
01:23:48,452 --> 01:23:52,001  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Get out of here, will you, please?
-What? Speak up. I can't hear you.

1361
01:23:52,092 --> 01:23:53,889  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:524
Johnny's in a bad mood. Get out!

1362
01:23:53,972 --> 01:23:57,328  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.
-Please listen to me. Get out.

1363
01:23:57,412 --> 01:24:01,007  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
Stop all this! What are you doing?
Look, Doc-- Are you really a doctor?

1364
01:24:01,092 --> 01:24:02,889  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, Heidelberg, 1919.

1365
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:05,572  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:524
Heidelberg?
How'd you hook up with Jonathan?

1366
01:24:05,692 --> 01:24:09,571  X1:070 X2:648 Y1:448 Y2:519
I tell you later about that, but you go now.
Please listen to me.

1367
01:24:10,532 --> 01:24:11,851  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:524
Stop it, Doctor!

1368
01:24:11,932 --> 01:24:14,810  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
You get out of here!
Look, when Johnny's in that mood...

1369
01:24:14,892 --> 01:24:17,087  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:519
...he's a madman. He's a maniac!

1370
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:20,250  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:482 Y2:524
And then things happen. Horrible things.

1371
01:24:20,332 --> 01:24:22,527  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Get out of here!
-Will you stop it?

1372
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:25,206  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:519
Stop telling me about Jonathan,
I'll take care of him.

1373
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:28,090  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:524
You take care of yourself.
Get going, little fellow.

1374
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:30,208  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What's that? Wait.
-My schnapps.

1375
01:24:30,292 --> 01:24:32,760  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I could use that.
-That's mine.

1376
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:36,002  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
Please. Only for dramatic critics.

1377
01:24:36,092 --> 01:24:38,811  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:519
You beat it before things start popping
around here.

1378
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:40,962  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:524
But, look, Mr. Brewster, please.

1379
01:24:41,052 --> 01:24:42,610  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
You've just been married.

1380
01:24:42,692 --> 01:24:46,082  X1:070 X2:647 Y1:448 Y2:524
You have a nice little wife waiting for you.
Please go now.

1381
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:47,526  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:519
Please.

1382
01:24:51,572 --> 01:24:54,245  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't those plays you see all the time
teach you anything?

1383
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:58,081  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't get me on the subject of plays!
I've got to wait for Mr. Witherspoon.

1384
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:00,606  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:524
At least people in plays
act like they got sense.

1385
01:25:00,692 --> 01:25:03,490  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:524
Did anybody in a play
ever act like they got intelligence?

1386
01:25:03,572 --> 01:25:06,723  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
-How can somebody be so stupid?
-You ought to have my job.

1387
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:10,811  X1:074 X2:646 Y1:448 Y2:519
When you get out of prison, have yourself
wheeled to the Garrick Theater.

1388
01:25:11,132 --> 01:25:14,442  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:524
There's a play that's so bad,
it'll still be running when you get out.

1389
01:25:14,532 --> 01:25:16,329  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:519
There's a man.... Now listen to this.

1390
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:19,848  X1:065 X2:655 Y1:448 Y2:524
He knows he's in the house with murderers
and should know he's in danger.

1391
01:25:19,932 --> 01:25:22,321  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
He's even been warned to get out.
And does he go?

1392
01:25:22,412 --> 01:25:24,130  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, he doesn't. He stays!

1393
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:28,803  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:524
This fellow doesn't even have sense
to be scared or to be on his guard.

1394
01:25:29,012 --> 01:25:30,968  X1:065 X2:653 Y1:482 Y2:519
The murderer even invites him to sit down.

1395
01:25:31,052 --> 01:25:32,963  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:519
-What do you think he does?
-I don't know.

1396
01:25:33,052 --> 01:25:34,690  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:519
He sits down!

1397
01:25:34,772 --> 01:25:37,889  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:519
He deliberately pulls up a chair
and he sits down in it.

1398
01:25:38,012 --> 01:25:39,445  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:524
Isn't that great?

1399
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:43,602  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:524
So there he is,
all waiting to be trussed up and gagged.

1400
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:48,160  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:519
What do you think they tied him up with?
The curtain cord.

1401
01:25:49,252 --> 01:25:50,526  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:519
Curtain cord?

1402
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,889  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
But didn't he see him get it?

1403
01:25:52,972 --> 01:25:56,044  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:519
No. The silly chump sits down
with his back toward the murderer.

1404
01:25:56,132 --> 01:25:58,930  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:519
All he has to do is look around,
but does he? No!

1405
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:03,728  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
See, brother Heidelberg,
in a play or even in a movie...

1406
01:26:03,972 --> 01:26:07,521  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:524
...a fellow never sees or hears anything.
That's right.

1407
01:26:07,612 --> 01:26:09,045  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:519
But what does he do?

1408
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:12,921  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:524
The big chump sits there.
This fellow's supposed to be bright.

1409
01:26:13,012 --> 01:26:16,163  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:519
Now get a load of this.
Look at the attitude.

1410
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:20,121  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
Large as life! He sits there
waiting to be tied up and gagged.

1411
01:26:20,692 --> 01:26:22,011  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:524
The big dope!

1412
01:26:30,772 --> 01:26:34,481  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:524
You were right about that fellow.
He wasn't very bright.

1413
01:26:35,692 --> 01:26:37,125  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, Mortimer.

1414
01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:40,686  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've been away for 20 years.

1415
01:26:40,972 --> 01:26:44,123  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
But never, my dear brother,
were you out of my mind.

1416
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:49,723  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:524
In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

1417
01:27:11,572 --> 01:27:15,281  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:524
The more you struggle
the more you strangle yourself.

1418
01:27:17,972 --> 01:27:20,645  X1:066 X2:652 Y1:482 Y2:524
Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

1419
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:54,086  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:522
Now, Doctor...

1420
01:27:55,892 --> 01:27:57,405  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:524
...we go to work.

1421
01:27:57,492 --> 01:27:59,847  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:524
Johnny, for me, the quick way. Please.

1422
01:28:00,892 --> 01:28:03,645  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:519
-This must be an artistic achievement.
-Please.

1423
01:28:03,852 --> 01:28:07,401  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
After all, we're performing
before a very distinguished critic.

1424
01:28:08,252 --> 01:28:09,287  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:482 Y2:519
Please!

1425
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:13,362  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right. Let's get it over with.

1426
01:28:14,252 --> 01:28:17,642  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:519
But I cannot see this without the drink.

1427
01:28:18,692 --> 01:28:20,091  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
Pull yourself together.

1428
01:28:20,172 --> 01:28:23,960  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:519
But I can't pull myself together
without a drink.

1429
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:26,885  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:519
You remember when we came in,
there was some wine.

1430
01:28:26,972 --> 01:28:29,805  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:524
And then they took it.
Where did they put it?

1431
01:28:31,212 --> 01:28:33,123  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:519
I found some wine.

1432
01:28:34,572 --> 01:28:36,563  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
Here, I'll split it with you.

1433
01:28:36,652 --> 01:28:39,246  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
We both have a drink before we operate.

1434
01:28:39,492 --> 01:28:43,883  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:524
I am so happy that we don't have
to operate without a drink.

1435
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:51,811  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
One moment, please.

1436
01:28:52,652 --> 01:28:54,449  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where are your manners?

1437
01:28:57,092 --> 01:28:58,571  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, Mortimer.

1438
01:28:58,812 --> 01:29:02,691  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
I realize now that it was you
who brought me back to Brooklyn.

1439
01:29:02,772 --> 01:29:04,171  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
We drink to you.

1440
01:29:05,492 --> 01:29:07,403  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
To my dear, dead brother.

1441
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:25,527  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:482 Y2:519
That idiot!

1442
01:29:25,612 --> 01:29:29,127  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He goes next. That's all. He goes next!
-Not Teddy! Please!

1443
01:29:29,252 --> 01:29:31,766  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:519
-We'll get to him later.
-You won't at all!

1444
01:29:31,932 --> 01:29:33,809  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:524
We have to work fast. The quick way.

1445
01:29:33,892 --> 01:29:35,405  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
The quick way, yes!

1446
01:29:35,492 --> 01:29:38,723  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:524
If it has to be, then the quick way.
I'll help you.

1447
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:55,008  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
The colonel has to quit blowing that horn.

1448
01:29:55,092 --> 01:29:58,050  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's all right. We're taking
the bugle away from him.

1449
01:29:58,132 --> 01:30:01,090  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'd better talk to him myself.
Where's the lights?

1450
01:30:07,292 --> 01:30:08,964  X1:228 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:524
You stood me up!

1451
01:30:09,532 --> 01:30:12,444  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've been waiting for you
for over an hour at Kelly's.

1452
01:30:13,412 --> 01:30:15,368  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What happened to him?
-Nothing.

1453
01:30:15,532 --> 01:30:20,526  X1:066 X2:650 Y1:448 Y2:524
He was explaining a play he saw and
that's what happened to a man in the play.

1454
01:30:21,212 --> 01:30:22,122  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:482 Y2:519
I see.

1455
01:30:22,652 --> 01:30:24,722  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did that really happen in a play you saw?

1456
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,401  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:524
How do you like that?
You can't trust nobody.

1457
01:30:27,492 --> 01:30:29,926  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
They practically stole that from my play.

1458
01:30:30,252 --> 01:30:33,961  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:524
In the second act, just--
Maybe I'd better start at the beginning.

1459
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:37,285  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yeah, sure.

1460
01:30:42,892 --> 01:30:45,360  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
You've got to hear the plot!

1461
01:30:48,492 --> 01:30:52,201  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:524
My mother's making up.
Like a flash, out of a clear sky...

1462
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:54,926  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:519
...the door opens and a man
with a mustache comes in.

1463
01:30:55,012 --> 01:30:58,641  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
He says, "Miss Peaches La Tour,
will you marry me?"

1464
01:30:59,492 --> 01:31:04,202  X1:074 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's the first scene. My mother doesn't
say they're married. That's the surprise!

1465
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:05,606  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:519
What a kick!

1466
01:31:06,052 --> 01:31:09,522  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:522
Twenty-five years pass.
Well, in the meantime, there's me.

1467
01:31:09,692 --> 01:31:13,048  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:519
Growing into a magnificent specimen.
So what do I do?

1468
01:31:13,132 --> 01:31:16,329  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:519
I join the police force and become
one of New York's finest.

1469
01:31:16,412 --> 01:31:19,848  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:519
I'm cleaning out a crooked laundry, see?
Little do I know it...

1470
01:31:19,972 --> 01:31:22,361  X1:071 X2:647 Y1:482 Y2:524
...but a dope fiend with a knife is after me.

1471
01:31:22,452 --> 01:31:23,931  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm in great danger.

1472
01:31:25,292 --> 01:31:28,284  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's getting you, ain't it?
I can see it in your eyes.

1473
01:31:29,732 --> 01:31:31,529  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
You ain't heard nothing yet.

1474
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:34,724  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:519
All of a sudden, a fire breaks out.
What an effect!

1475
01:31:34,812 --> 01:31:37,121  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:524
Firemen rush in and who's leading them?

1476
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:39,408  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia!

1477
01:31:42,092 --> 01:31:43,571  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:519
What's the matter with him?

1478
01:31:43,652 --> 01:31:46,246  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Probably your play put him to sleep.
-What?

1479
01:31:46,332 --> 01:31:50,245  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I personally like it very much.
-It's probably over his head.

1480
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:53,450  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Where have I seen that face before?
-No, please.

1481
01:31:55,572 --> 01:31:58,484  X1:069 X2:648 Y1:482 Y2:524
The scene changes. It's an evolving stage.

1482
01:31:58,732 --> 01:32:00,927  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm walking along my beat, casual-like...

1483
01:32:01,012 --> 01:32:04,561  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:524
...when a guy that I'm following,
it turns out he's following me!

1484
01:32:04,892 --> 01:32:07,645  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:524
Don't let nobody in.
I figures I'll outsmart him.

1485
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:11,082  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:524
-There's a vacant house on the corner.
-Johnny, the cops!

1486
01:32:11,172 --> 01:32:13,891  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:524
I sees the door handle turn,
so I pulls out my gun...

1487
01:32:13,972 --> 01:32:16,327  X1:064 X2:655 Y1:482 Y2:524
...braces myself against the wall and I says:

1488
01:32:16,412 --> 01:32:17,401  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:482 Y2:519
"Come in! "

1489
01:32:21,372 --> 01:32:22,771  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hello, boys.

1490
01:32:23,212 --> 01:32:26,807  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What the Sam Hill's going on?
-Sarge, this is Mortimer Brewster.

1491
01:32:26,892 --> 01:32:30,089  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He's going to help me write my play.
-Do you have to tie him up?

1492
01:32:30,172 --> 01:32:34,006  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
Report in. Why didn't you ring in?
The whole force is out looking for you.

1493
01:32:34,092 --> 01:32:37,084  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:524
Right in the middle of the second act.
Did they send you here?

1494
01:32:37,172 --> 01:32:39,527  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:522
No, we came to warn the old ladies.

1495
01:32:39,612 --> 01:32:41,967  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:519
-The colonel blew that bugle again.
-I heard him.

1496
01:32:42,052 --> 01:32:44,885  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:524
The neighbors are phoning in.
The Lieutenant's on the warpath.

1497
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:47,247  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:524
He says we've got
to put him away someplace.

1498
01:32:47,572 --> 01:32:49,051  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:522
Now, who the heck is this?

1499
01:32:49,132 --> 01:32:51,805  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:524
Mr. Brewster's brother.
My play put him to sleep.

1500
01:32:51,892 --> 01:32:54,804  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:519
That's the one that ran away.
So he came back.

1501
01:32:55,052 --> 01:32:56,531  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:524
Brophy. Get me Mac.

1502
01:32:56,692 --> 01:33:00,128  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:519
Have you got yourself in a mess!
You're two hours overdue at the station.

1503
01:33:00,412 --> 01:33:02,607  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:482 Y2:524
I better let them know that I found you.

1504
01:33:02,692 --> 01:33:04,410  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:522
It wasn't that bad, was it?

1505
01:33:05,692 --> 01:33:09,571  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:524
Tell the Lieutenant he can call off
the big manhunt. We found him.

1506
01:33:09,852 --> 01:33:12,241  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:519
At the Brewster house.

1507
01:33:12,332 --> 01:33:14,448  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:524
Shall we bring him in?

1508
01:33:14,652 --> 01:33:16,882  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, we'll hold him right here.

1509
01:33:18,532 --> 01:33:21,000  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
The Lieutenant is on his way over.

1510
01:33:21,412 --> 01:33:23,926  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:519
So I've been turned in?

1511
01:33:24,492 --> 01:33:27,052  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, you've got me.

1512
01:33:27,892 --> 01:33:31,931  X1:067 X2:651 Y1:448 Y2:524
I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother
will split the reward.

1513
01:33:32,052 --> 01:33:33,167  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, reward!

1514
01:33:33,252 --> 01:33:35,083  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now I'll do some turning in!

1515
01:33:35,212 --> 01:33:36,804  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:522
Wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

1516
01:33:36,892 --> 01:33:40,282  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:524
You think my aunts are sweet,
charming old ladies, don't you?

1517
01:33:40,372 --> 01:33:43,523  X1:067 X2:649 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar!

1518
01:33:44,012 --> 01:33:44,967  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, 13.

1519
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:47,805  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:519
Be careful what you say.
Your aunts are friends of ours.

1520
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:50,804  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I'll show them to you.
-Don't make trouble for them!

1521
01:33:50,892 --> 01:33:53,326  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:519
Never mind, Mr. Brewster.
Leave him to me.

1522
01:33:53,412 --> 01:33:55,482  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Come down to the cellar.
-Wait a minute.

1523
01:33:55,572 --> 01:33:58,325  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
Thirteen bodies.
I'll show you where they're buried.

1524
01:33:58,932 --> 01:34:01,366  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:522
-Go to the cellar with him.
-Yes, come to the cellar.

1525
01:34:01,452 --> 01:34:03,090  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, look, do I have to?

1526
01:34:04,212 --> 01:34:06,442  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:519
Maybe I don't want to go down
to the cellar.

1527
01:34:06,532 --> 01:34:08,568  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:519
Go on down the cellar with him!

1528
01:34:08,652 --> 01:34:11,883  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:524
Now, please. I'll tell you
the rest of my play later.

1529
01:34:12,452 --> 01:34:15,091  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Go on down the cellar with him.
-Do I have to?

1530
01:34:15,212 --> 01:34:17,680  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:519
Look at that puss.
He looks like Boris Karloff.

1531
01:34:17,772 --> 01:34:18,966  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't! Sarge!

1532
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:26,891  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:482 Y2:522
Look out, Pat!

1533
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,888  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Look out!
-He's got a gun.

1534
01:34:34,492 --> 01:34:36,767  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
I got him, Pat. Look out!

1535
01:34:37,132 --> 01:34:39,009  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:524
Fight. Go on and fight.

1536
01:34:43,532 --> 01:34:46,410  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's enough, that's enough.
Everybody off.

1537
01:34:49,612 --> 01:34:50,681  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:522
Pat, look out!

1538
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:51,887  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
Amazing.

1539
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:59,801  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:524
Such a fine day, too.

1540
01:34:59,892 --> 01:35:03,726  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:524
All I did was cross the bridge
and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing.

1541
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:10,611  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:519
Don't bother me now.

1542
01:35:10,692 --> 01:35:12,648  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:519
You could use this in the third act.

1543
01:35:12,732 --> 01:35:15,200  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:482 Y2:524
I got something better. Let me tell you--

1544
01:35:15,852 --> 01:35:17,251  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll see you later.

1545
01:35:20,772 --> 01:35:23,570  X1:070 X2:647 Y1:482 Y2:524
The papers are all signed. What do I care?

1546
01:35:23,892 --> 01:35:25,371  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
Go ahead, fight.

1547
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:34,485  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'd better call and see
if Witherspoon has left.

1548
01:35:35,492 --> 01:35:36,561  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:524
Telephone.

1549
01:35:37,652 --> 01:35:39,210  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll get every one of you!

1550
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:42,284  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:519
I hate cops. I'll brain the first one
that comes near me!

1551
01:35:42,372 --> 01:35:45,409  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:524
A little higher, brother.
Thank you very much. That's fine.

1552
01:35:46,052 --> 01:35:47,405  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't do that, please.

1553
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:48,686  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:522
Get him, Pat.

1554
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,771  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:519
That won't have any effect.
I've tried it before--

1555
01:35:51,852 --> 01:35:53,126  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
It did. Isn't that amazing?

1556
01:35:55,572 --> 01:35:58,291  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

1557
01:36:00,012 --> 01:36:01,570  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Witherspoon.
-Come in.

1558
01:36:15,492 --> 01:36:17,130  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:519
What has occurred?

1559
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:19,806  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:524
Never mind!
Didn't I tell you I'd handle this?

1560
01:36:20,052 --> 01:36:21,280  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, Lieutenant!

1561
01:36:21,372 --> 01:36:24,967  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
-We were just acting in self-defense.
-What happened? He put up a fight?

1562
01:36:25,052 --> 01:36:27,282  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
This isn't the one who blows the bugle.

1563
01:36:27,372 --> 01:36:31,809  X1:064 X2:653 Y1:448 Y2:519
-This is his brother who tried to kill O'Hara.
-All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

1564
01:36:31,892 --> 01:36:33,769  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:519
Boris.... Turn him over.

1565
01:36:37,452 --> 01:36:39,807  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:482 Y2:519
Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.

1566
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:42,560  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:519
You "kind of think
he's wanted somewhere"?

1567
01:36:42,812 --> 01:36:45,849  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:524
If you guys can't look
at the circulars we put up...

1568
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,401  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:519
...you can at least read
short detective stories.

1569
01:36:48,492 --> 01:36:50,483  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
Certainly, he's wanted. In lndiana!

1570
01:36:50,572 --> 01:36:53,882  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
He escaped from the prison
for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

1571
01:36:53,972 --> 01:36:55,166  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's my brother.

1572
01:36:55,252 --> 01:36:59,086  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:519
That's the way they described him.
"He looked like Karloff."

1573
01:36:59,572 --> 01:37:00,925  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why'd you knock him out?

1574
01:37:01,012 --> 01:37:04,243  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:524
He tried to get us to go to the cellar.
He says 13 bodies are there.

1575
01:37:04,332 --> 01:37:05,765  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:519
Thirteen bodies in the cellar...

1576
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:08,844  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:524
...and that don't tip you off
the guy's from a nuthouse?

1577
01:37:08,932 --> 01:37:10,081  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thanks, pal.

1578
01:37:10,212 --> 01:37:12,009  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
About my not ringing in, I want to--

1579
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:14,526  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:519
Where have you been all night?
Don't tell me.

1580
01:37:14,612 --> 01:37:18,002  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:519
I was right here writing a play
with Mortimer Brewster.

1581
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:20,851  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're going to have
a long time on that play.

1582
01:37:21,012 --> 01:37:22,445  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're suspended.

1583
01:37:22,532 --> 01:37:24,170  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now go on. Report in.

1584
01:37:24,252 --> 01:37:27,244  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:524
Bring him to and find out
where his accomplice is.

1585
01:37:27,332 --> 01:37:29,721  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:522
The guy who helped him escape.
He's wanted, too.

1586
01:37:29,812 --> 01:37:30,801  X1:311 X2:407 Y1:482 Y2:519
Here.

1587
01:37:31,092 --> 01:37:34,243  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've been after these guys for 48 hours.
Nothing to eat. No sleep.

1588
01:37:34,412 --> 01:37:36,289  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.

1589
01:37:36,372 --> 01:37:39,762  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
With flatheads like you on the force.
Falling for a story like that!

1590
01:37:39,852 --> 01:37:41,888  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:519
Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar.

1591
01:37:42,052 --> 01:37:44,327  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:519
But there are 13 bodies in the cellar!

1592
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:47,760  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Who are you?
-I'm President Roosevelt.

1593
01:37:49,452 --> 01:37:52,922  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What the blazes is this?
-He's the one that blows the bugle.

1594
01:37:53,212 --> 01:37:54,725  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:524
Howdy, Colonel.

1595
01:37:58,292 --> 01:38:01,648  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:524
Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.
Get this guy out of here.

1596
01:38:01,852 --> 01:38:04,127  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dear me! Another yellow-fever victim?

1597
01:38:04,572 --> 01:38:07,086  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
All the bodies in the cellar
are yellow-fever victims.

1598
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:10,448  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, Colonel. This is a spy.
We caught him at the White House.

1599
01:38:10,532 --> 01:38:13,000  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:524
Take him out and bring him to.
I want to question him.

1600
01:38:13,092 --> 01:38:16,607  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Questioning of spies is my department.
-Hey, you, keep out of that.

1601
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:20,845  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:519
You're forgetting that as President
I am also head of the Secret Service.

1602
01:38:30,812 --> 01:38:31,927  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who are you?

1603
01:38:32,452 --> 01:38:33,601  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's your name?

1604
01:38:33,692 --> 01:38:36,490  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:524
Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster.
But I'm not myself today.

1605
01:38:36,572 --> 01:38:40,451  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:524
You're his brother. Look, no argument.
He's got to be put away.

1606
01:38:40,572 --> 01:38:45,088  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:524
No arguments, Captain. No arguments.
Just a minute, take it easy. Read this.

1607
01:38:45,172 --> 01:38:47,049  X1:068 X2:650 Y1:482 Y2:524
Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight.

1608
01:38:47,132 --> 01:38:50,329  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I'm waiting for Mr. Witherspoon.
-As long as he's going someplace.

1609
01:38:50,412 --> 01:38:52,528  X1:067 X2:652 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's scaring the neighbors with that bugle.

1610
01:38:52,612 --> 01:38:55,922  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:524
And that cockeyed story
about 13 bodies being--

1611
01:39:04,212 --> 01:39:07,488  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've been without sleep for 48 hours.
I'm liable to think anything.

1612
01:39:07,572 --> 01:39:09,483  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
I know just how you feel.

1613
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,802  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:519
There's people dumb enough
to believe that.

1614
01:39:11,892 --> 01:39:14,964  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:519
Last year there was a crazy guy,
started a murder rumor.

1615
01:39:15,092 --> 01:39:17,652  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:524
I had to dig up a half acre plot
before I could prove--

1616
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:19,609  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:519
-What's this?
-What's the matter?

1617
01:39:19,692 --> 01:39:21,410  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
-These papers aren't any good.
-Why not?

1618
01:39:21,492 --> 01:39:23,960  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
He signed it Theodore Roosevelt!

1619
01:39:28,772 --> 01:39:32,003  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Is your taxi engaged?
-Losing dough every minute. Any offers?

1620
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:36,125  X1:066 X2:651 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm Mr. Witherspoon of Happy Dale
Sanitarium, I have come to get a Brewster.

1621
01:39:36,212 --> 01:39:39,249  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:519
I would like you to drive us back
to the sanitarium.

1622
01:39:40,492 --> 01:39:43,086  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
I knew this would end up in a nuthouse!

1623
01:39:44,532 --> 01:39:47,569  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:519
We like to think of it as a rest home.

1624
01:39:58,052 --> 01:39:59,167  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:519
Mr. Brewster?

1625
01:40:02,732 --> 01:40:04,484  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mr. Witherspoon is here.

1626
01:40:08,132 --> 01:40:11,920  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:519
Supposing the spy steals this document
and finds the name Roosevelt on it.

1627
01:40:12,052 --> 01:40:15,010  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
Think what that would mean
to the safety of the nation!

1628
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,560  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:519
-No, it's chicanery.
-What is this? Come on!

1629
01:40:17,652 --> 01:40:20,769  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He's come to. He's ready to talk.
-Hold him till I get there.

1630
01:40:20,852 --> 01:40:24,367  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:519
Let me explain. The name Brewster
is code for Roosevelt.

1631
01:40:24,772 --> 01:40:26,967  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Code for Roosevelt?
-Take the name Brewster.

1632
01:40:27,052 --> 01:40:29,122  X1:066 X2:651 Y1:482 Y2:524
Take away the "B" and what have you got?

1633
01:40:29,212 --> 01:40:31,487  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Rooster.
-And what does a rooster do?

1634
01:40:31,572 --> 01:40:34,882  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Crows.
-It crows! Where do you hunt in Africa?

1635
01:40:35,052 --> 01:40:37,247  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:524
-On the veldt!
-There you are! "Crowsveldt."

1636
01:40:37,332 --> 01:40:40,529  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:524
Ingenious! My compliments
to the boys in the code department.

1637
01:40:40,612 --> 01:40:42,682  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's all right! Do that again for me.

1638
01:40:42,772 --> 01:40:45,286  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Never mind! Give me that pen.

1639
01:40:46,052 --> 01:40:47,565  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:519
This is fun.

1640
01:40:47,932 --> 01:40:50,241  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

1641
01:40:56,812 --> 01:40:58,564  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm so glad to see you.

1642
01:41:00,492 --> 01:41:02,289  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
You will take good care of Teddy?

1643
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:04,647  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Best of care of him.
-That's fine.

1644
01:41:04,772 --> 01:41:06,524  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
And no wagon when he leaves.

1645
01:41:06,612 --> 01:41:08,648  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why? To take him away? Never, never.

1646
01:41:08,732 --> 01:41:11,451  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:524
Taxicabs. We always....
I have one waiting now.

1647
01:41:11,572 --> 01:41:13,085  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
It means a great deal to me.

1648
01:41:13,172 --> 01:41:16,130  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
You will personally see
that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale?

1649
01:41:16,212 --> 01:41:18,567  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
-He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.
-That's good.

1650
01:41:18,652 --> 01:41:21,644  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
You know, I sometimes envy
some of our patients, secretly.

1651
01:41:21,732 --> 01:41:24,849  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:519
You do? It must be a nice place.
I've never been there.

1652
01:41:24,932 --> 01:41:26,843  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:519
You never can tell.

1653
01:41:27,212 --> 01:41:30,090  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:524
This is a particularly happy moment
for me tonight.

1654
01:41:30,172 --> 01:41:33,960  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:519
-I've never met a dramatic critic before.
-The woods are full of them.

1655
01:41:34,052 --> 01:41:37,488  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:524
I have here something that will explain
what we're trying to do.

1656
01:41:37,572 --> 01:41:40,962  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:524
-A pamphlet about Happy Dale?
-No, it's a play.

1657
01:41:41,092 --> 01:41:42,764  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
Something I've been working on.

1658
01:41:42,852 --> 01:41:46,447  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's a dramatization of many incidents
that have happened at Happy Dale.

1659
01:41:46,532 --> 01:41:48,124  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:524
Captain! Captain!

1660
01:41:49,412 --> 01:41:53,769  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:524
I want you to read this carefully.
I want you to be just as harsh as you like.

1661
01:41:53,852 --> 01:41:55,205  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
I shan't mind, you know--

1662
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:57,601  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
Captain, this is Mr. Witherspoon.

1663
01:42:00,132 --> 01:42:02,009  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

1664
01:42:02,092 --> 01:42:04,003  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Come, my boy.
-What is this?

1665
01:42:05,492 --> 01:42:08,723  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, you got it wrong.
This is Captain Rooney.

1666
01:42:08,932 --> 01:42:10,524  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:524
The police?

1667
01:42:11,892 --> 01:42:15,805  X1:078 X2:640 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed.
Now you can take him away.

1668
01:42:15,892 --> 01:42:18,008  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

1669
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:20,367  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mr. President, I have good news for you.

1670
01:42:20,452 --> 01:42:22,761  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:519
Your term of office is over.

1671
01:42:23,612 --> 01:42:26,046  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Is this March 4?
-Practically.

1672
01:42:26,132 --> 01:42:27,406  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:519
Let's see....

1673
01:42:29,612 --> 01:42:31,842  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa!

1674
01:42:31,972 --> 01:42:34,532  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I must get started immediately.

1675
01:42:40,492 --> 01:42:43,609  X1:074 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:519
Is he trying to move into the White House
before I've moved out?

1676
01:42:43,692 --> 01:42:45,444  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:522
Who, Mr. President?

1677
01:42:45,532 --> 01:42:46,362  X1:313 X2:402 Y1:482 Y2:519
Taft!

1678
01:42:49,492 --> 01:42:54,361  X1:072 X2:646 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, this isn't Mr. Taft.
It's Mr. Witherspoon, your guide to Africa.

1679
01:42:54,692 --> 01:42:56,091  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bully! Bully!

1680
01:42:56,252 --> 01:42:58,766  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:524
Wait right here.
I'll bring down my equipment.

1681
01:42:58,852 --> 01:42:59,887  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:524
Happy man.

1682
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:02,123  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
Goodbye, Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha.

1683
01:43:02,212 --> 01:43:04,885  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:519
I'm on my way to Africa.
Isn't it wonderful?

1684
01:43:04,972 --> 01:43:06,007  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:524
Charge!

1685
01:43:08,652 --> 01:43:10,483  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's all right, I've got it.

1686
01:43:11,532 --> 01:43:12,442  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, dear.

1687
01:43:12,932 --> 01:43:15,810  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

1688
01:43:20,692 --> 01:43:23,331  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:482 Y2:524
You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you?

1689
01:43:23,412 --> 01:43:27,087  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, he's come to take him.
Teddy's been blowing his bugle again.

1690
01:43:27,172 --> 01:43:30,323  X1:078 X2:641 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, he can't go now! We won't permit it.

1691
01:43:30,452 --> 01:43:32,841  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
We promise to take his bugle
away from him.

1692
01:43:32,932 --> 01:43:36,163  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:524
-We won't be separated from Teddy.
-I'm sorry.

1693
01:43:37,692 --> 01:43:39,808  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:524
How can you allow this? You promised.

1694
01:43:39,892 --> 01:43:43,089  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:519
Brewster's got nothing to do with this.
The law is the law!

1695
01:43:43,212 --> 01:43:45,726  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:524
Teddy's committed himself
and he's got to go.

1696
01:43:46,572 --> 01:43:51,566  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:524
-If he's going, we're going, too!
-Yes, you'll have to take us with him.

1697
01:43:52,452 --> 01:43:54,602  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why not? Why not, indeed?

1698
01:43:55,852 --> 01:44:00,004  X1:073 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's sweet of them, but impossible.
We never take sane people at Happy Dale.

1699
01:44:04,372 --> 01:44:08,524  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
These little sane people will get lost
in the shuffle. You could arrange that.

1700
01:44:08,612 --> 01:44:11,490  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:524
Just put them in
and they'll get all mixed up.

1701
01:44:11,732 --> 01:44:14,007  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

1702
01:44:17,492 --> 01:44:19,403  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:522
Now, let's be sensible, ladies.

1703
01:44:19,532 --> 01:44:22,763  X1:071 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:524
Here I am wasting my time
when I could be doing some serious work.

1704
01:44:22,852 --> 01:44:25,241  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:524
There are still murders
to be solved in Brooklyn.

1705
01:44:25,332 --> 01:44:28,483  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:524
It ain't only his bugle blowing.
Things are going to get worse.

1706
01:44:28,572 --> 01:44:31,211  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

1707
01:44:31,292 --> 01:44:32,566  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:482 Y2:519
Our cellar?

1708
01:44:33,772 --> 01:44:37,287  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:519
Teddy's been telling around
there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar.

1709
01:44:37,372 --> 01:44:39,727  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:519
There are 13 bodies in our cellar.

1710
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:46,208  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:482 Y2:519
What?

1711
01:44:46,292 --> 01:44:49,648  X1:075 X2:641 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

1712
01:44:54,652 --> 01:44:55,641  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:524
Charge!

1713
01:45:01,812 --> 01:45:03,245  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:524
Isn't that amazing?

1714
01:45:04,452 --> 01:45:05,965  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:524
You behave yourself.

1715
01:45:06,052 --> 01:45:09,124  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:519
You know very well there are
13 bodies down in our cellar.

1716
01:45:09,212 --> 01:45:11,362  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
Certainly there's 13 bodies in the cellar.

1717
01:45:11,452 --> 01:45:15,161  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:524
And there are hundreds more
up in the attic, Captain!

1718
01:45:19,372 --> 01:45:21,602  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:519
-What is this?
-You mustn't mind Mortimer.

1719
01:45:21,692 --> 01:45:23,603  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:524
-How about it?
-I'll be right there.

1720
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:25,523  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's been a little strange all day.

1721
01:45:25,612 --> 01:45:29,241  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
Right now I wouldn't know what is
and what ain't strange anymore.

1722
01:45:29,332 --> 01:45:32,210  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:524
-I'll look in that cellar.
-I'll tell you what we'll do.

1723
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:35,682  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'll bring my bodies from the attic
and you get yours from the cellar...

1724
01:45:35,772 --> 01:45:40,482  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:524
...and we'll get them all together,
and we'll send them to Happy Dale.

1725
01:45:42,372 --> 01:45:46,001  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
No, you wouldn't have to dig.
The graves are all marked.

1726
01:45:46,412 --> 01:45:49,324  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:519
-We put flowers on them every Sunday.
-Flowers?

1727
01:45:49,412 --> 01:45:51,926  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

1728
01:45:53,692 --> 01:45:55,330  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:522
Humor them, humor them.

1729
01:45:56,052 --> 01:45:57,007  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:482 Y2:519
Smile.

1730
01:45:59,412 --> 01:46:01,687  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's one down there, a Mr. Spenalzo...

1731
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:02,921  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hasn't got it yet.

1732
01:46:03,012 --> 01:46:05,287  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:519
...who doesn't belong here
and has to leave.

1733
01:46:05,372 --> 01:46:09,126  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:524
-But the other 12 are our gentlemen.
-Your gentlemen?

1734
01:46:09,212 --> 01:46:12,090  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
You'd like mine better.
None of mine are gentlemen.

1735
01:46:13,252 --> 01:46:15,766  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:524
-You mustn't mind him at all.
-He got married today.

1736
01:46:15,852 --> 01:46:19,162  X1:114 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
"There is a Happy Dale far, far away

1737
01:46:19,252 --> 01:46:21,208  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:524
"There is a Happy"

1738
01:46:25,372 --> 01:46:27,328  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
He got it. It's amazing.

1739
01:46:27,932 --> 01:46:30,366  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:519
Don't you think you can find room
for the ladies?

1740
01:46:30,452 --> 01:46:31,805  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:482 Y2:519
Just the ladies?

1741
01:46:33,372 --> 01:46:35,090  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:519
Just the ladies!

1742
01:46:36,012 --> 01:46:38,526  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:524
-How about it?
-They'd have to be committed.

1743
01:46:39,212 --> 01:46:41,248  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:482 Y2:524
Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they?

1744
01:46:41,332 --> 01:46:44,005  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:524
-All they have to do is sign the papers.
-Certainly.

1745
01:46:44,092 --> 01:46:47,129  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:524
If we can go with Teddy,
we'll sign the papers.

1746
01:46:47,212 --> 01:46:48,406  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where are they?

1747
01:46:48,492 --> 01:46:50,483  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:524
I have them, ladies, right here.

1748
01:46:50,692 --> 01:46:53,684  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
Sign them up, will you?
I want this all cleaned up.

1749
01:46:53,812 --> 01:46:57,487  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:524
I'm going out to talk to that spy.
Maybe I can understand him.

1750
01:46:57,732 --> 01:46:59,609  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:519
Thirteen bodies in the cellar.

1751
01:46:59,732 --> 01:47:01,370  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ladies, if you'll sign right here.

1752
01:47:12,252 --> 01:47:13,651  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Here?
-Yes, please.

1753
01:47:13,772 --> 01:47:15,808  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's on the right-hand side there.

1754
01:47:15,892 --> 01:47:18,122  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm really looking forward to going.

1755
01:47:18,212 --> 01:47:20,521  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
The neighborhood here has changed so.

1756
01:47:20,652 --> 01:47:23,803  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:524
Yes. Especially since they won
that old pennant thing.

1757
01:47:26,772 --> 01:47:29,332  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:524
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
We've overlooked something.

1758
01:47:29,412 --> 01:47:32,848  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's absolutely compulsory that we have
the signature of a physician.

1759
01:47:32,932 --> 01:47:34,047  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:519
A doctor.

1760
01:47:34,172 --> 01:47:36,732  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:524
Dr. Einstein! Come here
and sign some papers, please.

1761
01:47:36,812 --> 01:47:38,803  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:522
-Good night.
-Come here, Dr. Einstein.

1762
01:47:38,892 --> 01:47:40,086  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:519
-A doctor?
-Yes.

1763
01:47:40,212 --> 01:47:43,761  X1:067 X2:652 Y1:448 Y2:524
Dr. Einstein almost operated on me earlier.
Come along, Doctor.

1764
01:47:45,852 --> 01:47:48,491  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:524
Now, here. Just sign right here,
please, Doctor.

1765
01:47:48,572 --> 01:47:51,086  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Were you leaving, Doctor?
-Yes, please.

1766
01:47:51,172 --> 01:47:53,970  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan?

1767
01:47:54,092 --> 01:47:56,890  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't think we go to the same place.

1768
01:47:57,292 --> 01:48:00,568  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:519
Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy
that's wanted in lndiana.

1769
01:48:00,652 --> 01:48:03,644  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:522
His accomplice's description is
on the circular, on the desk.

1770
01:48:03,732 --> 01:48:04,767  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
Read it to me, will you?

1771
01:48:07,252 --> 01:48:08,446  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:519
About 40.

1772
01:48:08,932 --> 01:48:10,411  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:519
Five-foot-three.

1773
01:48:10,732 --> 01:48:12,245  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
One hundred and forty pounds.

1774
01:48:12,892 --> 01:48:14,166  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:524
Pop eyes.

1775
01:48:15,652 --> 01:48:17,643  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:519
Talks with a German accent.

1776
01:48:17,972 --> 01:48:19,405  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:519
Poses as a doctor.

1777
01:48:19,612 --> 01:48:21,091  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, Mac. Thanks.

1778
01:48:21,212 --> 01:48:24,363  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:524
It's all right. The doctor
has completed the signatures.

1779
01:48:24,492 --> 01:48:25,686  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's great!

1780
01:48:25,852 --> 01:48:29,242  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:524
Thanks, Doc.
You've done Brooklyn a great service.

1781
01:48:34,212 --> 01:48:36,009  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:519
But Dr. Einstein!

1782
01:48:39,332 --> 01:48:42,642  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Now, Mr. Witherspoon--
-You're Witherspoon, I'm Brewster.

1783
01:48:42,772 --> 01:48:45,366  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

1784
01:48:45,732 --> 01:48:47,768  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Don't play games--
-You sign.

1785
01:48:47,892 --> 01:48:49,928  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
You sign as next of kin.

1786
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:53,682  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:519
Why didn't you say so?
I'm all confused. Don't mind me.

1787
01:48:55,532 --> 01:48:56,806  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:524
Mr. Witherport.

1788
01:48:57,252 --> 01:48:59,083  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:448 Y2:519
-Spoon.
-Here.

1789
01:48:59,692 --> 01:49:01,011  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
Come up and pack my duffel.

1790
01:49:03,292 --> 01:49:04,441  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:482 Y2:519
Duffel?

1791
01:49:04,532 --> 01:49:07,092  X1:070 X2:649 Y1:482 Y2:524
Pack his duffel. He's President, you know?

1792
01:49:07,452 --> 01:49:09,363  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
And bring along my bugle.

1793
01:49:11,132 --> 01:49:12,247  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:519
President.

1794
01:49:21,172 --> 01:49:22,491  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't charge!

1795
01:49:35,172 --> 01:49:38,130  X1:064 X2:654 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're really very worried about something.

1796
01:49:38,892 --> 01:49:41,486  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, darling, don't be worried.

1797
01:49:41,972 --> 01:49:45,044  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Me too, Mortimer.
-Well, of course, darling.

1798
01:49:45,892 --> 01:49:47,883  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:482 Y2:524
You'll both be very happy at Happy Dale.

1799
01:49:47,972 --> 01:49:52,170  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:524
We're very happy about the whole thing,
but that's just it.

1800
01:49:52,492 --> 01:49:54,642  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:524
We don't want anything to go wrong.

1801
01:49:56,492 --> 01:49:59,165  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:524
Will they investigate those signatures?

1802
01:50:00,172 --> 01:50:03,960  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:524
-They won't look up Dr. Einstein--
-But it's not his signature, dear.

1803
01:50:04,092 --> 01:50:05,923  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:448 Y2:519
-It's yours.
-Mine?

1804
01:50:06,012 --> 01:50:09,129  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
You see, you signed as next of kin.

1805
01:50:09,412 --> 01:50:13,451  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What's wrong about that, darling?
-Martha, you tell him.

1806
01:50:15,492 --> 01:50:16,766  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:522
Well, dear.

1807
01:50:16,852 --> 01:50:20,606  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What, dear?
-You're not really a Brewster.

1808
01:50:21,932 --> 01:50:24,366  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:519
-What?
-Your mother came to us as a cook.

1809
01:50:24,492 --> 01:50:26,722  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:519
And you were born
about three months afterwards.

1810
01:50:26,812 --> 01:50:29,645  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:524
And she was such a sweet woman
and such a good cook...

1811
01:50:29,732 --> 01:50:33,168  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:519
...we didn't want to lose her.
So brother married her.

1812
01:50:33,412 --> 01:50:35,403  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:522
Your real father was a cook, too.

1813
01:50:35,532 --> 01:50:38,569  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
He was a chef on a tramp steamer.

1814
01:50:41,812 --> 01:50:44,963  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:524
You mean I'm not really a Brewster?

1815
01:50:46,892 --> 01:50:49,406  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:524
-Darling!
-Don't feel so badly about it.

1816
01:50:49,532 --> 01:50:52,524  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:519
I'm sure it won't make any difference
to Elaine.

1817
01:51:01,212 --> 01:51:04,170  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
Where are you? Can you hear me?
I'm not really a Brewster!

1818
01:51:04,252 --> 01:51:06,049  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:519
I'm the son of a sea cook!

1819
01:51:12,252 --> 01:51:14,368  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:519
It's true! I saw them. It's true.

1820
01:51:14,492 --> 01:51:17,006  X1:071 X2:645 Y1:482 Y2:519
It's true! There are 13 bodies down there!

1821
01:51:17,172 --> 01:51:18,844  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:519
But I saw them--

1822
01:51:20,372 --> 01:51:21,885  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's all this screaming about?

1823
01:51:21,972 --> 01:51:25,009  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:524
-But I saw them--
-It's way past her bedtime.

1824
01:51:26,492 --> 01:51:27,607  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:482 Y2:519
Quiet!

1825
01:51:31,052 --> 01:51:33,168  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:524
-But, Mortimer--
-Goodbye!

1826
01:51:33,252 --> 01:51:35,482  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:524
-'Bye.
-Goodbye, darling!

1827
01:51:37,532 --> 01:51:40,649  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
-What is all this?
-They're going on their honeymoon.

1828
01:51:41,052 --> 01:51:43,008  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're off to a flying start.

1829
01:51:49,292 --> 01:51:50,691  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:524
I really did see--

1830
01:51:51,292 --> 01:51:53,328  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:519
You'll own two cabs!

1831
01:51:54,012 --> 01:51:56,128  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:519
I mean the meter!

1832
01:51:56,452 --> 01:51:57,965  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:522
Oh, Mortimer.

1833
01:52:08,492 --> 01:52:10,881  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:522
We're going to Niagara Falls.
Call me a cab, dear.

1834
01:52:10,972 --> 01:52:12,325  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:482 Y2:522
Yes, love.

1835
01:52:13,372 --> 01:52:14,930  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:522
But, Mr. Brewster!

1836
01:52:15,052 --> 01:52:18,283  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:519
I'm not a Brewster.
I'm a son of a sea cook.

1837
01:52:19,172 --> 01:52:20,207  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:524
Charge!

1838
01:52:22,132 --> 01:52:25,124  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not a cabdriver. I'm a coffeepot!

1839
01:52:26,772 --> 01:52:30,242  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:519
