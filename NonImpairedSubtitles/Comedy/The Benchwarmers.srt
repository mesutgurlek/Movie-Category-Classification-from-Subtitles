1
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,929
Throw it here.
- Come on, Nelson, throw it in here!

2
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,766
Yeah! You almost had it!
- I get one more?

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,601
Strike three!

4
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,994
Here you go. There it is.
- Gretchen, you almost had it.

5
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,131
Dang it.
- Nice throw.

6
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,925
l got a ladder. l'll get it.

7
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:36,137
Just tell Mrs. Donnelly it's on the roof.
She can get it whenever she wants.

8
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,555
That's good thinking, Clark.

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,975
l'll just have 80- year- old
Mrs. Donnelly climb on her roof.

10
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,478
Okay, cool. Thanks.

11
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,689
Clark. Hey.

12
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,857
l was kidding. You can't do that.

13
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,234
All right, fine.

14
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,486
Here, give her one of these.

15
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,865
This is yesterday's paper.
- Well, at least it's not on the roof.

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,535
Clark, don't pick your nose
in front of me, please.

17
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,704
l'm not picking, l'm scratching.

18
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,372
What are you scratching,
your brain?

19
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,666
Yeah, because it's huge.

20
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,839
Chain break! Not now!
l have 86 houses left.

21
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,632
Can you fix it?

22
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,886
Gus, what should I do with this?
- l'd flick it.

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,561
Nelson leans in and gets his sign.

24
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,855
Here comes a fastball.

25
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,151
Swing and a huge miss
by Gretchen Peterson.

26
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,238
Hey, losers. We have a practice
scheduled here. You gotta go.

27
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,615
I thought your practice was at 4:30.
- lt is.

28
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,909
We wanna have a practice
before our practice.

29
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh, okay. Can we hit with you?
- No, you suck.

30
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,042
Why don't you go home
and build your science projects.

31
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,464
Look, there's room for all of us.
We'll just play catch off to the side.

32
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,091
Listen, we have a game tomorrow...

33
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,260
...and there's only one field
to practice on.

34
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,054
So beat it!

35
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,433
Maybe this is a sign
you should get a car.

36
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,686
My mother said I should hold off
getting my license one more year.

37
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:11,066
You know, just to make sure
my reflexes are fully developed.

38
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,275
Stop!
- Hold him, Kyle!

39
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,111
Troy, I think he wants
some of your famous beef stew.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,571
"Beef stew! Beef stew!"
- Stop!

41
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,908
{y:i}Beef stew! Beef stew! Beef stew!

42
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,618
No, no, no.

43
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,746
No, stop it.

44
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,628
Hey! Get off him!

45
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,296
Later, fart face.

46
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,256
Yeah, you better run!

47
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,307
Are you all right?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

48
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,476
Need us to call your parents
or something?

49
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,603
lt actually...

50
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,815
...didn't taste as bad as you'd think.

51
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,113
Nelson, wait!
Let's just go to my house!

52
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,824
Oh, I love beef stew.

53
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,868
Why do kids have to be
so fricking cruel?

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,629
You know, I haven't been on
an actual field in almost 20 years.

55
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,296
l've never even been on a field.

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,510
lf I tried, the kids in my neighborhood
would spit loogies on my forehead.

57
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,345
That's awful, Clark.

58
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,514
Baseball is America's pastime.

59
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,807
That's like saying
you've never had apple pie.

60
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,020
You've never had apple pie?

61
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,647
Well, my mom said
it would give me diarrhea.

62
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,483
That's ridiculous.
You have to try it at least once.

63
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,484
Diarrhea?

64
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,488
No. Baseball. lt's the best.

65
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,906
Let's come back here later
and hit some balls.

66
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,328
Can I bring Richie?
He's never played either.

67
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,705
Yeah, bring Richie. Let's say 4:00.
- All right.

68
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,417
Hold on. My mom's sending me
a text message.

69
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,003
No way!

70
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,549
We're having macaroni tonight!
That means garlic bread! Yes!

71
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,134
Awesome!

72
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,847
Excuse me.
- Yeah?

73
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,683
l rented this
on your recommendation.

74
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,602
lt's nothing but a lame story
with lesbian sex scenes.

75
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,229
And you didn't like it?

76
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,773
l watched it with my parents.
lt was uncomfortable.

77
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,401
Come on, it's kind of hot.
- No, it's not.

78
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,235
All right, l'm sorry.

79
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,406
l'll recommend this:
{y:i}Haunted Slumber Party.

80
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,868
lt's actually a pretty decent film.
- No lesbian sex scenes?

81
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,661
I think there's two.
- You're a pig.

82
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,209
Hey, Richie, are you off yet?
- Easy. I can't leave this second, Clark.

83
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:38,213
l don't get to work for an hour a day
like you, paperboy.

84
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,381
Gus wants us to
hit some baseballs with him.

85
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,425
Clark, we don't play baseball.

86
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,886
l told Gus we'd be there, Richie.

87
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,390
And if we don't go,
that makes me a liar.

88
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:52,309
And that's not what l'm about.
Not now, not ever.

89
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,687
All right, Daytime Emmy.

90
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:57,065
Hey, Marty, l'm gonna split early,
all right?

91
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,734
l don't even know who you are.

92
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,611
Bros before ho's, dude.

93
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,076
Liz, honey, do you know
where I packed my baseball mitt?

94
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,580
No. Gus, if we conceive this month,
we would have the baby in January.

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,625
lt would be fun to have
a New Year's baby.

96
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,209
l can't find it.

97
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,421
January also has a higher
percentage of it being a girl.

98
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:24,259
l found it. I found it.

99
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,845
l found my mitt, Liz.
lt was in the old trunk.

100
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,597
Be serious. This is important.
My ovulation peaks at 6:00 tonight.

101
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,101
All right, honey, I love you.
l'll see you later.

102
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:35,186
Remember, Gus, 6:00.

103
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,816
Gotta keep your eye on the ball.

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,777
You just think of that?
You're an amazing coach.

105
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,449
Just focus, you'll be fine.
Just watch me.

106
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,743
With this vest, it's hard to swing.
lt's tight, you know.

107
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:55,372
Quit picking your nose, Clark.
Let's go. Look alive. Coming to you!

108
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,010
You just lost your membership
at Video Spot!

109
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,635
Dang it.

110
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,971
Hey, mister,
we have this field reserved.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,475
You were the ones
picking on that kid today.

112
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,226
So? You douche bags
have to get off this field.

113
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,355
Where's your coach?
- None of your business.

114
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,483
We have practice here,
so go, ho!

115
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,027
Hey, well, no coach, no field. Sorry.

116
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,696
Leave our field,
or you'll pay the consequences!

117
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,614
What is this, "Children of the Corn"?

118
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,742
l'm gonna call the cops.

119
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,578
We are cops. We're Navy SEAIs.

120
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,205
Navy SEAIs aren't cops.
- Aren't you our paperboy?

121
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,791
l'm undercover.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,670
All right, you cocky jerks, you want
the field so bad? We'll play you for it.

123
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,881
But there are nine of us
and three of you.

124
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,592
So you should beat us no problem.

125
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,552
What, are you scared?
- No.

126
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,428
Yeah, chicken.

127
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,682
l'm gonna go ask our team.

128
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,558
This is a bad idea. They look tough.

129
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,562
l saw that demon boy laying beef
in some nice kid's mouth earlier today.

130
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,024
Clark used to get beef
laid in his face all the time.

131
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,946
Oh, and you didn't?
- I got wedgies, that's different.

132
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,031
lt's cooler.

133
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,783
We'll do it.
- Time to meet your makers.

134
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,369
Makers of what? Poop?

135
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,415
Coming down!

136
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,670
Balls in.
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.

137
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:26,548
Get your position down.
- Troy, strike this loser out.

138
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:33,221
Strike!
- Yeah. Nice one, Troy.

139
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,265
Don't swing if it's not
in the strike zone.

140
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,766
Where's the strike zone?
- Strike two!

141
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:38,934
Right there.

142
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,398
Strike three.
- Three, you're out!

143
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,570
What a loser.
- Sit down, spaz.

144
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,489
That kid's throwing heat.
- Heat, schmeat.

145
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,115
One out!

146
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,783
Gonna be two outs!

147
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,495
Hey, I bet you're a real good catcher.
Of doughnuts, in your mouth.

148
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,666
Strike!
- Don't chop at it.

149
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,794
it's not a sword.
- You're not a sword.

150
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:07,421
Come on.
- Strike two.

151
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,424
Oh, that's ugly, man.
- Strike out, video boy.

152
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:11,718
Come on, now.

153
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,640
Strike three!
- I caught it. You're out.

154
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,643
But I ticked it. lt hit the bat.
- You're still out.

155
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,687
You're still fat. I ticked it!

156
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,940
I ticked it. Gus, you see that?
- Way to make contact on that one.

157
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,653
You know what? I was trying
to get under it to rip it into left...

158
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,531
...and throw them off,
but the dog barking threw me.

159
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,658
What dog?
- He ran to the bushes.

160
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,119
lt's cool now. All right, go, Gus.
Come on! Let's get rid of these dogs.

161
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,122
Strike him out quick!
- Get this guy out!

162
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,375
Move in.
- You're going down, shorty.

163
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,877
Guy's got nothing.
- Come on, give him a fast one.

164
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,468
All right, Gus! Awesome!

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,054
All right! Yeah!

166
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,643
He just did that steroid- free.
- What's steroids?

167
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,312
Something that makes
your pee- pee smaller.

168
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,401
There must be steroids in macaroni.
- Let's go.

169
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,653
Yeah!

170
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,153
Nice!

171
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,664
Here we go.
- Batter up.

172
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,039
Batter up!

173
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,216
Strike!

174
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,343
Not so fast!

175
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,054
You're supposed to catch it
with your glove, not your face.

176
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,515
Yeah!

177
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,851
l don't need lip from you,
son of Satan.

178
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,062
We're still in this thing.
- lt's okay. Next time.

179
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:49,273
You're out!

180
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,567
You're out!

181
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,695
Strike three, you're out!

182
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,072
Come on, Troy. Let's go, Troy.
- He can't hit you. Come on.

183
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,119
Yes!
- Yeah, Gus! Are you okay?

184
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,960
lt's over!

185
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,713
Three, you're out!

186
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,508
Sorry. Shoot.
Get another homer for us, Gus.

187
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,969
Yeah, smack it in the butt.
- Whatever that means.

188
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:23,892
l'm gonna keep this one in play.
Give the infield a workout. lt's 17-0.

189
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:27,228
What an idiot.
Come on, Troy, destroy him!

190
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,314
Strike him out. Strike this loser- -

191
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,942
Come on, Kyle, are you okay?

192
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,278
What happened?
- Get up.

193
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,072
Hey, get him up.
- Kyle, you okay?

194
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,077
Ball's still alive, chumps.
- Dude, he's gonna score.

195
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,080
Should somebody call 41 1 ?

196
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,331
He's fine.
He got the wind knocked out of him.

197
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,250
What's that noise?

198
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,841
Get him! Get him!
- Get him!

199
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,427
l think he just got the wind
knocked back into him.

200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,768
Gus, why didn't you play in
high school? You're incredible.

201
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:11,021
The whole bully thing, and jocks.
l didn't wanna deal with it.

202
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,942
Those butts! You could've gone
to the Super Bowl.

203
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,734
Yeah, that's the past.

204
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,614
Hey, Richie, where's your brother?
- Howie! Come out, the guys are here.

205
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,448
ls he still dealing with agoraphobia?

206
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,159
Yeah, dude, he hasn't left the house
in six months.

207
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,663
There he is.

208
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,124
Hey, Howie.
- How's it going, buddy?

209
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,625
Hey, guys.
How did hitting the balls go?

210
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,796
We played an actual game
against real people. lt was classic.

211
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,424
All these punk teenagers are like,
"Get off our field."

212
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,719
We're like, "We'll play you for it."
And we did, and we beat them.

213
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,973
I hit a foul, dude, it was sweet.
- lt was awesome.

214
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,474
You gotta videotape it next time
so I can see.

215
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,353
Buddy, just come with us.
- No. No.

216
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,648
lt's not that scary. And you could use
a little sun, trust me.

217
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,484
Outside, bad. The sun, scary.

218
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,070
He's not my friend.
He wants to hurt me. Safe room.

219
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,533
I know. Sun, bad. You, cuckoo.
- All right.

220
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,411
You know the best part about
winning a baseball game?

221
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,913
What's that?
- Going to Pizza Hut to celebrate.

222
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,789
Richie?

223
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,335
Oh, yeah. Okay, buddy.

224
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,672
ls that apple juice?
- No.

225
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,385
Honestly, you have
real natural athletic skills.

226
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,304
You could be a terrific ball player.

227
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,473
When you throw it to me,
and I catch it- -

228
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,559
Not with my face, but with a glove.
- - I like it.

229
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,854
l am starting to get the fever.

230
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,232
Dude, this chick is so hot.

231
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,861
What's going on?

232
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,031
Nothing. Just refilling the bar.

233
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,033
l love salad.

234
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,661
Yeah, it's...

235
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,203
...good and good for you.

236
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,249
l love salad.

237
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,382
That was some Barry White shit.
Very smooth.

238
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,341
Yeah, I work it when I have to.

239
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,679
How's "Ms. Pac- Man" treating you?
- That red ghost is kicking my balls.

240
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,473
Yeah, that's them, Uncle Jerry.

241
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,435
Richie Goodman and Clark Reedy?

242
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,979
What were you losers doing
on my ball field today?

243
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,065
Clark was. I was home.
- They were with me.

244
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:21,945
We were just hitting balls. These kids
showed up and we scrimmaged them.

245
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,905
That is priceless.

246
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:27,575
Clork the Dork and Richie Bitchy
playing baseball.

247
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,994
Why is that so funny?
- Because they're retards.

248
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,624
They should stick to what they know:
boogers and dingleberries.

249
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,044
You, stay away from my field...

250
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,588
...or l'll have my 1 2- year- old nephew
kick your ass.

251
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,341
Nice meeting you, Fairy Jerry.

252
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,304
What was that?
- You gave them nicknames.

253
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,182
l thought l'd give you one.
Fairy Jerry.

254
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,478
Oh, really?
- Really.

255
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,354
Okay, Gus.

256
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,606
Gus....

257
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,443
Gus Bus.
- What?

258
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,195
That's you. Gus Bus.

259
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,158
Wow, that was a brutal comeback.

260
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,286
Let's go, guys. I don't think
l'll ever recover from that.

261
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,745
Man.

262
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,622
You stay off my field.

263
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,791
Stay away from the fairy dust, Jerry.

264
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,504
"Gus Bus"?
- Shut up, Troy.

265
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,007
lt was the coolest, Gus.

266
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,301
Never seen anybody stand up
to Jerry like that.

267
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,804
l knew guys like that where I grew up.
They think they can do whatever.

268
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,306
l just wanted to say...

269
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,809
...that was great, the way
you put Jerry McDowell in his place.

270
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,226
That was no big deal.

271
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,229
Well, unfortunately for all of us...

272
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,148
...Jerry's in charge of
the baseball league for the county.

273
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,818
Hey. Are you the kid
that got farted on earlier?

274
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,155
Yes. This is my son Nelson.

275
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,075
He's become the fart magnet
for the neighborhood bullies.

276
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,911
l also get a healthy smear
of animal turds twice daily.

277
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,539
When I was your age, Fairy Jerry
dumped a bucket of dog poop on me.

278
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,210
His son just did that to me
last week.

279
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,546
l tried to talk to Jerry. He just laughed
and gave me a titty twister.

280
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,382
Guys like that don't realize
the damage they're causing.

281
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,426
l couldn't agree more.

282
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,729
By the way, thanks for hitting
Kyle Wilson in the chest with the ball...

283
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,400
...then letting me rip one
right in his mouth earlier.

284
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,734
lt was one of the best days
of my life.

285
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,362
This car is so radical.

286
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,573
Looks just like K.l.T.T.
from the show "Knight Rider".

287
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,283
lt is K.l.T.T. from "Knight Rider."

288
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,705
Watch this.

289
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,581
{y:i}Allow me to introduce myself.
{y:i}I'm K.I. T. T.

290
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,293
Who are you?

291
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,297
l'm just one of those nerds
who grew up...

292
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,341
...to make billions.

293
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,927
Maybe l'll see you guys
around sometime.

294
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,054
{y:i}It was a pleasure to meet you all.

295
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,390
{y:i}Easy, Mel.

296
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,401
l have yet to perfect the peel- out.

297
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,570
lt was fine.
- No, no, no. That was cool.

298
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,488
Yeah.
- Chicks were checking you out.

299
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,781
{y:i}Try not to destroy me
{y:i}completely, Mel.

300
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,915
Hey, honey, l'm home.

301
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,461
Where have you been?
- I was with Clark and Richie.

302
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:30,091
l am on an ovulating schedule.
You were supposed to be here at 6:00.

303
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,510
l thought you meant
Central Mountain Time.

304
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,428
Did you mean
Pacific Standard Time?

305
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,765
Why would you think that?
- Because you're from Colorado.

306
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,352
Don't you ovulate
according to where you're born?

307
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,770
Gus, that's just weird.

308
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,439
So from now on,
it's Pacific Standard Time.

309
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,442
Pacific Standard Time.
l'm all over that, baby. I love you.

310
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,573
Check out this mitt. lt's all black.

311
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,036
l look like a Borack warrior
from the "Captain Mighty" series.

312
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,083
Well, get a load of Mega Mitt.

313
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,797
Hey! Hey! What the- - ?

314
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,633
Watch it!

315
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,968
Clark? Richie?

316
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,970
l hardly recognize you clowns
without underwear on your head.

317
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,808
Brad. You have really
not slimmed down.

318
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,352
Oh, eat me.

319
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,437
So I heard from Jerry you tools
think you're athletes now.

320
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,483
l didn't know "athlete"
had three syllables. "a- tha- lete."

321
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,901
That's "ama- za- zing."

322
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,155
You think you're hot shit
because you know words.

323
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,949
Why don't you be a stud
and point us toward the register.

324
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,036
Or "register- er."

325
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:45,000
My team practices today at 5.
Swing by if you she- men wanna lose.

326
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,168
You can't handle the truth!

327
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,005
Bring it!
- Suck it!

328
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,847
Gus!

329
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,765
Gus!

330
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,766
He can't hear us.

331
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,026
Hey, fellas.

332
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:17,031
You okay, Richie?
- Yeah, l'm fine. Just purple nuts.

333
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,869
We just had a run- in with one of our
old bullies at the sporting goods store.

334
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,870
What happened?
- He said we're wussies...

335
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,956
...and he challenged us to a game.

336
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,583
I don't know if you can leave work.
- Of course I can.

337
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,961
l'll mow this later.
Let's take this guy down.

338
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,213
l think l'm gonna puke.
Grab my arm.

339
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,260
Bobby, this one's coming for you.
Focus and give us a double play now.

340
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,969
Let's go!

341
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,807
Thattaway. Good job.

342
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,977
Looks like the Three Muske- queers
decided to show up.

343
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,646
Everybody, get your butts in here.
Time for us to scrimmage some losers.

344
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,525
Yeah, we got a "scrim- im- age."
Come on!

345
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,321
How the hell will this work
with three guys?

346
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,364
We got a pitcher, a catcher,
and a fielder.

347
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,910
No, you've got a retarded paperboy,
a gay video clerk...

348
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,744
...and a smelly midget.

349
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,788
You wanna dance?
l'll dance on your face.

350
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,999
Dance? We'll beat your ass.

351
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,250
Death to you.
- Titty twister!

352
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,050
My wife's the only one
who gets to twist these man- titties.

353
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,511
l just know you guys better- -
Better come ready to play!

354
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,599
Gus is the new Jet Li.

355
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:26,935
Bring it on!

356
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,270
Hey, Dad, come down
to the field, quick!

357
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,400
Strike one!

358
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,151
Strike two!

359
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,237
Strike three!

360
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,863
Hey!
- What? lt slipped.

361
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,824
Strike three!

362
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,202
Hey! What are you laughing at?

363
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,869
He told me a joke.

364
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,291
Let's go, Richie!
- Oh, yeah.

365
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,753
Hey, Dad, come here. Look.

366
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:58,800
Might wanna throw a fielder
up in those mountains, in case:

367
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,344
What you got?
- Strike!

368
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,056
Pulled something. Used to run track.

369
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,640
Come on, Richie.

370
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:11,520
Strike two!
- I didn't swing at that. Can't count it.

371
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,313
Strike three!

372
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,818
Could you tell him to slow it down?

373
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,488
Did you tell him?

374
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,369
Here you go, Clark.
- Thanks, Nelson.

375
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,829
You're welcome.

376
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,543
Home run!

377
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,340
Yeah! Yeah, did you see that?

378
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,801
All right! You hit another homer!

379
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,345
Howie! He just hit a home run!

380
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,942
Strike one! Strike two! Strike three!

381
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,777
Can I get you a tennis racket?

382
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,656
No!

383
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,375
Bravo, gentlemen. Bravo.

384
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,584
Great game.
- Hey, thanks, Mel.

385
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,296
Say, guys, I have this sensational idea
l wanna run by you.

386
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,006
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?

387
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:26,470
l usually take lunch from 1 2 to 4:30,
so if it's in there I could handle it.

388
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,682
Tomorrow is egg salad day...

389
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,891
...but I guess I could
double up on lunch.

390
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,227
Gus, what do you think?

391
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,062
One sounds good.
- Great.

392
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:37,732
l'm at 501 Shmegmer Street.

393
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,526
See you then.
- See you, Nelson.

394
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,404
Bye. Bye, guys.
- What do you think it's about?

395
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,614
Dude, you're in trouble.
- No way.

396
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,573
You're definitely busted.

397
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,952
l didn't do anything. I swear!

398
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,586
This is it?
- I always wondered who lived here.

399
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,963
l just thought it was Clay Aiken
or something.

400
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,800
"Who goes there?"
- That is so cool!

401
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,218
lt's Gus, Clark and Richie.
We're here to see Mel.

402
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,555
"You may enter."
- Thanks, Darth.

403
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,806
"Thanks, Darth."

404
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:14,519
This place is sick, yo.
- This house must cost a zillion dollars.

405
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,729
Two zillion, actually.

406
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,107
Hey, Mel. This place is incredible.

407
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:22,526
Thank you, Gus. Gentlemen,
welcome to Chateau Shmegmer.

408
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,238
Shall we adjourn
to the food quarters?

409
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:30,452
Gentlemen, make yourselves
at home.

410
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,953
Yoda! R2!

411
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,416
Number 7!

412
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,255
{y:i}Lunch is ready when you are,
{y:i}Mr. Carmichael.

413
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,383
Hey, Number 7.
- "Don't touch me!"

414
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,718
Gentlemen, let's eat.
Sit wherever you please.

415
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,557
Gentlemen, order any kind
of sandwich you'd like.

416
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,352
Number 7, thank you.

417
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,605
l'll have a peanut- butter- and- jelly
sandwich with mayonnaise.

418
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:09,281
Can I have tuna fish and Skittles...

419
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,827
...and pudding skin on wheat,
with the crust cut off?

420
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,536
{y:i}I guess so.

421
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,920
That was radical!

422
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,671
All right, I got a crazy one for you,
Number 7.

423
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,509
l'd like a turkey on white- -

424
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,343
He's good.

425
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,512
So, what's on your mind, Mel?

426
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,432
Gentlemen, it is time we brought
this cause into the public eye.

427
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:39,229
What cause?
- The cause of the benchwarmers...

428
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:43,191
...the kids who warm the bench while
the others get to play and have fun.

429
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,029
All of us here in this room have been
excluded from athletic activities...

430
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,323
...and now our kids are going through
the same tomfoolery.

431
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,786
Now, Richie, do you have any kids?
- Never had a date.

432
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,162
Clark?
- Never spoke to a girl.

433
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,796
Gus?
- My wife and I are working on it.

434
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,506
Well, when you do have them...

435
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,885
...you will know how painful it is
to see them sad.

436
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,470
"Bonjour", dudes.
- Hey, Nelson.

437
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,473
How's it going?
- There's my man.

438
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:19,477
Son, you have a little smear
of something on your cheek.

439
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,980
From a dog or a cat?

440
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,567
l think it's a goat.

441
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,113
Number 7,
some assistance, please.

442
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,120
Thanks, Number 7.
You're my best friend.

443
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,165
{y:i}As you are mine, Nelson.

444
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,583
That's so cool.

445
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,422
Now, this is why I wanna start
a round- robin tournament...

446
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,552
...with you incredible men against all
the notoriously mean- spirited teams.

447
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,430
But why us three?

448
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,391
Because you know what it feels like
to be left out.

449
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,062
You're three grown men
who never got to play baseball...

450
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,647
...because you were weird
and smelled and sat when you peed.

451
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,612
Okay, the last one was just me.
But you get my point.

452
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,947
But why would any of these teams
agree to play in this tournament?

453
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,536
For the prize.

454
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,046
That's incredible!
- Killer!

455
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,465
An official- size stadium,
modeled to scale...

456
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,635
...after all the greatest ballparks
in America.

457
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,553
Like Wrigley, Fenway
and Yankee Stadium.

458
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,140
Nelson and his buddies have set up
websites devoted to your team.

459
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,812
You can go on Nerdly.net,
TheBenchwarmers.org...

460
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,232
...or Please- stop- with- the- shit- tossing-
it's- getting- old.com.

461
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,484
Why don't you just build a stadium
for Nelson and his buddies...

462
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,363
...and keep everybody else out?
- That won't solve anything.

463
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,364
Yeah, Clark.

464
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,366
lf we can beat them
at their own game...

465
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,203
...then kids like Nelson
and his buddies will get respect.

466
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,541
We'll do it. Come on.

467
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,836
Benchwarmers on three.
One, two, three.

468
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,212
Benchwarmers!

469
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,255
Can I get a napkin?
l spilled my ice cream.

470
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,715
On the counter.

471
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,886
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Gus Matthews?

472
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:22,141
Sorry. I spit a lot when I speak.
People despise me for it.

473
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:27,730
People spit. I mean, I spit
when I talk sometimes, too, you know?

474
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,400
My name is Sammy.
They call me Sammy Sprinkler.

475
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:34,571
Pleased to meet you, Sammy.
l'm Gus. Gus Bus.

476
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,281
Hey, if I come to a game...

477
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,449
...can I be your scorekeeper
and statistician?

478
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,909
Certainly.
- Yes!

479
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,748
All right. See you later, Sammy.
- You're the man, Gus. Peace out.

480
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,333
All right.

481
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,751
Who was that boy?

482
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:52,630
l'm just seeing if he might be
interested in babysitting our triplets.

483
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,925
Why are you spitting on me?
- Oh, l'm sorry, honey.

484
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,720
This is idiotic.

485
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,432
Are these guys serious about
this benchwarmer crap?

486
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,894
lt sounds like it.
- l'm not playing in this stinking thing.

487
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,521
lf there weren't nerds in the world,
who would we throw crap at?

488
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:13,067
No doubt. But what if we don't play,
and they win it?

489
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,652
They'll probably build
some weird nerd spaceship...

490
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:19,406
...and fly it to Planet Booger
or something, I don't know.

491
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,786
Now, guys,
it's one- game elimination.

492
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,746
They're as good as done.

493
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,248
You know what? You're right.

494
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,628
Let's strap it on, and beat these three
geeks, and win us a new stadium.

495
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,296
Let's get it on!

496
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,260
This green one is sweet.
Oh, all right. Okay.

497
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,931
We have a crowd, you guys.

498
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,932
Excellent!

499
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,142
Crap! What is she doing here?
- Who is it?

500
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,771
lt's that salad chick from Pizza Hut.
- She's so hot, it's sick.

501
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,774
Hey, she's with me.
- You wish.

502
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,109
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How you feeling?

503
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,738
l just destroyed that Porta- Potty,
but l'm feeling better.

504
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,489
Who did this?

505
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,786
Sorry!

506
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,829
Listen, I got a gift for you.

507
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,625
l never had my own uniform before.

508
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,793
We can't have a team
without uniforms.

509
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:16,005
l'm never taking this off.
This is the coolest thing ever.

510
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,175
This is the first game of
the tournament. Let's go out styling.

511
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,012
Nelson, you showed some serious
bat- retrieving skills last game.

512
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,473
What do you say about being
the Benchwarmers' official batboy?

513
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:30,729
That means yes!
- All right!

514
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:34,189
Come on! What are we waiting for?
Let's kick some hairless ass!

515
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,029
l had hair on my ass
before I could walk.

516
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:41,322
This is it, kids.

517
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:44,534
The Benchwarmers' quest
for a stadium is about to begin.

518
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,161
Karl's!
- Karl's Auto Body, the bad guys...

519
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:52,000
{y:i}...have taken the field in our Internet
{y:i}Podcast of Benchwarmers baseball.

520
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,209
{y:i}First to bat, Richie Goodman.

521
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,879
Fingers crossed.

522
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,006
Come on, Richie.
- Easy out here. Let's go.

523
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,425
The pitcher pitches....

524
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,093
Strike!

525
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,011
l ticked it.

526
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,348
l ticked it again.

527
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,853
Strike!

528
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,063
Nice try, son.

529
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,567
Just fouled two in front of salad girl.
- Nice.

530
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:20,069
Next up to bat, Clark Reedy.

531
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,281
All right, Clark. Here we go.
You're the man.

532
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,287
Those squirrels are definitely out.

533
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,588
That's my Miata! Kill him!

534
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,093
Hey, break it up!

535
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,053
Why is this happening?

536
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,890
Come on! Snap his femur!

537
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,808
Richie, help me!

538
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,395
Help me!

539
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,104
Mommy!

540
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,647
Come on, Gus.

541
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,483
We need it.
- You can do it.

542
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,244
Home run!
- Yeah!

543
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,253
Strike!

544
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:23,967
Strike!

545
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,102
Another one!

546
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,520
Oh, my God!

547
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,313
Strike!

548
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,692
Strike!

549
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,784
{y:i}Gus Bus! Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

550
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:55,123
This can't just be about me.
l gotta get these guys more involved.

551
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:58,125
Look alive, Clark!
- I wanna go home.

552
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,878
No, we need you, buddy.

553
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,005
No, you don't. l'm awful.

554
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,797
Come on, now.

555
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,383
Let's go, Tommy!

556
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,218
This one's coming
right to you, Clark.

557
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,141
lt's up, Clark! Clark!

558
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,602
Clark, look out!

559
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,025
Attaboy! Good job!

560
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,068
All right! Good throw!

561
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,987
Use your mitt, son, not your head!

562
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,661
Get it in here, pal! Get it in here.

563
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,457
Hold, hold, hold. Good job.

564
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,793
Gus, come on. Let's end this.

565
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,088
Two outs. Strike this kid out,
like before.

566
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,048
A home run here would tie it up...

567
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,218
...and knock the Benchwarmers
out of the tournament.

568
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,348
There we go! Nice! Go! Run!

569
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:54,682
Make the play, Clark!

570
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,392
Clark, go!

571
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,939
Pick up the ball!

572
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,401
Run! Go, go, go!

573
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,781
Richie! lncoming!

574
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,699
What did you say?

575
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,244
There we go! Nice! Go!
- Richie, get the ball!

576
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:15,536
The ball?

577
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,125
Behind you!

578
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,223
You're out!

579
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,687
What are you doing?!

580
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,730
Yes!

581
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,586
l'm sorry, honey,
we had another game today.

582
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,504
l pulled a muscle
sliding into second.

583
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,006
You gotta be kidding.
- lt's all right, I was safe.

584
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,011
Gus, we're trying to start a family.
l can't do it by myself.

585
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,931
l would hope not, because that
would make you a hermaphrodite.

586
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,433
We don't want that.

587
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:21,144
l'm glad this is a big joke to you.

588
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,687
Honey, I was just having a little fun.

589
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,231
Come on, don't go.

590
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,985
Gentlemen, yesterday's performance
was phenomenal.

591
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:34,573
All the online chat rooms
are exploding with enthusiasm.

592
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,911
Hey, Mel, why aren't we out practicing
on the field?

593
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,164
Well, I thought we could have
kind of a secret practice.

594
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,458
Maybe become more well- rounded
as a unit.

595
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:47,211
Nothing much.
Hitting, running, throwing, catching.

596
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,673
Yeah, Clark.
- "I heard you stunk."

597
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,176
Shut up, Number 7.
- "You shut up."

598
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:54,468
l'll kill you.

599
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:56,805
l want you guys to meet
an old friend of mine...

600
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,807
...who knows a thing or two
about baseball.

601
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,017
Ready when you are, buddy!

602
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:04,395
ls that Mr. T?
- Dude, it's Dr. Dre.

603
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,854
No, no.

604
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,981
That's Reggie Jackson.

605
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,150
Yeah, no, I don't know.

606
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,363
Mr. October! Five hundred
and sixty- three home runs.

607
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,989
Twice World Series MVP...

608
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,199
...where he spanked
four consecutive home runs.

609
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:18,742
Three on three pitches.

610
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:22,038
Reggie bar and I met at tuba camp
when we were kids.

611
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,583
Look at that.
- Oh, no way.

612
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,877
That's you, Reggie?
- Why is that so funny?

613
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,673
I was a cute kid.
- Oh, absolutely.

614
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,675
You're like a young Denzel.

615
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,677
l didn't know Denzel played Urkel.

616
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,679
Reginator and I went through
some tough times...

617
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,889
...with bullies and being picked on.

618
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,518
l can't stand that stuff.
Drives me crazy!

619
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,104
Crazy!
- Easy, buddy.

620
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,313
Easy.

621
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,443
Anyway,
l told Reggie- Reggie- Oxen- Free...

622
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,862
...we're having problems
with our fundamentals.

623
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,072
He agreed to come and help us
run some drills. lsn't that great?

624
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,826
We'll do the same drills that I did
when I was a kid learning to play.

625
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:01,702
All right.

626
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:02,370
All right.

627
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,039
Hey, so whose house is this?

628
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,499
This is to teach you speed.

629
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,668
How is standing here gonna teach us
speed? What are you doing?

630
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,545
Hey, run!
- Why?

631
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,298
Go, go!
- Reggie, you're nuts!

632
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:14,758
Go, go, go!

633
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:18,677
Who in the hell is it?!
l was freaking sleeping!

634
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,889
Nobody messes with me!

635
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,685
l will rip your throat out!
Do you hear me?!

636
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:28,604
And I will find you!

637
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,149
You're in the bushes!

638
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,904
l'm sorry!

639
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:39,531
l'm sorry! Go back to sleep!

640
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,250
Come on, guys, let's go. Come on.
- Run, run, run.

641
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,177
Who's there?

642
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,388
You better run, you smart alecks!

643
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:05,392
Who is it, Brad?
- Just a bunch of punks...

644
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,269
...who better watch their backs!

645
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:11,105
Relax, smarty pants.
Let's finish the massage.

646
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:14,149
Brad have a pool?
- I don't think so.

647
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:16,987
Yeah, I guess you're right.

648
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:20,823
Oh, you little devil.
l'm gonna get you.

649
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:21,990
Nightmares.

650
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,454
This next drill, boys, is for your
catch- and- quick- release skills.

651
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,083
Hot potato!

652
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,876
No!

653
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,839
Excellent, Clark.

654
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,173
Clark, let it go!

655
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,804
Throw it! Get rid of it!
- Come on, let it go!

656
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,309
Release! Release! Release!

657
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,860
{y:i}Sorry.

658
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,111
{y:i}Oh, dear.

659
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:00,697
{y:i}Well....

660
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:04,825
The final drill is for
hand- eye coordination. Hit it, Mel!

661
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,746
Let's go racing!

662
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,208
Look at that! Excellent!
- That's insane!

663
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,420
Yeah, baby!
- You got it, buddy.

664
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,757
That's my friend!

665
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:23,719
Give me the bat.

666
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,596
Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

667
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,020
Thattaway to go.

668
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:33,354
Don't fall.

669
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,815
You got it. You can do it.
- Hit it, baby!

670
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:41,696
Man, you can do it. You can do it.
Let me see it.

671
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,574
Clark, you're lucky l'm a billionaire.

672
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,702
{y:i}The score is all tied up.

673
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:52,332
The bottom of the sixth. This is
the Benchwarmers' closest battle yet.

674
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,416
Strike.

675
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,461
All right, Clark.
See the ball, be the ball.

676
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:00,548
Strike two!

677
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,051
Clark just made contact.
- With his own head.

678
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,843
Grab real tight and concen- -

679
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,056
Hey!

680
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,311
Better distance that time. Yeah.
- Thanks.

681
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,480
Richie's coming up.
The Benchwarmers need a hit here.

682
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,440
All right, Richie, here we go.

683
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,402
She's way out of your league.

684
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,321
What's?
- You're probably a 39-year-old virgin.

685
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,739
Women don't think that's too cute.

686
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,867
Shouldn't you be at home,
like, combing your doll's hair?

687
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,912
Shouldn't you be at home
blowing a doll up?

688
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,748
That's the only action a tool like you
is ever gonna get.

689
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,337
Take it out on the ball, not his head.

690
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,430
Run! Run!

691
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,100
Move your ass, Richie!

692
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,979
Run, Richie, run!
- You got it! Way to run!

693
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,940
Go! Go! Go!

694
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,153
Slide if you have to!

695
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,031
He's rounding third
and heading for home!

696
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,656
Bring it, dork.

697
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,377
Touch home plate!
Touch home plate!

698
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:21,962
Richie, touch home!

699
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,550
Safe!
- He scores!

700
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:29,178
Benchwarmers win!
- lt's a miracle! lt's a miracle!

701
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,804
l ain't a virgin now...

702
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:33,725
...to home runs, beyotch!

703
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,985
{y:i}The Benchwarmers win a close one
{y:i}on Richie's first home run...

704
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:47,656
{y:i}...in the history of the universe.
{y:i}We'll see you in game three.

705
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,990
I never hit it.
- Can we have your autographs?

706
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,034
Are you serious?

707
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,827
Yeah, you can.
- All right.

708
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,622
Write my name on the ball?

709
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,375
You see that home run?
Tell your sister about it.

710
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,001
Wait, do you need my address too?

711
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,840
You guys are making some noise.
This is music to my ear hair.

712
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:08,677
My dad has ear hair.
lt's pretty scary.

713
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:10,844
ls "badass" one or two words?

714
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,769
How do they keep winning?!
- These guys are turd nuggets!

715
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,937
Who wants to wrestle?
- l'm in.

716
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,398
All right.
- l'm good, l'm good.

717
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:23,857
Gotcha.

718
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,112
Howie, look,
they're not gonna kill you, all right?

719
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,281
They're dropping off
the cookies I ordered.

720
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,073
They look very aggressive.

721
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:35,662
I think they wanna beat me up.
- Trust me, you'll be fine.

722
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,707
Just take the Thin Mints back
into the apartment.

723
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:40,916
That's our food for the week.
- Fine.

724
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:44,211
You can eat the Thin Mints
at my funeral, Richie.

725
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,224
Hot. Hot.

726
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:57,726
Hot sun.

727
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:04,523
Cookie.

728
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:09,821
Sun, bad! Sun, bad!

729
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:15,826
Excuse me?

730
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,249
Are you okay?
- How you doing? Yeah. Wrong pipe.

731
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,085
No biggie. What's going on?
- Just returning these movies.

732
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:29,424
Hey, well, l'm the management
so l'm gonna waive the late fee.

733
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,593
Oh, they're not late. But thank you.

734
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:36,764
Well, anything you want
in the store is free too, so....

735
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:39,768
l'm Sarah,
and this is my brother Jarrett.

736
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:42,770
He's a huge fan of yours
and the Benchwarmers.

737
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,856
Cool. Thanks for cheering us on.

738
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:47,608
Hey, what does "beyotch" mean?

739
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:50,028
That's....

740
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,697
That means "good game"
in Swedlandia.

741
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,615
Well, we'll let you get back to work.

742
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,701
Okay. But maybe l'll see you
at another game, hopefully?

743
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,871
Yeah. Definitely.

744
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,457
All right. See you, Jarrett.
- Beyotch yesterday.

745
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:07,795
Marty, what do you think
of my future wife?

746
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,882
l smell cinnamon rolls.

747
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,677
Oh, I smell cinnamon rolls too.

748
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,471
Gentlemen, check it out.

749
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,476
Nerd headquarters.
Never felt more comfortable in my life.

750
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:25,813
Hey, guys, take a gander at these.
We made your own baseball cards.

751
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,898
Give me that.
- Let me see this.

752
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:30,318
What?
- They got statistics.

753
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:33,196
I hit 30 home runs.
- I got 1 1 foul ticks.

754
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:37,324
l have 20 eyes- closed strikeouts, five
broken windshields, six dead birds.

755
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,076
l'm freaking awesome!

756
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,664
Now listen up. Brookdale and Candia
both advanced today.

757
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:45,125
We have to beat them
to make it to the semifinals.

758
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,960
Unfortunately, it is on
their own home turf.

759
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,129
We'll have to hit the road
for a few days.

760
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,882
Did you say Brookdale?
- Yeah, aren't you from Brookdale?

761
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,260
Yeah.
- Oh, that's great.

762
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:57,511
We'll have a big
welcome- home party for you.

763
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,929
No!

764
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:01,516
l mean, it's all right.

765
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:03,351
l lost contact with everybody there.

766
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,478
Wait, so we're staying overnight?

767
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:07,688
Does my mother have to sign
a permission slip?

768
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,773
No, but we will have to change
your diaper.

769
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,028
Seriously, it's been three days.

770
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:17,781
Sweetheart, I have to leave town
for a landscaping convention.

771
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,409
You never mentioned
a landscaping convention before.

772
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,537
l know. This is the first one.

773
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:27,000
My ovulation schedule is delayed
because of the full moon anyway.

774
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,375
So it's okay.

775
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,712
Hey, Gussie,
imagine if we had a boy first...

776
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,550
...and he grew up to be smart
and sweet and handsome.

777
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,052
Or imagine he's only 3 feet tall...

778
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,263
...and everybody in the school calls
him Midget Boy or Yoda.

779
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:43,892
Then, just for fun,
they throw him into bowling pins...

780
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,561
...and laugh until
they pee all over themselves.

781
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:50,230
Were you Midget Boy or Yoda?

782
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:51,899
l don't wanna talk about it.

783
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,486
Just make some room, honey,
l gotta take a leak.

784
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:00,115
Oh, my God, you're not kidding!
Gus, stop it!

785
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,294
Mel is officially insane.

786
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,966
Oh, my God.

787
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:19,218
Right?

788
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:23,514
Gus, how sick is this?
lt sleeps five and it's got Playstation.

789
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:27,435
Check out the fridge, it's full of sweets.
l'm already on my third candy bar.

790
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:30,354
Oh, man.
- Mother would not approve of this.

791
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,064
That's creepy.

792
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,900
What the hell is that?
- That's just Howie.

793
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,280
Howie? You left the house.
Good for you.

794
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,781
Richie told me about the killer
in the neighborhood.

795
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:45,370
He's killing anyone named Howie.
That's my name. That's my name.

796
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,955
Just go with it.

797
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:52,793
Let's go, boys, we gotta be
in Candia by 2:00. Oh, FYl:

798
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:56,339
This team we're playing is notorious
for egging comic- book conventions.

799
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:57,882
Destroy them!

800
00:45:58,341 --> 00:45:59,843
Howie, you're a freak.

801
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,344
Edgar, let's get this Gus Bus
on the road.

802
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:06,808
{y:i}Game three. Benchwarmers vs.
{y:i}Standard Fence at Candia City Park.

803
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,437
Are we here?
- Loser!

804
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:11,687
l think we are.

805
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,648
lt's sixth inning and the Benchwarmers
are down by one run...

806
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:16,233
...with Clark Reedy up on deck.

807
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:22,197
Clark, hold the bat.
- Wait. Why?

808
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:24,074
That's good.
- What are you doing?

809
00:46:24,283 --> 00:46:26,160
Oh, I see.
- lt's gonna be great.

810
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:29,539
Hey, Richie! I look like a mummy!

811
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,209
God, it worked!
- Clark got a hit!

812
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:36,336
Awesome!
- The other way!

813
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:38,298
Come on, run it out!

814
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:42,010
Let's go! Yeah!

815
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:45,220
And Richie scores!
That ties it up, four to four!

816
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,056
l made it! I made it! Yeah!

817
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:49,017
Clark, bend down.

818
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:05,532
What the heck was that?
l mean, come on!

819
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,201
What a moron!

820
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:16,043
The ball gets away from the catcher!
Gus goes to second!

821
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:18,879
Go! He missed it!

822
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,216
Hey! What the- - ? Let go!

823
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,260
Go, Gus, go!
- You got it!

824
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:29,264
Come on, over here! Third!
- I got it! You got it. You got it.

825
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:32,727
Get the ball! Get the ball! Home!

826
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:34,645
Yeah!

827
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:39,608
lt burns.

828
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:43,488
Hot.
- lt burns. lt burns.

829
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:46,073
{y:i}And the Benchwarmers win it, 5- 4.

830
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:56,250
Look at all these people.
We're like the Beatles.

831
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,668
Or Wham! .

832
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,461
Get your Benchwarmers souvenirs.

833
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,589
Slide rules, pocket protectors,
pennants.

834
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,133
We got everything you need.

835
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,928
Welcome to Brookdale for game four.
Benchwarmers ball is on the lnternet.

836
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,599
Coach Bellows, Gus Matthews
from the Benchwarmers.

837
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,310
Shake hands
and have a good game.

838
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:15,895
Matthews. That sounds familiar.
You from around here?

839
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,063
No.

840
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:20,357
l grew up on the North Pole.

841
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:21,985
Not even close to here.

842
00:48:23,778 --> 00:48:25,113
And here's the pitch.

843
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:27,865
lt's a high fly ball!

844
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:44,466
Bad news.
The Benchwarmers are behind, 2-0.

845
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:46,968
Gus is up. Clark's on third.

846
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:51,638
He smacked that one!

847
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:57,895
No!
- Relax.

848
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,314
This game is all tied up.

849
00:49:12,368 --> 00:49:14,829
Richie hit a four-footer.
- Go, Richie!

850
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,832
Run it out! Run it out! Get there!

851
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:21,210
He's safe! He's safe! He's safe!

852
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:31,678
Way to go! Run it out!
- He's rounding third.

853
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:35,934
Richie scores!

854
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:37,560
Clark overran third base.

855
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:41,605
Safe!
- Yeah!

856
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:46,903
Too high! Bad idea! Call 91 1 !

857
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:51,949
That was close. Benchwarmers, 3-2.
Brookdale Glass is shattered!

858
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:54,952
Hey, could we please leave, Mel?
- What? Oh, yeah, sure.

859
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,705
Gus!

860
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,125
Gus, maybe this'll relax you.

861
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,252
Fresh off the presses
of "The Daily Shmegmer".

862
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,545
We're on the front page.
- No way!

863
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:08,758
"Benchwarmers Get Hizzot
and Rizoll lnto Semi- Fizinals."

864
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,260
Mel, if my wife sees this,
l'm totally busted.

865
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:12,970
Do not fret, my good man.

866
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,224
Number 7 is covering
Clark's paper route.

867
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:24,690
{y:i}Problem solved, Gus.

868
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:30,530
Welcome to the semifinals
of Mel's tournament.

869
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:34,491
Wayne's Hardware stands between
the Benchwarmers and the final game.

870
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,204
Meanwhile, the nerd fans
are attempting their first wave ever.

871
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:41,166
Hey, Jerry, what's going on?

872
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:42,541
Who's this?

873
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,420
l wanted you guys to have a little edge
today, so I brought my friend Carlos.

874
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:50,675
He is from the Dominican Republic,
and he is one incredible ball player.

875
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:52,260
Carlos, that's great.

876
00:50:52,468 --> 00:50:54,636
How old are you?
- I am 1 2.

877
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:56,805
More like 1 200.

878
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,643
Check my birth certificate.

879
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:01,269
He's legit.

880
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,774
You're kidding.
This is green crayon.

881
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:12,906
That's your kid?

882
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:15,949
Well, thanks a lot, Jerry,
but my team kicks ass.

883
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:19,162
I think we'll be fine.
- Well, he's here if you need him.

884
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:24,208
I need a refill.
- You need to go to an AA meeting.

885
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:27,544
No, really. I need a refill.

886
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:36,804
Here, hold this.

887
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,060
Look, a vampire.

888
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:51,444
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

889
00:51:57,366 --> 00:51:58,617
Strike three!

890
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:04,416
lt's a hit parade!

891
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:13,466
Time- out!

892
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,343
lt's about time. You're in, you're in.
Give me that.

893
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:23,810
Come on, "hombre."
We need "mucho" home run- o's.

894
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:35,655
Dude, you smell like beer.
- You look like beer.

895
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,449
Hey, who the hell's this guy?
- Sorry.

896
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:40,617
ls he on your roster?
- Yeah, of course he is.

897
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:43,204
He wasn't well earlier,
so I couldn't play him.

898
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:45,624
"Mi" tummy "es" sick- o.

899
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:48,333
This guy's 50. He's got a mustache.

900
00:52:48,584 --> 00:52:50,127
Not according to birth "certifico."

901
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,054
He's got documentation. Play ball!

902
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:12,107
Get out of here, baby!
Get out of here, baby!

903
00:53:12,316 --> 00:53:13,443
Yeah!

904
00:53:19,615 --> 00:53:21,325
{y:i}Oh, shit.

905
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:24,162
Howie, listen, take this money...

906
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,581
...go buy beer and tequila,
and come right back.

907
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,083
Don't be scared.
- I don't wanna do that.

908
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,667
Go, go, go.

909
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:32,753
Nelson.
- You're all right.

910
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,175
Strike three!

911
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:44,849
You gotta step in the batter's box.

912
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:47,602
l'm gonna kill your family.

913
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,648
Yes!

914
00:53:56,152 --> 00:53:57,445
Yeah!
- Gone!

915
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:00,948
Looks like the Gus Bus
is out of gas.

916
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:03,742
l got it! I got it!

917
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,457
That's what l'm talking about!

918
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:20,635
Third inning, and the Benchwarmers
cling to a one- run lead.

919
00:54:20,843 --> 00:54:23,387
Your hair is like a waterfall.

920
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:25,431
Thank you.
- Carlos.

921
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:27,267
Who say my name?

922
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,770
This is a present
from the Benchwarmers.

923
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,980
You're really good at baseball.
Awesome.

924
00:54:33,522 --> 00:54:35,816
"Gracias," albino. Now get lost!

925
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:42,865
Two outs and the Benchwarmers
hanging on, 6- 5.

926
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,126
Go, go, go!
- Gus, go!

927
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:11,019
Safe!
- Yes! He did it!

928
00:55:11,227 --> 00:55:13,312
He did it!
- No way! God!

929
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:21,529
My hand!

930
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,239
Top of the sixth,
Benchwarmers leading, 7- 5.

931
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:28,327
That looks rough, dude.
ls it broken?

932
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:30,288
lt's not broken, but I can't pitch.

933
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,208
Richie, can you pitch?
- Hell, no, dude. I can't even catch.

934
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:36,460
My vote is to have Clark pitch.
- Wait, why me?

935
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:39,547
You throw newspapers.
You have to have some arm.

936
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,717
Come on, come on. Let's go, guys.
- Clark, we have no other choice.

937
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:46,261
What are you gonna do?
- l'll play the outfield.

938
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,888
l can still catch pop flies.

939
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:50,934
l'll try.

940
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,895
l wonder if Clark pitched before.

941
00:55:56,855 --> 00:55:59,274
Nope.
- Come on, really burn it in.

942
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:03,738
Ball three.

943
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:05,406
Come on.

944
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:07,074
Ball four. Take your base.

945
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:11,246
Two- run lead. Bases are loaded,
and Carlos is coming up.

946
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:17,418
One run scores.

947
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:21,840
The tying run scores.

948
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:29,596
Here comes the lead run!
And he is....

949
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:33,435
Out!
- Oh, my God! What a play!

950
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:39,648
We go to the bottom of the last inning,
and it's all tied up.

951
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:43,653
Carlos, we need "tres" more outs
to go into extra innings.

952
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:45,155
ls that beer?

953
00:56:45,363 --> 00:56:48,240
No, it's Gatorade, honky.
Just give me the ball.

954
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:53,955
The Benchwarmers need something
against Carlos. He's unhittable.

955
00:56:57,583 --> 00:57:00,127
lt's a live ball! Run it out!
Clark, run it out!

956
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:06,384
Yes!

957
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:10,554
Maria...

958
00:57:10,763 --> 00:57:12,931
...why did you leave me?

959
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,811
Letting a 1 2- year- old drink like that
is disgusting.

960
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,354
{y:i}Here we go, Richie, here we go!

961
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:23,025
Ball!
- Come on, ump, he's ducking it!

962
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,321
Here we go, Richie, here we go!

963
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:27,697
Take your base.

964
00:57:33,452 --> 00:57:35,705
Gus is up, and here's the pitch.

965
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:42,252
Safe!

966
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:44,381
Hey, who's on deck?

967
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,552
Damn!
- Oh, no. They don't have anyone else.

968
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,386
They have to forfeit.
- What?

969
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:53,847
You have any reserve players?
- No.

970
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:56,393
What about that guy over there
eating sun block?

971
00:58:00,896 --> 00:58:02,398
He's never played before.

972
00:58:02,606 --> 00:58:04,441
That's not my problem.
He's got a uniform.

973
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:09,989
Hey, either he plays
or you forfeit the game. Play ball!

974
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:15,160
Last inning, winning run's on third,
and it's all up to Howie.

975
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:25,129
Look at this freak.
- Son, son. Get in the batter's box.

976
00:58:25,337 --> 00:58:26,423
Someone get his sword.

977
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:31,343
Here you go, Howie. Take this.
- Nelson. Nelson.

978
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:32,803
Get up and take a swing.

979
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,810
Look at all those albinos.

980
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,105
Wait till he pitches the ball, retard.

981
00:58:43,939 --> 00:58:45,441
Strike!

982
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:47,986
They should let him use his sword.

983
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:51,781
Maria!

984
00:58:52,406 --> 00:58:55,200
No.
- Come on, weird guy!

985
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:59,789
{y:i}Weird guy! Weird guy! Weird guy!

986
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:11,968
Take the base.

987
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:16,847
No way! We win! We win!
- Amazing!

988
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:20,685
You have to touch first base, kid.
- Come on, come on.

989
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,771
Howie, hit by the pitch,
forces in the winning run...

990
00:59:23,979 --> 00:59:26,315
...and sends the Benchwarmers
to the finals!

991
00:59:26,523 --> 00:59:27,941
That's game.

992
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:34,323
Carlos, you're drunk!

993
00:59:39,537 --> 00:59:42,082
We're here with Richie Goodman
of the Benchwarmers.

994
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:43,625
How do you feel after that win?

995
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,918
What can I say?
Baseball's in my blood.

996
00:59:46,168 --> 00:59:50,882
{y:i}Hey, could I give a shout- out
{y:i}to my main salad girl at Pizza Hut?

997
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,677
{y:i}I like salad.

998
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:57,137
Guys, can you believe this crap?

999
00:59:57,346 --> 01:00:00,225
l'd like to beat his ass,
just like I did back in the diz- ay.

1000
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:03,645
Are they any good?
- The only guy that's good is that guy.

1001
01:00:04,562 --> 01:00:07,606
{y:i}This is Gus Matthews, the heart
{y:i}and soul of the Benchwarmers.

1002
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:09,316
Gus Matthews?

1003
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:10,777
{y:i}So were you bullied as a kid?

1004
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:15,823
{y:i}The bully thing affected my life pretty
{y:i}huge, and I wanna tell you kids...

1005
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:18,325
{y:i}...messing with other kids
{y:i}can do a lot of damage.

1006
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:22,163
What? That guy damaged more kids
than anybody I knew.

1007
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:23,999
He made my life hell growing up.

1008
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:26,792
You're twice his size.
You could crush that little puke.

1009
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:29,044
He didn't do the physical warfare.

1010
01:00:29,253 --> 01:00:32,215
He played the psychological card
by attacking your weaknesses.

1011
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:34,676
l started losing my hair
when I was 9 years old.

1012
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:37,302
He jumped all over it
with the mean nicknames.

1013
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:39,346
Eight Ball, Bowling Ball...

1014
01:00:39,555 --> 01:00:42,017
...Kojak, Mr. Clean,
Cream of Wheat Guy...

1015
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:46,312
...Scatman Crothers,
the Black Uncle Fester.

1016
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,273
How about the
Black Bodybuilding Charlie Brown?

1017
01:00:49,481 --> 01:00:50,691
That's a good one.

1018
01:00:50,858 --> 01:00:52,694
He used that too!

1019
01:00:55,488 --> 01:00:58,991
Oh, don't cry, buddy.
l think your hair's the bomb, yo.

1020
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:02,245
lt looks great. Doesn't it, guys?
- Yeah.

1021
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:03,705
Really, brothers?
- Yeah.

1022
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:06,916
Sure, Daddy Warbucks. I would've
never have thought that was a wig.

1023
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,876
lf I was blindfolded.

1024
01:01:10,419 --> 01:01:13,965
Got a problem? Why don't you punch
me in the face as hard as you can.

1025
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,885
Pour some honey on me.
Let me see you get really mad.

1026
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:23,767
Anyway, at least I left there
with my sanity.

1027
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:27,604
He actually teased this one midget boy
in our neighborhood league so bad...

1028
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:30,981
...the little fella up and quit baseball
and went into the loony bin.

1029
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,318
Guys, we gotta tell Jerry.
He's gonna love this.

1030
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:35,904
Definitely.
- Yeah.

1031
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:39,281
Really? Well, thanks, Cassandra.

1032
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:42,576
What's the score now, Mel?
- Well, Jerry's Lumber just won, 5- 2.

1033
01:01:42,785 --> 01:01:44,663
That means our town
gets the stadium!

1034
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:47,749
Nelson and his buddies will,
because we'll kill those guys!

1035
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,416
Yeah! Wicked!

1036
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:52,127
Number 7, shakes all around!
- Yes!

1037
01:01:52,336 --> 01:01:53,629
l gotta take a leak.

1038
01:01:53,837 --> 01:01:56,383
Down the hall,
1 2th door on the right.

1039
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:02,096
{y:i}Last night, we did a story
{y:i}about the Benchwarmers...

1040
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:05,934
{y:i}...a team of three men who were
{y:i}excluded from baseball as kids...

1041
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:07,811
{y:i}...and are now making up
{y:i}for lost time.

1042
01:02:09,562 --> 01:02:12,106
{y:i}Hello, Gus.
{y:i}This is the urinal speaking.

1043
01:02:12,314 --> 01:02:15,944
{y:i}Chemical analysis of your pee shows
{y:i}you'd better stop eating fast food...

1044
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:18,113
{y:i}...or you're going to die.

1045
01:02:19,197 --> 01:02:22,574
{y:i}We have just been given evidence
{y:i}that one of the men, Gus Matthews...

1046
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:24,993
{y:i}...is not the man
{y:i}he's been saying he is.

1047
01:02:25,202 --> 01:02:27,455
Hey, no shake for me.
The toilet said so.

1048
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,125
{y:i}Gus Matthews was easily
{y:i}the biggest bully in Brookdale.

1049
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:34,294
{y:i}Well, you weren't the nicest kid
{y:i}in school either, Steven.

1050
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:37,132
{y:i}I hate everybody!

1051
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,009
{y:i}What a baby. But he's right.

1052
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:42,386
{y:i}I was their principal back then,
{y:i}and Gus was in my office constantly.

1053
01:02:42,594 --> 01:02:44,930
{y:i}I remember he especially
{y:i}picked so hard on one kid...

1054
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:46,975
{y:i}...that the poor boy
{y:i}was institutionalized.

1055
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:51,395
{y:i}That's really too bad. Those guys
{y:i}inspired a lot of really nice kids.

1056
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,606
{y:i}This is Kathy Dobson
{y:i}from Channel 9 news.

1057
01:02:55,983 --> 01:02:59,154
You were a jerk just like the rest
of the kids who mess with me?

1058
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:02,531
l made a mistake, Nelson.

1059
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:06,243
l wish I could take it all back.

1060
01:03:06,618 --> 01:03:09,372
l can't believe I looked up to you.

1061
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:17,629
l don't know what to say, guys.

1062
01:03:19,382 --> 01:03:20,842
l'm sorry.

1063
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:29,517
{y:i}Let's party!

1064
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:32,103
Not now, Number 7!

1065
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,527
ls that why you don't
wanna have kids, Gus?

1066
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:46,283
Do you feel you don't deserve
a happy family because of your past?

1067
01:03:47,576 --> 01:03:51,623
l'm afraid that if we have kids, they're
gonna get picked on without mercy...

1068
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:54,666
...because karma
will be catching up with me.

1069
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:59,172
Sweetheart, you are wrong.
Life's about learning lessons.

1070
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:01,841
l can't just learn a lesson
and move on.

1071
01:04:02,175 --> 01:04:04,552
That little boy that I picked on
when I was a kid...

1072
01:04:04,718 --> 01:04:05,969
...he didn't ever move on.

1073
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,141
l bet he'd be able to move on
if you said you were sorry.

1074
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,780
Can I help you?

1075
01:04:25,406 --> 01:04:27,783
Marcus, honey.
- What is it, Mother?

1076
01:04:28,242 --> 01:04:32,289
l just finished another peanut butter
sculpture. lt's a pterodactyl.

1077
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:37,292
Oh, that's nice.
You have a visitor, dear.

1078
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:39,503
But I don't know anyone.

1079
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,925
lt's Gus from grade school.

1080
01:04:45,176 --> 01:04:46,802
No!

1081
01:04:47,386 --> 01:04:48,762
Don't come down here!

1082
01:04:51,516 --> 01:04:52,892
Marcus- -
- No, don't come down!

1083
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,562
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1084
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:57,980
Don't touch me!
- Please, hear me out.

1085
01:04:58,188 --> 01:04:59,982
Just give me a chance.

1086
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,322
Marcus, stop trying to cast spells.

1087
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:09,867
Marcus- -
- Stay away!

1088
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:16,166
Look, Marcus, I want to apologize...

1089
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:19,710
...for all the nasty things I did to you
when we were kids.

1090
01:05:19,918 --> 01:05:21,378
l'm not here to mess with you.

1091
01:05:21,587 --> 01:05:24,674
You're lying to me
like all the other times.

1092
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:26,551
You are denied entry.

1093
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,886
l'm sorry,
from the bottom of my heart.

1094
01:05:29,094 --> 01:05:30,888
l was stupid, Marcus.

1095
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:35,810
Get out of my basement!
You're a bad, bad man! Go! Get out!

1096
01:05:35,977 --> 01:05:38,104
l didn't expect you to forgive me.
l mean....

1097
01:05:38,604 --> 01:05:39,897
Look, I know because of me...

1098
01:05:40,105 --> 01:05:42,858
...you were never able to feel
what it was like to play ball...

1099
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,986
...or be part of a team.

1100
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,823
So I wanna
give you my hat, Marcus.

1101
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:52,701
Because even though
you didn't know it...

1102
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:55,497
...you are the heart and soul
of this squad.

1103
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,250
l'll see you around, buddy.

1104
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:14,264
Start here.

1105
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:17,894
You've got 24 hours.
- What, are you serious?

1106
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:22,481
lf you build it, nerds will come.

1107
01:06:22,856 --> 01:06:25,860
And keep it under a billion.
lt's all l've got...

1108
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:27,570
...on me.

1109
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:30,489
Excellent!

1110
01:06:30,697 --> 01:06:32,074
Okay, people!

1111
01:06:32,282 --> 01:06:36,329
We got 24 hours to build us
a ballpark! Can we do it?

1112
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:38,373
Yeah!

1113
01:06:58,018 --> 01:06:58,977
Cool!

1114
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:03,063
Are you kidding me? Look at this.
Dude, this place is huge!

1115
01:07:03,272 --> 01:07:05,899
Swings!
- We'll go on the swings later.

1116
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:08,194
Slide.
- That's right, there's a pool.

1117
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:11,072
We'll all go in after.
- I forgot my floaties.

1118
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:13,866
We're here live in Greenfield
for the big game...

1119
01:07:14,074 --> 01:07:16,452
...between the Benchwarmers
and Jerry's Lumber.

1120
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,331
The Benchwarmers were
recently rocked by scandal.

1121
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,249
Let's see what the fans have to say.

1122
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,418
Excuse me, sir. What do you think
of the accusations against Gus?

1123
01:07:24,585 --> 01:07:28,131
His soul will perish in the fire pit
of the underworld.

1124
01:07:30,508 --> 01:07:34,428
{y:i}There you have it. The fire pits.
{y:i}Not a good time.

1125
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:36,930
Around the horn.

1126
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,226
We could still win this thing.

1127
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:42,979
Wha- - ? How?
- lf we use the Force.

1128
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:45,898
Let's try not to be too geeky, Clark.

1129
01:07:46,106 --> 01:07:48,818
The Force is powerful,
my young padawan.

1130
01:07:49,027 --> 01:07:50,737
He's right. lt is.

1131
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:52,447
Hey, guys.

1132
01:07:56,116 --> 01:07:58,243
l know l'm not
on the team anymore...

1133
01:07:58,452 --> 01:08:01,706
...but I just wanted you to know that
l'm here to support you.

1134
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:04,333
Because you'll always be
my best friends.

1135
01:08:06,293 --> 01:08:09,756
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Shmegmer Park...

1136
01:08:09,964 --> 01:08:13,009
...and the final game
of Mel's Tournament...

1137
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:17,012
...of Little Baseballers
and Three Older Guys!

1138
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:20,976
Homo!

1139
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,645
Hey, check out the little gnome.

1140
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,149
Play ball!

1141
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:33,154
Can I say something?

1142
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:35,156
Yeah, I guess so.

1143
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:40,078
Hand me the mike, please.
l can't reach it.

1144
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:46,250
Hello, everyone.
My name is Marcus Ellwood...

1145
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,586
...better known
as Dragonmaster7 84.

1146
01:08:49,795 --> 01:08:52,673
Or Yoda! Or Midget Boy!

1147
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,597
lt is true I ended up in an institution
as a child...

1148
01:08:59,805 --> 01:09:02,350
...from Gus bullying me all the time.

1149
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:05,645
And he made my life miserable
for years.

1150
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:10,232
To be honest, I thought I would never
stop hating him.

1151
01:09:12,818 --> 01:09:16,113
But then yesterday
he came to visit me in my basement.

1152
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:21,620
And as I cowered in my peanut butter
fort, he apologized to me.

1153
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:25,248
And I could hear the sadness
in his voice.

1154
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:27,541
This nerd makes me
seem like Rambo.

1155
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,876
l don't think so.

1156
01:09:29,084 --> 01:09:31,461
John Stamos?
- Warmer.

1157
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,883
And then, moments
after my old nemesis left...

1158
01:09:36,091 --> 01:09:38,845
...l saw a hat on my stuffed moose.

1159
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:41,097
The hat of a Benchwarmer.

1160
01:09:42,224 --> 01:09:46,228
A Benchwarmer begging
for a new start, just like me...

1161
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:48,229
...and so many of you.

1162
01:09:48,395 --> 01:09:52,232
He shouldn't get a new start! l'll never
forgive the kids who picked on me!

1163
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:53,400
Yeah!

1164
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:57,905
Young one,
life is too short to harbor hatred.

1165
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:01,451
Do you remember episode
number 38 of "Dungeon Wars"?

1166
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:08,583
The golden elves forgive the great
giants for destroying their village...

1167
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:12,085
...even though the giants
made the elves' life hell.

1168
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:15,672
The elves realized the giants
were tortured too.

1169
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:22,555
He's a modern- day Yoda.

1170
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:26,309
l mean, not his looks
but his philosophy stuff.

1171
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:30,437
Actually, his looks too. Yeah.
- His looks a little bit too, yeah.

1172
01:10:30,604 --> 01:10:34,983
And so I forgive my new friend Gus,
as all of you should.

1173
01:10:35,776 --> 01:10:39,446
Look at all the joy and hope
he's brought to all of us.

1174
01:10:39,905 --> 01:10:42,117
He has more than paid his dues.

1175
01:10:45,036 --> 01:10:47,539
Go, Gus!
- Come on, Marcus!

1176
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,626
Thank you, Marcus. Come on.

1177
01:10:54,086 --> 01:10:56,547
Hey. Buddies for life.
- Thanks.

1178
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:01,428
I want a little man too.
- Here you go.

1179
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:13,230
Me and the guys have been playing
all these games, not for revenge.

1180
01:11:13,438 --> 01:11:17,025
We did it to show that everyone
should be allowed to play baseball...

1181
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:18,485
...and have fun.

1182
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:26,202
And that is why Clark, Richie and l
will not be playing in the game today.

1183
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:31,791
lnstead, our team will consist of
kids who've never known...

1184
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,918
...what it's like to play in front
of a crowd or to be cheered on.

1185
01:11:35,127 --> 01:11:37,337
Let me tell you,
it's an awesome feeling.

1186
01:11:37,504 --> 01:11:41,175
So please, put your nerd
and jock hands together...

1187
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:44,679
...and welcome to the field
the new Benchwarmers!

1188
01:11:45,513 --> 01:11:46,932
Yeah!
- Hi!

1189
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:49,559
All right!

1190
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:54,187
Now, lastly, let's make some noise
for your new third- base coach:

1191
01:11:54,396 --> 01:11:55,981
Marcus Ellwood!

1192
01:11:59,193 --> 01:12:00,694
ls he all right?

1193
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,282
For years I thought the sun
was a monster.

1194
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:08,620
l'm here to tell you that it's not
a monster. lt's not a monster!

1195
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:10,705
You're all right.
- Take him in the shade.

1196
01:12:10,872 --> 01:12:12,707
All right, let's have some fun!

1197
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,666
{y:i}Hey, everybody,
{y:i}it's Clark and Richie...

1198
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:17,085
{y:i}...and we're standing in
{y:i}for Gretchen and Mitchell.

1199
01:12:17,294 --> 01:12:20,047
And we're gonna get things going
right now. Big deck.

1200
01:12:20,214 --> 01:12:21,840
He got it.

1201
01:12:22,132 --> 01:12:23,592
Oh, no.

1202
01:12:25,553 --> 01:12:26,805
And he's okay.

1203
01:12:27,013 --> 01:12:29,391
Oh, hey, that's my helmet!
That's my helmet!

1204
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:31,268
lt's all right, buddy.

1205
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:33,103
Nice try, Sammy!

1206
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:36,355
Oh, my God, I just saw
your head for the first time.

1207
01:12:36,563 --> 01:12:39,608
{y:i}Let's give a nice round of applause
{y:i}for little Sammy Sprinkler!

1208
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:41,610
He missed it
and people are cheering.

1209
01:12:42,194 --> 01:12:44,154
Yeah, and his coach
didn't even yell at him.

1210
01:12:44,363 --> 01:12:45,490
That's pretty cool.

1211
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:49,452
And here comes our lead- off hitter
with a familiar tape job.

1212
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:51,955
Gretchen, I know why
you're taping your hands.

1213
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:56,833
l also know why there's three squirrels
that won't be at this game today.

1214
01:12:59,878 --> 01:13:01,296
Strike! Strike! Strike!

1215
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:02,756
Well, there's a strikeout.

1216
01:13:02,923 --> 01:13:04,925
That's okay! Good try! Good try!

1217
01:13:05,384 --> 01:13:06,511
Good going, Gretchen.

1218
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,555
All right, next up it's Jarrett.

1219
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:12,184
lf you know Jarrett, you know his sister
works at Pizza Hut. She's over there.

1220
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,771
Another strikeout.

1221
01:13:19,773 --> 01:13:22,651
And a strikeout. Strikeout.

1222
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,778
Strikeout. Strikeout. Strikeout.

1223
01:13:25,529 --> 01:13:26,865
And a strikeout.

1224
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:29,034
l think we got a free stadium!

1225
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:30,952
Clark, we're beating them
in strikeouts.

1226
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,955
And you're also beating them
in boogers picked, so we got that.

1227
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:41,295
Good game. Drive home safe tonight.
On the yellow brick road.

1228
01:13:41,962 --> 01:13:43,213
God, he's a dick.

1229
01:13:45,966 --> 01:13:48,386
He got all of that one.
Back, back, back!

1230
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,807
ln the pool!

1231
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:54,559
Good hit, Kyle.

1232
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:57,479
Yeah, nice one, Kyle.

1233
01:13:59,062 --> 01:14:00,063
Go, Kyle!

1234
01:14:01,565 --> 01:14:04,443
Well, it's 42 to nothing as we head
into the last inning.

1235
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:08,323
And it looks like the Benchwarmers
will go down without a fight.

1236
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,784
Hey. What are you smiling at?

1237
01:14:10,992 --> 01:14:12,911
l guess how much fun
they're having.

1238
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,664
Wipe the smile off your face
or l'll wipe it off for you.

1239
01:14:15,872 --> 01:14:16,915
You got three more outs.

1240
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:20,000
You blow this shutout, you won't play
on a team next year. Got it?

1241
01:14:20,209 --> 01:14:22,377
Get out there and annihilate
those stinkweeds!

1242
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:24,713
Let's go!

1243
01:14:24,922 --> 01:14:26,840
Come on, let's do this!

1244
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:30,637
Strike one!

1245
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:32,180
Hang in there, son!

1246
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,015
Come on, Nelson!

1247
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:36,726
Strike two!

1248
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:38,687
Come on, strike out this loser!

1249
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,314
You know what? You're the loser.

1250
01:14:44,358 --> 01:14:45,692
Time!

1251
01:14:46,193 --> 01:14:48,612
What's up, buddy?
- Hey, Nelson.

1252
01:14:48,821 --> 01:14:51,366
l'll throw you one down the middle.
- What does that mean?

1253
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:54,202
lt means choke up on the bat a little
and swing away.

1254
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:57,455
The ball's gonna be right there.
- Hey, thanks.

1255
01:14:57,664 --> 01:15:00,708
l can help you with your social studies
homework later if you need it.

1256
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:03,752
Sounds good.
l suck at social studies.

1257
01:15:03,961 --> 01:15:05,879
Okay, guys, follow my lead.

1258
01:15:12,345 --> 01:15:14,097
Butterfingers.
- He got a hit!

1259
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:17,100
Come on! Go, go!
- Oh, my God!

1260
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:18,935
Why are you kicking it?!

1261
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:20,395
Go, go!

1262
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:30,571
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

1263
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:34,576
Run! Come on! Go! Go! Go home!

1264
01:15:34,784 --> 01:15:36,077
Go, go, go!
- Go, Nelson!

1265
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:38,121
Nelson, get at the plate!

1266
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:41,708
Slide! Slide!

1267
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:42,916
Safe!

1268
01:15:44,293 --> 01:15:46,336
We did not get shut out!

1269
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,523
What is going on? What is going on?
Let go of me! Nerds!

1270
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:10,277
You put me down!
What is going on?

1271
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:37,472
Can I let you in on a secret?
- Sure.

1272
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:42,310
l've never actually, like, totally,
100-percent kissed a girl before...

1273
01:16:42,602 --> 01:16:46,688
...and I was wondering
if you would be my first one.

1274
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:49,608
l would like nothing more than that.

1275
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:52,778
Rea...?

1276
01:16:52,986 --> 01:16:54,196
Clark!

1277
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,033
You kissed a girl before I did?

1278
01:16:57,492 --> 01:17:00,287
This is way better than macaroni.

1279
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,543
l'm not afraid of the sun anymore.

1280
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:10,546
That's good, buddy.
How's the moon treating you?

1281
01:17:10,754 --> 01:17:12,256
Not a fan.

1282
01:17:14,299 --> 01:17:17,512
Hey, Gus. The new Benchwarmers
are gonna need a coach next season.

1283
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,014
What do you say?

1284
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:20,515
l'd be honored, Mel...

1285
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:23,477
...but I might be a little busy
getting my family started.

1286
01:17:24,519 --> 01:17:27,521
Actually, honey,
it's already been started.

1287
01:17:29,857 --> 01:17:31,066
Really?

1288
01:17:33,527 --> 01:17:34,862
Hey, everybody!

1289
01:17:35,362 --> 01:17:37,240
l'm gonna be a dad!

1290
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:47,083
That's quite an ovation.
- You wanna hear an even bigger one?

1291
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:51,336
The reason she's pregnant is
because I went all the way with her!

1292
01:17:58,678 --> 01:18:02,015
That's so great.
What does "all the way" mean?
