1
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,361
Good morning, Tom.

2
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,973
<i>Twelve is our number.</i>

3
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:20,979
<i>It's the number of games my husband Tom</i>
<i>coaches at Lincoln College every season.</i>

4
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,949
<i>It's the number of times we zero out our</i>
<i>bank account each year to make ends meet.</i>

5
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,613
<i>And it's the number of kids</i>
<i>we try to keep track of.</i>

6
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,787
<i>- Hey. Good run?</i>

7
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,661
Oh, yeah.

8
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,200
You need a paramedic?

9
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,567
No, just a pair of knees.
You finish?

10
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,335
Still proofing, but I'm sending it
to Diane today.

11
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,741
Look at this.
New, clean cover...

12
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,371
no peanut butter stains...
yet.

13
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,712
- Hey, baby?
- Baby?

14
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,810
You know, on the run,
you know what I was thinking?

15
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,378
What?

16
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,550
Well, we've been married,
what, five years?

17
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,256
- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-three. Sorry.

18
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,562
And I think we could use
a little change around here...

19
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,693
like-like this
lumpy old mattress.

20
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,465
- Maybe we should just,
you know, get rid of it.

21
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,872
Don't be ridiculous, honey. You know you
can just pound the lumps out of a mattress.

22
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,400
What-What do you mean? You can just
pound the lumps out of a mattress?

23
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,811
Yeah, just randomly
start swatting away.

24
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,816
- And it goes flat?
- Yes, yes.

25
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,614
Just start... You just randomly
start swatting...

26
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,061
Careful.

27
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,399
- I got a dog on me!
<i>- Twelve's</i>
<i>an insane number of kids...</i>

28
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,904
<i>but having a small family</i>
<i>was never an option for us.</i>

29
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,601
<i>See, Tom loved growing up</i>
<i>with seven brothers and sisters.</i>

30
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,837
<i>And after my sister died,</i>
<i>I spent most of my time...</i>

31
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,177
<i>wishing I had</i>
<i>seven brothers and sisters.</i>

32
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,411
<i>Tom and I met at</i>
<i>Illinois Polytechnic University.</i>

33
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,114
<i>He was a senior dreaming of be coming</i>
<i>the head football coach there.</i>

34
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,249
<i>I was a freshman dreaming</i>
<i>of becoming a sports reporter.</i>

35
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,624
<i>He wanted eight kids,</i>
<i>I wanted eight kids. Bam.</i>

36
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,062
<i>An hour after I met him,</i>
<i>I knew he was the one.</i>

37
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,100
<i>We just had family</i>
<i>at the wedding.</i>

38
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,692
<i>Oh, and Shake Maguire,</i>
<i>Tom's best man.</i>

39
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,796
<i>What a hot dog.</i>

40
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,433
<i>A year later,</i>
<i>we had our first... Nora.</i>

41
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,637
<i>I loved taking her</i>
<i>to work with me.</i>

42
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,681
<i>After Charlie and Lorraine were born, we</i>
<i>realized our dream of living in the city...</i>

43
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,377
<i>- and having eight kids and</i>
<i>two careers wasn't gonna work.</i>

44
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,910
<i>As much as we wanted our big careers,</i>
<i>we wanted our big family more.</i>

45
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,322
<i>So Tom settled for a Division III</i>
<i>coaching job at Lincoln...</i>

46
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,953
<i>I quit writing for the</i> Tribune,
<i>and we moved to the country.</i>

47
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,963
<i>Tom and I got busy</i>
<i>when we moved to Midland.</i>

48
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:56,263
<i>We had Henry, Sarah, Jake and Mark</i>
<i>in consecutive years.</i>

49
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,861
<i>Then we went for magic number eight,</i>
<i>and instead...</i>

50
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:02,601
<i>we got the first set</i>
<i>of fraternal twins... Jessica and Kim.</i>

51
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,269
<i>- Nine kids.</i>
- Come on, you guys. Come on.

52
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,279
Wave! Hi!

53
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,807
<i>With each child, Tom and I got further</i>
<i>from our big career dreams.</i>

54
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,819
<i>But we didn't think about that.</i>

55
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,387
Oh. Sorry, Coach.

56
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:30,425
<i>We had our hands full with nine.</i>
<i>We were happy, and we were done.</i>

57
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,971
<i>Then we went to a party celebrating</i>
<i>Shake Maguire's appointment...</i>

58
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,973
<i>to athletic director</i>
<i>at our alma mater.</i>

59
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,670
<i>And, well, too many beers and nine</i>
<i>months later, we had Mike.</i>

60
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,612
<i>After that,</i>
<i>Tom got a vasectomy.</i>

61
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,979
<i>But he didn't hear the doctor say</i>
<i>that it would be a few weeks...</i>

62
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,814
<i>before the procedure</i>
<i>became effective.</i>

63
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:51,448
<i>In '98, Nigel and Kyle got us</i>
<i>to that crazy number 12.</i>

64
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,982
<i>But by then, Tom and I</i>
<i>were experts at managing chaos.</i>

65
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,626
- Let's move, gang.
Come on, come on, come on!

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,864
- Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
- Charlie missed his curfew again
last night. Take care of that.

67
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,405
Hey.

68
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,203
You can only put on
so much lip gloss, princess!

69
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,938
- You blew my concentration!
<i>- Temper, Sarah.</i>

70
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,572
Now I get to start
all over again.

71
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,048
- Wrap it up, Lorraine!
<i>- Okay, Daddy.!</i>

72
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,176
- Have you seen my frog, Dad?

73
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,244
Sorry, Charlie.
Uh, Nigel. Kyle.

74
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,723
- It's Mark.
- I knew that.

75
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,520
Hey, teenager. You got caught
on Mom radar last night.

76
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,531
You're not gonna get that scholarship
if you're out late with Beth...

77
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,533
the night before a big game.

78
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,695
Well, I'm not so sure
I even want to go to college.

79
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,900
Since when?

80
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,103
Since Beth's mom offered me
a job at the auto shop.

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,113
Hmm. Sounds exciting.

82
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,014
Well, we'll talk about that
after you get your full ride.

83
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,951
And, meanwhile, in by 10:00
on school nights. Clear?

84
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,581
- Got it.
- Anything else you wanna talk about?

85
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,455
Did I mention
I don't like you very much?

86
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,893
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Then I'm good.

87
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:08,059
- Okay, me too.

88
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,730
Dude, two words:
Need new skates.

89
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,001
Dude, three words:
Paper route.

90
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:19,306
"Hi. Can't make dinner. Hank and I
are moving into our new apartment.

91
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,313
Love, Nora."

92
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,350
- Have you seen Beans, Mom?
- Mm-mm.

93
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,677
<i>- Here you go, Gunner.</i>
<i>- You hungry, boy?</i>

94
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,977
Here you go, Gunner.
Are you hungry?

95
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,747
Look, I am totally aware that
this family doesn't value...

96
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,449
self-presentation in the same
obsessive way that I do.

97
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,823
<i>Fine. Whatever.</i>
<i>But one of my life goals...</i>

98
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,885
aside from being, like,
a fashion guru...

99
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,987
is to indicate to
the local community that...

100
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,362
the Baker family
actually owns a bar of soap.

101
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,767
<i>So, as self-appointed in-house</i>
<i>rep of style and hygiene...</i>

102
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,738
I think I should be allotted at least five
extra minutes in front of the mirror.

103
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,399
- Three.
- Done.

104
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,171
Now help your sister
butter the toast.

105
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,839
Sarah, your suspension from lacrosse
for excessive force has been lifted.

106
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,975
<i>So you're going today. Henry,</i>
<i>you have band practice, all right?</i>

107
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,350
I cleaned your clarinet. Please don't
play with food in your mouth again.

108
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,981
Kim and Jessica, your teacher called
and has made a request...

109
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,048
that you do not correct her
in front of the class.

110
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,390
<i>Mike, you have show-and-tell today.</i>
<i>And, please, honey...</i>

111
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,589
remember that body parts
do not count.

112
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,757
Kyle and Nigel, you have
a dentist's appointment at 3:00.
You're goin' to work with Dad.

113
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,233
Yeah!

114
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,269
- And we're shooting
our Christmas card today.

115
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:04,248
- What time's Nora coming over?
- Uh, she may not make it.

116
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,548
She hardly ever comes home since
she started dating that doorknob.

117
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,249
- He's not a doorknob.
- The man irons his jeans, Mom.

118
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,417
- Yeah, that's weird.
<i>- Never mind.</i>

119
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,393
I'll shoot it without her.
I'll Photoshop her in.

120
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,952
Honey, could you take 10 pounds
off me with that Photoshop thing?

121
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,260
- Can I be Photoshopped in?
- Wait. If Sarah's bein' Photoshopped in...

122
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,358
- then I'm definitely
gonna get Photoshopped in.
- Why don't we all be...

123
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,927
Nobody gets Photoshopped in but Nora.
Everybody be here by 4:00.

124
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,870
Why do we always do
our Christmas cards in May anyway?

125
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,103
Because the earlier we get it done,
the bigger discount we get at the printer.

126
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,112
<i>- Now, let's eat.!</i>

127
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,205
Here you go.
Look alive.

128
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,299
No, Mark!

129
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,766
Get him!

130
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,648
<i>- Come on.! Get him, Charlie.!</i>
<i>- He's headed for the waffles.!</i>

131
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,184
<i>- I got him, Charlie.! I got him.!</i>
<i>- Come to Daddy.! Come on.!</i>

132
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,751
Mike, stick!

133
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,762
- Mark, net!
- I got the door covered!

134
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,457
I got the net!

135
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,295
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

136
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,191
<i>Uh-oh. Busted.</i>

137
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:07,299
Put Beans in his cage...

138
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,841
now.

139
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,316
Is everything broken?

140
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,858
Teacup with
the flower on it broken?

141
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,895
Nice move, FedEx.

142
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:43,397
<i>Okay, here we go,</i>
<i>everyone. School. Let's go.</i>

143
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,573
Hey.

144
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,150
Much cooler.

145
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,157
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Henry, here you go.
<i>- Thanks, Mom.</i>

146
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,591
For the record, I am so over Nora's
hand-me-downs.

147
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,597
All right, well, you look gorgeous
in anything, Lorraine.

148
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,133
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's goin' on?
What's wrong with you, mister?

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,533
Everybody says
the FedEx guy dropped me off...

150
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,731
'cause I don't fit in
with this family.

151
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,434
You fit.
You fit right here.

152
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,740
- Like that.
<i>- I called shotgun.!</i>

153
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,575
- No, I did!
- I did!

154
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,581
- I did!
<i>- All right, that's it.!</i>

155
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,049
Hey, you two,
knock it off!

156
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,313
Mom's losing it!
I'm losing it!

157
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,550
All right. All right. Come on.
Break it up. Break it up.

158
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,787
<i>Here we go. Are you okay?</i>
<i>I'll give you candy.</i>

159
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:40,127
- Nigel, Kyle, chill or be chilled.
- Sure. Listen to him.

160
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,963
Mark? Oh.

161
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,776
- So Nora's not coming?
- Well, not exactly. Here.

162
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,678
That is so Nora. We tell 'em
they can't sleep together...

163
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,943
when they visit,
so she moves in with him.

164
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,951
Honey, she's just trying
to have her own life.

165
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,953
- She's too young to have her own life.
- She's 22.

166
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,457
The same age I was
when I was pregnant with her.

167
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,458
Five minutes ago, she was
sitting on my shoulders...

168
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,790
pointing at cows
in Munger's Field.

169
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,796
- And then you blinked.
- Yeah.

170
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,560
- Enough with the blinking.
No more blinking.
- All right.

171
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,305
You were checking me out,
weren't you?

172
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,967
Yes, I was.
You got a problem with that?

173
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,171
Twelve kids later,
and we still got the heat.

174
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,371
Whoo!

175
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,422
<i>Come on.! Hit it.!</i>

176
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,628
<i>Faster, faster, faster.!</i>

177
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,171
- Is that as fast as you can go?
- Is that all you got?

178
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,298
Pump 'em high!
Pump 'em high! Let's go!

179
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,399
- Pump it up!
- That's good! That's good!

180
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,605
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Way to go, Marcus.

181
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:07,140
<i>- Way to go, boys.!</i>
<i>- Nice passes.</i>

182
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,916
- Right here.
- Nice job!

183
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,927
Man, you're gettin'
old and ugly.

184
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,564
Shake.

185
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,294
Hey.

186
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,302
Hey, what are you
doin' here?

187
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,500
What, are you still too busy
bein' the pansy house-husband
to read the newspapers?

188
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,268
That coach was 5-3.

189
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,540
That's doesn't cut it.
I'm trying to grow a program.

190
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:40,017
Hey, guys. Remember Shake?
We played college ball together.

191
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,280
Yeah, the hot dog.

192
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,083
Mom said it first.

193
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,420
We're having
adult time here, boys.

194
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,722
No idea what that means.

195
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,228
<i>Well, it's this crazy thing</i>
<i>where grown-ups...</i>

196
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,095
actually get to have a conversation
without being interrupted by kids.

197
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,566
- Sounds wicked boring.
<i>- It is.</i>

198
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,933
So why don't you run along?

199
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,700
Mom's right.
He is a wiener.

200
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,436
<i>Sorry about that. Kate likes you.</i>
<i>It's just that, you know...</i>

201
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,637
she had to have the biggest
stud on the team.

202
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,146
So she, uh, chose
the third-string receiver...

203
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,410
and got all this.

204
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,542
Yeah.

205
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,917
So, are you gonna
tell me why you're here?

206
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,614
Lincoln's a winning machine.

207
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,160
You think you can make
our old team a champion again?

208
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,927
- You mean coach?
- Coach.

209
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,502
- Tom, what is it? Just tell me.

210
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,598
- Just...
- Okay. Wait.

211
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:42,013
- Dad's covering with the machines.

212
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,515
- To the chute!
- Go, go, go!

213
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,913
<i>My, this is big.</i>

214
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,285
Shake Maguire wants me
to coach the Stallions.

215
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,018
- Get out!
- He offered me...

216
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,528
a fat five-year contract, housing
allowance, moving expenses.

217
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,155
Kate, we can finally get new furniture.
We can get a new car.

218
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,962
And get this. University employees
can send their kids to school for free.

219
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,095
Wow.

220
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,575
Oh. I don't know, honey.
A Division I coaching job...

221
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,771
that's a lot of pressure
and a lot more hours.

222
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,304
Yeah, but with all the kids in school next
year, we could handle more job pressure.

223
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,114
Yeah, but, honey, Midland is our home.
I mean, the kids' lives are here.

224
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,417
Midland has been great
for raising our kids...

225
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,619
but I never expected 'em
to sacrifice the way that I did.

226
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,855
You loved your childhood.

227
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,864
Yeah.

228
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,833
Except for this part...
the raggedy, hand-me-down part.

229
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,165
The Stallions head coach.

230
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,967
It's your dream job,
isn't it, honey?

231
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,968
I want this one, Kate.

232
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,012
Let's talk to the kids.

233
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,411
How do you think
they'll handle it?

234
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,541
- We're gonna move!

235
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,188
Okay, everybody,
you know the drill.

236
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,315
On "three,"
you give me a big "cheese."

237
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,753
Jake, do you have
to wear black?

238
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,823
Black works, Mom. Jesus, like,
has his funeral on Christmas.

239
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,597
- He died on Easter, Barbie.
- Whatever.

240
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,865
He was resurrected
on Easter, moron.

241
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,930
- Be quiet.
<i>- Don't touch me.!</i>

242
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,172
- Hey, hey, hey!
What's all the fighting about?

243
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,043
Exactly when did you plan
on telling us about moving?

244
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,414
- I'm not moving!
- Yeah, because I'm not moving, all right?

245
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,389
- I'm not moving.
- Charlie, Evanston is only four hours away.

246
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,791
- Beth can come and visit.
- This isn't just about Beth, Mom.

247
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:40,195
- My whole life is here at Midland.

248
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,392
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

249
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:46,302
- Hi, Nora. You're on speaker.
- Hi, everybody.

250
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,900
Hank says hi too. So, you guys
are thinking about moving up here?

251
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,536
Yeah. You got room in that new
apartment for your big old family?

252
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,548
Just big enough for two, Dad.
How's your book going, Mom?

253
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,710
Actually, I just sent it to a friend
who's in publishing, so we'll see.

254
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,619
- Could we stay on subject, please?
<i>- Beans's mother's buried here.</i>

255
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,953
I'm not splitting them up.
They're family.

256
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,892
We can build a fancy new memorial
to Pork in our new yard.

257
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,260
- Yeah, like we could afford that.
- Actually, we can.

258
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,165
I'll be making enough money to do that,
get you out of hand-me-downs...

259
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,671
<i>get Jake those new skates, and get</i>
<i>that new car we've been saving for.</i>

260
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,265
- But I have friends here!
- Honey, you'll keep in touch.
And you can make new friends.

261
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,641
Quiet!

262
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,980
Now, look,
I know you're all scared.

263
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,579
Moving is a big deal. We're
very comfortable here. I get that.

264
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,988
And that's why I turned down a lot of
other coaching offers through the years.

265
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,127
But this is a job
I wanted since we left Chicago.

266
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,223
And, in fact,
it's more than a job to me.

267
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,768
Um, this is my team...

268
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,930
<i>and it's my colors</i>
<i>and it's, um...</i>

269
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,372
the Stallions.

270
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,536
And they're finally
calling my number.

271
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,672
<i>And I want you to take this risk</i>
<i>with me, because if you do...</i>

272
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,910
I promise you, we will be...

273
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,351
a happier and stronger family.

274
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,790
- You promise?
- I promise.

275
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,522
- I would feel happier and
stronger if we vote on it.
- Yeah, definitely.

276
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,530
<i>- We should vote.</i>

277
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,623
<i>That's the only way to make it fair.</i>
<i>It's the only way to do it.</i>

278
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,964
All right, we can vote.

279
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,005
But in the end, your mother and I are gonna
do what we think is best for the family.

280
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,007
- What's the point of even voting?
- I'm out.

281
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,636
- Let's get out of here.
It's not even worth it.
<i>- Come on, guys.</i>

282
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,183
Hello? Still here.

283
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,246
All right, eight noes...

284
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,225
three yes's
and three maybes.

285
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,557
<i>Not exactly a mandate.</i>

286
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,189
Give me a pen.
I'm gonna change some of these.

287
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,697
Here we go.

288
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,168
- What?
- "What"?

289
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,172
Let's review, shall we?

290
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,038
Here we go.

291
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,772
"I'm so glad I found someone
whose dreams are as big as mine.

292
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,041
I love you. Kate."

293
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,083
I always loved the way
you go for things, Tom.

294
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,645
Pedal to the metal, full-on,
all of it or none of it.

295
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,714
So we're doing this.

296
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,818
We're gonna do this.

297
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,567
We're doing it.

298
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:35,073
Yeah. And by the time we move,
the kids'll get used to the idea.

299
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,622
<i>Say good-bye</i>
<i>to your mother, Beans.</i>

300
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,234
<i>Gunner, to the car.!</i>

301
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,236
- Come on!

302
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,397
I'm you.
Gunner, to the car!

303
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,566
- I'm Gunner. Gunner, to the car!

304
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,141
<i>Hey, Charlie. Do me a favor</i>
<i>and drive the Cutlass?</i>

305
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,012
Thanks for ruining my life.

306
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,813
<i>I don't wanna move.!</i>

307
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,615
- You know what?
Everybody's going with us.

308
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,486
We're taking all your toys.
Okay.

309
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,653
Well, whoever said expressing
emotion is a good thing, I'd like to see.

310
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,332
Hey, this is our street.

311
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,837
Are you sure we're gonna
fit in here, Dad?

312
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,969
You'll have friends here
in no time, guys.

313
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,225
<i>Here we are.</i>
<i>We are here. Everybody out.</i>

314
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,284
<i>I want everybody out.</i>

315
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,723
- Hey, slow down there, Gunner!

316
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,031
- Wait up!
- Hey, Kyle, check this place out!

317
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,936
- Cool!

318
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,372
There it is... a 1920s classic.

319
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,376
What, did the Munsters
give you a good price?

320
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,572
<i>All right, the twins share, but</i>
<i>everybody else gets their own room.</i>

321
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,515
- Now, go kill each other for the best one!
- That's great.

322
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,456
Hey, Charlie.

323
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,290
You're gonna need a car to visit Beth.
The Olds is yours now.

324
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,133
You trying to bribe me?

325
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,193
Is it working?

326
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,463
Little bit.

327
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,935
Come on.

328
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,613
Welcome home, Kate.

329
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,757
- It's gonna be great, Tom.
- Mmm.

330
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,763
<i>Jessica, come here.!</i>
<i>Check this out.!</i>

331
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,765
<i>- This room is huge.!</i>
<i>- Can I see this one?</i>

332
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,767
Whoa-ho!
Back it up, FedEx.

333
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,429
If anyone gets the room
across from me, it's Charlie.

334
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,098
- And are you Charlie? No.
<i>- Dude, I call this room.</i>

335
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,698
<i>- Nobody else gets it, okay?</i>
<i>- Look at the view from here.!</i>

336
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,506
<i>- It's spectacular.!</i>
<i>- Can I share with you?</i>

337
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,078
Oh, God.
They're fast-food people.

338
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,045
<i>- Hello?</i>

339
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,778
People are here!

340
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,083
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Tina Shenk.

341
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,147
This is my husband Bill
and our son Dylan.

342
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,385
- How do you do?
<i>- We, uh, live across the street.</i>

343
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,554
- Thank you. This is lovely.
I'm Kate. This is Tom.
- Hi.

344
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,291
- We're the Bakers.
- Oh!

345
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,060
- Gunner! Gunner!
- I am so sorry.

346
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,829
- Sorry.
- Are you hiding a cheeseburger
anywhere on your person?

347
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,566
- L-I don't eat meat.

348
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,871
- Jake?
- Dude! Two words: Manners.

349
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,174
- What's up? Wanna help me unpack?
- Sure.

350
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,680
- Put your sweater on, sweetie.
- He's inside, dear.

351
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,740
Don't start, okay?

352
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,015
So, uh, is Jake
your only child?

353
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,058
No. We have 12.

354
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,357
I couldn't
keep her off me.

355
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,232
- Heads up!
- Oh!

356
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,893
- Little less wrist, Mike.
- Got it.

357
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,168
<i>- Game on.!</i>
- Uh, they're playing hockey in the house?

358
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,210
Well, if the game gets bigger
than three-on-three, then
they have to take it outside.

359
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,215
Uh, Dylan doesn't really
care for rough play.

360
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,685
Uh, you're gonna wanna
stop now, dude.

361
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,689
- Oh, my God!

362
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,918
- Hang on, buddy!
- A little help here!

363
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,053
- I got him! I got him!
- Save my baby!

364
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,723
Don't worry, Dylan. I swing
from the chandelier all the time.

365
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,461
- Cool!
- All right.

366
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,800
Aah! I got him! I...
Oh! I don't got him!

367
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,364
- Oh, my God!

368
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,802
So, Dylan,
know any good restaurants?

369
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,974
<i>I've got you, Dylan.!</i>
<i>Don't worry, honey.!</i>

370
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:25,082
<i>- Whoa.!</i>
- You can let go, Dylan.
I think she's got you.

371
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,250
<i>- Spin him this way so I can...</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.!</i>

372
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,824
- Oh, sweetie, are you all right?
- I'm fine, Mom.

373
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,893
<i>- Oh, dear.</i>
- You know, for the entire
minute and a half we lived here...

374
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,904
I really hated
that chandelier.

375
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,564
- Here we go.

376
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,405
Okay. We, uh... We better go.
It's time for your chess lesson.

377
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,411
I don't have
a chess lesson, Mom.

378
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,413
Well, then, you need to practice
for your chess lesson.

379
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,449
Come over anytime, dude.

380
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,076
Uh, we'll, uh, we'll call,
schedule a play date.

381
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,313
No need.
Just come by anytime.

382
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,982
Oh, no, we'll call.

383
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,618
- You're all invited to my birthday.
- Oh-ho. That'll be fun.

384
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,924
Hey, Charlie, come on down
and help me with this, okay?

385
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,692
<i> Careful, honey.</i>
<i>There's glass everywhere.</i>

386
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,066
- I got it, Mom.
- Okay, well, I'll help you.

387
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,766
- Hey, Shake, what's up?
- You okay?

388
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,435
Really?

389
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,877
Okay, well,
I'll see you there.

390
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:26,350
Hey! Hey, guess what? Fox Sports
wants to interview me on TV!

391
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,819
- Okay, well, we got this.
- Dad's gotta earn a living!

392
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,356
<i>Twelve kids.</i>
<i>That's the throwback.</i>

393
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,358
Irresponsible is what is is.

394
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,553
How come we didn't
have more kids?

395
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,562
Because we wanted
one perfect child...

396
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,655
and that's what we got.

397
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,689
Cool.

398
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,492
<i> Honey, I'm gonna be home late</i>
<i>tonight. I got another press conference.</i>

399
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,829
<i>Come on. Whatever happened</i>
<i>to that stud...</i>

400
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,130
who sat across from me
at dinner every night?

401
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,433
He got his dream job,
remember?

402
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,411
- Good-bye, Dad.
- See ya, buddy.

403
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,397
Tell the masseuse I'm running
about 15 minutes late.

404
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:51,367
- Day 14 on the alien planet.
<i>- Where you goin'?</i>

405
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,930
To sign up for football.
And, no, you can't come.

406
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,176
<i>Could this place be</i>
<i>any more boring?</i>

407
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,976
<i>- There's, like, nothing to do around here.</i>
- I could give you a make over.

408
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,479
All righty, then.

409
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,296
Hi.
I'm Charlie Baker.

410
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,300
Oh, yeah, Tom Baker's boy.

411
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,099
Read where his old buddy Shake
threw him a bone.

412
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,106
<i>Offense or defense?</i>

413
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,069
I'm a quarterback.

414
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,410
Yeah, well,
maybe in Cowpie, Illinois.

415
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,940
<i>This is 4-A, Skippy.</i>
<i>The bigs.</i>

416
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,579
Put him on defense.
Cornerback.

417
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,827
<i>By the way, when you show up</i>
<i>for practice, don't be wearing that hat.</i>

418
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,502
<i>Okay, uh, let's see.</i>
<i>Who's next? Yes?</i>

419
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,802
<i>It's been reported that you like</i>
<i>to blast music in your locker room. Why?</i>

420
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,240
Uh, well,
it loosens up the players...

421
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,073
and, uh,
gets 'em psyched.

422
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:10,046
Unless, of course, I start dancing.
Then they just get nauseous.

423
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,884
At least we get
to see him on TV.

424
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,886
<i>Coach,</i>
<i>how do you manage a family of 12...</i>

425
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,047
<i>and a football team?</i>

426
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,057
Well, I've got
a great team here...

427
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,787
and a solid support system
at home.

428
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,955
- Go to bed, kids.
- Okay, you heard the coach.

429
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,964
- Off to bed. Here we go.

430
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,126
In Midland, we were a family.
Now we're a support system?

431
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,069
- A family is a support system, Butch.

432
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,310
Hello? Who's this?

433
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,939
- Somebody from something something.
- Okay. Shh.

434
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,712
Hello? Yeah, hi, Diane.

435
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,988
<i>This is business. Salmons</i>
<i>and pinks are so homemaker.</i>

436
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,259
All right, focus on
your navies and your grays.

437
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,167
Navy is muscle, gray is smarts. Choose
either, and you'll rule the boardroom.

438
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,502
- What's going on?
- Guess what?

439
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:13,010
Diane Phillips called.
My book's getting published.

440
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,011
Did I tell you
we're gonna have it all?

441
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,446
- You've never said that.
- I'm tellin' you now, baby! Whoo!

442
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,746
- Oh-oh.
- Oh!

443
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,616
<i>- Oh.! Whoa.!</i>
<i>- Mmm.!</i>

444
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,416
Ooh!

445
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,687
Oh, my God! Can you guys just please
wait till I leave the room?

446
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,694
Can you hurry?

447
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,231
- All right, there's one thing.
- What?

448
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,961
They asked me to go
to New York for a few days.

449
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,272
- Oh.
- "Oh"?

450
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,537
That was a good "oh,"
as in "okay."

451
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,135
<i>Yes, it's not</i>
<i>the best timing in the world.</i>

452
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,875
- But you're going to New York.
I can handle this.
- You'll manage.

453
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,439
Yeah.

454
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,543
Well, you haven't been home much,
Tom, since we moved here.

455
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,719
And you're gonna have to, you know,
shop for school supplies...

456
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,987
get 'em dressed
and-and bathed so they're clean...

457
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,655
- and put 'em to bed at night, walk Gunner...
- Been there. Done all that.

458
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,299
- You're considering this?
- I'm not considering it.

459
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,098
You're going. Nora can help me out
around the house.

460
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,842
New York. Wow.

461
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,400
Yeah. Wow.

462
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,319
<i>It totally sucks. I miss you too...</i>

463
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,329
but, I mean, I gotta get a job.

464
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,331
Hi, Lorraine.

465
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,560
Okay, I'll try
and be there, honey.

466
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:48,038
Hi, Kimmy. Yeah, l-I know I haven't
been very friendly recently.

467
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,937
They are pulling me in again!

468
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,977
- Just tell 'em you can't do it.
- Can you guys hold on a second?

469
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,172
That's easy for you to say.
You're an only child.

470
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,646
It might be fun
to babysit together.

471
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,883
No! Whoa, no!

472
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,188
No. You know what happened
last time we visited.

473
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,196
- They were welcoming you into the family.
- They set me on fire!

474
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,165
Just your pants.

475
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,897
Honey, I am an actor, okay? And, sure,
last time it was just my pants.

476
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,565
But what if next time
it's my face?

477
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,905
This is the moneymaker.
I'm not that good of an actor.

478
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,968
This is how I get the jobs.
I know that.

479
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,310
I'm man enough to admit it.

480
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,508
Please?

481
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,313
- Don't look at me like that.
Don't look at me like that!
- Please, please, please, please?

482
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,253
You always do that to me.
Fine, fine. You know what? We'll go.

483
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,518
But I'll tell you what.
One thing happens, and I'm gone.

484
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,493
And no fires.
And we sleep in the same room.

485
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,496
Kimmy, put Dad on.

486
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,665
She says she'll help us out if
they can stay in the same room.

487
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,397
No. No way.

488
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,565
No, she knows the rules. She wants
to have her own room when she's here.

489
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,508
Isn't that sweet? No.

490
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:04,207
Okay, look, why don't you just come over
on Sunday, and we'll talk logistics.

491
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,740
- All right. Bye.
- Tell me Doorknob Man
isn't babysitting too.

492
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,219
Yes, he very well
might be, young lady.

493
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,347
And do not set
his pants on fire again.

494
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,890
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Classic.

495
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,261
<i>It was just his pants.</i>

496
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,196
Is anybody besides me thinking
our happier and stronger life...

497
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,563
was actually code
for "nastier and suckier"?

498
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,228
First, Dad forces us
to move.

499
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,535
Then Mom decides to become a career
person and, like, travel the globe.

500
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,132
Now we have to take orders
from Hank, the model/actor?

501
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,702
- And he hates kids too.
- Ow!

502
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,443
Nora's blind to his evil. We have
no choice but to intervene.

503
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,146
We've got 48 hours.
Let's work a plan.

504
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,087
<i>All right, Appleschmear season</i>
<i>is officially open.!</i>

505
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,462
The president of the United States,
Sarah Baker...

506
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,468
will throw out the first apple.

507
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,471
Come on. Bring on the chin music, baby.
Let's go. Let's go.

508
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,172
<i>Let's go. Oh, yes.!</i>

509
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,012
Ho, it's an apple!
And now it's sauce.

510
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,750
And that's a beauty!
Mmm! Mmm!

511
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,361
- Whoa!

512
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:29,366
Appleschmear. It's the game my
Great-Grandma Gilbreth invented.

513
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,629
- Neat.

514
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,069
Time out.
Nora's here.

515
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:41,137
- Nora! Nora!
- No! No, no, no, no!

516
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,045
<i>Kids, please do not touch</i>
<i>the LeBaron. Just had it detailed.</i>

517
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,879
Hey, whoa, Tom.
Tom, can we please, uh...

518
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,715
ask the kids to respect
the perimeter around the LeBaron?

519
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,017
Hey, hey, respect the perimeter, kids.
Come on. Respect...

520
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,854
Back up. Back up.
Nora. Nora, welcome.

521
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,895
- Come on.
- It's a luxury automobile, kids.

522
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,430
- Not your daddy's Oldsmobile.
- This is for you. Congratulations.

523
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,363
- Come on.
- I wanna hear all about it.

524
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,401
- It's very fancy.
- Now, about the babysitting.

525
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,369
Battle stations.

526
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,535
Heads up, Hank!

527
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,108
<i>Yo, Hank.!</i>

528
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,908
Phase one complete.

529
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,695
Sorry about your clothes, Hank.
We'll have 'em dry in no time.

530
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:13,794
"Sorry about your clothes, Hank.
We'll have 'em dry in no time."

531
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,448
What is with the staring?
Just stop looking at me.

532
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,220
Chopsticks.

533
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,096
Open meat bucket.

534
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,174
Oh!

535
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,406
Begin underwear soaking.

536
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,147
So, um, how's the acting
career going, Hank?

537
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,488
If it was goin' any better,
there'd have to be two of me.

538
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,255
Yeah, we saw you in the commercial
with the gargling... the mouthwash ad.

539
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,388
You know, the remarkable thing
about my career is...

540
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,932
I only started acting, uh,
a month ago...

541
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,934
and, uh,
I'm already on TV.

542
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:22,439
<i>It's the real deal. The career</i>
<i>is white hot, Tom. It's on fire.</i>

543
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,634
I read that most actors end up
in the food service industry.

544
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,373
That's not gonna happen
to Hank, Kim.

545
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,043
<i>Candidly,</i>
<i>I, uh, think Nora's right.</i>

546
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,712
It's really... It's gettin' so as I can
hardly go out in public anymore.

547
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:40,883
<i>I mean, really, with... between the</i>
<i>autograph hounds and the paparazzis...</i>

548
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,449
Autographs and everything?
I mean, just the one commercial...

549
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,461
and you have paparazzi?

550
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,191
Yeah. I've-I've actually...
I've never actually seen them...

551
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,032
but, you know, they hide
in the bush and they get their shot.

552
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:57,507
<i>The crazy thing is that now we're trying</i>
<i>to sit at home like regular joes...</i>

553
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,305
Yeah, well, honey, it's...
And we're watching TV, right?

554
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,176
<i>And, boom, comes on a commercial,</i>
<i>and, bam, there's me.</i>

555
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,181
It's, like, you expect to see yourself
in the mirror...

556
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,740
you know, and you expect
to be lookin' at the handsome devil...

557
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,150
but not on...
not on the TV like it is.

558
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,314
<i>It's, like, bam.! Bam.! You turn</i>
<i>the channel. You're tryin' to...</i>

559
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,723
<i>you know, get it out,</i>
<i>and it's... it just keeps poppin' up.</i>

560
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,557
It's like I can run from me,
but I can't hide from me.

561
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,788
What a nightmare!

562
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,325
Yeah.

563
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,837
Nora, honey, you wanna
help me in the kitchen?

564
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,240
Nora, stop!
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

565
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,509
Wanna help me in the kitchen? Get a pie,
look at a picture of Grandma, say the rosary?

566
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,550
<i>- Come on, kids. Here we go.</i>
<i>Everybody out.</i>
- I'll be back.

567
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,018
Tommy.
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

568
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,095
- Gunner!

569
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,134
- Save it, boy.

570
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,642
- Hey!
- Hey.

571
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,644
There you go.
You look as good as new.

572
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,375
- Yeah. Not as good as you, chief.
- Yeah, anywhere.

573
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,548
- How sweet.
- You know what you want?

574
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,646
Kate, is this... is this
orange juice freshly squeezed?

575
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,249
Nora and I are on
a bit of an organic diet...

576
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,226
and we're only goin' with
the organic freshly squeezed...

577
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,763
and it tastes a bit
like Tropicana.

578
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,322
<i>He's a winner.</i>

579
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,164
- Gunner, no!

580
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,999
Release the hound.

581
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,561
All right, charge!

582
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,608
You guys poppin' out
another one any time soon?

583
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,811
Just... curiosity.

584
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,355
- Gunner!

585
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,292
- Gunner!
- Gunner!

586
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,091
It's Gunner.

587
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:03,190
Honey, he's...
he's really digging in.

588
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,100
Sorry, babe.
Gunner, stop! Sit-Sit down!

589
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,660
<i>- He's attacking.!</i>
- Stop it, Gunner.

590
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,167
- Oh, my. Well, he's hungry.
<i>- Stop it, Gunner.!</i>

591
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,677
- Gunner!

592
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,980
Get him off!
Get him off!

593
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,376
Nora! Nora, we didn't
want <i>you</i> to go.

594
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,383
Look, let's just get
something clear.

595
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,511
Even though you guys live
near me now, I have my own life.

596
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,613
It's <i>mine.</i>
Not <i>ours...</i> mine.

597
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,023
<i>Nora.! Would you please</i>
<i>get in the LeBaron?</i>

598
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:07,120
<i>- I beg of you.!</i>
- My loyalty is to Hank now...

599
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,190
and that's the way
it's gonna be.

600
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,293
In the living room,
now!

601
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,406
Let's go!

602
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,375
Your neighborhood canines have
completely ruined the LeBaron's paint job.

603
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,438
I'm sure my family
will pay to repaint it.

604
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,848
Good, 'cause I'm sure
payin' for your family.

605
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,785
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I think you know what it means.

606
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:36,293
You soaked his underwear
in meat.

607
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,887
That is so wrong.

608
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,765
Funny, but wrong.

609
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,528
Now, who was
the mastermind...

610
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,474
in the meat-soaking plot
against Hank?

611
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,449
You were the masterminds?

612
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,753
Step back, please.

613
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,156
You have a dark gift,
Sarah Baker.

614
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,351
But it's going to cost
everyone a month's allowance.

615
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:45,691
- Do you wanna make it two?

616
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,428
<i>Now, when your mother</i>
<i>leaves tomorrow...</i>

617
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,628
<i>I'm gonna need everyone</i>
<i>to pull their own weight.</i>

618
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,069
Now, go upstairs
and go to your rooms!

619
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,376
Soaking his underwear in meat?

620
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,540
I mean,
how do they come up with that?

621
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,609
If I could just harness that ingenuity and
channel it into something constructive.

622
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,315
Yeah, like getting somebody
to help you out while I'm gone.

623
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,552
I can handle it, even without
the better half of the tag team.

624
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,958
I know, honey. I'm just worried.
I've never left the kids...

625
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,997
- Honey, it's three days!
<i>- I know.</i>

626
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,158
I'm just...
I'm gonna miss 'em.

627
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,929
<i>Okay, I froze some dinners. And</i>
<i>make sure they get to school on time.</i>

628
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,437
It's their first day, so you know
how nervous they're gonna be, all right?

629
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,167
And, kids, don't worry.
Mom can be back from New York
in two hours if something happens.

630
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,573
Really, it's only one hour
with the time difference.

631
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:36,670
All right, I hugged everybody.
I love you all. One more hug,
and you guys pass it on.

632
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,874
All right? All right,
thank you, sweetheart.

633
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,883
- I love you.
- I love you too.

634
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,114
- Okay. All right. Do I have everything?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

635
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,213
All right.

636
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,349
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

637
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,689
- I love you.
- Yeah, yeah.

638
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,491
Have a safe flight.

639
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,863
Got the whole neighborhood
out to say good-bye, huh?

640
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,662
Bye, Mom!

641
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,676
Little vampires,
my plan worked.

642
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,941
She's gone. Now I can raise
you children the way I want to!

643
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,886
Come on. It's gonna be fun.
I mean, your dream has come true.

644
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,888
Mom's gone.
Weak old Dad is here.

645
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,550
You can get away with murder.
You can do anything you want.

646
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,527
Dylan's birthday party
is coming up.

647
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:29,897
You can get all hopped up on ice cream
and sugar and cake and go crazy.

648
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,435
You kids are gonna
do great today, I promise.

649
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,561
What is that?

650
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,660
Moo!

651
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,972
I guess he's the funniest guy
in the herd.

652
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,916
Walk much?

653
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,439
- Hi!
- Hey!

654
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:54,450
- Look at you, Diane.
- Look at you. You did not have 12 kids.

655
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,713
- Yes, I did.
- Girl, I can't even manage a boyfriend.

656
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,517
- Well, who can? Look at this room!
- Oh, it's great.

657
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,424
- Isn't it great?
- Listen, we've got big plans for the book.

658
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,485
- Really? I'm so...
- Ta-da!

659
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,462
Oh, come on!
Look at it!

660
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,989
- Isn't it great?
- It's fantastic. I love it. Look at this.

661
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,559
The company wants it
in stores by Christmas.

662
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,571
- Christmas?
- Yes. So, tomorrow...

663
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,073
the marketing people will bring you
up to speed on the book tour.

664
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,109
- A-A book tour?
- Yes. We've got talk shows...

665
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,204
book signings,
personal appearances.

666
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,249
And it's only gonna take
a couple of weeks.

667
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:30,514
Couple of weeks? Oh, no.
I can't be away from the kids that long.

668
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,588
Well, if there's no book tour,
then there's no book.

669
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,328
- Two weeks?
- Kate...

670
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,297
you've been the primary caregiver
for, what, 22 years?

671
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,664
Can't Tom handle the kids
for a while?

672
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,010
They're all going to end up
on milk cartons.

673
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,054
Gil... Gil, Decker and Rico
are playing too loose at the corners.

674
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,066
- We need to pull them in.

675
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,626
Sarah, dishwasher! I'll-I'll come by tomorrow
after I drop the kids off at school...

676
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,865
and we can talk out
some offense variations.

677
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,669
All right. No, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

678
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:29,576
<i>Dad, Nigel hit Kim with a dart,</i>
<i>and I assume he will be punished.</i>

679
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,614
Uh, Jake, get me a Band-Aid, okay?
Here, here.

680
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,616
Go stir. You like to stir.
Here, let's take a look at it.

681
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,618
Let's take a look, see if it's okay.

682
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,883
- Oh, no, I'm just kidding.
It's actually not...
- Uh, Dad?

683
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,151
- Yeah?
- This goo's on fire.

684
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,719
Oh, no, no. That's the way Daddy likes it!
Likes it hot and nice and spicy!

685
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:49,994
Yeah. Here we go.
There we go. Got it. All right.

686
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,729
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, good. Can you get a Band-Aid?

687
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:56,102
- No need to say hello.
- Not one other kid in
this neighborhood does chores.

688
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,505
Well, we're not like any
other family in the neighborhood.

689
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,476
Right. So,
why do we live here?

690
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,308
Dishwasher, now!

691
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,077
Jessica, can you get these plates
and put 'em on the table, please?

692
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,086
Oh, God. What the...
Mike's athletic cup?

693
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,088
Ow!

694
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:17,149
Oh!
Pasta de la Crotch.

695
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,491
- Is that blood?
- No, it's just a...

696
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:33,609
Oh! Clean-up on aisle 12!
Anybody?

697
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,805
You need help
cleaning up, Dad?

698
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,179
- I'm in puke!
- Are you all right?

699
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,277
- Still need help cleaning up?
- No, you mopped it up
enough with your back.

700
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:50,349
Oh, disgusting!
Where's the Band-Aid?

701
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,124
<i>- Dad, it still hurts.</i>
- Oh, here, let me look. Let me look.

702
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,461
Nora, where's that Band...

703
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,058
Jake put a bucket on Jessica's head,
and it's stuck.

704
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,036
And when they have a free moment,
let my parents know that...

705
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,732
I came by to tell 'em
I got a job today at an ad agency.

706
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:07,004
Nora... Nora!

707
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,071
<i>- Dad, a little help here.!</i>
- Nora!

708
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,379
<i>- Nora.!</i>

709
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,055
- Are you all right?

710
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,683
- You are in over your head, mister!
- I'm so sorry.

711
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,284
I mean, I will... I will call...
It's just my wife is out of town.

712
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,489
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

713
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:31,523
- Dad, can I kill Jake now?
- No, you finish washing the car first.

714
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,195
- Dad, can you get this Band-Aid on me?
- Yes, yes. Come on. Come on.

715
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:37,104
- Let's go. Okay, come on.
Everything will be all right.
<i>- Oh, Jake?</i>

716
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,007
- Give me the Band-Aid.
<i>- That's the last time you put</i>
<i>a bucket on my head.!</i>

717
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,045
- Does that hurt? Okay, good.

718
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:45,047
- There it is. All right, good. Good.

719
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,276
<i>Hey, Nigel, wanna play darts?</i>

720
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,115
No! No playing darts!
I told you that!

721
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,619
- Hello?
- Hi. How's it goin'?

722
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,090
Oh, everything's fine. I'm just, uh...
I'm just here. I'm just, uh, making dinner.

723
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,855
- Yeah.
<i>- Dad, check me out.!</i>

724
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:02,729
- Isn't this awesome?
- How are you?

725
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,699
- Good, I guess.
<i>- Sorry, Dad.!</i>

726
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,895
I mean, it's kind of weird
having all this free time.

727
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,497
- You sure everything's all right, honey?
- Oh, honey, everything's fine.

728
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,940
- I can handle it.

729
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,877
All right, you know, I'm just used to
tag-teaming to manage the mob.

730
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,437
- So I thought...
- Oh, no. They're like kittens.

731
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,574
- Whoa!
<i>- Sorry, Dad.!</i>

732
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,381
Uh, well, this might be a good time then
to talk about me staying a few extra days.

733
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:29,221
- What? A few extra days?
- Uh, 14, give or take.

734
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,056
What did I say about throwing darts?

735
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,597
That's a lot of days, Kate,
and a couple of key games.

736
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,929
All right, but I have a plan.
If we just take it one day at a time...

737
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,128
and if you start to get overwhelmed
or the kids stage a coup...

738
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,137
you call me up, I'm home,
end of trip.

739
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,641
Well, uh, s-s-sounds good.
Sounds good.

740
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,643
- Got him in the face!

741
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,272
Okay, honey, thanks for doin' this.
Give me someone.

742
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,943
Oh. Hey, uh, you know what?
They're doing homework right now...

743
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:59,785
and it's that math, uh, trig...
"trigadronomy" thing that you
and I just aren't very good at.

744
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:03,656
And it's the sweetest thing.
They formed a little study group...

745
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,322
and they're helping each other,
and, uh, it's like a little mini, uh...

746
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:11,197
- think tank thing.

747
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,395
And I'd just hate
to break that up.

748
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,201
Well, give everyone my love, and
you call me right after dinner, okay?

749
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,208
- Okay. Will do.
- Bye.

750
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:22,074
- Bye.
<i>- Come on, Dad.</i>
<i>Don't hide in the closet.</i>

751
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,272
<i>Take it like a man.!</i>

752
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,281
Two weeks'll go by in
no time, guys. You'll see.

753
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,909
<i>Yeah, right.!</i>

754
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,385
Yeah, right.

755
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,786
- Yeah?

756
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,451
- Hey.
- What's up?

757
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,654
- Okay?
- Come in.

758
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,391
<i>Look, your mom's not coming home</i>
<i>for a couple of weeks.</i>

759
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,434
What?

760
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,272
Okay. Up till now,
I've been, like, mellow...

761
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:58,303
about this whole having-it-all lifestyle
that you and Mom are currently into...

762
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,509
"A," because Sarah has the drama
queen role totally covered...

763
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,986
and "B," because I've benefited
from your salary spike...

764
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,286
in various shallow
but nonetheless pleasing ways.

765
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:12,727
But, Dad, check it out. This afternoon,
Mike was repelling from the roof...

766
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,525
<i>Nigel was using Kim</i>
<i>as a human dartboard...</i>

767
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,260
<i>and you employed your son</i>
<i>as a vomit mop.</i>

768
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,737
Call me crazy, Pops, but things are getting
pretty twisted around here.

769
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,433
I need to hire some help.

770
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,875
As in a babysitter? Okay,
that is so not happening.

771
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,606
Dad, just call Mom and tell her
we need her back home.

772
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,171
I just can't do that right now,
not with all the work she's done.

773
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,184
It just wouldn't be fair.

774
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:38,551
Well, then why don't you
spend more time at home?

775
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,216
Honey, that's just not
an option right now.

776
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,055
<i>I've got a big job,</i>
<i>a job that I love.</i>

777
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,425
I'm gonna have to
call in some backup.

778
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,935
<i> Hello.</i>

779
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,840
Uh, my name is Tom Baker, and I'm
interested in hiring a domestic helper.

780
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,869
Um, I have 12 children.

781
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,149
Actually, I'm serious.

782
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,583
- Just 12.
- Twelve.

783
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:12,121
There's only two.
Oh, plus 10.

784
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,590
How many kids? Well, uh, when
you get here we can just count 'em up.

785
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,627
Well, there's 12.
But one doesn't live with me...

786
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,628
and one you never see
'cause he's so mad.

787
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,163
Uh, a dozen?

788
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:34,732
Just-Just-Just 12.

789
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,076
Hello. I'll just hang up on myself.

790
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,899
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Mike. What's up?

791
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:09,104
- It's Mark.
- Right. Mark. What's up?

792
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,147
I don't get this math homework.

793
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,708
Hey, you know what? I've got a game
I'm not nearly prepared for.

794
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,719
Could you go ask one
of your sisters to help you?

795
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,950
Yeah. Okay.

796
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,090
Forget it.

797
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,401
Hello. Yeah,
could you do me a favor...

798
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:43,811
and send up 12 pillows
to 504?

799
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,814
Yes.

800
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,009
Thank you.

801
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,382
Mmm.
That'll be good.

802
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:58,184
"Hey, kids,
I had to get to work.

803
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,195
"Lorraine and Kim,
you're in charge of breakfast.

804
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:05,200
Henry and Jake, lunches.
Charlie, handle drop-offs."

805
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:08,032
<i>- Come on, Charlie. We're gonna be late.</i>

806
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:11,096
Cute car seats, Baker.

807
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,369
You know, we had to take
our little brothers to nursery school...

808
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,434
if that's okay with you.

809
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,072
What happened? Did-Did Mommy
and Daddy go back to the farm?

810
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,413
You know what? This whole "harass
the hick" thing's getting pretty old.

811
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,543
Actually, I'm just
gettin' started.

812
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,212
- Yeah? What else you got?
- Yeah.

813
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,222
- You don't wanna know, man.
- Oh, I wanna know.

814
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,259
Charlie!
Charlie, Charlie, stop.

815
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,591
Stop. Just let it go,
okay? Please.

816
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,222
Yeah, Charlie.
Let it go, and go...

817
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,493
- all the way back to Podunk.

818
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,661
- Charlie, go.
<i>- Go.</i>

819
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,103
Hey, Gil, I got
a real shot with this team.

820
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,440
They're 2-0. They're rising in
the national standings...

821
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,445
and they're taking
nothing for granted.

822
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:55,041
<i>- Hey, Coach.</i>
- Hey, teenager, what's up?

823
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,678
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

824
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,386
- Look, Dad, um...
- Hey, guys, knock it off!

825
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,451
<i>All right, Coach.!</i>

826
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:10,363
I know you're all lit up
about this new job...

827
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,731
- but my new school...
- The press is waiting, Bake!

828
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:16,397
- They're out there now?
- Yeah. Come on. Get dressed.
- Hey, can we do this later?

829
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,557
Hey, kids.
How was your day at school?

830
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:45,931
I'd say the high point was that you're
only 45 minutes late picking us up.

831
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,835
Hey, you know what? There was
a pep rally at school today.

832
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,204
There were 20,000 people in the stands,
and I just couldn't leave.

833
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,642
- Here.
- Hey, you did a drawing.

834
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,146
"My favorite place
in the world..."

835
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,483
Is that the Midland house?

836
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,562
President Gerhard and I have been
waiting for a half an hour.

837
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,569
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had to...

838
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,628
I know you have responsibilities
at home, Bake, but this is it.

839
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,071
This is your shot,
your moment, not theirs.

840
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:28,008
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

841
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,545
You've wanted this
for as long as I've known you.

842
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,047
I just don't want to
see you blow it.

843
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,551
I'll work something out.

844
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:40,248
It's hard to believe someone as
staggeringly beautiful as you...

845
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:44,089
<i>could deliver 12 children and</i>
<i>still look as yummy as you do.</i>

846
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,822
Oh, that's so sweet.

847
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,228
I guess the camera
can't see my hips.

848
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,200
<i> Tell us,</i>
<i>did you have them conventionally?</i>

849
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,069
Well, uh, after the sixth one,
they just kind of walked out.

850
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,876
- Why don't you read us a little
something from your book?

851
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:09,282
Oh, I don't know. No. People
can just buy it and then read it.

852
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:12,321
- Oh, come on.
- The audience wants it.

853
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,186
- Oh, all right. Okay.

854
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,419
"Some, uh, call me a mom."

855
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,758
"Others call me
a primary caregiver.

856
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,297
But they both mean
the same thing: Chauffeur."

857
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,425
You know, it sounds like you
and your husband have things
under control at home.

858
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,130
Oh, well, I'm lucky
to have him. We sure do.

859
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,934
Kids, on the carpet! Now!

860
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,980
Dad!

861
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:42,779
College guys?

862
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,821
- What's goin' on here?
- Where's Charlie?

863
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,655
- He went to Midland for the day.
- Midland? It's a school day.

864
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:53,162
- He hates school.
- 'Course you couldn't know that
'cause you're never home.

865
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,962
Well, that is about
to change, Sarah Baker.

866
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,127
Because since I can't go to work
without you guys getting in trouble...

867
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,263
and since I can't stay home
without Shake bugging me...

868
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,364
I have brought my work
home with me.

869
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,432
Guys, meet the family.
Family, meet the team.

870
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,740
- 'Sup, boys?
- What's up?

871
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,747
Okay, we will be in the living room.
We got a lot of work to do.

872
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,807
I don't want any interruptions
unless it's an emergency. Clear?

873
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,954
Okay. Now go do your homework.
Let's go, guys.

874
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,861
<i>All right, first team, line up.!</i>

875
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,227
Good. Good. Good.

876
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:37,239
But you hit 'em too high.
You wanna hit 'em low.

877
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,312
Twenty-four.

878
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:54,890
Dad, come on!

879
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:58,223
Hey, how's New York?

880
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,961
Hi.

881
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,902
Okay, I've gotta go now.

882
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:14,809
I love you.

883
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,890
Step off, missy!

884
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:09,090
You don't talk that way
unless it's with humor!

885
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,604
Something tells me you had an unpleasant
interaction with those boys, Mark.

886
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,106
<i>They knocked my glasses off.</i>

887
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,713
I heard you were
dissing my family.

888
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,716
I don't even know
your family, loser.

889
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,617
- You do now.
- My latte!

890
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:43,289
Coach, give us a quote.

891
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,071
Violence begets violence.

892
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,947
<i>All right, enough is enough.</i>

893
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:08,616
<i>You're slacking on your chores.</i>
<i>You're fighting at school.</i>
<i>Things are out of control.</i>

894
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,956
As of this moment,
you are all grounded.

895
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,997
- What's "grounded"?
- "What's grounded?"

896
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,830
I'll tell you what grounded is.
Except for attending games...

897
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,529
you go to school;
you come home from school;

898
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,765
you do your homework;
you do your chores;

899
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,808
you go to bed;
and that's it.

900
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,935
- But that...
- Oh, yes, Sarah, I know. That sucks.

901
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,606
- But that's the way it is.
- Does this mean we can't go
to Dylan's birthday party?

902
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:36,709
- That's exactly what it means.
- We bought his presents already.

903
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,981
You are going to miss it!

904
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,014
Now, go to bed!

905
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:20,885
Hey, Gunner. Wanna get
up on the bed, buddy? Huh?

906
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,261
- Come on.

907
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,526
Come on.

908
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:10,572
- Hello.
- Next year, let's book the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir too.

909
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:14,548
Whatever happened to
pin the tail on the donkey?

910
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:18,246
And on the end around, the guard pulls.
That means you, Buttler.

911
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,644
I'm going to Dylan's
birthday party. Who's with me?

912
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,976
Yeah!

913
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,600
Hi... Oh.

914
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:17,110
Brazilian mud viper.
She gets one live rat a week.

915
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,884
<i>Hey, Dylan. Wanna play catch</i>
<i>with the football I got you?</i>

916
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:28,151
Uh, my nanny'd have to
check with my dad...

917
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:32,126
who'd have to check with my mom
who would say it was an
inappropriate use of free time.

918
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,493
Hmm. Sounds like a "yes" to me.
Go get it, Mike.

919
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,839
And, O'Neal, you gotta crack
the first guy that shows outside.

920
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:51,345
<i>Run, Billy.! Run.!</i>

921
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:05,155
Kids?

922
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,576
Get my kids.
I'll meet you at the house.

923
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,343
- Ready!
- Break!

924
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,859
Sarah Baker, off, now!

925
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:45,560
- No way!
- Don't make me come up there!

926
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:13,328
Oh, my God!
It's gonna blow!

927
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,074
- Aaaah!

928
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:33,115
It was my best birthday
ever, Coach.

929
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:35,912
Your children are never
playing with Dylan again!

930
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,681
- Sorry about your arm, Dylan.

931
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,245
- Hello, Shake.

932
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,917
Any idea what this could do
to my program? Don't speak. Listen.

933
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:47,121
I don't want the players
at your house, and I don't want
your kids in the department.

934
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:51,360
<i>- There he is.!</i>
- Coach! Coach! How will this
impact Saturday's game?

935
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:55,666
Coach, what do you have to say
to reports that you're simply
spreading yourself too thin?

936
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:59,697
- Is this child care or football?
- Sarah from Evanston,
you're on with Kate Baker.

937
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,073
<i>Mom, it's Sarah.</i>

938
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,772
Hi, Sarah.
Is everything okay?

939
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,680
- Come home immediately.
- I wanna talk to her!

940
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,480
- No! Guys!

941
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:13,681
<i>- I wanna talk to her.!</i>
- Guys, stop!

942
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,385
- Hello?

943
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,792
Now look what you did.

944
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,837
- Dad?
- Oh, Nora.

945
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:33,807
Thanks for coming. Thank you,
thank you. I appreciate it.

946
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:37,539
- You seemed kind of desperate on the phone.
- Yeah. They're... everywhere.

947
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,008
You guys?

948
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,331
- Hi.
- I just talked to the kids.

949
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,034
Yes, I know everything.
Dylan's in the hospital.

950
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:10,670
<i>Charlie's about to be expelled.</i>
<i>And Nora taking time off from</i>
<i>her first job to babysit?</i>

951
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:13,408
- Can we do this later, Kate?
- No, Tom.

952
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,781
You promised me that you would
let me know if you couldn't handle it.

953
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:20,413
I'm doing the best I can.
Please, let's talk later.

954
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,957
Bye.

955
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:31,092
- What's the matter?
- The book tour's over
for me. I'm going home.

956
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,537
<i>Get a move on, guys.</i>
<i>We gotta get dinner on the table.</i>

957
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:44,412
Hi. It's me.
Okay, I'm coming home.

958
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,641
Now, I know this
is gonna be a big strain.

959
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:50,207
<i>The publishing company arranged</i>
<i>for the</i> Oprah Winfrey Show
<i>to tape at our house tomorrow...</i>

960
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,221
<i>which is, you know, great, but</i>
<i>I'm really gonna need your help.</i>

961
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:57,123
<i>We're talking Bakers full force. Boys,</i>
<i>you clean up the outside, girls, the inside.</i>

962
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,252
<i>I want everybody</i>
<i>in fancy, nice, clean clothes.</i>

963
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:03,765
<i>And, Tom, if you could please supervise this</i>
<i>one last thing, I would really appreciate it.</i>

964
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,266
<i>- Okay? All right. Bye.</i>

965
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,895
Sounds like somebody
got his jimmy whipped.

966
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:14,734
Jimmy whipped!

967
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,312
Mommy!

968
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,650
Beans, you okay?

969
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:38,021
- Go get dressed, guys.

970
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,288
- Hello.

971
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:46,129
Oh, it's me. Yeah. My flight
was delayed. They lost my luggage.

972
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,328
I'm gettin' there
as soon as I can. Sorry.

973
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:51,771
Okay. Those are
for Oprah's people!

974
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,207
- Is the house clean?
- We're working on it, Kate.

975
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:58,735
- Okay. I'll see you when I see you.

976
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,907
Okay, guys, good job!
Go inside and get cleaned up.

977
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,920
Come on! Hustle up!
Hustle up! Let's go!

978
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,724
<i>Camera truck's here.!</i>

979
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:28,370
I need warm water!
Look out, Dad!

980
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,641
Don't make a mess
in the kitchen!

981
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,581
- Hello? Uh, Baker house?

982
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,641
- Yeah. You guys from <i>Oprah?</i>
- Yes, sir.

983
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,085
- She's really gonna be here?
- Any time now.

984
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:42,123
Okay, well, just, you know,
set up anywhere.

985
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,625
- Will do.
- Let's go, guys.

986
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:49,960
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Let's set up over here, guys.</i>

987
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,768
<i>- Knock much?</i>
- You got kicked off the team.

988
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,638
Well, look who decided
to be a parent!

989
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,337
Let's check
that attitude, Charlie.

990
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:07,280
I don't fit in this town, Dad.
I'm going back to Midland.

991
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:11,445
You are not dropping out of school,
and you are not walking out on this family.

992
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,454
What family?

993
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:17,481
Since we moved here, everybody's
been looking out for number one,
especially you and Mom.

994
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,460
Your mother and I are doing
what we think is best for everyone.

995
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,965
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You did not
take this coaching job for us.

996
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:28,093
You took this because you were a loser
in college while Shake was being a superstar.

997
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:32,607
If you want your shot at glory, if you wanna
have it all, you do what you gotta do.

998
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:36,110
But quit feeding us this line about being
a happier and stronger family.

999
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:40,478
This move was about you!
And you know what?

1000
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:45,680
I don't have to sit here and pay the price
for your life choices. I'm leaving.

1001
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,484
You're staying.

1002
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,618
Are you gonna make me?

1003
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:58,222
Charlie, I love you.

1004
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,895
I want you to have
the best life you can have.

1005
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,837
And that means you're
getting a diploma.

1006
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:11,139
When I graduate, I'm gone.

1007
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:20,382
<i>Hey, Charlie, am I looking</i>
<i>okay for national TV?</i>

1008
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:25,553
You know, you turned into
a jerk when we moved here!

1009
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:29,529
- Everybody turned into a jerk
when we moved here.

1010
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,704
Charlie?

1011
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,747
<i>Mom's home.!</i>

1012
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,785
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

1013
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:55,882
- Mommy! Never go away again!
- Hi.

1014
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,392
- Mom, listen up. Here's the sizzle.
- I missed you, honey.

1015
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:01,293
Okay, Dad is stressed to the point
of a total meltdown.

1016
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:04,059
Charlie's like a half a step away
from juvie, and Mark's...

1017
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,896
Okay. Oprah's coming.
We'll talk about it later. Here we go.

1018
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,870
- Whatever.
- I just wanna get everything ready.

1019
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:12,202
- What's the deal with Charlie?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?

1020
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:15,766
- I'm sorry. Hi.
- Hi. Charlie got kicked off the football team.

1021
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,244
- What?
- Don't worry. I'm handling it.

1022
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:25,718
Shake. President Gerhard.

1023
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,721
- Tom.
- Tom, we need a minute.

1024
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:32,419
- Please don't die, Beans.

1025
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:36,590
The university is prepared to make
an investment in the program...

1026
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,599
but we want some assurances.

1027
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:42,125
- What does that mean?
- We wanna know you're committed
to the football program.

1028
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:46,664

01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,267
<i>So what's it gonna be, Tom?</i>

1030
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:51,437
<i>Tom, didn't you pick up</i>
<i>my dry cleaning?</i>

1031
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:54,107
Yes, dear.
It's in the front closet.

1032
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:57,447
Well, I guess the wife
just answered our question.

1033
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,682
The wife's name
is Kate, Shake.

1034
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,958
What a wiener.

1035
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:10,423
<i>We want an answer by Monday,</i>
<i>Tom. This meeting's over.</i>

1036
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,911
I'm all right.

1037
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,383
I love you.

1038
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,148
I'm gonna go get ready.

1039
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:36,156
- Sorry, Dad.

1040
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:46,429
What's this?

1041
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,163
Hank slept over.
Do you have a problem with that?

1042
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:52,638
Yes, I have a problem with that!
This house is G-rated.

1043
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,677
Whoa, chief.
Look, Nora's a big girl.

1044
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:58,736
Now would be
an excellent time...

1045
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:02,682
for you to be
very, very quiet...

1046
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,685
chief.

1047
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,886
Now, get dressed
and get downstairs.

1048
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:12,026
Whoa.

1049
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:18,091
I just... I can't believe you let
things get this bad around here.

1050
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:20,259
<i>- I can't believe it.</i>
- What can I say?

1051
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:23,031
You didn't pick the perfect
moment to have a career.

1052
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,573
Oh, okay, yeah. I'm not even
gonna touch that hypocrisy.

1053
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,439
You told me to go to New York.
Mr. I Can Handle It.

1054
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,445
"Everything'll be okay.
Go, Kate!" Help me, would you?

1055
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:34,846
So you're telling me you didn't
want to go to New York?

1056
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,680
No. I want a lot of things.
So do you.

1057
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:41,348
- That's the problem.
- This isn't working.

1058
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:45,450
- Yeah. That's my point.
- I meant the zipper.

1059
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,634
Let's just get through
the next hour, okay?

1060
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,102
- Fine.
- Fine.

1061
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,574
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>
<i>I know it's been a difficult day...</i>

1062
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:04,874
but I need all of you, and I would appreciate
it if you could just put on happy faces.

1063
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,437
Everything's great.
We're a big, happy family.

1064
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,451
If you can remember the lines
I told you to say to Oprah.

1065
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,216
If you can't remember, don't say
anything. Big smiles. Let me see 'em.

1066
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,486
<i>Mom, Beans is dead.</i>

1067
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:19,823
Nobody cares
about your stupid frog, FedEx.

1068
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,295
Stop calling me that!

1069
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:26,926
<i>- Don't you dare call him that.!</i>

1070
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,802
<i>- All right.! Hey.!</i>
- Stop it! Stop it!

1071
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,240
What's the name
of this segment again?

1072
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,676
Uh, "One Big Happy Family."

1073
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:40,340
Okay, I'm calling
Oprah's people right now.

1074
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,680
All I'm saying is,
families are inevitable.

1075
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,277
It's like death or taxes.

1076
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,754
Does that mean
you don't want children?

1077
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,156
<i>- Leave him alone.!</i>
- Hello!

1078
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,956
Look at these...
They're monsters!

1079
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:58,864
- Honey, you can't want this.
That's why you're with me.

1080
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,971
<i>Nora.! Come on.!</i>
<i>We need you down here.!</i>

1081
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,269
<i>You're stepping on me.! Stop.!</i>

1082
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,333
<i>Nigel, get off</i>
<i>your brother's head.!</i>

1083
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,346
Get off me!
Nobody cares about me!

1084
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,076
- Nobody cares about me!
- Mark, what's going on?

1085
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,880
<i>- Mark.! Mark.!</i>
- What are you talking about?

1086
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:21,855
- I'm perfect! I've never done
anything like this before!
- No! None of that!

1087
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:26,019
- Hey! Hey!
- No, you do not want to come down here.

1088
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,892
No, it's the farthest thing
from a happy family.

1089
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,332
Why am I the only normal
person in the family?

1090
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,232
Feel free to sleep
on the couch.

1091
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,932
You read my mind.

1092
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:16,239
Daddy, are you and Mommy
gonna get a divorce?

1093
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:23,183
Come here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1094
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,185
Mark's gone.

1095
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:33,417
- Mark's gone.
- What?

1096
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,396
Hey, Dad.

1097
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:39,456
What I said before...
I was out of line.

1098
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,764
Forget it.

1099
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,772
You were right.

1100
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:51,336
- Mark!

1101
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:03,288
- Hello.

1102
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:06,122
Hey, Mark ran away.
Is he with you?

1103
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,924
No. We'll come
help you look.

1104
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:16,633
There's me! Oh.

1105
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,936
- Mark's missing.
- Oh.

1106
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:23,000
<i>Take it to the max. Tommy Max.</i>

1107
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,273
Let's go.

1108
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,747
I look great.

1109
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:30,785
Did you not hear me?
My brother is missing!

1110
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,286
No. Did you not hear me?
I'm on TV!

1111
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,862
What was that for?

1112
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,100
Oh. What do you want?

1113
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:50,331
My son Mark ran away.
He's not here, is he?

1114
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:53,602
I always knew one of your kids
would land on a milk carton.

1115
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,303
Twelve is just
too big a number.

1116
01:21:56,378 --> 01:22:00,314
- We'll help you look for him.
- It's-It's past Dylan's bedtime.

1117
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,283
We're gonna
look for him, Tina.

1118
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,114
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1119
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:10,079
Let the police handle it!
You'll never find him!

1120
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,889
Oh, we'll find him. Like you said,
12's a big number.

1121
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:17,898
- Mark! Mark!
<i>- Mark.!</i>

1122
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:20,799
He's about, about...
about that high.

1123
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:24,600
He's got red hair and glasses.
There's a photo, and you can keep that.

1124
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,608
No luck.
I've been everywhere.

1125
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,878
Thanks for looking.

1126
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,712
- Where's Hank?
- He's not gonna make the cut.

1127
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,217
I hope the family
isn't to blame.

1128
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:41,751
They're totally to blame.

1129
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,293
I'll have officers check
the train and bus stations.

1130
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:51,264
- He wouldn't get on a train or a bus.
- He might've.

1131
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:54,791
Those times when I ran away from Midland,
I was gonna go to Chicago.

1132
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:57,030
My favorite place in the world.

1133
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,702
Your favorite place in the world.

1134
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:58,327
You said we'd be happier.
You didn't keep your promise.

1135
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,528
I know. I'm sorry.

1136
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,250
<i>Mom.!</i>

1137
01:24:56,324 --> 01:25:00,055
Oh, honey! Oh!

1138
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:03,757
Oh, we missed you, sweetheart.

1139
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,960
Do that again, I'm going
to have to pound you.

1140
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:10,664
- But I thought I was FedEx.
- Your eccentricities and vision problems...

1141
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:15,175
<i>are genetic traits that could be attributed</i>
<i>to any number of the Baker ancestors.</i>

1142
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:19,009
Yeah. Without you, we wouldn't
be the 12 Bakers anymore.

1143
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,538
We'd be, like, 11.

1144
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:26,348
<i>I figured everybody hated me like Sarah</i>
<i>and Lorraine hate each other.</i>

1145
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,913
There are times when
I want to kill Sarah...

1146
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:34,257
but I'd kill for her
all the time.

1147
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:37,594
- Come here, cutie.

1148
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:51,443
Tom? You wanna say
something? A few words?

1149
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:53,572
Sure.

1150
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:57,545
Beans was a good frog.

1151
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:06,120
He was, uh, not like
a lot of the bad frogs...

1152
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:09,630
you hear about today,
all hopped up.

1153
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:14,031
- He was lovable. He was almost human.

1154
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:16,969
He was like, uh,
one of the family.

1155
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:21,202
<i>Except that, of course,</i>
<i>he was green and he ate flies.</i>

1156
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:25,440
But he was a hopper.

1157
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:29,950
He hipped and he hopped.

1158
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,780
He loved hip-hop.

1159
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:40,753
Mark, why don't you... I think
you should say something.

1160
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:45,162
For a long time, you were
the only person I could talk to.

1161
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,633
That's different now.

1162
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,000
But you're the one
who got me through.

1163
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:52,505
<i>Thanks.</i>

1164
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,345
I'm resigning after
the season, Shake.

1165
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:43,886
Giving up the dream, huh?

1166
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,290
Just going
with a different one.

1167
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:47,988
No regrets?

1168
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:50,929
If I screw up
raising my kids...

1169
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,990
nothing I achieve
will matter much.

1170
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,298
Thank you.

1171
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:02,199
We'll make an announcement
at the end of the week.

1172
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:10,612
Come on. Keep the assembly line
up here. We gotta get this done.

1173
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:13,654
- Where's Dad?
- He went to the game.

1174
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:16,246
Why didn't he
ask us to go?

1175
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:20,886
Because... he didn't want you to be there
on the day that he quits his job.

1176
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,556
- He's quitting his job?
- Mm-hmm.

1177
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:27,260
- What would we have to do
so he wouldn't quit?
- I'll give up clarinet lessons.

1178
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:31,999
- I'll go back to hand-me-downs.

1179
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:34,371
Okay, ease up.
Everybody listen.

1180
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:37,570
<i>Dad's a big boy, and</i>
<i>he makes his own decisions...</i>

1181
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:41,012
and he's doing this
because it's what he wants.

1182
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:44,711
In that case, I totally take back
what I said about the hand-me-downs.

1183
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:48,187
I thought so. Anybody else
wanna take back their offer?

1184
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:52,124
<i>Yeah, there we go.</i>

1185
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:24,776
<i>I guess you could say</i>
<i>that when Tom and I left Midland...</i>

1186
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:27,844
<i>we had a mess of theories</i>
<i>about how to raise children.</i>

1187
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,255
<i>We still have a mess</i>
<i>of children, but no theories.</i>

1188
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:36,687
<i>Sure, 12 is still our number.</i>

1189
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:42,835
<i>It's the number of months</i>
<i>my book was on the best-seller list.</i>

1190
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:47,739
<i>It's the number of job offers Tom turned</i>
<i>down before we found one close to home.</i>

1191
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,607
- Hike!

1192
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:59,683
<i>And each day, it's the number of times</i>
<i>I'm thankful there's such a thing as family.</i>

1193
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:04,210
What happened to you?

1194
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:06,480
Oh, my God!

1195
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:12,323
Save the eggs!

1196
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:20,030
Yeah, you got room for all your big
old family in that new apartment?

1197
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:22,501
<i>- You're on camera, Steve.</i>
- Sorry. I am.

1198
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:24,834
You idiot.

1199
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:28,865
Yeah, you got room in your
new apartment for that...

1200
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:30,968
Battle ax
of a wife of mine?

1201
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,979
You got...

1202
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,981
<i>Act angry, not grumpy.</i>

1203
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,347
- I really am grumpy.
<i>- Well, that's good.</i>

1204
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:39,352
Two times?

1205
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,445
<i>- Two times. Ready?</i>
- Then going outside?

1206
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:44,116
<i>Yeah. Actually, we're</i>
<i>almost done, so let's do it.</i>

1207
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:46,125
<i>On your mark, get set, go.!</i>

1208
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:48,718
I don't wanna move!
I don't wanna move!

1209
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:51,196
<i>Cut. Good job. Okay?</i>

1210
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:55,292
I listened...
I listened the "goodest."

1211
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:59,304
I don't wanna do it anymore.

1212
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:02,103
<i>- One more time.</i>
<i>- Last one and you're outta here.</i>

1213
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:06,440
- Cut! Cut! Cut!

1214
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,812
Somebody help me!
Help me!

1215
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:11,750
- Whoa!
- Just for the record, Mom...

1216
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:14,754
Be careful, pally.
Slow down on that stuff.

1217
01:33:14,822 --> 01:33:18,986
You're not gonna remember a damn thing
in school if you suck 'em back like I do.

1218
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:21,790
Now, on the end around
the guard pulls.

1219
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:25,093
That means you, Buttler.
Whoa.

1220
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:28,329
<i>- Cut.!</i>

1221
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,304
<i>- Action.!</i>
- Frankly, I'm concerned.

1222
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:34,102
I go around those kids,
they start beatin' on me.

1223
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:36,302
What if I get a black eye?

1224
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:40,643
Frankly, I'm concerned, honey.
The kids set me on fire, they beat me.

1225
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:43,912
They're abusive.

1226
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,613
This is how I get jobs,
right here!

1227
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:49,417
I'm sorry. I looked
at myself in the camera.

1228
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,754
I'm so... good-looking.
They set me on fire!

1229
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:54,818
- Sounds good to me.
- All the kids wrapped in duct tape.

1230
01:33:54,895 --> 01:33:57,728
Maybe we can just roll,
roll ourselves in duct tape...

1231
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:00,289
and then I can just
roll you across the floor.

1232
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,427
Together, maybe.

1233
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:10,043
Ow!

1234
01:34:15,575 --> 01:34:45,043
