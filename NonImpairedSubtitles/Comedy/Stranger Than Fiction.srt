<i>This is a story about a man</i>
<i>named Harold Crick.</i>

1
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,628
<i>And his wristwatch.</i>

2
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,897
<i>Harold Crick was a man of infinite</i>
<i>numbers...</i>

3
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,767
<i>... endless calculations</i>
<i>and remarkably few words.</i>

4
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,842
<i>And his wristwatch said even less.</i>

5
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,412
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

6
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:35,054
<i>... Harold would brush</i>
<i>each of his 32 teeth 76 times.</i>

7
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,181
<i>Thirty-eight times back and forth.</i>

8
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,058
<i>Thirty-eight times up and down.</i>

9
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,124
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

10
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,393
<i>... Harold would tie his tie in a single</i>
<i>Windsor knot instead of the double...</i>

11
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,629
<i>... thereby saving up to 43 seconds.</i>

12
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,142
<i>His wristwatch thought the single</i>
<i>Windsor made his neck look fat...</i>

13
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,937
<i>... but said nothing.</i>

14
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,647
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

15
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,483
<i>... Harold would run at a rate of nearly</i>
<i>57 steps per block for six blocks...</i>

16
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,024
<i>... barely catching</i>
<i>the 8: 17 Kronecker bus.</i>

17
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,289
<i>His wristwatch would delight...</i>

18
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,399
<i>... in the feeling of the crisp wind</i>
<i>rushing over its face.</i>

19
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,010
<i>And every weekday, for 12 years...</i>

20
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,579
<i>... Harold would review 7. 134</i>
<i>tax files...</i>

21
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,650
<i>... as a senior agent</i>
<i>for the Internal Revenue Service.</i>

22
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,815
Regs section 1.469-2 (B) (i), Diane.
Thanks.

23
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,389
Good morning. IRS.

24
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,157
Harold, 89 times 1417?

25
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,024
126,113.

26
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,200
That adds up.

27
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,899
O<i>nly taking a 45. 7-minute</i>
<i>lunch break...</i>

28
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,305
<i>... and a 4.3- Minute coffee break...</i>

29
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,603
<i>... timed precisely by his wristwatch.</i>

30
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,206
Oh, great.

31
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,712
Yeah, we'll go to Mullen's or we'II...

32
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,447
<i>Beyond that,</i>
<i>Harold lived a life of solitude.</i>

33
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,720
<i>He would walk home alone.</i>

34
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,061
<i>He would eat alone.</i>

35
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,438
<i>And at precisely 11: 13 every night...</i>

36
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,405
<i>... Harold would go to bed alone...</i>

37
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,411
<i>... placing his wristwatch to rest</i>
<i>on the nightstand beside him.</i>

38
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,576
<i>That was, of course,</i>
<i>before Wednesday.</i>

39
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:54,421
O<i>n Wednesday, Harold's wristwatch</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

40
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,594
Oh, my God, you got it?

41
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,928
I got it.

42
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,835
I got it.

43
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,019
<i>If one had asked Harold,</i>
<i>he would have said...</i>

44
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,021
<i>... that this particular Wednesday was</i>
<i>exactly like all the Wednesdays prior.</i>

45
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,352
<i>And he began it the same way he...</i>

46
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,369
<i>And he began it the same way</i>
<i>he always did.</i>

47
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,703
Hello?

48
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,586
<i>He began it the same way</i>
<i>he always did.</i>

49
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,419
<i>When others' minds would...</i>

50
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,924
Hello? Is someone there?

51
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,966
<i>When others' minds would fantasize</i>
<i>about their upcoming day...</i>

52
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,269
<i>... or even try to grip onto</i>
<i>the final moments of their dreams...</i>

53
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,312
<i>... Harold just counted brushstrokes.</i>

54
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,278
All right, who just said,
"Harold just counted brushstrokes"?

55
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,785
And how do you know I'm counting
brushstrokes?

56
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,855
Hello?

57
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,260
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,</i>
<i>modest...</i>

58
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,892
<i>It was remarkable h...</i>

59
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,333
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,</i>
<i>modest elements of Harold's life...</i>

60
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,705
<i>... so often taken for granted...</i>

61
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:59,317
<i>... would become the catalyst</i>
<i>for an entirely new life.</i>

62
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,081
<i>Harold ran for the bus...</i>

63
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,587
<i>... his stiff leather shoes</i>
<i>making a terrible squeaking sound...</i>

64
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,488
<i>... as they flexed against the asphalt.</i>

65
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,494
<i>And though this was</i>
<i>an extraordinary day...</i>

66
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,537
<i>... a day to be remembered</i>
<i>for the rest of Harold's life...</i>

67
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,505
<i>... Harold just thought</i>
<i>it was a Wednesday.</i>

68
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,005
I'm sorry, did you hear that?

69
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,080
The voice. Did you hear it?
"Harold thought it was a Wednesday"?

70
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,715
Don't worry, it is Wednesday.

71
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,953
No, no, did you hear it? "Harold
just thought it was a Wednesday"?

72
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,419
- Who's Harold?
- I'm Harold.

73
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,223
Harold, it's okay, it's Wednesday.

74
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,897
No, no, I...

75
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,058
Never mind.

76
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,069
<i>Harold couldn't concentrate</i>
<i>on his work.</i>

77
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,238
Excuse me, Harold?

78
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,374
<i>His thoughts were scattered.</i>
<i>His mind elsewhere.</i>

79
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,907
Sorry.

80
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,939
Someone here should be able to fix...
Hold on a second.

81
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,412
Hey, Harold. What's 67 times 453?

82
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,417
<i>When a coworker asked</i>
<i>the product of 67 and 453...</i>

83
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,816
You know what?
I can't think while you're talking.

84
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,513
<i>... he drew a blank.</i>

85
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,692
- What?
- What?

86
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:18,022
<i>- Harold quickly answered, "30,351."</i>
- What? Oh, nothing. 30,351.

87
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,530
<i>Despite the answer</i>
<i>really being 31,305.</i>

88
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:26,330
Wait, wait, wait, 31,305. Sorry.

89
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,374
Dude, I just totally caught
some insurance adjuster...

90
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,240
...claiming his jet ski
as a work vehicle.

91
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,481
I'll tell you, it is a shame...

92
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,619
...that they don't give out
an auditor of the year award.

93
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,254
Dude?

94
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,591
You okay?

95
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,821
Dave, I'm being followed.

96
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,035
How are you being followed?
You're not moving.

97
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,135
- It's by a voice.
- What?

98
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,138
I'm being followed
by a woman's voice.

99
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,613
Okay.

100
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,314
What is she saying?

101
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,987
She's narrating.

102
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,627
Harold, you're staring at boxes,
what is she narrating?

103
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,126
No, no, no. I had to stop filing.

104
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,162
Watch. Watch. Listen. Listen.

105
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,633
<i>The sound the paper made</i>
<i>against the folder...</i>

106
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:36,103
<i>... had the same tone</i>
<i>as a wave scraping against sand.</i>

107
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,968
<i>And when Harold thought about it...</i>

108
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,408
<i>... he listened to enough waves</i>
<i>every day...</i>

109
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:46,483
<i>... to constitute what he imagined</i>
<i>to be a deep and endless ocean.</i>

110
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,219
Did you hear that?

111
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,821
You mean you filing?

112
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,615
No, no, no, the voice.

113
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,954
No.

114
00:09:56,395 --> 00:10:00,798
Frightening part is sometimes I do
imagine a deep and endless ocean.

115
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,131
What ocean?

116
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,328
The one made by the sound...
Forget it.

117
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,507
New audits. Have a good day.

118
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,005
Thank you.

119
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:17,806
All right, we got a baker
and a securities trader.

120
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,548
Maybe you should take the baker.

121
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,852
- Okay?
- Okay.

122
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,691
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

123
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,928
- You miscreant.
- I understand.

124
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,569
Oh, get bent, taxman!

125
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,836
- Taxman!
- Taxman!

126
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,878
Taxman!

127
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,551
Go home!

128
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,415
Listen, is there somewhere else
we could talk about this?

129
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,420
No. We're gonna talk about this
right here.

130
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:08,256
Okay. It says, the file, that you only
paid part of your taxes for last year.

131
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,527
- That's right.
- Looks like only 78 percent.

132
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,398
Yep.

133
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,772
So you did it on purpose?

134
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,237
Yep.

135
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,274
So you must have been
expecting an audit?

136
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,042
I was expecting a fine...

137
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,818
...or a sharp reprimand.

138
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,119
A reprimand? This isn't
boarding school, Ms. Pascal.

139
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,951
You stole from the government.

140
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:40,029
No, I didn't steal from the government.
I just didn't pay you entirely.

141
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,133
Ms. Pascal, you can't just
not pay your taxes.

142
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,901
Yes, I can.

143
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,902
You can if you wanna get audited.

144
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,666
Only if I recognize your right
to audit me, Mr. Crick.

145
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,577
Ms. Pascal, I'm right here
auditing you.

146
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,038
Now I have to go over
your past three years...

147
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,149
...to make sure
that's all you haven't paid.

148
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,778
Fine.

149
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,180
Actually, you know, it's not fine.

150
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,293
Listen, I'm a big supporter
of fixing potholes...

151
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,828
...and erecting swing sets
and building shelters.

152
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,263
I am more than happy
to pay those taxes.

153
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,903
I'm just not such a big fan
of the percentage...

154
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,702
...that the government uses
for national defense...

155
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,471
...corporate bailouts
and campaign discretionary funds.

156
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,208
So I didn't pay those taxes.

157
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,045
I think, actually...

158
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,950
...I sent a letter to that effect
with my return.

159
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,326
Would it be the letter that begins,
"Dear Imperialist Swine"?

160
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,756
Yes.

161
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:49,463
Ms. Pascal, what you're describing
is anarchy. Are you an anarchist?

162
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,066
- You mean am I a member of...?
- An anarchist group, yes.

163
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,405
Anarchists have a group?

164
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,044
I believe so. Sure.

165
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,741
They assemble?

166
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,246
I don't know.

167
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,986
Wouldn't that completely
defeat the purpose?

168
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,485
<i>It was difficult for Harold to imagine</i>
<i>Ms. Pascal as a revolutionary.</i>

169
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,921
- Not now.
<i>- Her thin arms...</i>

170
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,153
- What?
<i>...hoisting protest signs.</i>

171
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,888
<i>- Her long shapely legs...</i>
- Nothing.

172
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,727
<i>... dashing from tear gas.</i>

173
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,333
<i>Harold wasn't prone to fantasies...</i>

174
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,133
<i>... and so he tried his best</i>
<i>to remain professional.</i>

175
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,707
<i>But, of course, failed.</i>

176
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,375
<i>He couldn't help but imagine</i>
<i>Ms. Pascal...</i>

177
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,574
<i>... stroking the side of his face</i>
<i>with the soft blade of her finger.</i>

178
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,389
<i>He couldn't help but imagine her</i>
<i>immersed in a tub...</i>

179
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,990
<i>... shaving her legs.</i>

180
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,856
<i>And he couldn't help</i>
<i>but imagine her naked...</i>

181
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,554
<i>...stretched across his bed.</i>
- Mr. Crick?

182
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,036
- Mr. Crick.
- Yes, what is it?

183
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,934
You're staring at my tits.

184
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:07,200
I wa...? I don't think I was.
I don't think I would do that.

185
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,040
If I was, I can assure you...

186
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,479
...it was only as a representative
of the United States government.

187
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:18,953
Sorry, I'm just having issues today.
So I'll be back on Tuesday.

188
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,960
<i>Harold suddenly found himself</i>
<i>beleaguered and exasperated...</i>

189
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,565
<i>...outside the bakery...</i>
- Shut up!

190
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,735
<i>... cursing the heavens in futility.</i>

191
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,166
No, I'm not, I'm cursing you,
you stupid voice!

192
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,307
So shut up and leave me alone!

193
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,263
Hey, watch it!

194
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,591
<i>Excuse me.</i>

195
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,270
Excuse me.

196
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,107
Are you Miss Eiffel?

197
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,805
- Yes.
- Excellent.

198
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,538
May I ask what you're doing?

199
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,641
Research.

200
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,717
- Oh, am I interrupting?
- Yes.

201
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,822
I'm sorry. I'm Penny Escher.

202
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,889
I'm the assistant
your publishers hired.

203
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,190
- The spy.
- The assistant.

204
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,831
I provide the same services
as a secretary.

205
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,063
I don't need a secretary.

206
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,828
Then I will have to find some
other way of occupying my time.

207
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,666
Like watching me like a vulture...

208
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,604
...because the publishers
think I have writer's block, right?

209
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,410
Do you have writer's block?

210
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,517
Are these pages?

211
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,187
They're letters. To me.

212
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,789
- Are you writing back?
- I don't respond to letters.

213
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,053
And I suppose you smoked
all these cigarettes?

214
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,792
No, they came pre-smoked.

215
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,732
Yeah, they said you were funny.

216
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,434
What do you think about
leaping off a building?

217
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,305
I don't think about
leaping off buildings.

218
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,308
- Yes, you do.
- No. I try to think of nice things.

219
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,447
Everyone thinks about
leaping off buildings.

220
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,311
Well, I certainly don't think about
leaping off of a building.

221
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,256
They say...

222
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,467
I read this in this
fantastically depressing book.

223
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,129
- That when you jump
from a building...

224
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,673
...it's rarely the impact
that actually kills you.

225
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,237
Well, I'm sure it doesn't help.

226
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,606
There's a photograph
in the book called <i>The Leaper.</i>

227
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,341
It's old, but it's beautiful.

228
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,019
From above the corpse of a woman
who'd just leapt to her death.

229
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,283
There's blood around her head,
like a halo...

230
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,622
...and her leg's buckled underneath,
her arm's snapped like a twig...

231
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,523
...but her face is so serene...

232
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,128
...so at peace.

233
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,538
And I think it's because
when she died...

234
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,141
...she could feel the wind
against her face.

235
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,714
I don't know how to kill Harold Crick.
That's why they sent you.

236
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,255
Yes, to help you.

237
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,957
How are you gonna help me?

238
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,285
You, who never thinks
of leaping off buildings?

239
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,088
What great inspiration
will you bestow on me?

240
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,595
I'll tell you, the quaint ideas
you've gathered...

241
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,824
...in your adorable career
as an "assistant"...

242
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,868
...are to no avail
when faced with killing a man.

243
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,335
I understand.

244
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,370
Do you? I can't just...

245
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,580
As much as I would like to...

246
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,516
...I cannot simply throw
Harold Crick off a building.

247
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:55,428
Miss Eiffel. Kay. I've been
an author's assistant for 11 years.

248
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,398
I've helped more than 20 authors
complete more than 35 books...

249
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,663
...and I've never missed the deadline.

250
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,865
And I have never gone back to the
publisher to ask for more time.

251
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,512
Now, I will be available to you
every minute of every day...

252
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,342
...until the final punctuation
is embedded on the very last page.

253
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,919
I do not like loud music.
I do not abide narcotics.

254
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:21,420
And I will gladly and quietly
help you kill Harold Crick.

255
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,704
I had a very interesting little convo
with someone in your section.

256
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,101
Yeah?

257
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,240
They said you were feeling
a little wibbly-wobbly.

258
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,441
Catch a little cubicle fever?

259
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,952
Oh, I don't know. I think I'm okay.

260
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:53,920
Harold, a tree doesn't think
it's a tree...

261
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,318
...it is a tree.

262
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,626
<i>Why was Harold talking to this man?</i>

263
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>This man was an idiot.</i>

264
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:08,296
<i>This man used words like</i>
<i>"wibbly-wobbly" and "convo."</i>

265
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,902
<i>And explained that trees were trees.</i>

266
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,173
O<i>f course trees were trees.</i>

267
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,108
<i>Harold knew trees were trees.</i>

268
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,942
I am going to believe you, Harold.

269
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,584
<i>What Harold didn't know</i>
<i>was why he couldn't shake...</i>

270
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,346
<i>... the smell of brownies</i>
<i>from his senses.</i>

271
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,015
<i>Why Ms. Pascal had made</i>
<i>his fingertips quiver and lips go numb.</i>

272
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,893
Harold?

273
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,425
Yes? Sorry.

274
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,195
What's going on, Harold?

275
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,967
Well...

276
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,503
Nothing. Everything's fine.

277
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,749
Listen, according to your records...

278
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,614
...you haven't taken vacation
in a few years now.

279
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,950
Let's say you take a little break.

280
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,925
Use some of that vaca time.

281
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,896
Yeah. I'll think about it.

282
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,602
Harold.

283
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,341
I'm not really supposed to do this,
but...

284
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,156
<i>Harold assumed his watch</i>
<i>was simply on the fritz...</i>

285
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,167
<i>... and never even considered that it</i>
<i>might be trying to tell him something.</i>

286
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,167
<i>In fact, Harold had never once</i>
<i>paid attention to his watch...</i>

287
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,242
<i>... other than to find out the time.</i>

288
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,712
<i>And, honestly,</i>
<i>it drove his watch crazy.</i>

289
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,517
<i>And so, on this particular</i>
<i>Wednesday evening...</i>

290
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,087
<i>... as Harold waited for the bus,</i>
<i>his watch suddenly...</i>

291
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,789
<i>... stopped.</i>

292
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,291
Sorry, does anyone have the time?

293
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,461
- Yeah, I got 6:18.
- Thanks.

294
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:21,765
<i>Thus Harold's watch thrust him</i>
<i>into the immitigable path of fate.</i>

295
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:26,239
<i>Little did he know that this simple,</i>
<i>seemingly innocuous act...</i>

296
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,243
<i>... would result in his imminent death.</i>

297
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,708
What? What?

298
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,908
Hey! Hello?

299
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,785
What?

300
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,750
Why?

301
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,151
Why my death?

302
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,791
Hello!

303
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,486
Excuse me!

304
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,658
When?

305
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,357
How imminent?

306
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,894
Okay, where are you?

307
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:03,441
"Harold would brush his 32 teeth
72 times."

308
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,510
Why won't you say anything?
I heard you.

309
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,314
"That would result
in his imminent death."

310
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,753
I heard you!

311
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,085
Come on, you stupid voice.

312
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,853
"Harold frantically grabbed his lamp.

313
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,290
Harold, incensed, shook the hell
out of it for no apparent reason!

314
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,165
And smashed it on the ground,
kicking it repeatedly!

315
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,774
Harold took his Kleenex box,
threw it across the room...

316
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,604
...then stormed the closet!"

317
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,373
Come on. Say something.

318
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,145
Something. Say something!

319
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,380
Say something!

320
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,164
"Harold, distraught..."

321
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,559
God.

322
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,131
"Harold, distraught..."

323
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,734
"Harold..."

324
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:15,114
<i>I'm afraid what you're describing</i>
<i>is schizophrenia.</i>

325
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:22,824
No. No. It's not schizophrenia.
It's just a voice in my head.

326
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,691
I mean, the voice isn't telling me
to do anything.

327
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,389
It's telling me what I've already done.

328
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,601
Accurately
and with a better vocabulary.

329
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,407
Mr. Crick, you have a voice
speaking to you.

330
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,003
No, not to me, about me.

331
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:45,416
I'm somehow involved
in some sort of story.

332
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,377
Like I'm a character in my own life.

333
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,720
But the problem is
that the voice comes and goes.

334
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,152
Like there are other parts of the story
not being told to me...

335
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,922
...and I need to find out what those
other parts are before it's too late.

336
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,128
Before the story concludes
with your death.

337
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,700
Yes.

338
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,972
Mr. Crick, I hate to sound
like a broken record...

339
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,471
...but that's schizophrenia.

340
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:16,507
You don't sound like a broken record,
but it's just not schizophrenia.

341
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,415
What if what I said was true?

342
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:25,886
Hypothetically speaking,
if I was part of a story, a narrative...

343
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,959
...even if it was only in my mind...

344
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,887
...what would you suggest that I do?

345
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,925
I would suggest
you take prescribed medication.

346
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,896
Other than that.

347
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,004
I don't know.

348
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,701
I suppose I would send you to see
someone who knows about literature.

349
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,207
Okay.

350
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,175
Yeah. That's a good idea.

351
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,614
Thank you.

352
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,848
So you're the gentleman
who called me about the narrator.

353
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,719
- Yes.
- This narrator says you're gonna die.

354
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,053
Yes.

355
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,719
- How long has it given you to live?
- I don't know.

356
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,263
Dramatic irony.
It'll fuck you every time.

357
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,260
- So you crazy or what?
- Well...

358
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,496
Are you allowed to say that
to crazy people?

359
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,834
- I don't know.
- Oh, well. How many stairs...

360
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,341
...in the hallway out there?
- What?

361
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,809
You were counting them
as we walked, weren't you?

362
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,208
No.

363
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,111
Of course.
What bank do you work at?

364
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,479
No bank. IRS agent.

365
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,212
- Married?
- No.

366
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,446
Ever?

367
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,591
Engaged to an auditor.
She left me for an actuary.

368
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,559
- How heartbreaking. Live alone?
- Yes.

369
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,163
- Any pets?
- No.

370
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,403
- Friends?
- No. Well, Dave at work.

371
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,803
I see. The narrator,
exactly what does he sound like?

372
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,341
It's a woman.

373
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,876
A woman.

374
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,208
- Is it a familiar woman?
- No.

375
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,111
Someone you know?

376
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,180
No.

377
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,015
Did you have enough time
to count the tiles in the bathroom?

378
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,558
I wasn't counting the tiles.

379
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,757
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

380
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,429
- Sure?
- Yes.

381
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,066
So this woman, the voice,
told you you're gonna die?

382
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,497
She didn't tell me.
She doesn't know I can hear her.

383
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,500
- But she said it.
- Yes.

384
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:21,933
And you believed her.

385
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,571
She's been right
about a few other things.

386
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,337
- Such as?
- How I felt about work.

387
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,014
- You dislike your work?
- Yes.

388
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,245
Well, not the most insightful voice
in the world, is it?

389
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,751
First thing on a list
of what Americans hate: Work.

390
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,618
Second, traffic. Third, missing socks.
See what I'm saying?

391
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,792
Sort of.

392
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,984
I told you you were gonna die,
you believe me?

393
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,526
- No.
- Why?

394
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,095
I don't know you.

395
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,357
- But you don't know this narrator.
- Well...

396
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:55,197
- Okay, Mr. Crick, I can't help you.
- Why?

397
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,467
Well, I'm not an expert in crazy,
I'm an expert in literature theory.

398
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,111
And I gotta tell you, thus far...

399
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,213
...there doesn't seem to be a single
literary thing about you.

400
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,715
I don't doubt you hear a voice,
but it couldn't possibly be a narrator...

401
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,945
...because, frankly, there doesn't seem
to be much to narrate.

402
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,590
Beside that, this semester
I'm teaching five courses.

403
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,487
I'm mentoring
two doctoral candidates...

404
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,662
...and I'm the faculty lifeguard
at the pool.

405
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,525
- I just thought you could possibly...
- Perhaps you should keep a journal.

406
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,703
Write down what she said
or something.

407
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,634
That's all I can suggest.

408
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,236
I can barely remember it all.
I just remember:

409
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:37,939
"Little did he know that this simple,
seemingly innocuous act...

410
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,617
...would lead to his imminent death."

411
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,686
- What?
- "Little did he know that this..."

412
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,652
- Did you say, "little did he know"?
- Yes.

413
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,993
I've written papers
on "little did he know."

414
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,657
I used to teach a class
based on "little did he know."

415
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,730
I mean, I once gave an entire seminar
on "little did he know."

416
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,769
Son of a bitch, Harold.

417
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,640
"Little did he know" means there's
something he doesn't know...

418
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,177
...that means there's something
you don't know. Did you know that?

419
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,016
- I want you to come back Friday.
- Okay.

420
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,448
No, "imminent,"
you could be dead by Friday.

421
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:19,680
Come back tomorrow at 9:45.

422
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,189
Ten seconds ago
you said you wouldn't help me.

423
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,623
It's been a very revealing 10 seconds,
Harold.

424
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,068
<i>Harold was deep in thought.</i>

425
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,731
<i>For a few, brief moments, from</i>
<i>Born Boulevard to Euclid Avenue...</i>

426
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,410
<i>... all the calculations</i>
<i>and all the rules...</i>

427
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,912
<i>... and all the precision of Harold's life</i>
<i>just faded away.</i>

428
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,917
<i>How perfect then</i>
<i>that in this space...</i>

429
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,022
<i>... Ana Pascal would appear.</i>

430
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,485
Ms. Pascal.

431
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,991
Ms. Pascal, it's Harold Crick
from the IRS.

432
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,665
Excuse me.

433
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,633
- Hi.
- Hi.

434
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,603
- Would you like a seat?
- Nope.

435
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,834
There's 11 open ones.

436
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,773
I don't care.

437
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,742
Sorry about that.

438
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,962
How are you?

439
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,795
I'm lousy. I'm being audited.

440
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,396
Of course.

441
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,634
By a real creep too.

442
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,405
I think I owe you an apology.

443
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,872
- Really?
- IRS agents...

444
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,485
...we're given rigorous aptitude tests
before we can work.

445
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:01,556
Unfortunately for you, we aren't tested
on tact or good manners...

446
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,986
...so I apologize.

447
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,990
I ogled you.

448
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,166
Sorry.

449
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,034
Okay, apology accepted.

450
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,807
But only because you stammered.

451
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,953
So you're a frequenter of the
metropolitan transit authority too?

452
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,256
No. I'm just late.

453
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,491
Big flag-burning to get to?

454
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,188
Actually...

455
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:46,793
...it's my weekly evil-conspiracy
and needlepoint group.

456
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,766
You wanna come?

457
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,443
I left my thimbles and socialist
reading material at home.

458
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,680
So...

459
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,280
<i>Harold nervously made small talk.</i>

460
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,756
You have very straight teeth.

461
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,620
<i>Very small talk.</i>

462
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,864
Thanks. They're real.

463
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,398
<i>Harold quickly calculated the odds</i>
<i>of making an ass of himself...</i>

464
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:21,436
<i>... in ratio to the amount of time</i>
<i>he stayed to chat.</i>

465
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,034
This is my stop. I should go.

466
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,578
<i>- He was elated and surprised...</i>
- See you soon.

467
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,774
<i>... by his somewhat flirtatious</i>
<i>encounter with Ms. Pascal.</i>

468
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,254
<i>So elated that he exited</i>
<i>the Transit Authority bus...</i>

469
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,858
<i>... a good 27 blocks too early</i>
<i>and would now have to walk.</i>

470
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,212
<i>- "You ain't down yet."</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

471
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:07,942
<i>Tell us, what is</i> You Ain't Got
Nothin' On Me <i>about, Emmett Cole?</i>

472
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,710
<i>What does this mean?</i>

473
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:14,756
<i>Well, it's about being around</i>
<i>in the world, doing different things...</i>

474
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,257
<i>...doing what you wanna do...</i>
- Come in.

475
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,391
Mr. Crick. Come in, come in. Please.

476
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,595
How are you?

477
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,534
I'm fine, actually.

478
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,572
You can turn that off.

479
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,601
Looks like our narrator
hasn't killed you quite yet.

480
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:38,077
- No, not yet.
- Good, great. Have a seat.

481
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,807
- Count the stairs outside?
- No.

482
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,988
Course not. I've devised a test...

483
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,656
How exciting is that?
- Of 23 questions...

484
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,419
...which I think might help uncover
more truths about this narrator.

485
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,459
- Now, Howard...
- Harold.

486
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,497
Harold. These may seem silly,
but your candor is paramount.

487
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,191
Okay.

488
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,068
So.

489
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:06,175
We know it's a woman's voice,
the story involves your death...

490
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,403
...it's modern, it's in English.

491
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,412
I'm assuming the author
has a cursory knowledge of the city.

492
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,552
- Sure.
- Okay, good.

493
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,985
Question one:

494
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,682
"Has anyone recently left
any gifts outside your home?"

495
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,452
Anything? Gum? Money?

496
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,789
- A large wooden horse?
- I'm sorry?

497
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,989
- Just answer the question.
- No.

498
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,828
"Do you find yourself inclined
to solve murder mysteries...

499
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:35,437
...in large, luxurious homes
to which...?" Let me finish.

500
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,131
"To which you may or may not
have been invited?"

501
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,536
No. No, no, no.

502
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,770
All right. On a scale of one to 10...

503
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,507
...what would you consider the
likelihood you might be assassinated?

504
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,052
Assassinated?

505
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,517
One being very unlikely, 10 being
expecting it around every corner.

506
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,120
- I have no idea...
- Okay. Let me rephrase.

507
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,951
Are you the king of anything?

508
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,054
- Like what?
- Anything.

509
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,562
King of the lanes
at the local bowling alley.

510
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,166
"King of the lanes"?

511
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:08,236
- King of the lanes. King of the trolls.
- "King of the trolls"?

512
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,739
Yes. A clandestine land
found underneath your floorboards.

513
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,241
- Anything.
- No.

514
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,504
No. That's ridiculous.

515
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,808
Agreed. But let's start with ridiculous
and move backwards.

516
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,386
Now, was any part of you at one time
part of something else?

517
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,749
Like do I have someone else's arms?

518
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,983
Well, is it possible at one time
that you were made of stone...

519
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,093
...wood, lye, varied corpse parts...

520
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,661
...or earth made holy
by rabbinical elders?

521
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,562
No. Look... I'm sorry. What do these
questions have to do with anything?

522
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,895
The only way to find out
what story you're in...

523
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,095
...is to determine what stories
you're not in.

524
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,571
Odd as it may seem, I've just ruled out
half of Greek literature...

525
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,869
...seven fairy tales,
10 Chinese fables...

526
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,014
...and determined conclusively
that you are not King Hamlet...

527
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,206
...Scout Finch, Miss Marple...

528
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:57,080
...Frankenstein's monster,
or a golem.

529
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,251
Aren't you relieved to know
you're not a golem?

530
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,629
Yes, I am relieved to know
that I am not a golem.

531
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,800
Good.

532
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,434
Do you have magical powers?

533
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,271
May I ask what we're doing out here?

534
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,005
- We're imagining car wrecks.
- I see.

535
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,614
And we can't imagine
car wrecks inside?

536
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,343
No.

537
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,418
Did you know
that 41 percent of accidents...

538
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,115
...occur in times
of inclement weather?

539
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,591
So do 90 percent
of pneumonia cases.

540
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:16,699
Really? Pneumonia.
That's an interesting way to die.

541
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,263
But how would Harold
catch pneumonia?

542
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,462
Have you written
anything new today?

543
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:23,935
No.

544
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,939
Did you read the poems I suggested,
or make a list of words...

545
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,112
...buy new typing paper, anything?

546
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,871
No, none of it.

547
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,013
Sitting in the rain won't write books.

548
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:38,484
Well, that illustrates exactly how much
you know about writing books.

549
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,790
What's this?

550
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,730
It's literature on the nicotine patch.

551
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,299
I don't need a nicotine patch, Penny.
I smoke cigarettes.

552
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,601
Well, it may help.

553
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,935
May help? Help what?

554
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,312
Help what, Penny?
Help write a novel?

555
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,744
May help save your life.

556
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,517
I'm not in the business of saving lives.

557
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,314
In fact, just the opposite.

558
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,487
- "What's your favorite word?"
- Integer.

559
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,220
Good, good, good.

560
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,558
"Do you aspire to anything?"

561
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,461
- No.
- Conquer Russia?

562
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,231
- Win a whistling contest?
- No.

563
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,308
Harold, you must
have some ambition.

564
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,706
- I don't think so.
- Some underlying dream. Think.

565
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,474
Well...

566
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,248
...I've always wanted my life
to be more musical.

567
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,424
- Like <i>West Side Story?</i>
- No.

568
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,725
- Like...
- What?

569
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:55,365
Well, I've always wanted to learn
to play the guitar.

570
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,462
Okay.

571
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,273
The last thing
to determine conclusively...

572
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,965
...is whether you're in a comedy
or a tragedy.

573
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,508
To quote Italo Calvino:

574
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,977
"The ultimate meaning
to which all stories refer has two faces:

575
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,049
The continuity of life,
the inevitability of death."

576
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,386
Tragedy, you die.
Comedy, you get hitched.

577
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,161
Most comic heroes
fall in love with people...

578
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,159
...introduced after the story
has begun.

579
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,992
Usually people
who hate the hero initially.

580
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,000
Although I can't imagine anyone
hating you, Harold.

581
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,004
Professor Hilbert, I'm an IRS agent.

582
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,569
Everyone hates me.

583
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,204
Right, right. Good.

584
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,677
Have you met anyone recently
who might loathe the very core of you?

585
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:49,116
I just started auditing a woman
who told me to get bent.

586
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,782
Well, that sounds like a comedy.

587
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,322
Try to develop that.

588
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,152
Four of these?

589
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,296
You know, I didn't get my honey,
honey.

590
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:04,025
Lulu, can you refill the honey
for Larry? Quarters also?

591
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,827
That's my good boy.

592
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,970
I'm adding some acorns.

593
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,838
Mr. Crick.

594
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,411
You're here early.
Must have a lot of people to extort.

595
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,477
No. No, just you.

596
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,646
- Twig tea and banana bread.
- Yes, ma'am.

597
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,309
Actually, it should only take the day to
make sure 22 percent is all you owe.

598
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,253
Well, I won't be paying no matter
the percentage, Mr. Crick.

599
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:32,327
No, I know. But the percent
determines how big your cell is.

600
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,630
You know, you can call me Harold.

601
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,001
Yeah, I know. But I don't want to.

602
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,404
This is for Ramona, honey.

603
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,307
- Oh, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

604
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,916
What is that?
What are you marking?

605
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,309
Oh, this is nothing.

606
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,648
Why don't we start
with your backup documents...

607
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,325
...and the receipts
for the past three years.

608
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,016
Sure.

609
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,897
What's this?

610
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,399
- My files.
- What?

611
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,098
My tax files.

612
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,500
You keep your files like this?

613
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,510
No, actually I'm quite fastidious.

614
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,242
I put them in this box
just to screw with you.

615
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,132
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

616
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,932
So how was it? Aruba.

617
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,438
Ms. Pascal? Can I just ask you
a question about this receipt?

618
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,510
- It was fantastic.
- Just wondering if this nine is a seven.

619
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:58,944
- And what did you do?
- I got a beautiful tan.

620
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:03,110
- I'm just gonna guess it's a seven.
- I mean, I feel stress-free.

621
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,087
Do you need help with that?

622
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,320
- Walk to heaven. I see the president.

623
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,692
- It's the taxman. Hello, Mr. Taxman.
- Yeah.

624
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,367
- You can call me Harold.
- Okay.

625
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,195
- How the numbers going?
- Pretty good.

626
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,166
- Gonna find that 22 percent?
- 22 percent?

627
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,863
Twenty-two, 11 times 2.
It's prime numbers.

628
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,066
- You gonna tax the bathroom?
- No, I'm not gonna tax the bathroom.

629
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,542
- Could I use the bathroom, then?
- Go for it.

630
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,442
Okay. I wanna use the bathroom.
Bye now.

631
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,775
Bye-bye.

632
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,090
Well, good night.

633
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,888
You want a cookie?

634
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,656
Oh, no.

635
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:24,960
Come on. They're warm and gooey.
They're fresh out of the oven.

636
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,500
No, I don't like cookies.

637
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,167
You don't like cookies?

638
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,372
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

639
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,516
- Everybody likes cookies.
- No, I know.

640
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,620
I mean, after a really awful,
no-good day...

641
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,723
...didn't your mama ever make you
milk and cookies?

642
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:52,384
No. My mother didn't bake.

643
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,724
The only cookies I ever had
were store-bought.

644
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,101
Okay. Sit down.

645
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,866
- No, I'm...
- No.

646
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,138
Sit down.

647
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,208
Now...

648
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,241
...eat a cookie.

649
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,816
I really can't.

650
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,353
Mr. Crick, it was a really awful day.

651
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,090
I know, I made sure of it.

652
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,289
So pick up the cookie...

653
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,623
...dip it in the milk...

654
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,628
...and eat it.

655
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,523
That's a really, really good cookie.

656
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,632
So when did you decide
to become a baker?

657
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,806
- In college.
- Oh, like a cooking college?

658
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,070
I went to Harvard Law actually.

659
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:20,777
- Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed it was...
- No. No, it's fine. I didn't finish.

660
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,520
- Did something happen?
- No.

661
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:28,915
I was barely accepted.
I mean, really barely.

662
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,254
The only reason they let me come
was because of my essay.

663
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:36,456
How I was gonna make the world
a better place with my degree.

664
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:41,967
Anyway, we would have to participate
in these study sessions...

665
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:45,164
...my classmates and I,
sometimes all night long.

666
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:49,106
And so I'd bake so no one
would go hungry while we worked.

667
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:52,282
Sometimes I would bake all afternoon
in the kitchen in the dorm...

668
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,510
...and then I'd bring my little treats
to the study groups...

669
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,347
...and people loved them.

670
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,817
Eat.

671
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:04,289
I made oatmeal cookies,
peanut-butter bars...

672
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,198
...dark-chocolate
macadamia-nut wedges.

673
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,730
And everyone would eat
and stay happy...

674
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,095
...and study harder
and do better on the tests.

675
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,999
More and more people started
coming to the study groups...

676
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,037
...and I'd bring more snacks.

677
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,767
I was always looking
for better and better recipes...

678
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:26,507
...until soon it was ricotta cheese
and apricot croissants...

679
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,909
...and mocha bars
with an almond glaze...

680
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,750
...and lemon chiffon cake
with zesty peach icing.

681
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:39,886
And at the end of the semester
I had 27 study partners...

682
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,533
...eight Mead journals
filled with recipes...

683
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,258
...and a D average.

684
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,000
So I dropped out.

685
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,130
I figured if I was gonna
make the world a better place...

686
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,502
...I would do it with cookies.

687
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,781
You like them?

688
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,274
I do.

689
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,150
I'm glad.

690
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,282
Thank you for forcing me
to eat them.

691
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,822
You're welcome.

692
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,863
I should go. Oh, thank you.
For the cookies, I mean.

693
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,832
- Why don't you take them home?
- Oh, no.

694
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,199
- Oh, come on.
- No, really, please.

695
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,433
- No, really, please.
- No, no, no. Really, please.

696
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,702
I would like to, but I can't.

697
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:30,903
- You can't?
- No, no, I mean...

698
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,810
Because, see, it constitutes a gift.

699
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,711
Actually I shouldn't have even had
those other ones, so...

700
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,115
Okay. Well, I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

701
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,951
- No. I know, but if you did...
- Well, I'm not going to.

702
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,251
I know, but if you did...

703
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,520
- What, you think I'm gonna call the...?
- No, no. I'll purchase them.

704
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,858
I'm happy to purchase them.
How's that?

705
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,302
And then there are no issues.

706
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,636
- What?
- No.

707
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,901
- Please.
- Just...

708
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,942
- Why don't I just...?
- Go home.

709
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,443
Really, it's not a big deal.

710
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,775
Go home.

711
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,817
Okay.

712
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,721
Did you?

713
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:20,319
You baked those cookies for me,
didn't you?

714
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,164
You were just trying to be nice
and I totally blew it.

715
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:34,506
This may sound like gibberish
to you...

716
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,505
...but I think I'm in a tragedy.

717
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,947
Professor Hilbert, I've totally failed
at the comedy-tragedy thing.

718
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,312
In fact, I think she likes me even less.

719
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,647
- I know, it's great.
- What do you mean?

720
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,820
You've proved something else
entirely.

721
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:25,688
The voice seems to be dependent
on actions you take.

722
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,265
You reset your watch,
it says you reset your watch.

723
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,263
You ride a bus,
it says you ride the bus.

724
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,834
You brush your teeth,
it says you brush your teeth.

725
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:38,064
It may be that you yourself
are perpetuating the story.

726
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,938
- So I suggest we try something else.
- Like what?

727
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,376
- Try nothing. Nothing.
- What about Ms. Pascal?

728
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,776
- Forget her.
- Forget her?

729
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,952
Other than numbers,
she's all I think about.

730
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,882
Harold, if you wanna stay alive,
you'll try something else.

731
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,422
- That something being nothing?
- Nothing, exactly.

732
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,321
- Nothing?
- Let me explain this again.

733
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:02,157
Some plots are moved forward
by external events and crises.

734
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,062
Others are moved forward
by the characters themselves.

735
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,463
If I go through that door,
the plot continues.

736
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,935
The story of me through the door.
If I stay here...

737
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,574
...the plot can't move forward,
the story ends.

738
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,574
Also if I stay here, I'm late.

739
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,314
- Don't do anything tomorrow.
- Nothing?

740
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,977
Stay home. Don't answer the phone,
open the door, brush your teeth.

741
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,587
- What about work?
- Call them.

742
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,020
- Tell them you're not coming.
- Don't go to work?

743
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,353
Don't do anything that may
move the plot forward.

744
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,586
Instead, let's see if the plot finds you.

745
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,825
Marshall, you're not kicking.

746
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,695
<i>- Certain that these geese have never</i>
<i>known any home but this one:</i>

747
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,898
<i>A small lake in Eastern Poland.</i>

748
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,704
<i>Pollution from a nearby factory</i>
<i>is slowly killing...</i>

749
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,405
<i>... the small fish and insects</i>
<i>on which these creatures feed.</i>

750
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:58,850
<i>All attempts to move the birds to</i>
<i>similar bodies of water have failed.</i>

751
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,890
<i>Perhaps it is the familiarity alone</i>
<i>that keeps them here.</i>

752
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:07,086
O<i>r perhaps it's an unwillingness</i>
<i>to lose the collective memory...</i>

753
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,289
<i>... of the once-beautiful hills</i>
<i>that surround the lake.</i>

754
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,163
<i>And it takes only seconds</i>
<i>for the fiddler crabs to realize...</i>

755
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,703
<i>... that the wader</i>
<i>they might once have feared...</i>

756
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,398
<i>... has now become their prey.</i>

757
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,611
<i>The wounded bird knows its fate.</i>

758
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,708
<i>Its desperate attempts to escape...</i>

759
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,375
<i>... only underscore the hopelessness</i>
<i>of its plight.</i>

760
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,852
<i>The primates' sad, soulful eyes</i>
<i>will be the first to be plucked out...</i>

761
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,859
<i>... then sold to cosmetic companies</i>
<i>around the world...</i>

762
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:45,057
<i>... for use in the testing of mascara</i>
<i>and artificial tears.</i>

763
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:49,136
<i>Next, the monkeys' fur will be stripped</i>
<i>away from their limp corpses...</i>

764
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:52,706
<i>... and sewn together</i>
<i>to form pillows and comforters.</i>

765
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,400
<i>Mr. Zebra thought he was gonna</i>
<i>take a nice drink.</i>

766
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,239
<i>But you never know</i>
<i>who's gonna eat...</i>

767
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,711
<i>... when you're dining</i>
<i>at Mother Nature's restaurant.</i>

768
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,612
<i>That's gotta hurt. What does</i>
<i>this bald eagle wanna serve...</i>

769
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,844
<i>... with some kidney beans</i>
<i>and a fine Chianti?</i>

770
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:09,048
<i>It's an eel. And again:</i>

771
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,523
<i>Looks like old Mr. Crocodile</i>
<i>wanted some antelope...</i>

772
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,753
<i>... to clear that salty zebra</i>
<i>from his palate.</i>

773
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,331
<i>Here's a struggle betting gentlemen</i>
<i>have been known to put money on.</i>

774
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,265
<i>When a mongoose encounters a cobra</i>
<i>it's hard to know who's gonna win.</i>

775
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,632
<i>But this time it looks like</i>
<i>it's... the cobra...</i>

776
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,933
<i>... who's putting the squeeze</i>
<i>on the mongoose!</i>

777
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,373
<i>But don't cash in your chips</i>
<i>just yet, gentlemen...</i>

778
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:31,672
<i>... because now it's the mongoose</i>
<i>who holds the winning card!</i>

779
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,805
Hey! Hey!

780
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,478
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?!

781
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,648
- Holy crapping hell.
- What the hell is that?

782
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,044
- Stop the crane. Stop it.
- Stop the crane!

783
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,219
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing?

784
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,081
Us? What are you doing?

785
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,950
I was watching TV.

786
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:17,615
- Well, we're demolishing this place.
- Are you nuts? I live here!

787
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,557
- Is that a TV?
- Yes, that's a TV! It's my TV!

788
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,699
- Well, what's your TV doing in there?
- I said I live here, stupid!

789
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,663
It's where I keep my stuff!

790
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,168
My name's on the goddamn buzzer!
Harold Crick.

791
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,341
Apartment 2-B, 1893 McCarthy!

792
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,778
- Did you say 1893?
- Yes!

793
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,353
I'm not exactly sure it was plot.

794
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,580
I was hoping you'd say it was
just a really bad coincidence.

795
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,227
Meeting an insurance agent the day
your policy runs out is coincidence.

796
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:55,125
Getting a letter from the emperor
saying that he's visiting is plot.

797
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,495
Having your apartment eaten
by a wrecking ball...

798
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,329
...is something else entirely.

799
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,430
Harold, you don't control your fate.

800
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,610
- I know.
- You do?

801
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,909
Okay. Come with me.

802
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,016
Hey, Tom, can you leave that
till tomorrow?

803
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,713
You were right.
This narrator might very well kill you...

804
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:23,018
...so I humbly suggest that you just
forget all this and go live your life.

805
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:27,991
Go live my life? I am living my life.
I'd like to continue to live my life.

806
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:33,166
I know. Of course. I mean all of it.
However long you have left.

807
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,806
You know, I mean, Howard,
you could use it to have an adventure.

808
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:41,535
You know, invent something, or just
finish reading <i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

809
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:45,408
Hell, Harold, you could just eat
nothing but pancakes if you wanted.

810
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,040
What's wrong with you?

811
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,379
Hey. I don't wanna eat
nothing but pancakes. I wanna live.

812
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,580
Who in their right mind in a
choice between pancakes and living...

813
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,758
...chooses pancakes?

814
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,860
Harold, if you'd pause to think
I believe you'd realize...

815
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,257
...that that answer's
inextricably contingent...

816
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,659
...upon the type of life being led...

817
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,229
...and, of course,
the quality of the pancakes.

818
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,199
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

819
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,334
Yes, I do.

820
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:19,241
But you have to understand that this
isn't a philosophy or a literary theory...

821
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,246
...or a story to me. It's my life.

822
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:26,150
Absolutely. So just go make it the one
you've always wanted.

823
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,594
I never expected
that they would have...

824
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,630
- Do you want one, two?
- I want one.

825
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,132
- One?
- I want two.

826
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,876
All right, so here's your room.

827
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,677
Or as I like to call it, Sleep Pod Two.

828
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,583
Thanks, Dave.

829
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:01,279
No problem, dude.
It'll be nice having you around.

830
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,453
- How long you planning on staying?
- I'm not sure.

831
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:15,895
Dave, can I pose a somewhat abstract,
purely hypothetical question?

832
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,840
Sure.

833
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,702
If you knew you were gonna die...

834
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,876
...possibly soon...

835
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,214
...what would you do?

836
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,848
Wow, I don't know.

837
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,655
Am I the richest man in the world?

838
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,051
No, you're you.

839
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,990
Do I have a superpower?

840
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,426
No, you're you.

841
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:44,430
I know I'm me,
but do I have a superpower?

842
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,964
No, why would you
have a superpower?

843
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,536
I don't know,
you said it was hypothetical.

844
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,966
Fine. Yes. You're really good at math.

845
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,344
That's not a power, that's a skill.

846
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,379
Okay, you're good at math
and you're invisible.

847
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,845
- And you know you're gonna die.
- Okay, okay.

848
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,120
That's easy, I'd go to space camp.

849
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,680
Space camp?

850
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:11,827
Yeah, it's in Alabama. It's where kids
go to learn how to become astronauts.

851
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,790
I've always wanted to go
since I was 9.

852
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:18,496
You're invisible
and you'd go to space camp?

853
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,226
I didn't pick invisible,
you picked invisible.

854
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,800
Aren't you too old
to go to space camp?

855
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,799
You're never too old
to go to space camp, dude.

856
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,376
Space camp.

857
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,304
O<i>ne hundred and twenty-two</i>
<i>guitars.</i>

858
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,982
<i>Seven hundred and thirty-two</i>
<i>strings.</i>

859
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,310
<i>Two hundred and fifty-seven</i>
<i>pickups.</i>

860
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,011
O<i>ne hundred and eighty-nine</i>
<i>volume knobs.</i>

861
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:19,092
<i>Here Harold stood, face to face</i>
<i>with his oldest desire.</i>

862
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,621
<i>And stand is almost all Harold did.</i>

863
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,125
<i>It wasn't just about finding</i>
<i>a guitar.</i>

864
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:31,535
<i>It was about finding a guitar</i>
<i>that said something about Harold.</i>

865
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,641
<i>Unfortunately, this guitar said:</i>

866
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:38,212
<i>"When I get back to Georgia,</i>
<i>that woman gonna feel my pain. "</i>

867
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,843
<i>This one said something</i>
<i>along the lines of:</i>

868
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:45,020
<i>"Why, yes, these pants are Lycra."</i>

869
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,317
<i>These said, "I'm very sensitive,</i>
<i>very caring...</i>

870
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,255
<i>... and I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>how to play the guitar. "</i>

871
00:58:56,232 --> 00:59:00,032
<i>"I'm compensating for something.</i>
<i>Guess what. "</i>

872
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,809
<i>And then Harold saw it.</i>

873
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,009
<i>A damaged and terribly mistreated</i>
<i>sea-foam-green Fender...</i>

874
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,841
<i>... staring back at him.</i>

875
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,778
<i>Despite its obvious maladies...</i>

876
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,249
<i>... the guitar spoke</i>
<i>with conviction and swagger.</i>

877
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:23,084
<i>In fact, it looked Harold directly</i>
<i>in the eye and very plainly stated:</i>

878
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,989
<i>"I rock."</i>

879
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,160
Just breathe. Watch it!

880
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:32,266
We've got a 21 -year-old male
with a gunshot wound to the chest.

881
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,364
There you go.

882
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:39,174
Shot in a gang fight?
Harold's not in a gang.

883
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,643
Man in tweed?

884
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:46,974
There's nothing wrong with him,
he just likes looking at sick people.

885
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,378
Oddly spoken with disdain.

886
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,085
This isn't working.

887
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,721
Well... I don't even know
why we're here.

888
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,618
I don't think we're supposed
to be here.

889
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:59,056
- You said I needed visual stimuli.
- I meant a museum.

890
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,423
I don't need a goddamn museum.
I need the infirm.

891
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,622
You are the infirm.

892
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,658
You're right. The problem is
these people aren't dead...

893
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,837
...they're just severely injured.

894
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,474
Excuse me,
where are the dying people?

895
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,709
Most of these people
are sick or injured...

896
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,813
Which is great, don't get me wrong.

897
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,677
- But they're gonna get better,
which doesn't really help me.

898
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:25,217
Is there any way to see the people
who aren't going to get better?

899
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:26,388
Excuse me?

900
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,786
I'd like to see, if at all possible,
the ones who aren't gonna make it.

901
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,620
You know, the dead-for-sure ones.

902
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,524
I'm sorry,
are you suffering from anything?

903
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,195
Just writer's block.

904
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,035
<i>With every awkward strum...</i>

905
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,703
<i>... Harold Crick became stronger</i>
<i>in who he was...</i>

906
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:56,646
<i>... what he wanted,</i>
<i>and why he was alive.</i>

907
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,754
<i>Harold no longer ate alone.</i>

908
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,187
<i>He no longer counted brushstrokes.</i>

909
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,794
- Harold, I'll see you.
<i>- He no longer wore neckties.</i>

910
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:07,963
Bye, Dave.

911
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:13,225
<i>And, therefore, no longer worried</i>
<i>about the time it took to put them on.</i>

912
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:19,432
<i>He no longer counted his steps</i>
<i>to the bus stop.</i>

913
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:27,213
<i>Instead, Harold did that</i>
<i>which had terrified him before.</i>

914
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,580
<i>That which had eluded him</i>
<i>Monday through Friday...</i>

915
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,950
<i>... for so many years.</i>

916
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,489
<i>That which the unrelenting lyrics...</i>

917
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,925
<i>... of numerous punk-rock songs</i>
<i>told him to do:</i>

918
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,765
<i>Harold Crick lived his life.</i>

919
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,774
<i>But despite resuscitating his life...</i>

920
01:01:56,979 --> 01:02:01,006
<i>... reviving his hope, and instilling</i>
<i>a few wicked calluses...</i>

921
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,345
<i>... Harold's journey</i>
<i>was still incomplete.</i>

922
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:11,193
<i>And Harold's wristwatch wasn't about</i>
<i>to let him miss another opportunity.</i>

923
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,697
Ms. Pascal?

924
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,634
- Ms. Pascal?
- Mr. Crick.

925
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,832
- Hi.
- Hi.

926
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,837
- Hi.
- Hi.

927
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,015
I'm glad I caught you.

928
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,147
Oh, yeah? Why?

929
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:39,819
Because I wanted
to bring these to you.

930
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,786
- Really?
- Yeah.

931
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:48,362
So you can't accept gifts,
but you can give them?

932
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,390
- Listen...
- I don't know.

933
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,034
That seems a little inconsistent,
doesn't it, Mr. Crick?

934
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,464
Very inconsistent, yes.

935
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,002
I'll tell you what.
I'll purchase them.

936
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,673
- No.
- No, no, no, really...

937
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,241
...I'd like to purchase them.
What are they?

938
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,610
Flours.

939
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,716
- What?
- I brought you flours.

940
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:22,587
And you carried them
all the way here?

941
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:29,364
Ms. Pascal, I've been odd
and I know that I've been odd.

942
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:33,204
And I want you.

943
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,211
- What?
- There's so many reasons.

944
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:39,575
There's so many influences in my life
that are telling me...

945
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,340
...at times quite literally...

946
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,349
...that I should come here
and bring you these...

947
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,719
...but I'm doing this
because I want you.

948
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,690
You want me?

949
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,719
In no uncertain terms.

950
01:03:56,532 --> 01:04:01,765
Isn't there some very clear
and established...

951
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,600
...rule about fraternization?

952
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:08,003
- Auditor-auditee protocol?
- Yeah.

953
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,475
Yeah, but I don't care.

954
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:14,210
- Why?
- Because I want you.

955
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:20,722
Well...

956
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,893
...do you mind carrying those
a little bit further?

957
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,060
Okay.

958
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,232
Okay.

959
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:47,879
Did you make a key?

960
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,245
No, I just committed it to memory.

961
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:54,514
- The blue, that's barley flour.
- What's that one?

962
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,089
- The orange?
- Yeah.

963
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,884
I forget.

964
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,461
Right here.

965
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,794
Do you wanna come up?

966
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,795
- To your place?
- Yeah.

967
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,341
I guess I could.

968
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,478
Wasn't that the idea with the flours
and everything?

969
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:23,145
Honestly, I only figured it out
up to "I want you."

970
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,144
Listen, Mr. Crick...

971
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,613
...I think I like you.

972
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:34,894
And before I do anything rash,
I'd like to make sure.

973
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,458
I'd like you to come up.

974
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,833
I'd be honored.

975
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:44,404
Great.

976
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,176
<i>Yeah, he was nuts though.</i>

977
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:53,075
<i>He got caught when he tried</i>
<i>to get the contract notarized.</i>

978
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:56,046
No. No.

979
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,920
Was it good?

980
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,492
Thank you.

981
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:06,161
- You're welcome.
- Can I help you?

982
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,559
No, no, I'm gonna put them in the sink.
Go sit down on the couch.

983
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,605
So do you play the guitar?

984
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,568
- What?
- Do you play the guitar?

985
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:28,512
Terribly. Someone traded me that
for a wedding cake.

986
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:32,347
Does that mean I have to claim it
on my taxes now?

987
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:37,015
- No. I'll leave it out of my final report.
- Oh, thanks.

988
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,325
Do you play?

989
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,018
Not really. I only know one song.

990
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,629
Oh, play it.

991
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,062
No, I don't know it that well, actually.

992
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,134
No, come on. I promise I'm not gonna
laugh at you. Play it.

993
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,532
No, no, no. Maybe some other time.

994
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,264
All right.

995
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,115
Ms. Pascal?

996
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,819
- I...
- I know.

997
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,993
I want you too.

998
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:50,546
<i>Harold's life was filled with moments</i>
<i>both significant and mundane.</i>

999
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:56,020
<i>But to Harold, those moments</i>
<i>remained entirely indistinguishable...</i>

1000
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:57,920
<i>... except for this.</i>

1001
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:03,463
<i>As Ana let out a soft sigh and</i>
<i>repositioned herself against him...</i>

1002
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,793
<i>... Harold knew</i>
<i>somewhere in his heart...</i>

1003
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,799
<i>... that this was one</i>
<i>of the significant moments.</i>

1004
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:12,872
<i>He knew she was</i>
<i>falling in love with him.</i>

1005
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,242
Professor Hilbert. It's a comedy.

1006
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,175
- What?
- A comedy.

1007
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:23,841
The woman. The one who hates me.
Ana Pascal?

1008
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,146
- Last night...
- Yeah?

1009
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:27,982
She's falling in love with me.

1010
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,953
- She is?
- It's like a miracle.

1011
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,491
The voice confirmed it
in the middle of the night.

1012
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,094
Well, that's wonderful, Harold.

1013
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,322
I mean, it completely nullifies my list,
but that's fantastic.

1014
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:38,625
What list?

1015
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,029
These are seven living authors
whose prior work...

1016
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,933
...would seem to make them
candidates to write your story...

1017
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,835
...based on the criteria you and I
previously determined.

1018
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:51,240
If your narrator is alive,
she's on this list.

1019
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,882
But it appears the list
is of little use to you now.

1020
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,052
Now that you're gonna live
happily ever after.

1021
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:01,815
Oh, goodie. This woman, Karen Eiffel,
she's one of my favorite authors.

1022
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,355
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

1023
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,652
Beautiful tragedies. Just beautiful.
Anyway...

1024
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:10,389
...let me quickly copy this list for you,
just in case.

1025
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,501
Sociopathic author.

1026
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,365
- I just wanted to thank you.
- Of course.

1027
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,776
Listen, please, you must tell me if you
hear the voice of the narrator again...

1028
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,444
...just for my own edification.

1029
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,136
I will.

1030
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,274
<i>Well, it's called</i> Death and Taxes.

1031
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,216
<i>Wow. You know, I'm from Texas.</i>

1032
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:36,983
<i>No. Not "Texas." Taxes.</i>

1033
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,387
Death and Taxes.
Death and Taxes.

1034
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,529
<i>Taxes.</i>
<i>Like the Benjamin Franklin quote.</i>

1035
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,595
<i>Precisely so.</i>

1036
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,733
<i>This lady's a package,</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

1037
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:49,426
<i>Tell us, what is this next book</i>
<i>going to be about?</i>

1038
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,106
<i>It's about interconnectivity.</i>

1039
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:56,071
<i>The looming certainty of death.</i>

1040
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:57,905
<i>Men's fashion accessories.</i>

1041
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,013
- Oh, my God, that's her.
- What?

1042
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:03,275
- That's the voice. She's the narrator.
- No, that can't be right.

1043
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,146
No, I'm positive.

1044
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,754
Harold, this interview's a decade old.

1045
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,618
<i>I didn't think anyone actually</i>
<i>wore cuff links anymore.</i>

1046
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,521
That's her.

1047
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,458
- She's British?
- She's her.

1048
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,394
- Karen Eiffel?
- Professor Hilbert, I know that voice.

1049
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:20,769
Crap.

1050
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,868
- What's wrong?
- First of all, she wasn't on my list.

1051
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:28,737
I figured you would have mentioned
the accent and she doesn't...

1052
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,046
She kills people.

1053
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,715
- What?
- In every book she...

1054
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,477
The books are all about...
They die. She kills them.

1055
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,621
- Kills who?
- The heroes.

1056
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:43,223
Four Black Veils. <i>What is that?</i>

1057
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:46,053
<i>It's about a girl who loses</i>
<i>several members of her family...</i>

1058
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,853
<i>... in quick succession.</i>

1059
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,291
Where is she?

1060
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:54,526
She's untraceable. Believe me,
I used to teach a class on her.

1061
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:58,002
I've written her letters. I mean,
she's a hermit, she's a recluse.

1062
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,472
Here. Here's the last book she wrote.

1063
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,737
Look at the copyright. She hasn't
published anything in 10 years.

1064
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,279
She had knowledge of the city.
Does she live here?

1065
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:08,950
She used to, yes, but I mean...

1066
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,120
Banneker Press. 2267 Wallace Street.
Is that her publisher?

1067
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:15,484
You're not listening. I said even
if you find her she's not gonna...

1068
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,090
Thank you for your help.

1069
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:19,055
She only writes tragedies!

1070
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,626
<i>I don't believe in God.</i>

1071
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,658
Okay, he's bringing her flours.

1072
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,832
Kay, where you been?

1073
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,743
I went out to buy cigarettes...

1074
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:12,709
...and I figured out
how to kill Harold Crick.

1075
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:15,313
Buying cigarettes?

1076
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,953
As I was...
When I came out of the store...

1077
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,518
...it came to me.

1078
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:23,488
How?

1079
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,956
Well, Penny,
like anything worth writing...

1080
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:29,221
...it came inexplicably
and without method.

1081
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:32,662
I see. Then what happens?

1082
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:37,700
It's perfect, actually. I can't believe
I didn't think of it earlier.

1083
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,841
It's simple, ironic...

1084
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,538
...possibly heartbreaking.

1085
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,178
Is that it?

1086
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:47,573
Yes.

1087
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:50,547
- You wrote it on legal sheets?
- On the bus.

1088
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:53,586
Well, then.

1089
01:14:56,959 --> 01:15:01,396
So I'll finish it today.

1090
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,228
I'll let the publishers know.

1091
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,926
I'll begin packing my things.

1092
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:10,104
I appreciate it.

1093
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,722
- Hi. Hello. Hi.
- May I help you?

1094
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,949
I need to speak to Karen Eiffel.

1095
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,524
- I'm sorry?
- Karen Eiffel.

1096
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,923
She's one of your authors.
I need to talk to her.

1097
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,064
Well, sir, she's not here.

1098
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:40,360
No. No, I know. I need to find her.
I need to know where she is.

1099
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:41,831
We're just the publishers.

1100
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,837
Right. Of course. But there must be
a way that I can contact her.

1101
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,636
We have the address
where her fan mail is sent.

1102
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,108
No, I can't send mail. It's urgent.

1103
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,075
How do you know her?

1104
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:56,776
- I'm her brother.
- Her brother?

1105
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,288
- Her brother-in-law.
- She has a sister?

1106
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,355
No, I'm married to her brother.

1107
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,887
Not in this state, the one over.

1108
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:12,129
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

1109
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:14,632
No. Okay. Listen.

1110
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:21,431
I'm one of her characters. I'm new.
I'm in her new book.

1111
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:26,046
And she's going to kill me.
Not actually. But in the book.

1112
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,843
But I think it'll actually kill me
so I just need to talk to her...

1113
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:32,213
...and ask her to stop.

1114
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,667
Hi, Harold. Nice sweater.

1115
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,239
Hi, Harold. Phones are out.

1116
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,137
Hey, Harold, 19 percent of 4632?

1117
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,712
Hey, Harold. Back from your vaca?

1118
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,317
Hey. Looking good.

1119
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,520
- He looks terrible.
- Yeah, banged up.

1120
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,022
Wherever he went,
I do not want to go.

1121
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:12,591
Book me not there.

1122
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,025
He's totally ignoring me.

1123
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:22,499
Here, look at this now.
There he goes.

1124
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:23,898
It was good having you.

1125
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:50,227
- Oh, dude, the phones are out.
- Can I borrow your cell phone?

1126
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,696
- The signal's down.
- Damn it.

1127
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,392
- You all right?
- Dave, I need a favor.

1128
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:58,266
- Sure, what is it?
- Can I have some change?

1129
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,636
<i>Within moments, Harold found himself</i>
<i>running across the plaza...</i>

1130
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,814
<i>... heading for the nearest</i>
<i>pay phone.</i>

1131
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,779
<i>At last, he spotted it.</i>

1132
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:17,091
<i>But as Harold neared the phone,</i>
<i>he saw it was occupied...</i>

1133
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,591
<i>... by an octogenarian determined</i>
<i>to reach his daughter in Denver...</i>

1134
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,855
<i>... no matter how many quarters</i>
<i>it took.</i>

1135
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,363
<i>Fortunately, Harold remembered</i>
<i>a bank of phones...</i>

1136
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,330
<i>... in the Sixth Street subway tunnel.</i>

1137
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,994
The baby's name isn't Mrs. Epstein.
My daughter's name is Mrs. Epstein.

1138
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,256
<i>The first phone</i>
<i>failed to give a dial tone.</i>

1139
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,157
<i>And the second</i>
<i>seemed to be splattered...</i>

1140
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,159
<i>... with a fresh batch of mucus.</i>

1141
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,626
<i>Harold dialed the third phone...</i>

1142
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:05,500
<i>... fervently making sure to give each</i>
<i>number key a specific forceful push.</i>

1143
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:28,495
Don't answer that!

1144
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,597
Didn't you say this phone never r...?

1145
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,025
- Hello?
- Is this Karen Eiffel?

1146
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,890
- Yes.
- My name is Harold Crick.

1147
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,259
I believe you're writing a story
about me.

1148
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:10,068
- I'm sorry?
- My name is Harold Crick.

1149
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,263
- Is this a joke?
<i>- No.</i>

1150
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,535
No, I work for the IRS. My name,
Miss Eiffel, is Harold Crick.

1151
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:20,112
<i>When I go through the files at work</i>
<i>I hear a deep and endless ocean.</i>

1152
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:23,182
- Oh, G...!
<i>- Miss Eiffel?</i>

1153
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,677
Hello?

1154
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:28,014
<i>Miss Eiffel? Hello?</i>

1155
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,524
Let him in.

1156
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,541
Hello.

1157
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,138
Hello.

1158
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,043
I'm Penny. I'm Kay's assistant.

1159
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,151
Oh, I'm Harold. Her main character.

1160
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,131
Oh, my God.

1161
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,537
Oh, my God.

1162
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:26,540
Oh, my God.

1163
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:33,015
Miss Eiffel?

1164
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:36,685
Your hair. Your eyes.

1165
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:39,484
Your fingers.

1166
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,698
Your shoes.

1167
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:47,962
Hello.

1168
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:54,164
I'm Harold Crick.

1169
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,639
I know.

1170
01:21:58,613 --> 01:21:59,807
How did you find me?

1171
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:04,283
We audited you
a little more than 10 years ago...

1172
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:06,477
...and your number was in the file.

1173
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:11,318
I'm sorry,
but this is incredibly strange.

1174
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,187
You're telling me.

1175
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:15,988
Didn't you think you were crazy?

1176
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,121
Sort of.

1177
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:21,894
But then you were right
about everything. Like, everything.

1178
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,298
And then you said,
"Little did he know."

1179
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:28,636
- "Little did he know"?
- Yeah. It's third-person omniscient.

1180
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,471
Jesus.

1181
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,080
Which meant it was, well, you know,
someone other than me.

1182
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,009
At least that's what
Professor Hilbert said.

1183
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,311
Professor Hilbert?

1184
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,315
- Professor Jules Hilbert?
- Yeah.

1185
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,592
Yeah, he loves your books.

1186
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,428
I love his letters. I don't...

1187
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,655
So you understand
why I had to find you...

1188
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:54,096
...and ask you not to kill me.
- What?

1189
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:57,436
I mean, obviously
you haven't written the end.

1190
01:22:58,473 --> 01:22:59,440
Harold...

1191
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:03,873
I mean, now since we've met
and you can see that I exist...

1192
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,047
...you're not gonna kill me, right?

1193
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,611
Have you written it?

1194
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,710
I can... No.

1195
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,445
- Have you written it?
- An outline.

1196
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,888
Okay. But it's just an outline, right?

1197
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,684
- Yeah, sort of.
- "Sort of"?

1198
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,417
- It's just not typed.
- "Not typed"?!

1199
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,118
- Maybe that's okay.
- What does that mean?

1200
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,731
- I'm sorry, I'm trying to write a book.
- What do you mean it's "okay"?

1201
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,959
- What do you mean you're sorry?
- Kay.

1202
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,932
Let him read it.

1203
01:23:32,774 --> 01:23:34,537
Let him read it.

1204
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,825
- Did you find her?
- Yeah.

1205
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,626
- And?
- I may already be dead...

1206
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,627
...just not typed.

1207
01:23:58,666 --> 01:23:59,655
Is that it?

1208
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,000
Did you read it?

1209
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,502
I tried, but I couldn't.

1210
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,009
You have to read it.

1211
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:12,138
You have to tell me
what to do or what not to do.

1212
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,114
If I can avoid it...

1213
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,486
If I have a chance...

1214
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,410
Please.

1215
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:28,729
Okay.

1216
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,591
Okay.

1217
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,564
And here's your uniform.

1218
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,538
It's a go. Banetta's outside,
she'll assign you your locker.

1219
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,646
- And you roll.
- I'm ready.

1220
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:19,669
Professor Hilbert?

1221
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,807
- Hi, Harold.
- Hi.

1222
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:27,078
You look tired.

1223
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:30,113
No, no, just calm.

1224
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:35,420
Harold, I'm sorry.

1225
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,856
You have to die.

1226
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,057
What?

1227
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:45,755
It's her masterpiece.

1228
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:53,268
It's possibly the most important novel
in her already stunning career...

1229
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:57,137
...and it's absolutely no good
unless you die at the end.

1230
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,010
I've been over it again and again...

1231
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,844
...and I know how hard this is
for you to hear.

1232
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:11,187
You're asking me
to knowingly face my death?

1233
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,920
Yes.

1234
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:17,090
Really?

1235
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,363
Yes.

1236
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:33,537
I thought you'd...
I thought you'd find something.

1237
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:35,979
I'm sorry, Harold.

1238
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:43,314
Can't we just try and just see
if she can change it?

1239
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,992
- No.
- No?

1240
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:47,593
Harold...

1241
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:51,728
...in the grand scheme
it wouldn't matter.

1242
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,733
- Yes, it would.
- No.

1243
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,808
I could change.

1244
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:05,171
I could quit my job.

1245
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,008
I could go away with Ana.

1246
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,043
I could be someone else.

1247
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:13,979
Harold, listen to me.

1248
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:16,588
I can't die right now.

1249
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,652
It's just really bad timing.

1250
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:27,158
No one wants to die, Harold,
but unfortunately we do.

1251
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,527
Harold...

1252
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,196
Harold, listen to me.

1253
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,438
Harold, you will die someday,
sometime.

1254
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,807
Heart failure at the bank.

1255
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,511
Choke on a mint.

1256
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:47,785
Some long, drawn-out disease
you contracted on vacation.

1257
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,720
You will die. You will absolutely die.

1258
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,018
Even if you avoid this death,
another will find you.

1259
01:28:56,230 --> 01:29:02,066
And I guarantee that it won't be nearly
as poetic or meaningful...

1260
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:04,438
...as what she's written.

1261
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,606
I'm sorry...

1262
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:13,576
...but it's the nature of all tragedies,
Harold.

1263
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:18,349
The hero dies,
but the story lives on forever.

1264
01:29:56,824 --> 01:30:01,090
- There's an empty seat right there.
- No, I wanna sit down over here.

1265
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:38,096
Kay?

1266
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:51,076
Kay?

1267
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:56,547
How many people
do you think I've killed?

1268
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:00,917
- Kay.
- How many?

1269
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:02,719
- I don't know.
- Eight.

1270
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:07,722
- Kay...
- I've killed eight people. I counted.

1271
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:10,091
They're fictional. Get up.

1272
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,266
Harold Crick isn't fictional.

1273
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:15,464
- I don't...
- He isn't fictional, Penny.

1274
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:20,598
Every book I've ever written ends
with someone dying. Every one.

1275
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:23,775
Really nice people too.

1276
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,937
The book about Helen
the schoolteacher.

1277
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:34,215
I killed her
the day before summer vacation.

1278
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,048
How cruel is that?

1279
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:40,892
And the civil engineer, Edward.

1280
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,528
The one I trapped...

1281
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:48,259
...with a heart attack in rush hour.

1282
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:50,300
I killed him.

1283
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,098
I killed...

1284
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:57,269
Penny, I killed them all.

1285
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,445
Miss Eiffel? Miss Eiffel?

1286
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:36,614
- Harold.
- Hi.

1287
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:40,251
- I just finished it.
- You just...

1288
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:43,252
Yeah, I read it all in one read
on the bus.

1289
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:45,819
It's lovely.

1290
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:48,154
I like the part about the guitars.

1291
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:53,098
Well, thanks, thanks. Goo...
Well, listen, I'm...

1292
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:57,863
No, I read it and I loved it.
And there's only one way it can end.

1293
01:32:58,673 --> 01:33:02,200
I mean, I don't have much background
in literary anything...

1294
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,344
...but this seems simple enough.

1295
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:10,782
I love your book.
And I think you should finish it.

1296
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:29,935
<i>The night before his death...</i>

1297
01:33:30,137 --> 01:33:33,766
<i>... Harold unsuspectingly went about</i>
<i>some usual business.</i>

1298
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:37,744
<i>He finished his outstanding audits.</i>

1299
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,205
<i>He made a few phone calls</i>
<i>he had been putting off.</i>

1300
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:46,216
Listen, does your program
have an age limit?

1301
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:49,287
<i>And he traveled to Ms. Pascal's...</i>

1302
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:52,721
<i>... where she made him meat loaf</i>
<i>and chocolate pudding...</i>

1303
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:55,589
<i>... and the two watched old movies.</i>

1304
01:33:57,365 --> 01:33:58,992
<i>It was a nice enough evening.</i>

1305
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:03,034
<i>And in any other circumstance</i>
<i>it would've seemed commonplace.</i>

1306
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:07,105
<i>In fact, the only thing</i>
<i>that made this night significant...</i>

1307
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,674
<i>... was the morning it preceded.</i>

1308
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:17,681
I have to tell you something.

1309
01:34:17,885 --> 01:34:19,182
You do?

1310
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:21,748
I do.

1311
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:25,650
- Is it a secret?
- Sort of.

1312
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,350
Tell me.

1313
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:31,031
I adore you.

1314
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,328
I adore you too.

1315
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,476
- That it?
- No.

1316
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,475
I have to tell you this.

1317
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,274
I just want you to listen carefully.

1318
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:50,040
Okay.

1319
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:55,515
You can deduct the value
of all the food you give away...

1320
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:58,248
...as a charitable contribution.
- Harold.

1321
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:03,761
No, no, no. In fact it amounts to more
than what you're currently withholding.

1322
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:06,125
And it doesn't break any tax laws.

1323
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:10,531
Harold, the point
is to break the tax laws.

1324
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:14,105
I wanna make the world
a better place too, Ana.

1325
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:18,239
I think that means
keeping you out of jail.

1326
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:23,706
Okay.

1327
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:25,875
Okay?

1328
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:27,554
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1329
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:31,418
If you come over here...

1330
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:35,823
...and talk a little more tax talk
in my ear.

1331
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:38,362
Because I like it so much.

1332
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:05,046
<i>Much had changed for Harold</i>
<i>over the past few weeks:</i>

1333
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,220
<i>His attitude towards work.</i>

1334
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:09,753
<i>His habitual counting.</i>

1335
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:11,820
<i>His love life.</i>

1336
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:19,363
<i>But of all the transmutations</i>
<i>Harold Crick had undergone...</i>

1337
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:24,561
<i>... perhaps the most significant</i>
<i>was that today on his return to work...</i>

1338
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:29,209
<i>... he was not late</i>
<i>for the 8: 17 Kronecker bus.</i>

1339
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:33,574
<i>What Harold had not understood...</i>

1340
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:36,181
<i>... about that Wednesday</i>
<i>four weeks prior...</i>

1341
01:37:36,383 --> 01:37:39,147
<i>... was that the time he received from</i>
<i>his fellow commuter...</i>

1342
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:43,084
<i>... was, in fact, three full minutes</i>
<i>later than the actual time...</i>

1343
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:45,588
<i>... and, therefore, three full minutes</i>
<i>later...</i>

1344
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:50,492
<i>... than the time to which his watch</i>
<i>and life had been previously set.</i>

1345
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:53,931
<i>Not the worst of errors.</i>

1346
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:58,635
<i>But if Harold had not set his watch</i>
<i>to the incorrect time...</i>

1347
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:02,400
<i>... Harold would have again</i>
<i>barely caught the 8: 17 Kronecker bus.</i>

1348
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:05,170
<i>And he would not be approaching</i>
<i>the bus stop...</i>

1349
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:08,576
<i>... precisely at 8: 14</i>
<i>this particular Friday.</i>

1350
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:10,249
Excuse me.

1351
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:15,915
Harold?

1352
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:19,451
<i>An otherwise ignorable fact...</i>

1353
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:21,688
<i>... until the unthinkable occurred.</i>

1354
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:57,726
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1355
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:59,627
I need for everyone
to just stay seated.

1356
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:01,357
Come on, son.

1357
01:39:06,507 --> 01:39:09,101
- What happened? I didn't see him.
- It was not your fault.

1358
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,608
He was trying to help the boy.
Get your supervisor.

1359
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:13,006
I don't believe this.

1360
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:15,704
- It was all my fault, though.
- No, it wasn't.

1361
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,110
Is he okay?

1362
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:20,151
- It looks likes he's breathing.
- I don't think he's breathing.

1363
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:21,651
Oh, my God.

1364
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:37,763
Come in.

1365
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:42,533
Excuse me.

1366
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:48,543
Are you Professor Hilbert?

1367
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,683
Yes.

1368
01:39:53,921 --> 01:39:56,412
Hi. I'm Karen Eiffel.

1369
01:39:57,224 --> 01:40:01,627
I believe we have
a mutual acquaintance.

1370
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,292
Please, sit down.

1371
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,758
No, I just came by to...

1372
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:11,202
Here.

1373
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:17,442
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1374
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:20,007
Have you read it?

1375
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:23,343
Is that all right?

1376
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,378
Yes.

1377
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:35,861
I think, perhaps, you may be
interested in the new ending.

1378
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:50,240
Good afternoon.

1379
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:52,907
Oh, hi.

1380
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,845
It's a pretty brave thing you did.

1381
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:01,945
Stepping in front of that bus
was pretty brave.

1382
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:06,219
Kind of stupid, but pretty brave.

1383
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,156
Oh, yeah.

1384
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:10,723
Is that boy okay?

1385
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:13,161
He's just fine. Scratched up is all.

1386
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:14,994
Oh, good.

1387
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:18,995
Am I okay?

1388
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,805
Well, you're not dead.

1389
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:24,807
On the other hand, it looks like
you cracked your head...

1390
01:41:25,012 --> 01:41:27,207
...you broke three bones
in your leg and foot...

1391
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:30,110
...you suffered four broken ribs,
fractured your left arm...

1392
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:34,219
...and severed an artery in your right,
which should've killed you in minutes.

1393
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:35,615
But amazingly...

1394
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:38,553
...a shard of metal from your watch
obstructed the artery...

1395
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:41,694
...keeping the blood loss
low enough to keep you alive...

1396
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:43,362
...which is pretty cool.

1397
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:46,962
Yeah.
So with some physical therapy...

1398
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:49,897
...a few months of rest,
you should be fine.

1399
01:41:50,237 --> 01:41:53,365
Well, sort of. We weren't able
to remove the shard of watch...

1400
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:56,475
...from your arm without risking
severe arterial damage.

1401
01:41:56,677 --> 01:41:58,975
You'll be okay.
You'll just have a piece of watch...

1402
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:01,443
...embedded in your arm
the rest of your life.

1403
01:42:02,082 --> 01:42:04,915
You're very lucky to be alive,
Mr. Crick.

1404
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:06,820
Yeah.

1405
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:14,425
- Dr. Mercator, Mr. Crick has a visitor.
- Sure.

1406
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:18,989
- My God, Harold.
- Hey.

1407
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:24,466
- I'm okay. It's all right.
- Harold.

1408
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:26,161
I'm fine.

1409
01:42:26,373 --> 01:42:28,967
Harold, you're not fine.

1410
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:32,577
Look at you. You're severely injured.

1411
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:35,748
- No, I'm fine.
- What...? What happened?

1412
01:42:36,917 --> 01:42:38,544
I stepped in front of a bus.

1413
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:41,550
What? Why?

1414
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:45,384
There was a boy.
I had to push him out of the way.

1415
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:47,651
What?

1416
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:51,793
I had to keep this boy from getting hit.

1417
01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:58,296
You stepped in front of a bus
to save a little boy?

1418
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:01,299
I didn't have a choice.

1419
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:03,135
I had to.

1420
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:20,685
It's... It's okay.

1421
01:43:21,995 --> 01:43:24,691
- It's not great.
- No.

1422
01:43:24,898 --> 01:43:27,332
It's okay. It's not bad.

1423
01:43:27,768 --> 01:43:31,101
It's not the most amazing piece
of English literature in several years...

1424
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:33,637
...but it's okay.

1425
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:36,676
You know...

1426
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:41,444
...I think I'm fine with "okay."

1427
01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:44,173
It doesn't make sense
with the rest of the book though.

1428
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,978
No, not yet. I'll rewrite the rest.

1429
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:49,519
My assistant said
she'd go back to the publisher...

1430
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:52,248
...and request more time.
- Why?

1431
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:54,354
Don't know. It's awfully sweet though.

1432
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:57,029
No, why did you change the book?

1433
01:43:59,466 --> 01:44:00,990
Lots of reasons.

1434
01:44:01,201 --> 01:44:03,931
I realized I just couldn't do it.

1435
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,207
Because he's real?

1436
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:10,505
Because it's a book about a man...

1437
01:44:10,711 --> 01:44:13,703
...who doesn't know he's about to die
and then dies.

1438
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:17,611
But if the man does know
he's going to die and dies anyway...

1439
01:44:17,818 --> 01:44:20,286
...dies willingly,
knowing he could stop it, then...

1440
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:26,082
I mean, isn't that the type of man
you want to keep alive?

1441
01:44:28,428 --> 01:44:31,261
<i>As Harold took a bite</i>
<i>of Bavarian sugar cookie...</i>

1442
01:44:31,465 --> 01:44:35,492
<i>... he finally felt as if everything</i>
<i>was going to be okay.</i>

1443
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:40,031
<i>Sometimes, when we lose ourselves</i>
<i>in fear and despair...</i>

1444
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,640
<i>... in routine and constancy...</i>

1445
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:45,905
<i>... in hopelessness and tragedy...</i>

1446
01:44:46,513 --> 01:44:50,074
<i>... we can thank God</i>
<i>for Bavarian sugar cookies.</i>

1447
01:44:50,817 --> 01:44:53,547
<i>And fortunately,</i>
<i>when there aren't any cookies...</i>

1448
01:44:53,754 --> 01:44:58,487
<i>... we can still find reassurance</i>
<i>in a familiar hand on our skin...</i>

1449
01:44:59,826 --> 01:45:01,817
<i>... or a kind and loving gesture...</i>

1450
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,099
<i>... or a subtle encouragement...</i>

1451

<i>... or a loving embrace...</i>

1452
01:45:16,009 --> 01:45:18,842
<i>... or an offer of comfort.</i>

1453
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:23,344
<i>Not to mention hospital gurneys...</i>

1454
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,446
<i>... and nose plugs...</i>

1455
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:36,527
<i>... and uneaten Danish...</i>

1456

<i>... and soft-spoken secrets...</i>

1457

<i>... and Fender Stratocasters...</i>

1458
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:52,839
<i>... and maybe the occasional piece</i>
<i>of fiction.</i>

1459
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:56,245
<i>And we must remember</i>
<i>that all these things...</i>

1460
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:58,611
<i>... the nuances, the anomalies,</i>

1463
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:08,923
<i>They are here to save our lives.</i>

1464
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:12,157
<i>I know the idea seems strange.</i>

1465
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:15,961
<i>But I also know that it</i>
<i>just so happens to be true.</i>

1466
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:18,403
<i>And so it was:</i>

1467
01:46:18,605 --> 01:46:21,073
<i>A wristwatch saved Harold Crick.</i>
