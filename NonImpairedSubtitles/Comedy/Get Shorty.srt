1
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,578
It's fuckin' cold outside.

2
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,523
The guy on the radio said
it's gonna get down to 34.

3
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,888
It's 34.

4
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,791
That's freezing, for Christ sakes.

5
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,728
Yo, Chili!
What, you spacing?

6
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:39,134
They're closing down the Granville.
You know, that theater on Biscayne?

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,139
That guy owes Momo a couple G's.

8
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,404
I know. I was thinkin'
maybe Momo should buy it.

9
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,672
I could run it for him,
show some old Cagney movies.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,805
What's Momo gonna want
with some broken-down theater

11
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,610
that shows movies
nobody wants to see anymore?

12
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,709
Outside of maybe turning it
Into some kind of porno house,

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,287
he's not gonna give much of a fuck.

14
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,017
- I'm gonna go talk to this Chili.
- Besides, you already got a job.

15
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,116
Yeah... yeah.

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,525
- Hey, Ray! How you doing?
- Yeah, good. You?

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,293
Okay. Can you
believe this weather?

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,061
Miami Beach, for Christ sakes.

19
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,194
Chili Palmer.

20
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,296
It's chilly outside,
and it's Chili inside.

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,500
It's a regular fuckin' Chili-fest!

22
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,842
How you doing, Ray?

23
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,073
Obviously much better
than you, Chili.

24
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,416
That was a good one.

25
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,712
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,954
Hey, when you're done
staring out the window,

27
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,963
I'll meet you back at the office.

28
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,412
Hey! Where's my coat?

29
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,413
It's not one of these?

30
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,109
Do you see a black
leather jacket, fingertip length,

31
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,685
<i>like the one
Pacino wore in Serpico?</i>

32
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,220
- 'Cause if you don't, you owe me $379.
- Maybe you didn't see the sign.

33
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,289
I seen the sign,

34
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,857
but I didn't come to sunny Florida
to freeze my ass off, you got that?

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,359
So you either find my coat,
or you give me the $379

36
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,294
that my ex-wife paid for it
at Alexander's.

37
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,362
Wait a minute.
Ray Bones took my coat?

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,664
No, no, he didn't take it.

39
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,706
He borrowed it, 'cause, see,
somebody took his coat.

40
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,504
So Mr. Barboni try this other coat,
and it fit him pretty good.

41
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,010
That was my coat.

42
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,672
He was wearing it to go home,
but he's not gonna keep it.

43
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,805
My car keys are in that coat.

44
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,884
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.

45
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,078
You know,
he works for Jimmy Capp.

46
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,815
I know who he works for.
Where's your phone?

47
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:37,890
This way.

48
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,726
Are you sure it was Ray Bones
that took the coat?

49
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,456
That's what the man said.

50
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,556
Tomorrow I see on the TV weather
it's gonna be nice and warm.

51
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,760
- You don't need the coat.
- This is it.

52
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:55,000
Get the coat.
Just don't piss the guy off, okay?

53
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,702
Then we're gonna have to call Momo
and straighten the whole thing out,

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,937
and Momo's gonna be pissed off
for wasting his time.

55
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,343
We don't need that.

56
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,678
Don't worry. I'm not gonna say
any more than I have to, if that.

57
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,092
It's freezing.

58
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,201
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a minute.

59
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,112
What are you, fuckin' nuts?

60
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,550
My nose! My nose!

61
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:21,123
Holy shit!
Somebody call 9-fuckin'-111!

62
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,094
Somebody call 9-fuckin'-111!

63
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,737
What do you want me to do, Ray,
go to war over a fucking coat?

64
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,033
You're lucky the guy didn't kill you.

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,007
The coat was a Christmas present,
for Christ sakes.

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,668
Now, listen to me, Jimmy.

67
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,872
You gotta do something
about this guy. He's running amok.

68
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,745
And he's got no fuckin' respect
for none of us.

69
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,443
He's got no respect for you.

70
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,953
And I don't gotta do shit!
Chili Palmer don't work for me.

71
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,751
He works for Momo up in Brooklyn,

72
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:55,794
so as long as Momo's around,
nothing happens to Chili Palmer.

73
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,159
Do you understand?

74
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,492
Over here.

75
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,434
We're here, Momo.

76
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,665
I hope you guys
checked this place out good,

77
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,210
'cause I'm goin' in there alone,
and I don't want no fuckin' surprises.

78
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,871
Oh, yeah. I checked
everything, Momo.

79
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,671
Yeah, who is it?

80
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,250
- It's Momo.
- Get in here.

81
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,849
Surprise!

82
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,797
What are you tryin' to say...
you're never gonna sleep again?

83
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,804
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed.
There's a difference.

84
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,841
This article says that most people
die in their beds.

85
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,069
I figure as long as
I stay out of bed, I'm safe.

86
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,510
What? That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard of.

87
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,013
Where you gonna sleep?

88
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,514
In my recliner.

89
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,847
You know, the tan one
in the TV room.

90
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,854
Or I'll go to the coffee shop,
slide into a booth, pull my hat down.

91
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,483
Hey, how many people you know
died in a coffee shop?

92
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,128
Cut straight hair in here
or just fags?

93
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,897
Hey, Bones. That's quite a scar
you got on your head.

94
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,734
Why don't you have
these guys fit you for a rug,

95
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,434
cover it up for you?

96
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,534
You two geezers
take your game to the park.

97
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,240
This man is the man.

98
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,373
You understand what I'm sayin',
motherfucker?

99
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,716
He's Mr. Bones, and you speak
to Mr. Bones from now on.

100
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,483
Come on. You can do better
than him, can't you?

101
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,492
Not these days.
Not unless you speak Spanish.

102
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,292
You got a miss.
Leo Devoe... he's six weeks over.

103
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,592
He's dead.

104
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,394
How do you know he's dead?
Did he tell you?

105
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,492
Yeah, he told me
that he was dead.

106
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,695
Personally?

107
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,705
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me
that he got killed

108
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,037
in that Getaway jet crash
that happened a month ago.

109
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,008
Maybe he took out
some flight insurance.

110
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,408
Go check with his wife.

111
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,038
You check it out.
It's your book now.

112
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,583
He owns some dry cleaning store
over on Federal Highway.

113
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,778
Let me explain
something to you.

114
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,186
Momo is dead, which means
that everything he had

115
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,656
now belongs to Jimmy Capp,
including you,

116
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,058
which also means that when I speak,
I speak for Jimmy...

117
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,289
e.g., from now on,

118
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,230
you start showing me
the proper fucking respect.

119
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,564
"E.g." means "for example."

120
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,068
What I think you want to say is "i.e."

121
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,968
Bullshit, it's short for ergo.

122
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,665
Ask your man.

123
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,072
To the best of my knowledge,
"e.g." means "for example."

124
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,907
E.g., i.e., fuck you.
The point is this...

125
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,244
when I say, "Jump,"
you say, "Okay," okay?

126
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,284
Yeah, Ray. Okay.

127
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,320
Now, you owe me
the dry cleaner's 15 G's,

128
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,979
plus the juice,
which is another...

129
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,856
2,700.

130
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,090
You either get it from his wife
or outta your own pocket.

131
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,564
I don't give a fuck,

132
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,500
but you never hand me
a book with a miss.

133
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,639
We'll see you, Ray.

134
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,803
Go see the dry cleaner's wife.
You got three days.

135
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,543
I told you not to piss him off
that time. You remember...

136
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,416
Don't say another fuckin' word,
all right?

137
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,490
I hate the dry cleaning business.

138
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,393
I hate being inside all day
around all those machines.

139
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,191
Must be hot.

140
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,959
You have no idea
how hot it is.

141
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,871
You know, Fay, I was...
I was wondering...

142
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,736
did Leo have life insurance?

143
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,536
I don't know of any.

144
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,041
I trust you, Chili.

145
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:31,418
I think you're a decent type of man,
even if you are a crook.

146
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,856
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Fay.

147
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,161
I wish he really was dead.

148
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,822
He's a son of a bitch.

149
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,629
Yeah, that's him, all right.

150
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,175
Called himself Larry DeMille.
Hit on every showgirl in town.

151
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,268
He told me he was
the Martinizing king of Miami.

152
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,437
What a moron.

153
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,640
Anyway, you want this guy,
he's in L.A.

154
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,240
We put him on a plane after he
spanked one of my cocktail girls.

155
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,218
- Leo spanked a cocktail girl?
- Apparently, the way it went...

156
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,881
...he invites her to Santa Anita
to play the ponies with him.

157
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,423
She tells him
what he can do with that.

158
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,186
He gives her one on the tush.

159
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,661
My guess... he's by his lonesome
at the track right now.

160
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,198
Hey, Chill, if you decide
to go to L.A.,

161
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,494
this guy owes us 150 grand.

162
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,228
60 days over.
Some movie producer.

163
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,769
Movie producer? Really?

164
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,771
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Why not?

165
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,774
Appreciate that, man.
You're gonna love this guy.

166
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,743
Another fuckin' moron.
Harry Zimm.

167
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,821
All right. Thanks a bunch.

168
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,828
- Where is it?
- It's right there.

169
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,788
Well, what is that?

170
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,529
- It's an Oldsmobile Silhouette.
- I ordered a Cadillac.

171
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,969
Oh, well, yeah,
that's the Cadillac of minivans.

172
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,597
Are you kidding me?

173
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,836
Hey, you want, La Tijera
Car Rental is right over there,

174
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,378
but I think all they got
Is Rabbit convertibles.

175
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,778
Guess I'll take
the Cadillac of minivans.

176
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,533
Harry!
Harry, goddamn it, wake up!

177
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,007
Wake up.
Somebody's downstairs.

178
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,544
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's downstairs.

179
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,409
Be quiet. Listen!

180
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,617
- I don't hear anything.
- Right there.

181
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,220
It's the television.

182
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,417
When I came upstairs, you stayed
downstairs to finish your drink.

183
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,154
I told you to turn off
the television when you were through.

184
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,890
I also told you
you could sleep in the maid's room.

185
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,796
Yeah, well, I did that.

186
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,132
I turned the television off
with the remote thing,

187
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,728
then I laid it on the floor.

188
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,669
You know what could've happened?

189
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,645
The dog came in, stepped on it
and turned the television back on.

190
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,476
I don't have a dog, Harry.

191
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,385
You don't?

192
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,021
What happened to Muffy?

193
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,023
Harry, are you gonna go down there
or do you want me to do it?

194
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,184
No, I'm going.

195
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,261
Hurry!

196
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,192
Anybody skimmin' the pool?
It needs it.

197
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,431
I'm goin', I'm goin'.

198
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,276
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

199
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,710
All right, I'm going.
I'm going.

200
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,947
Jesus.

201
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,346
<i>Do you have
one of those satellite dishes?</i>

202
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,923
<i>No satellite dishes.</i>

203
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,618
<i>Now, where I live... how many channels
do you get of television?</i>

204
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,355
<i>Oh, probably 40, 50 channels.</i>

205
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,693
<i>Are you on
the information superhighway?</i>

206
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,787
<i>No, not yet.</i>

207
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,698
<i>Where I live... and I get all of
the premium services on my cable...</i>

208
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,667
<i>I get 2,800 different channels.</i>

209
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,740
<i>2,800 channels?
No kidding.</i>

210
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,536
<i>- If I wanted, I could...
- Harry Zimm.</i>

211
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,702
Jesus Christ!

212
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,041
How you doing?
I'm Chili Palmer.

213
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,639
Jesus! If I have a heart attack,
I hope you know what to do.

214
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,082
Where you been, Harry?

215
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,118
Have we met? I don't recall.

216
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,382
We just did.

217
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,287
I told you,
my name's Chili Palmer.

218
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,257
You're in pictures, right?

219
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,261
Did you ever stop to think what would
happen if I had a heart attack?

220
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,524
- Look at me, Harry.
- I'm looking at you.

221
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,066
I want you to keep
looking at me, right here.

222
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,102
Well, that's what I'm doin'.

223
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,734
You know Dick Allen?
Mesa's Casino?

224
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,103
That's what this is.

225
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,302
You're a collector
for the fucking casino.

226
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,141
You come in here
in the middle of the night.

227
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,944
I thought you were an actor
auditioning, for Christ sakes.

228
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,746
We'll see about this.

229
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,624
Operator, let me have
Las Vegas information.

230
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,356
Harry, let me give you some advice.

231
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,952
You don't want to act
like a hard-on,

232
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,929
you're standing there
in your undies.

233
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,263
What you want to do
is sit down and talk to me.

234
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,766
- Harry, a marker is like a check.
- I know what a marker is.

235
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,174
They don't want to deposit yours
and have it bounce.

236
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,337
That annoys them.

237
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,381
And your dear friend
Dick Allen's been calling you,

238
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,747
leaving messages on your machine,
and you haven't gotten back to him,

239
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,911
so he asked me, as a favor,
to look you up.

240
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,320
I follow you here, and I see you
in a window with a woman,

241
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,882
<i>looks a lot like Karen Flores,
the actress from Grotesque.</i>

242
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,690
You're not looking at me, Harry.

243
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,627
Why do I have to keep
looking at you?

244
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,960
Because I want you to.

245
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,397
So now you're gonna get rough, huh?

246
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,969
I make good by tomorrow,
or you're gonna break my legs?

247
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,799
Come on, Harry. Mesa's?

248
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,908
Tell Dick Allen I'll cover those markers
in the next 60 days at the most.

249
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,412
If he doesn't like it, then that's
his problem, the fucking prick.

250
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,543
So, you want me to call you a cab?

251
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,517
So you make movies, huh?

252
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,682
I produce feature motion pictures.
No TV.

253
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,851
<i>You mentioned Grotesque before?</i>

254
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,397
<i>That happens to be Grotesque, Part II
that Karen Flores was in.</i>

255
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,990
<i>She also starred in three of my
Slime Creatures releases.</i>

256
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,728
You may have seen them.

257
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,861
I got an idea for a movie.

258
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,201
Yeah, what
did this guy look like?

259
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,938
You can't imagine
what a pathetic little guy!

260
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,848
Is he one of these with
the Bermuda shorts and the black socks?

261
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,976
No, no. Wait for this. Okay.

262
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,181
Leo, right? He would wear,
like, plaid wool hats

263
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,554
in Miami
in the middle of the summer.

264
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,894
He doesn't want anyone
to think that he's bald, right,

265
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,725
so he'd be wearing a fuckin' cap!

266
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,865
Say hello to Chili Palmer.

267
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,529
Chili, this is Karen Flores.

268
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,198
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Karen.

269
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,003
How'd you get in the house?

270
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,771
He's just telling me
an idea for a movie.

271
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,573
It's not bad so far.

272
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,011
Sit down, have a drink.

273
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,980
Tell Karen.
See what she thinks.

274
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,815
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- I came in the back door.

275
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,479
You broke in?

276
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,114
Well, it was open.
Wasn't locked.

277
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,556
Well, what if it were?

278
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,218
You want to hear this idea?

279
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,454
It's about this dry cleaner

280
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,623
that scams the airline
out of 300 grand. Tell her.

281
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:24,828
It's simple. It's basically about a guy
who owes a shylock $15,000,

282
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,303
and he's about three weeks
over on the vig.

283
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,000
- That's the interest you have to pay.
- I know what vig is.

284
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,303
Anyway, this dry cleaner...

285
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,878
let's call him Leo, all right?
He's scared.

286
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,674
<i>He doesn't know any better.
He leaves town.</i>

287
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,148
<i>So Leo gets on the plane, but the plane
sits there... it doesn't move.</i>

288
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,981
<i>They announce over the PA system
there's some kind of mechanical problem.</i>

289
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,679
<i>They'll be there maybe an hour,</i>

290
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,690
<i>"But keep your seats
in case they get it fixed sooner."</i>

291
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,783
<i>So the guy's nervous
and in no shape just to sit there,</i>

292
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,055
sweat it out,
so he gets off the plane,

293
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,562
he goes into the cocktail lounge,

294
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,962
<i>and he starts throwing them down,
one after another.</i>

295
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,228
<i>As a matter of fact,
he's still in the lounge</i>

296
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,304
<i>when the plane crashes on takeoff.</i>

297
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,208
<i>When the guy finds out
it was his flight, he can't believe it.</i>

298
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,245
If he had stayed on the plane,
he'd be dead.

299
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,144
Right now, he knows
his luck has changed.

300
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,683
If everybody thinks he's dead,
he won't have to pay back the 15

301
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,445
or what he owes on the vig.

302
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,453
Keep going. Come on.

303
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,682
Since Leo's name
was on the passengers list,

304
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,883
they bring his wife out to the airport,
where they're going through

305
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,325
<i>personal effects,
whatever wasn't burned up.</i>

306
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,622
<i>Leo's bags were on the plane,</i>

307
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,461
<i>so the wife tells them what to look for...
things only she would know about.</i>

308
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,305
Oh, my Leo! My Leo!

309
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,879
<i>So a couple of days go by,</i>

310
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,073
<i>and the people from the airline
come out to see his wife.</i>

311
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,743
<i>They tell her how sorry they are
and all that their plane exploded,</i>

312
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,342
<i>and they offer her a settlement,</i>

313
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,750
<i>the amount based on
what he would've earned</i>

314
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,482
<i>operating the dry cleaners
the rest of his life.</i>

315
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,558
So how much is the wife offered?

316
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,356
300 grand. So they take it.
You know, money in the hand, babe.

317
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,327
So he gets his wife
to cash the check,

318
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,365
<i>and he takes off
for Vegas with the dough.</i>

319
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,127
<i>He gets there
and he's supposed to call her...</i>

320
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,260
<i>you know,
let her know when to come out.</i>

321
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,361
<i>She never hears from him again,
but he's hot.</i>

322
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,838
<i>He runs the 300 grand
up to half a million.</i>

323
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:10,909
Then he comes back to L. A...

324
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,533
But it's driving the guy nuts
because he's winning

325
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,669
and he can't tell anybody
who he is.

326
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,648
So we show in a back story
his motivation, his desire to be famous.

327
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,947
He's got the dough to buy his way in...
mix with the celebs...

328
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,887
and he can't resist,
so then he comes to L.A.

329
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,220
I don't know about
the mixing with celebrities.

330
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,226
I mean, that's something new
that was just added.

331
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,796
But yeah, he comes to L.A.,

332
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,889
and I don't know
what happens after that.

333
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
What? That's it?
That's your movie?

334
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,902
I said I had an idea for a movie.

335
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:43,873
That's half a movie with holes in it...
maybe 40 minutes of screen time.

336
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,671
You don't have a girl...
a female lead...

337
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,610
and on top of that, you don't have
anybody to sympathize with.

338
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,547
- You don't have a good guy.
- The shylock is the good guy.

339
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,709
The shylock is barely mentioned.

340
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,219
It's not believable that the wife
would get a settlement that fast.

341
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,289
Harry doesn't realize
it's a true story.

342
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,292
That Miami flight that went down was
on the news every day for about a week.

343
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,759
Harry must have been busy.

344
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,194
- That's where you got the idea?
- Part of it, yeah.

345
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,301
You're not the guy, are you...
the dry cleaner?

346
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,528
Leo.

347
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,434
You wouldn't be
talking to me if you were.

348
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,800
No, I'm not the guy, Harry.

349
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,669
But you do work for the casino?

350
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,505
Oh, for God's sakes, Harry!
He's the shylock.

351
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,806
That right?
That's what you do for a living?

352
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,108
That's what I did for a living
until recently.

353
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,014
But after I'm done here,
I don't know what I'm gonna do next.

354
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,882
Well, I got an early call.

355
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,047
No problemo, babe.
Go on up to bed.

356
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,557
What I'm saying, Harry,
is that I would like you

357
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,787
and your new buddy
to get out of my house.

358
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,489
Oh, yeah, well, sure.

359
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,159
It was absolutely
a pleasure to meet you, Karen.

360
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,647
I guess in your line of work,

361
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,978
there's times you have
to get kinda rough, huh?

362
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,712
You know, in case
one of your customers don't pay?

363
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,153
- They always pay.
- Yeah? You pack a gun?

364
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,652
Not really.

365
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,386
You ever been arrested?

366
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,291
Well, I've been picked up

367
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,957
for loan sharking and racketeering,
but never convicted, no.

368
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,034
I'm clean, Harry.

369
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,465
Racketeering.

370
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,231
That covers a lot of ground
doesn't it?

371
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,863
Get to the point, Harry.

372
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,941
You want me to do
something for you.

373
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,881
That's us.

374
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,135
Good girl.

375
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,603
Don't say nothing to me.
Just sit down

376
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,012
and act like you're waiting for
somebody that's supposed to meet you.

377
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,516
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Don't nobody know me here.

378
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,644
- Give me the fuckin' money.
- Sit down.

379
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,655
Now, be looking.

380
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,420
The man over to your right
in the blue wool shirt, hanging out...

381
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,122
<i>The other way.
Derecho.</i>

382
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,326
That's a federal officer...
most likely D.E.A.

383
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,562
He moves his leg,
you look for the bulge.

384
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,332
You savvy bulge?
Good.

385
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,305
That's his backup piece.

386
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,468
Hey, try it without looking
right at him if you can.

387
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,876
- What's your name?
- Yayo Portillo.

388
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,039
All right, Yayo, you know he's there.
Just forget about him.

389
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,607
I'm gonna get up. Soon as I'm gone,
you sit down in this same seat I'm in.

390
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,209
You'll feel something under your ass.

391
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,312
That's a key to a locker
where your half million is,

392
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,550
along with some product
we're returning.

393
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,287
Powder's been stepped on
so many times, it's baby food.

394
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,488
You're supposed to give me
the money yourself.

395
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,962
Try to be cool, Yahoo.

396
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,461
I told you where it is.

397
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,538
You do it just how I told you,
and you have a safe trip home.

398
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,387
What'd you have for breakfast, baby?
What'd you have for breakfast?

399
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,088
How come you weigh so much?
You have a burrito?

400
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,294
Give it to the nice lady.
There you go.

401
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,367
Sorry.

402
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:09,270
Getting chocolate all over you.
Say thank you. Bye-bye.

403
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,534
Hi.

404
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,670
Like fucking clockwork,
huh, Bear?

405
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,837
Hi, Bo.

406
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,915
Hey, Farrah. You ready to go
for a ride, sweetie?

407
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,983
Yeah.

408
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,382
Told you to watch your mouth
around my daughter.

409
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,685
<i>The white zone is for
loading and unloading only.</i>

410
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,257
These guys, my investors,
they run a limo service.

411
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,989
They came to me originally,

412
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,224
put some money
in a few of my pictures.

413
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,061
Did okay. They're happy.

414
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,794
This was back a few months ago
when I was planning

415
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,495
what would be my next picture,

416
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,539
about this band of killer circus freaks
that travel around the country

417
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,802
leaving bodies in their wake.

418
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,400
There's a 700-pound fat lady

419
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,911
has a way of seducing guys...
gets them in her trailer.

420
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,174
Harry, look at me.

421
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,510
You're trying to tell me

422
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,413
that you fucked up
without sounding stupid,

423
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,644
and that's hard to do.

424
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,721
Let's talk about where you're at, okay?

425
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,790
You blew 200 grand
of these limo guys' money

426
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,054
on a football game in Vegas,
and you didn't tell them. Now, why?

427
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,458
They don't seem like the type of guys

428
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,895
that would take it with
any understanding or restraint.

429
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,659
First thing they'd do
is break my legs.

430
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,995
You got that on the brain,

431
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,092
but if you were so scared, why did you
take it to Vegas to begin with?

432
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,535
I needed a half million dollars
to buy a script.

433
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,972
- A movie script?
- Blockbuster, but quality.

434
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,135
No mutants or maniacs.

435
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,803
<i>This is gonna be my
Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

436
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,546
<i>Murray Saffrin, the guy that wrote it...
did all my Grotesque pictures...</i>

437
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,177
had it in his drawer for 20 years.

438
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,687
He shows it to me one day,

439
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,418
and he says he's got a major star
interested, would I produce it?

440
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,788
Which star?

441
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,352
Two-time Academy-award
nominee Martin Weir.

442
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,125
That's Martin Weir.
He's the one that played

443
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,566
<i>the mob guy turned snitch
in Cyclone.</i>

444
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,728
One of his best parts.

445
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,863
His best part was
when he played the crippled gay guy

446
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,601
that climbed Mount Whitney.

447
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,472
<i>Ride the Clouds.
Good picture.</i>

448
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,010
That woman...
she looks familiar.

449
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,773
She's a rock star.

450
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,246
Every day, same time, they come
down here and have breakfast.

451
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,409
He faces west
so he can see his billboard.

452
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,850
She faces east
as an excuse to wear her shades.

453
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,285
Unbelievable.

454
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,118
Anyway, Murray has a shrink

455
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,749
who happens to be Martin's
personal trainer's shrink.

456
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,124
Murray gives the shrink the script.

457
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,992
The shrink gives it
to Martin's trainer,

458
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,589
who reads it to Martin
as they work out.

459
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,168
- Martin loves it. He flips.
- So, what's the problem?

460
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,136
The problem is Murray.
Heart attack.

461
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,297
Doris, Murray's widow,

462
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,001
she finds out about
this Martin Weir thing,

463
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,101
and because Murray and I
never had a written contract,

464
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,146
she wants half a million bucks
for the script.

465
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,148
You want me to put you
next to my dry cleaner

466
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,945
so he can invest in your movie.

467
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,019
That, or I was thinking,

468
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,180
what if some tragic accident
were to befall the widow Saffrin?

469
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,521
No, Harry,
I'm not gonna pop her, okay?

470
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,991
It was just a thought.

471
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,857
I tell you what I can do.

472
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,295
I can meet with these limo guys,
tell them to leave you alone for a while,

473
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,526
make the point in a way
they can understand.

474
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,158
You don't know these guys.

475
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,170
Believe me, I know them
a whole lot better than you do.

476
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,817
I once asked this literary agent
what kind of writing paid the best.

477
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,394
He said ransom notes.

478
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,088
Ransom notes.

479
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,893
<i>Here it is... Mr. Lovejoy.</i>

480
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,598
"Lovejoy sits behind the wheel,
watching a bar across the street,

481
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,735
getting his video camera..."
What, is he following someone?

482
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,335
Read it. It's a grabber.

483
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,952
Harry, I think your investors are here.

484
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,959
- Oh, Jesus.
- All right, this is the plan.

485
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,791
I want the limo guys to sit
in these chairs, not on the couch.

486
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,864
You got that?

487
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,159
Yeah.

488
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,564
No. Keep the blinds open.

489
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,863
I want the light in their eyes.

490
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,130
I'm gonna sit at the desk.

491
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,934
I don't want you to introduce me.
Just start talking.

492
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,976
I want you to stand here behind them
as they sit down, you understand?

493
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,774
They'll be looking at you,
but they don't know who you are.

494
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,576
They'll be saying,
"Who is this guy?"

495
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,243
But you don't say anything.
Do not tell them who I am, okay?

496
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,912
- I gotta say something to them.
- No, you don't.

497
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,216
Don't say any more
than you have to,

498
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,757
unless you want
to say something like,

499
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,657
"Glad you assholes stopped by.
Now I can straighten you out."

500
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,956
You're kidding, right?

501
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,826
Just say the movie's
been postponed a year,

502
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,228
but don't tell them why.

503
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,824
<i>Whatever you do, don't say anything
about Mr. Lovejoy, you got that?</i>

504
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,231
All right. Let's go.

505
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,041
- Hey, Ronnie.
- Hey, Harry. Hi.

506
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,011
Wow!

507
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,910
What year is it, man?
We enter a time warp?

508
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,040
I feel like I'm in
Hollywood of yesteryear.

509
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,142
- Have a seat right there.
- Cool.

510
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,149
This is my associate
Chili Palmer.

511
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,421
He's gonna be working with me.

512
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,962
Just so there's no misunderstanding,

513
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,588
despite the rumors
you might have heard,

514
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,031
<i>your investment in Freaks
is just as solid</i>

515
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,330
as the day you signed
your participation agreement.

516
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,871
I can hear you, man,
but where the fuck are you?

517
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,668
Right here.

518
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,972
What I've been wondering is,
where's he been?

519
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,639
Yeah. Where you been, Harry?
We haven't heard from you lately.

520
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,149
New York. I was interviewing actors,
scouting locations.

521
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,583
<i>The main thing is that Freaks</i>

522
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,348
is gonna be put off
for a couple of months.

523
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,514
- A couple of months?
- Yeah.

524
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,217
Just a couple of months.

525
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,785
We need more... prep.

526
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,128
Hey, Harry, bullshit, man.
We have an agreement with you.

527
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,067
No, no, we're gonna do this picture.
We are going to do this picture.

528
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:44,005
I just have another project to do first,
one I've promised this guy for years.

529
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,507
I want to see your books, Harry.

530
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,837
Just show me where it is...

531
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:50,210
a two with five zeros
after it in black and white.

532
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,909
I want to see your books, I want to
see your fuckin' bank statements...

533
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,679
Hey, Ronnie, look at me.

534
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,689
You have a piece of a movie,
that's all. Not a piece of Harry.

535
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,784
If he wants to do another movie
this year, that's how it's gonna be.

536
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,864
Excuse me, bro,
but who the fuck are you?

537
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,728
I'm the one telling you how it is.

538
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,595
Catlett.

539
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,397
What is this other movie
you're doing first, Harry?

540
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,667
- Let me show...
- Harry, let me answer this one.

541
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,242
First of all, who am I talking to...

542
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,107
am I talking to him
or am I talking to you?

543
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,338
You can talk to me.

544
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,575
That's what I thought.
Let me put it this way.

545
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,210
<i>Outside of Freaks, it's none
of your fuckin' business what we do.</i>

546
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,515
Oh! Here it is right here.

547
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,285
<i>This is the project...
Mr. Lovejoy.</i>

548
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,361
I don't want you guys to think that
I'm trying to put something over on you.

549
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,625
<i>Mr. Loveboy...
what is it, Harry... a porno flick?</i>

550
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,860
It's fluff.
You wouldn't be interested in it.

551
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:47,062
You think we go to see your movies?
I've seen better film on teeth.

552
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,201
It makes no difference to me
which one our money's in,

553
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,743
<i>so how about you just take
our 20 points out of Freaks</i>

554
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,245
<i>and put 'em in this other one,
this Mr. Loverboy.</i>

555
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,713
No. I can't do that.

556
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,579
You're positive about that?

557
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,949
Yeah. It's a different kind of deal.

558
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,885
It's... structured.

559
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,547
Okay.

560
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,717
Then be good enough
to hand us our money back,

561
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:12,159
or you think about us coming in
on this new deal.

562
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,252
You let us know.

563
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,265
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin'
dead as disco. You hear me?

564
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,928
Take your time, Harry.

565
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,802
We're not animals,
are we, Ronnie?

566
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,846
What?

567
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,689
What?

568
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,564
Maybe I wasn't clear,

569
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,663
but I thought I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

570
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,241
I had to tell them something.

571
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,042
Harry, never say anything
unless you have to.

572
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,615
You asked me to
get these guys off your back,

573
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,311
<i>and the next thing I know, you're saying,
"Have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy."</i>

574
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,284
I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.

575
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,855
I told them that I would think about it.

576
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,390
In this town,
what does that mean? Nothing.

577
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,052
Well, that's the difference
between you and me, Harry.

578
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,219
I say what I mean.

579
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,389
If I want something from someone,
I ask them straight out.

580
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,694
If I want Martin Weir,
I go get Martin Weir.

581
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,133
I don't fuck around
with his trainer's shrink.

582
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,761
Shrink's trainer.

583
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,032
Take me back to my car.

584
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,220
<i>- Yeah?
- Tommo, Chili.</i>

585
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:48,088
<i>Hey, where you been?
I been calling all over for you.</i>

586
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,320
<i>Ray Bones is looking for you.
Where the hell are you?</i>

587
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,454
<i>- I'm in L.A. Now.
- What are you doing out there?</i>

588
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,997
I'm going into
the movie business.

589
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,589
<i>I'm thinking about producing.</i>

590
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,226
What the fuck do you know
about making movies?

591
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,066
I don't think the producer
has to know much.

592
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,369
<i>I think you're full of shit
or a chump.</i>

593
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,942
I gotta go.

594
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,171
<i>Call me when you know
more about Ray Bones.</i>

595
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,611
Karen, how you doing?

596
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,114
What are you doing here?

597
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,344
Listen, I wanted to come by
and apologize for breaking in

598
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,852
the way I did last night.

599
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,546
Let me get this straight.

600
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,454
You broke in again to apologize
for breaking in before?

601
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,584
No, no.
Your patio door was open.

602
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,185
You shouldn't do that.
You got a lot of nice things in this house.

603
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,323
Well, make sure you lock it
on the way out.

604
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,867
You had a bad day, huh?

605
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,993
I spent all day
crawling out of a grave.

606
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,366
The director said I was incapable

607
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,633
of reaching the emotional core
of the character.

608
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,901
What?

609
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,239
<i>Obviously, he didn't see you in
Bride of the Mutant.</i>

610
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,369
You saw that one?

611
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,744
When you turn to the camera

612
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,876
and you say to the alien mother
that her time on Earth is finished,

613
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,011
Joan Crawford on her best day

614
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,714
wished that she had
had in her day,

615
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,452
the emotion, the intensity
that you had in that scene.

616
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,326
Well, that was a good scene...
I mean, for a horror movie.

617
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,159
No, for any movie.

618
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,256
I know I'm better than what
I've been doing all these years,

619
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,164
walking around in fuck-me pumps
and a tank top,

620
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,998
waiting till it was time to scream.

621
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,233
- Yeah, but what a scream.
- Yeah, it's a real gift.

622
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,174
Look, all I'm sayin' is, it would be
nice to get the chance

623
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,835
to say one great line,

624
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,676
<i>like in that great Bette Davis movie
Cabin in the Cotton,</i>

625
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,181
where she walks up to
the guy on the porch,

626
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,878
gives him a flirty look, and says,
"I'd kiss you, but I just washed my hair."

627
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:26,423
Great line. How come you don't
do movies with Harry anymore?

628
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,788
'Cause I married
the great Martin Weir.

629
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,292
He was a full-time job.

630
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,419
Have you read
Harry's new script?

631
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,690
No.

632
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,823
He says it's the best thing
he's ever read.

633
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,992
<i>He must mean after
Slime Creatures III.</i>

634
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,832
Was that why Harry
came over last night...

635
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,930
to ask you to help him
put Martin in a movie?

636
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,839
Harry's dreaming
of a $40 million production

637
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,879
he'll never get off the ground
with a star he'll never sign

638
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,881
with or without my help.

639
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,942
- He said Martin flipped over it.
- Martin's known for his flipping.

640
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,247
He flips over a script,

641
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,789
then when it comes time
to make a deal, he flips out.

642
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:03,520
Why don't I go over to Harry's office
and pick you up a copy of the script,

643
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,119
and you can read it yourself,
see what you think?

644
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,393
- Don't go out of your way.
- No, no. It's nothing.

645
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,800
I better go have a talk with Leo,
my runaway dry cleaner.

646
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,339
Right. See how your story ends.

647
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,000
<i>You know, that movie Touch of Evil
is playing near my hotel.</i>

648
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,010
We could go check it out
if you want,

649
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,172
go watch Charlton Heston
be a Mexican.

650
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,479
That's all right.
Another time.

651
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,413
See ya around.

652
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,682
See ya.

653
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,716
Hi. My name is Ray.

654
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,343
I'm a friend of Chili Palmer's.

655
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,355
Have you spoken with Mr. Palmer
since your husband blew up?

656
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,823
Oh, uh... once or twice.

657
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,019
And what was it you talked about?

658
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:14,097
- Nothing really. This and that.
- This and that?

659
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,771
I want us to be friends,
I really do,

660
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,842
and we all know that friends
don't hit each other...

661
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,535
unless they have to.

662
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,875
So what do you say
we start all over again,

663
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,644
and you tell me exactly
what the fuck is goin' on.

664
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,277
Huh? Okay?

665
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,853
Good evening, sir.

666
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,054
And a very good evening
to you, too, sir.

667
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,528
Thank you.

668
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,281
Leo, look at me.

669
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,122
I'd have never thought
you'd be so dumb,

670
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,722
leaving over 300 grand
in the closet under an extra blanket,

671
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,198
but I guess you are.

672
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,463
I didn't know
where else to keep it.

673
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,038
Where would you?

674
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,576
- How about a bank?
- No. They'd report it to the IRS.

675
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,008
You don't open an account.

676
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,706
You put it in a safe deposit box,
you dip in it whenever you want.

677
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,978
- How did you know that I was here?
- I'll give you another tip.

678
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,179
Next time you write to your wife,
don't use hotel stationery.

679
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,119
It was Fay, wasn't it,
told you about the money?

680
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,657
What, she tell you my whole
life history, for Christ sake?

681
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,250
Leo, I'm here
to save your ass.

682
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,954
How? By taking my money?

683
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,033
No. You get to keep the money that
you won today. That's yours.

684
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,896
It's all mine.

685
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,367
Leo, sit down.

686
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,471
I don't know how you got this far,
you're so fuckin' dumb,

687
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,976
but you're through,
and I'm gonna explain why.

688
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,547
I hope you're not so dumb
that you won't understand.

689
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,481
Ray Bones is the man
that you're dealin' with now,

690
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,485
and when Bones finds out what you did,
he's gonna take everything,

691
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,522
including the sporty little hat
you got on your head,

692
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:23,115
and then most likely he'll shoot you
so you won't tell on him.

693
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,196
Now, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

694
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,629
Now, you've got $310,000
in the bag here.

695
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,997
I'm gonna take the 300
you scammed from the airlines,

696
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,899
and the ten that's left over,
I'm gonna borrow from you

697
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,130
and pay back at another time.

698
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,835
Wait. You take all my money,
but you're borrowing part of it?

699
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,002
At 18%.

700
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,673
Now, don't ask another
fuckin' question. I'm leaving now.

701
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,112
But you won't know where I am.
I mean, I don't even know where I'll be.

702
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,416
I'll find you, Leo.

703
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,616
You leave a trail
like a fuckin' caterpillar.

704
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,188
Hey.

705
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,257
Hey, wait a minute.
What's this 18% a year shit?

706
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,200
You want to borrow 10,
the vig is three bills a week.

707
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,861
That's 15 for the vig plus the 10.

708
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,305
That's 25 big ones,
you go the whole year, buddy.

709
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,877
Hey, you hear me?

710
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,910
<i>This is good, this Mr. Lovejoy.</i>

711
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:57,681
It needs a better ending, but, yes,
I can see why Harry wants to do it.

712
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,452
You understand,
I knew Harry was lying,

713
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,027
saying this wasn't any good
but holding on to it like, man,

714
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,030
you'd have to break his fingers
to get it away from him.

715
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,690
That's funny,
because I was thinking,

716
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,701
What am I gonna have to break
of yours to get it away from you?

717
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,498
Now, I'm explaining to you
what I'm doing here,

718
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,698
in case you thought
I came to rob the place

719
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,800
or rip off any of this
dusty old shit that the man has.

720
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,880
I wouldn't make you out to be
a burglar. Not in that outfit.

721
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,973
Harry called you his associate.
What does that mean?

722
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,381
I never heard your name

723
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,249
<i>or read it in
The Hollywood Reporter</i>

724
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,548
<i>or Variety or anyplace.</i>

725
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,384
Just what he said.
I'm his associate.

726
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,391
You must bring
something heavy to the deal.

727
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,620
I do. Me.

728
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:41,425
It says here you're getting
Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy?

729
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,966
- That's right. We're getting Martin.
- Come on.

730
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,228
How you gonna do that?

731
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,236
I'm gonna take a gun,
I'm gonna put it to his head,

732
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,397
and I'm gonna say,
"Sign the fuckin' papers, Martin,

733
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,305
or you're dead." That's it.

734
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,842
I wonder... would that work?

735
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:56,469
You know who I see
for the part of Al Roxy?

736
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,140
Harvey Keitel.
Man could play it in his sleep.

737
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,377
<i>He was pretty good
in that movie Fingers.</i>

738
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,577
Missed that one.

739
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,654
You know who else?
Morgan Freeman.

740
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,484
You know Morgan's work?

741
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,354
Morgan Freeman.
He's a colored guy, though.

742
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,722
So what?

743
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,422
Where does it say in the script
the man's got to be white?

744
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,556
Color's what the part needs, man.

745
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,601
You need somebody to do it
with some style.

746
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,829
What do you think of the script?

747
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,339
The first thing
that's gotta go is the title.

748
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,608
This writer's name, Murray Saffrin,
would be better than Lovejoy.

749
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,307
I'm with you on that one.

750
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,387
You know what I'm thinking?
Why don't you and I, we sit down,

751
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,888
we write the script over
where it needs it.

752
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,389
You could write one of these?

753
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,754
There's nothing to it.

754
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,225
All you do, you get an idea,

755
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,228
you set down
what you want to say on paper,

756
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,424
then hire somebody else to fill in
the commas and shit where they belong

757
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,433
if you're not positive yourself.

758
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,765
Maybe fix up the spelling
where you have some tricky words...

759
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,338
although I've seen some scripts,

760
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,236
<i>I know the words
weren't spelled right,</i>

761
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,968
there was hardly
any commas in it at all!

762
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,704
So I don't think
that's too important.

763
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,006
All right, you get to the end.

764
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:06,048
You write in "fade out."
You're done.

765
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,311
- That's it.
- That's all there is to it?

766
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,651
Then what the fuck
do I need you for?

767
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,286
Because I'm offering
my services on this one, man.

768
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,622
I'll tell you what.

769
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,187
If I need a ride sometime,
I'll let you know.

770
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,331
<i>How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.</i>

771
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,171
<i>This is where you're gonna die.</i>

772
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,880
<i>That wasn't no misfire.
That was just to turn you around.</i>

773
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,452
<i>I don't wanna shoot you
in the back.</i>

774
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,646
<i>Unless you'd rather...
try to run for it.</i>

775
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:52,353
<i>Schwartz, is she there?
Did you bring my wife?</i>

776
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,988
<i>She's in the car.
They've got it all on tape.</i>

777
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,159
<i>- You sure you got enough?
- Go play it back. You'll see.</i>

778
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,366
<i>- How many did you frame?
- You better give me that gun.</i>

779
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,804
<i>Okay, here it is.</i>

780
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,772
"That's the second bullet
I stopped for you."

781
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,554
You're goin' down, Orson.

782
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,892
<i>Isn't somebody going to come
and take him away?</i>

783
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,829
<i>Yeah, in just a few minutes.
You really liked him, didn't you?</i>

784
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,058
"The cop did."

785
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,295
<i>- The one who killed him.
- "He loved him."</i>

786
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,707
<i>Hank was a great detective,
all right.</i>

787
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:38,832
"But a lousy cop."

788
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,070
<i>Is that all you have to say for him?</i>

789
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,013
<i>He was some kind of a man.</i>

790
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,152
<i>What does it matter
what you say about people?</i>

791
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,994
<i>Good-bye, Tana.</i>

792
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,899
<i>Adios.</i>

793
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,804
Wow, huh?

794
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,776
You been here the whole time?

795
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,615
No. I just caught the end.

796
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,782
You know, Welles
didn't even want to do this movie.

797
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,121
He had some studio contract
he couldn't get out of,

798
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,559
but sometimes
you do your best work

799
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,528
when you got a gun
to your head.

800
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,859
Yeah.

801
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,424
I brought you a copy of the script.

802
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,230
I already read it.
Harry left a copy at the house.

803
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,498
- How did you like it?
- It's not horrible.

804
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,598
I don't like the title and I don't like
some of the characters in it.

805
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,303
- So you read it.
- I haven't read it, but I will.

806
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,210
- You and Harry'll make a great team.
- Is that right?

807
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,907
Listen, I'm gonna
make a deal with him.

808
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,041
Oh, good, you found a character
you like for yourself?

809
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,983
No. I don't want to act in it,
I want to produce it,

810
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,554
especially if I
help him get Martin.

811
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,917
Hey, that's fair, huh?

812
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,719
Yeah. So, what do you
get out of it?

813
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,158
Is that why you come down here,
to ask me that?

814
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,923
I want to know.

815
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,089
Why would anyone
want to be in the movies?

816
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,258
Yesterday you were
a loan shark.

817
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,393
Yeah, but I was
never that into it,

818
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,904
especially this bullshit
about having respect.

819
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,303
Forget about it.

820
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,035
It's bad enough treating these guys
like they're your heroes,

821
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,772
smiling at stupid comments
they think are so funny.

822
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,973
You think the movie business
is any different?

823
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,050
Yeah, but I like movies,

824
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:30,018
and I figure if I help Harry
make a movie, I'll find out what to do

825
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,350
outside of raising money
and having an idea.

826
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,185
That doesn't sound so hard.

827
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,849
I mean, I was
in on the money business,

828
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,689
and I have a lot of ideas
floatin' around in my head.

829
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,287
Listen, I'm gonna talk
to Martin tomorrow morning.

830
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,663
I told Harry that I'd meet you and him
at the Abiquiu restaurant afterwards.

831
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,431
This just might work out.

832
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,373
- You never know.
- Just might.

833
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:56,913
Adios.

834
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,895
I spent eight hours at the airport
looking at people's bulges.

835
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,438
I don't like that.

836
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,303
This is not the way
we do business.

837
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,069
You two do not know
who you are messing with.

838
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,145
Listen to me.
I don't want no fucking key, okay?

839
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,213
I want the money.

840
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:09,008
You gonna smoke, you get
the hell off my $70-a-yard carpet.

841
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,180
Now, I told you where the money is.
All you got to do is go and get it.

842
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,315
No. I tell you something.

843
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,622
I go to that airport, and I open
that locker and they bust me,

844
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,458
I tell them I come
to get something for you.

845
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,555
- That's all I know.
- That's all you know, huh?

846
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:26,602
- That's all I know.
- Wait here. I'll be back directly.

847
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,466
Keep an eye
on Yahoo for me.

848
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,617
That's the way
you get things done.

849
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,057
What the fuck you gonna
do with that?

850
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,356
I'm taking you out, Yahoo.

851
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,399
You see that... the way the man
just went right over?

852
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,741
Maybe we could get
Chili Palmer up here.

853
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,007
You could fix
my railing to give way

854
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,309
like they do in the movies.

855
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,612
I invite the man up here
to have a look at my view,

856
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,186
get him to lean over the railing...

857
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,811
That's the dumbest idea
I ever heard.

858
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,455
Here's the thing, Bear.
I want to produce movies.

859
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,325
What's the point of living in L.A.
Unless you're in the movie business?

860
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,399
And I mean high up in it.

861
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:33,526
<i>That's the reason why Harry's gonna
produce this Mr. Lovejoy with me,</i>

862
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,104
not Chili Palmer.

863
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,221
I can't believe this map is accurate.

864
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,263
I bought it for ten bucks from a kid
sitting on a lawn chair on Sunset.

865
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,026
You were supposed to meet me
at the restaurant.

866
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,067
I know, but look at this...
it says, "Martin Weir's house,

867
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,931
across the street
from George Hamilton."

868
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,471
That must be George...
Nicole?

869
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,976
Jesus, it is you! It's Nicki now.
I don't believe this!

870
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,440
- I know her.
- Hi, Nicki.

871
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,880
Karen, shit, I didn't
see you there. How are you?

872
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,953
Come in, baby. You got to come in.
You gotta meet Martin.

873
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,646
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?

874
00:50:29,554 --> 00:50:32,421
Chili was the only one at Momo's
didn't try to hit on me.

875
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:34,287
Oh, what a gentleman.

876
00:50:34,392 --> 00:50:38,886
- Do you like my hair? Black?
- Oh, nice. Especially under the arms.

877
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,988
Martin won't let me shave.

878
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:45,058
Guess I fill some need... takes him
back to the '60s or something.

879
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:47,966
Speak of the devil.

880
00:50:48,073 --> 00:50:51,907
- Karen, look at you.
- Hi, Martin.

881
00:50:53,545 --> 00:50:56,241
You smell so good.
She always smells so good.

882
00:50:56,347 --> 00:51:00,443
- Neat. Martin, this is Chili Palmer.
- Chili, is it?

883
00:51:00,552 --> 00:51:01,644
Nice to meet you, Martin.

884
00:51:01,753 --> 00:51:04,085
Chili's a gangster...
ran a club I used to play at

885
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:05,679
for another gangster back in Miami.

886
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:07,758
How is Momo these days anyway?

887
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,827
- Dead.
- Bummer.

888
00:51:09,928 --> 00:51:11,987
I'll let you get to your movie talk.

889
00:51:12,097 --> 00:51:14,622
Chili, do not leave
without saying good-bye to me.

890
00:51:19,003 --> 00:51:20,197
So?

891
00:51:22,974 --> 00:51:24,601
You know how beautiful you are?

892
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:26,802
You really are beautiful.

893
00:51:26,911 --> 00:51:28,435
I'm sitting here. I'm...

894
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:33,547
...looking at you and having
flashbacks of memories of us.

895
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:34,777
Really?

896
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:38,185
Yeah, and I'm wondering...
how did it go wrong?

897
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:40,382
How did it all slip away?

898
00:51:40,492 --> 00:51:41,652
It didn't slip away, Martin.

899
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,389
You did when you went off
to fuck Nicki at my birthday party.

900
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:47,965
Yeah. That was a good party.

901
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:50,591
<i>Marty, you were so good
in that movie The Cyclone.</i>

902
00:51:50,702 --> 00:51:53,694
Martin.
Yeah. It was a beautiful role.

903
00:51:53,805 --> 00:51:56,000
All I had to do was find
the character's center...

904
00:51:56,107 --> 00:51:59,804
the stem I used to wind him up...
and he'd play, man.

905
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:01,572
He'd just play.

906
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,544
You had that down cold.
If I didn't know better,

907
00:52:03,648 --> 00:52:05,206
I'd have thought
you was a made guy.

908
00:52:05,316 --> 00:52:07,341
- Thank you.
- I mean, no acting there, right?

909
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:10,080
And the fink part.
Oh, man. Jesus Christ.

910
00:52:10,188 --> 00:52:13,351
I never met a fink,
and I hope to God I never do,

911
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,790
but the way you played a fink,
that's how it's gotta be, right?

912
00:52:15,894 --> 00:52:17,293
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:19,795
Two weeks before we started shooting,

914
00:52:19,898 --> 00:52:23,095
I went back to Bensonhurst
just to hear you guys talk.

915
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:25,533
See, I'm Italian,
but I grew up in Tarzana,

916
00:52:25,637 --> 00:52:30,336
so I wanted to get the rhythms
of your speech, you know.

917
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:32,033
Oh, we speak differently?

918
00:52:32,143 --> 00:52:34,543
Well, it's more like your attitude,
your tone.

919
00:52:34,646 --> 00:52:37,444
Your speech patterns demonstrate
a certain confidence in yourselves,

920
00:52:37,549 --> 00:52:40,746
in your opinions,
your indifference to conventional views.

921
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:42,342
You know, it's like...

922
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:45,718
- Like we don't give a shit.
- Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

923
00:52:45,824 --> 00:52:49,055
Anyway, once I get the authentic
sounds of speech,

924
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,028
the rhythms, the patois, you know,

925
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:54,723
I can actually get into their heads.

926
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:57,700
I can actually think the way
those guys do. Get inside.

927
00:52:57,802 --> 00:52:59,394
- Really?
- Yeah.

928
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:02,530
I'm one of those guys.
What am I thinking?

929
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,164
Well, don't get me wrong.

930
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:07,676
An actual metamorphosis
doesn't take place.

931
00:53:07,779 --> 00:53:09,041
That wouldn't be acting.

932
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,944
So you don't know
what I'm thinking?

933
00:53:11,049 --> 00:53:13,381
No, I don't,
but I have to say I'm curious.

934
00:53:13,484 --> 00:53:15,418
So you want to know
what I'm thinking?

935
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,387
- Yeah, if you want to tell me.
- I'm thinking about a movie.

936
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:19,751
One of mine?

937
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:21,758
No, one that we're producing.

938
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,454
With what,
wise-guy money? Hmm?

939
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:28,661
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

940
00:53:28,766 --> 00:53:31,064
No. Look, Martin,
I'm not connected to that anymore...

941
00:53:31,169 --> 00:53:33,603
not since I left that loan-sharking
operation in Miami.

942
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:36,037
What's the matter...
pressure got too much for you?

943
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,608
Pressure? I'm the one
who applied the pressure.

944
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:39,677
Oh, yeah?

945
00:53:39,777 --> 00:53:42,337
Now, Martin,
can I ask you a question?

946
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:44,813
You're an actor.
Actors like to pretend, right?

947
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,248
We've been known to make believe.

948
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:48,512
Pretend this.

949
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,987
You're a shylock.
A guy owes you 15 grand.

950
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,820
He skips town. He takes off.
What do you do?

951
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:09,737
Oh, Martin, for Christ sake.

952
00:54:11,142 --> 00:54:13,110
Just... you know...

953
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:15,839
I'm doing Shylock
instead of a shylock.

954
00:54:15,947 --> 00:54:16,914
Right.

955
00:54:17,015 --> 00:54:19,074
All right, what's my motivation?

956
00:54:19,183 --> 00:54:21,276
The acquisition of money.
To collect.

957
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,684
To inflict pain if I have to.

958
00:54:23,788 --> 00:54:27,622
Guy splits with 15 large
of my money, I go after him!

959
00:54:27,725 --> 00:54:29,249
What the hell you think I'd do?

960
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,555
- Martin, look at me.
- I am looking at you.

961
00:54:31,663 --> 00:54:34,063
No, look at me the way
I'm looking at you.

962
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:35,427
Put it in your eyes.

963
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:38,195
"You're mine, asshole,"
without saying it.

964
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:40,567
Okay. How about this?

965
00:54:44,842 --> 00:54:46,935
What are you telling me,
that you're sleepy?

966
00:54:47,045 --> 00:54:48,478
That you want to go to bed?

967
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:50,274
All right. Wait, wait.

968
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:51,643
Okay.

969
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:02,324
Now you're squinting
like you need glasses.

970
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,827
Well, what do you...
what do you...

971
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:07,022
- Look at me.
- What?

972
00:55:07,131 --> 00:55:11,124
What I'm thinking is,
"You're mine. I fuckin' own you."

973
00:55:11,235 --> 00:55:13,829
But what I'm not doing is feeling
one way or another about it.

974
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:15,803
You see,
you're not a person to me.

975
00:55:15,907 --> 00:55:19,365
You're an entry in my book, that's all.
You're just a guy who owes me money.

976
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:22,909
All right. How about this?

977
00:55:26,217 --> 00:55:27,980
Ooh. Wow.

978
00:55:28,086 --> 00:55:30,748
Not bad, not bad.

979
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:33,847
- No wonder you're Martin Weir.
- Oh, yeah.

980
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:36,085
That's what I think of you, asshole.

981
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:38,219
Nothin'.

982
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:40,923
I believe it. I believe it.

983
00:55:41,032 --> 00:55:43,500
So I turn this on
when I confront the guy?

984
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:46,434
You haven't found him yet,
because he split for Las Vegas.

985
00:55:46,537 --> 00:55:49,836
- How do I know that?
- Because his wife told you.

986
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:51,738
Oh, his wife told me. Okay.

987
00:56:00,018 --> 00:56:03,818
- Harry, how you doing?
- Bo, hi. Great.

988
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:07,723
I'm expecting some people.

989
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:11,261
You must be doing some big deals,
doing lunch in a place like this.

990
00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:13,262
Yeah, I'm working on a few things.

991
00:56:13,364 --> 00:56:16,197
<i>I hear you bagged Martin Weir
for Mr. Lovejoy.</i>

992
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,393
This town. Boy,
word gets around, doesn't it?

993
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:19,936
Chili Palmer told me...

994
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,008
last night, when he called me
over to your office to talk about it.

995
00:56:24,108 --> 00:56:25,871
Chili Palmer
showed you my script?

996
00:56:25,977 --> 00:56:28,445
Yeah. I was wondering why
he would do that.

997
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:34,148
So the wife sues the airline.
This is some gutsy babe.

998
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:36,413
Good-looking, too...
like Karen.

999
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:39,081
So when do I meet up with
the husband and give him the look?

1000
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,090
That's not so simple.

1001
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:43,786
There's a mob guy. Real hard-on.
You owe him money.

1002
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:45,886
And he's after you,
wants to take you out

1003
00:56:45,997 --> 00:56:47,828
because you broke
his nose and shot him.

1004
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:49,866
Right, right. Go ahead.
Keep going.

1005
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:53,903
Well, at this point,
basically that's gotta be it.

1006
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:55,495
You mean that's all you're gonna tell me?

1007
00:56:55,606 --> 00:56:59,770
<i>Actually, Martin, the reason we came by
was to talk about Mr. Lovejoy.</i>

1008
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:02,402
We understand that you read the script,
that you loved it, you flipped.

1009
00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:05,513
Refresh my memory.

1010
00:57:05,616 --> 00:57:09,347
Listen, Harry, how'd you like
to get your hands on $500,000?

1011
00:57:09,454 --> 00:57:12,116
You pay me back at your convenience
with no interest.

1012
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:13,212
Are you serious?

1013
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:16,657
All I want in return is to work
on this movie with you.

1014
00:57:16,761 --> 00:57:20,720
In fact, I've already got
some strong ideas on how to fix it up.

1015
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:23,460
Gentlemen, can I get you
anything else?

1016
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:26,002
Let's get another one
for Mr. Zimm. Double.

1017
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,872
You're just gonna give me
this 500 grand?

1018
00:57:31,976 --> 00:57:33,102
We'll talk about that, Harry,

1019
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:34,701
but first I gotta know...

1020
00:57:34,812 --> 00:57:36,712
how'd you hook up
with this Chili Palmer?

1021
00:57:39,117 --> 00:57:43,076
<i>Yeah, Mr. Lovejoy, it was good.
I'll call Buddy and set up a meeting.</i>

1022
00:57:43,187 --> 00:57:44,916
- All right. Who's Buddy?
- Lufkin, his agent.

1023
00:57:45,022 --> 00:57:46,046
Karen knows him.

1024
00:57:46,157 --> 00:57:47,784
- But you are interested?
- Yeah, I'm intrigued.

1025
00:57:47,892 --> 00:57:50,622
<i>It might help you if you take
another look at The Cyclone...</i>

1026
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:52,389
the way a visual fabric
is maintained

1027
00:57:52,497 --> 00:57:54,624
while the metaphor plays
on different levels.

1028
00:57:58,002 --> 00:57:59,401
Hey, Chili, is this your ride?

1029
00:57:59,504 --> 00:58:01,802
Yeah. I like to sit up high,
check everything out.

1030
00:58:01,906 --> 00:58:04,238
I mean, it is
the Cadillac of minivans.

1031
00:58:04,342 --> 00:58:06,435
Yeah. Check this out.

1032
00:58:10,281 --> 00:58:12,977
Wow. You mind
if I take it for a spin?

1033
00:58:21,826 --> 00:58:25,193
He was watching Letterman, huh?
Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.

1034
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,892
So, did he ever find that dry cleaner,
the one with all that money on him?

1035
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,662
Leo? I don't know.

1036
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:34,863
I bet he did, but he ain't
giving you one penny of it

1037
00:58:34,972 --> 00:58:37,634
to help you out...
not the way I am.

1038
00:58:38,976 --> 00:58:42,571
Assuming I go along with this,
when could I have the 500 grand?

1039
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,806
Whenever you want.

1040
00:58:43,915 --> 00:58:47,646
The money's in one of those jock bags
in $100 bills out at the airport,

1041
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:49,686
just waiting in a locker to be picked up.

1042
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:51,254
At the airport, huh?

1043
00:58:55,026 --> 00:58:58,359
It was waiting out there on a deal
that didn't go through, Harry,

1044
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:00,487
one that you don't want to know about.

1045
00:59:00,598 --> 00:59:02,225
I don't know. L...

1046
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:04,767
All right,
it's not the kind of thing you do.

1047
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:07,337
So I'm thinking, why not send
your boy Chili Palmer?

1048
00:59:07,438 --> 00:59:11,374
If he gets busted, hit on the head,
you aren't out a thing, Harry.

1049
00:59:12,777 --> 00:59:14,768
C-18.

1050
00:59:14,879 --> 00:59:16,540
Magic number.

1051
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:22,050
I don't think so.

1052
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:25,321
I'm positive.
It was Susan Hayward.

1053
00:59:25,423 --> 00:59:28,051
No, no. It was
Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford...

1054
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:30,961
Excuse me, Harry.

1055
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,220
Wait here.

1056
00:59:43,007 --> 00:59:47,034
I'd like you to meet
my associate Bear... movie stuntman,

1057
00:59:47,144 --> 00:59:50,079
champion weight lifter,
as you might have noticed.

1058
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:52,206
Throws things out I don't want.

1059
00:59:52,316 --> 00:59:55,444
I think you oughtta
turn around and go back to Miami.

1060
00:59:55,553 --> 00:59:57,077
- You're a stuntman?
- Yeah.

1061
00:59:57,188 --> 00:59:58,177
You any good?

1062
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:00,254
Am I any good?

1063
01:00:07,765 --> 01:00:10,427
That's not bad for a guy his size.

1064
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:13,733
I'll make you a deal.

1065
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:16,306
If you can get outta here
before I take my coat off,

1066
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:20,070
I won't clean up the floor with you
and mess up your pretty little costume.

1067
01:00:21,178 --> 01:00:24,841
You don't know me.
You only think you do.

1068
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:38,188
That guy is a stuntman.

1069
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:40,321
<i>Yeah. He was in Creatures II.</i>

1070
01:00:48,406 --> 01:00:50,067
Rough business, this movie business.

1071
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:53,166
I may have to go back
to loan-sharking just to take a rest.

1072
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,905
Harry, what are you still doing
with those guys?

1073
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:59,449
He happens to be loaning me
$500,000... no strings.

1074
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,609
I can write
any kind of agreement I want.

1075
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:03,186
Cash or check?

1076
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:07,314
Cash, and it happens to be sitting
at the airport in a locker at this moment.

1077
01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:09,188
A locker at the airport?

1078
01:01:09,293 --> 01:01:12,126
Harry, Jesus Christ, tell me
you're not really that stupid.

1079
01:01:12,229 --> 01:01:13,457
You're being set up, Harry.

1080
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:16,158
<i>You pulled him out of that Freaks deal.
Now he's paying you back.</i>

1081
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:18,030
Is that right?
He's setting me up?

1082
01:01:18,135 --> 01:01:22,037
Why is it that Catlett said I should
send you to the airport to pick it up,

1083
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:23,663
since you haven't done
a fucking thing for me

1084
01:01:23,774 --> 01:01:27,835
since you got involved in this
except show Bo Catlett my script?

1085
01:01:27,945 --> 01:01:31,005
You're right, Harry,
you're not the one being set up.

1086
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:33,208
At least Bo has invested
in three of my movies.

1087
01:01:33,317 --> 01:01:34,944
Harry, we spoke with Martin.

1088
01:01:35,052 --> 01:01:36,417
- We?
- Chili and me.

1089
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,612
Really?

1090
01:01:37,722 --> 01:01:39,781
He asked us to call Buddy,
set up a meeting.

1091
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,050
A meeting...

1092
01:01:41,158 --> 01:01:42,750
you and Karen?

1093
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,851
Guy's been in town two days,

1094
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:47,863
and already he thinks
he's David O. Fuckin' Selznick.

1095
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:50,695
Okay, Mr. O. Selznick,
should I make my deal with Bo,

1096
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:52,098
or are you
finally gonna help me out

1097
01:01:52,203 --> 01:01:54,171
and have a talk with
your dry cleaner if you find him?

1098
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:57,035
I found him, but forget about
Leo's money, Harry.

1099
01:01:57,141 --> 01:01:58,802
Do you have it?

1100
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:02,106
If I gave you Leo's money,
you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass,

1101
01:02:02,213 --> 01:02:03,771
and that's
a whole new kind of trouble.

1102
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:04,848
Who?

1103
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:08,214
Ray Barboni... he lives in Miami.
He owns Leo now that Momo's dead.

1104
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,482
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus Christ!
Where do you get these names?

1105
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:13,352
I'll tell you what I'll do for you, Harry.

1106
01:02:13,457 --> 01:02:15,425
I'll go out to the airport
tomorrow morning when it's crowded.

1107
01:02:15,526 --> 01:02:18,154
I'll check it out. If there's no problem,
I'll get you your money.

1108
01:02:18,262 --> 01:02:19,695
But I wouldn't get
my hopes up, Harry.

1109
01:02:19,797 --> 01:02:22,698
Maybe I should call
this Ray Barboni character

1110
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,427
and see if he wants
to invest in my movie.

1111
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:27,368
Don't waste your time, Harry.
He's not a movie fan.

1112
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:28,904
Now, come on,
give me the key.

1113
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,474
Oh, Harry.

1114
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:39,116
You tell him he's gotta be
outta there by five in the morning.

1115
01:02:39,216 --> 01:02:42,743
Because the actor will only work
one night, that's why.

1116
01:02:42,853 --> 01:02:45,185
I gotta go. Yeah.

1117
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,151
Coming.

1118
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,689
- Who is it?
- Me.

1119
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,768
- Oh, fuck!
- I heard that.

1120
01:02:59,003 --> 01:03:00,436
Hello, Doris.

1121
01:03:00,538 --> 01:03:04,235
Harry Zimm,
you look like a wet kiss.

1122
01:03:06,844 --> 01:03:11,713
Well, aren't you gonna offer me
whatever it is you taste like?

1123
01:03:11,816 --> 01:03:13,443
Come in, Doris.

1124
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:16,679
My favorite color... putty.

1125
01:03:16,787 --> 01:03:19,153
Yeah, I like it.

1126
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:21,485
What do you want, Doris?

1127
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:34,428
- I miss Murray, Harry.
- Yeah, I miss him, too.

1128
01:03:34,538 --> 01:03:36,768
A hell of a good writer,
you know.

1129
01:03:36,874 --> 01:03:38,739
I should know.
I discovered him.

1130
01:03:38,843 --> 01:03:40,037
Made him what he was.

1131
01:03:40,144 --> 01:03:42,374
What he was was a hack.

1132
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,007
He couldn't get a job
writing for anybody but you.

1133
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:47,515
I'm being honest.

1134
01:03:47,618 --> 01:03:50,109
He was a lousy writer,
but he was a good husband.

1135
01:03:50,221 --> 01:03:52,280
I just didn't know
until it was too late.

1136
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:55,756
Yeah, well, 20/20 hindsight and all that.
You know what they say.

1137
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,192
I hate being alone.

1138
01:03:58,295 --> 01:04:02,356
The house is so quiet,
so lonely.

1139
01:04:03,701 --> 01:04:07,899
It needs... a man's touch.

1140
01:04:09,573 --> 01:04:11,438
Nice necklace, Doris.

1141
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,011
I don't know
how I feel about this.

1142
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,313
You seem to feel fine about it.

1143
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:29,553
I mean morally.
You know, Murray was a friend.

1144
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,718
Murray's dead.

1145
01:04:34,865 --> 01:04:36,492
Does this mean that

1146
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,660
<i>you're gonna reconsider
our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?</i>

1147
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,328
No, but now that you mention it,

1148
01:04:41,438 --> 01:04:44,430
I did talk to a gorgeous young executive
over at Paramount the other day

1149
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:47,409
who just happened
to get his hands on the script.

1150
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:48,500
What did he say?

1151
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:51,775
He said if Martin's interested,
I can get half a million for it, easy.

1152
01:04:53,784 --> 01:04:55,547
Oh, don't worry, Harry.

1153
01:04:55,653 --> 01:04:59,589
- I'm still gonna give you till Friday.
- How honorable of you.

1154
01:05:01,892 --> 01:05:05,089
You want me to go?
Just say so.

1155
01:05:09,266 --> 01:05:10,392
What the hell.

1156
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:20,010
Fuck!

1157
01:05:23,714 --> 01:05:25,807
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1158
01:05:31,855 --> 01:05:33,880
<i>- What?
- Ray Barboni?</i>

1159
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:35,356
Who is this?

1160
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:37,757
<i>Is this the guy
they call Ray Bones?</i>

1161
01:05:37,861 --> 01:05:41,058
<i>- It depends. Who is this?
- Who is this?</i>

1162
01:05:41,165 --> 01:05:43,759
This is the one
telling you the way it is.

1163
01:05:43,867 --> 01:05:45,698
Okay, asshole?

1164
01:05:45,803 --> 01:05:47,998
Now, you want
your 300 grand or don't you?

1165
01:05:48,105 --> 01:05:50,073
What 300 grand
are you talking about?

1166
01:05:50,174 --> 01:05:52,233
The 300 grand
a guy named Leo Devoe

1167
01:05:52,343 --> 01:05:54,140
scammed off an airline.

1168
01:05:54,244 --> 01:05:58,180
The 300 grand that Chili Palmer
now has in his possession.

1169
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:02,844
Hello? Are you there?

1170
01:06:02,953 --> 01:06:05,717
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
I just don't like this anonymous crap.

1171
01:06:05,823 --> 01:06:09,554
It means you're either
a big chickenshit, or you're not for real.

1172
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,491
Trust me, I am very for real.

1173
01:06:11,595 --> 01:06:13,153
Okay, then, so who are you?

1174
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:15,561
<i>I happen to work
for Harry Zimm, all right?</i>

1175
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:16,997
Who?

1176
01:06:17,101 --> 01:06:20,696
Harry Zimm. The man happens
to be a major Hollywood player.

1177
01:06:20,804 --> 01:06:21,998
I never heard of him.

1178
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:25,041
<i>Maybe that's because you've never
been out of fuckin' Miami, dipshit.</i>

1179
01:06:25,142 --> 01:06:26,609
Maybe you oughtta get on a plane,

1180
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:29,941
<i>come out to L.A.,
take a meeting with Mr. Zimm.</i>

1181
01:06:30,047 --> 01:06:34,143
Okay, so this Zimm guy... what is he
asking for, a finder's fee or something?

1182
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:36,151
<i>Is that what we're talking about here?</i>

1183
01:06:36,253 --> 01:06:38,687
Hey, Zimm don't ask for dick.

1184
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:41,417
Zimm tells you the way it is...
or else.

1185
01:06:43,227 --> 01:06:44,592
Or else what?

1186
01:06:44,695 --> 01:06:47,061
<i>Or else use your fuckin' imagination!</i>

1187
01:08:07,244 --> 01:08:09,439
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could help me out.

1188
01:08:09,546 --> 01:08:12,106
I got a gift in here for my wife.
It's a surprise.

1189
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:15,583
I was wondering if you could put this
in locker C-17 for me.

1190
01:08:15,686 --> 01:08:18,246
Ten bucks.
Take you two minutes.

1191
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:20,255
Yeah, okay.

1192
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:23,216
You'll need some of this.

1193
01:08:23,327 --> 01:08:26,421
You gotta make it quick, though.
She's in the john.

1194
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,122
C-17.

1195
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:47,806
Good man.

1196
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:29,791
Excuse me!

1197
01:09:49,246 --> 01:09:50,372
Let's go, boys.

1198
01:09:53,784 --> 01:09:55,684
Excuse me, sir.

1199
01:09:55,786 --> 01:09:57,651
Agent Curtis, Drug Enforcement.

1200
01:09:57,754 --> 01:09:59,619
These are
Agents Dunbar and Morgan.

1201
01:09:59,723 --> 01:10:02,487
- Would you come with us, please?
- Jesus Christ, what's going on?

1202
01:10:02,593 --> 01:10:05,061
Let's just follow him and behave
ourselves, what do you say?

1203
01:10:12,236 --> 01:10:13,999
Mr. Barbone?
Welcome to LA.

1204
01:10:14,104 --> 01:10:16,504
I'm Bobby, your driver.
Did you have a good flight?

1205
01:10:16,607 --> 01:10:19,098
I hope you drive better than
you fuckin' spell, jack-off.

1206
01:10:19,209 --> 01:10:21,404
The name is Barboni,
not Barbone, okay?

1207
01:10:22,446 --> 01:10:24,311
You want to go to the hotel first,
Mr. Escobar?

1208
01:10:24,414 --> 01:10:26,712
I want to get my fuckin' money.

1209
01:10:29,386 --> 01:10:30,978
- You live in Miami?
- That's right.

1210
01:10:31,088 --> 01:10:34,182
- What are you doing in Los Angeles?
- I'm in the movie business.

1211
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:36,020
- You're an investor, is that it?
- No, I'm a producer.

1212
01:10:36,126 --> 01:10:39,152
- You have a card in this?
- Not yet. I just got started.

1213
01:10:39,263 --> 01:10:41,322
I'd appreciate you telling me
what this is about.

1214
01:10:41,431 --> 01:10:43,626
I got a John Doe warrant
says I can strip-search you.

1215
01:10:43,734 --> 01:10:45,201
Pat him down.

1216
01:10:45,302 --> 01:10:49,398
Put your hands on the wall.
Spread your legs.

1217
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:50,768
What are you doing at the airport?

1218
01:10:50,874 --> 01:10:54,366
I was supposed to pick up my wife here,
but she wasn't on the plane.

1219
01:10:54,478 --> 01:10:56,810
Why, if you live in Miami,
is your wife coming in from Newark?

1220
01:10:56,914 --> 01:11:00,315
We had a fight, and she left me,
went back to Brooklyn,

1221
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:02,385
so I called her and I said,
"Why don't you come out west?

1222
01:11:02,486 --> 01:11:05,512
Maybe a change of scenery
will get us back together again."

1223
01:11:05,622 --> 01:11:08,750
She said okay, but evidently,
she changed her mind.

1224
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:11,054
- Your wife a Lakers fan?
- I am.

1225
01:11:11,161 --> 01:11:13,186
I'm a fan of everything
that's L.A.

1226
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:14,787
I love it out here.

1227
01:11:14,898 --> 01:11:16,331
He's clean.

1228
01:11:18,302 --> 01:11:19,462
You can go.

1229
01:11:20,771 --> 01:11:22,432
What are you guys
looking for, anyway?

1230
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,302
A bomb or something?
What is it?

1231
01:11:24,408 --> 01:11:25,739
Something that shouldn't be there.

1232
01:11:25,842 --> 01:11:26,968
Is that right?

1233
01:11:27,077 --> 01:11:29,102
Why don't you get an attendant
to open up the lockers and look in?

1234
01:11:29,212 --> 01:11:30,236
Maybe you'll find it.

1235
01:11:30,347 --> 01:11:32,178
That's an idea.
I'll think about it.

1236
01:11:32,282 --> 01:11:36,082
Yeah, I'd do that.
Then I'd get the right guy next time.

1237
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:48,757
Mr. Barbone,
you ever want to go to the beach,

1238
01:11:48,865 --> 01:11:51,356
here's the freeway you take
that we're on.

1239
01:11:51,468 --> 01:11:53,299
Of course, on the weekend,
there's no traffic.

1240
01:11:53,403 --> 01:11:56,201
I'm from Miami fuckin' Beach,
and you want to show me the ocean?

1241
01:11:56,306 --> 01:11:57,739
And what about the sun?

1242
01:11:57,841 --> 01:12:00,571
Does that ever shine in this town,
or is this smog around all the time?

1243
01:12:00,677 --> 01:12:03,373
They say the smog's the reason
we have such beautiful sunsets.

1244
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,471
That's what they say, huh?

1245
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:08,415
What a bunch of fuckin' bullshit.

1246
01:12:21,732 --> 01:12:24,633
I don't know how I could have
missed you in that shirt.

1247
01:12:24,735 --> 01:12:26,168
It's the same as the other one,

1248
01:12:26,269 --> 01:12:28,965
except a different-colored hibiscus,
is that right?

1249
01:12:29,072 --> 01:12:32,974
- You didn't have the key on you?
- You think I'd be standing here?

1250
01:12:33,076 --> 01:12:35,340
If you're gonna set someone up
and you want it to work,

1251
01:12:35,445 --> 01:12:37,572
it's gotta be a surprise.
Can you remember that?

1252
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:39,171
Spotted 'em, huh?

1253
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:42,979
Did you see it work in some movie
that you got beat up in?

1254
01:12:43,086 --> 01:12:45,111
Got to ask you for that key back.

1255
01:12:45,222 --> 01:12:46,689
Hey, wait a minute.

1256
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:49,156
The setup didn't work,
and you want the key back?

1257
01:12:49,259 --> 01:12:52,126
Bo said if you didn't open the locker,
the deal's off.

1258
01:12:53,096 --> 01:12:54,859
You're serious?

1259
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:57,900
This is how you guys do business?
I'm surprised you're not dead.

1260
01:12:59,202 --> 01:13:01,432
There's no fuckin' way
you're gonna get that key, okay,

1261
01:13:01,538 --> 01:13:03,768
unless you put a gun to my head,
and then maybe we'll talk.

1262
01:13:03,874 --> 01:13:06,069
Now, move away
from the fuckin' car.

1263
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:07,905
I don't need a gun for you.

1264
01:13:11,048 --> 01:13:12,447
All right, all right.

1265
01:13:12,549 --> 01:13:14,710
Slow down.
Breathe through your mouth.

1266
01:13:14,818 --> 01:13:16,718
Slow. Breathe.

1267
01:13:18,688 --> 01:13:20,656
Bear, look at me.

1268
01:13:22,993 --> 01:13:25,325
You tell your boss I don't want
to see him again.

1269
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:27,659
He made a deal with Harry,
and a deal's a deal.

1270
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:28,731
You got that?

1271
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:30,959
Okay, get up.

1272
01:13:33,737 --> 01:13:36,604
What are you hanging around
a guy like that for, anyway?

1273
01:13:36,706 --> 01:13:39,698
You were in the movies.
You were a stuntman, right?

1274
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:42,574
What's he ever done that
he can talk about?

1275
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,914
- You okay?
- Not too bad.

1276
01:13:46,016 --> 01:13:48,246
How about when you fell
down the stairs?

1277
01:13:49,753 --> 01:13:51,778
Pulled my quadriceps.

1278
01:13:53,523 --> 01:13:55,320
So how many movies
you been in?

1279
01:13:55,425 --> 01:13:57,256
About 60.

1280
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,123
- No shit?
- No shit.

1281
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:00,526
What were some of them?

1282
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,962
You didn't see none of 'em.

1283
01:14:03,066 --> 01:14:05,967
- What were some of 'em?
- You wouldn't know any names.

1284
01:14:14,544 --> 01:14:16,273
Who is it?

1285
01:14:16,379 --> 01:14:20,839
I'm the dipshit
who's never been out of Miami.

1286
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:25,814
Well, Mr. Barboni,
what a nice surprise.

1287
01:14:25,922 --> 01:14:28,356
Good to see you.
Have a seat.

1288
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:30,323
Right here, right here.

1289
01:14:35,165 --> 01:14:37,326
Ray... Ray Bones.

1290
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:39,629
Barbone. Sorry.

1291
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:42,262
Oh, yes. Uh...

1292
01:14:45,842 --> 01:14:48,208
They say the fuckin' smog
is the fuckin' reason

1293
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:50,745
you have such beautiful
fuckin' sunsets.

1294
01:14:52,349 --> 01:14:53,407
Yeah.

1295
01:14:53,783 --> 01:14:55,580
What do you mean,
he faked them out?

1296
01:14:55,685 --> 01:14:58,483
<i>He knew it was a setup
and he was ready for it.</i>

1297
01:14:58,588 --> 01:15:00,852
<i>- So where's the money?
- I guess it's still in the locker.</i>

1298
01:15:00,957 --> 01:15:03,585
You guess.
You mean you don't know?

1299
01:15:03,693 --> 01:15:06,856
<i>I mean I don't care, Bo.
I really don't care.</i>

1300
01:15:06,963 --> 01:15:09,022
Bear, I'm gonna call you later.

1301
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:13,803
Mr. Escobar, what a surprise.
Welcome to L.A.

1302
01:15:13,904 --> 01:15:15,132
Where's my nephew?

1303
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:16,830
Your who?

1304
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,272
Yayo! Where is he?

1305
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,835
I haven't seen Yayo.

1306
01:15:24,948 --> 01:15:28,042
He's my sister's kid...
no father, not too bright.

1307
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:29,778
Personally, I think he's a retard.

1308
01:15:29,886 --> 01:15:32,184
I only gave him the job as
a favor to my sister, you understand.

1309
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:34,849
Oh, sure. Family.
I know how that goes.

1310
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:37,188
He comes up here
with our product.

1311
01:15:37,294 --> 01:15:40,263
He's supposed to come back home
with the $500,000.

1312
01:15:40,363 --> 01:15:41,489
He never shows up.

1313
01:15:41,598 --> 01:15:43,759
Meanwhile, my sister's
going crazy.

1314
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:45,858
She's calling me all the time.
She's worried.

1315
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:49,700
Me, I just want to know what happened
to my fucking money.

1316
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:52,001
I don't know.
I gave the man his money.

1317
01:15:52,108 --> 01:15:53,132
I sent him on his way.

1318
01:15:54,211 --> 01:15:55,701
You gave him the money?

1319
01:15:55,812 --> 01:15:58,474
I gave him the key to a locker
that had the money in it.

1320
01:15:58,582 --> 01:16:00,709
Why would you do that...
put the money in a locker?

1321
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:02,910
Because there were
a zillion DEA guys

1322
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:04,748
hanging around the terminal.

1323
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:06,981
A zillion? That's a lot, huh?

1324
01:16:07,123 --> 01:16:10,058
Mr. Escobar, maybe your nephew
panicked and took off.

1325
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,628
Why are you talking to me
this bullshit?

1326
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:16,790
I think maybe I have Ramon and Cesar
staple your tongue to your chin!

1327
01:16:18,602 --> 01:16:20,297
What do you think?

1328
01:16:20,403 --> 01:16:22,803
I think you speak
very good English, Mr. Escobar.

1329
01:16:22,906 --> 01:16:25,773
We're gonna spend the weekend
at the Universal Sheraton.

1330
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:28,469
Take the tour. See the shark.

1331
01:16:28,578 --> 01:16:31,979
<i>Check out that
Miami Vice Action Spectacular.</i>

1332
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:33,982
Oh, nice. Yeah.

1333
01:16:34,084 --> 01:16:38,111
After, we're gonna come back here,
get my money.

1334
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:42,219
Oh, yeah.

1335
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:44,987
And Yayo, too.

1336
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,058
His fuckin' nephew?

1337
01:16:48,164 --> 01:16:50,132
<i>When you get to town,
you go straight to the bank,</i>

1338
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:51,996
<i>you raid the limo account.</i>

1339
01:16:52,102 --> 01:16:54,832
Hey, bro, I'm in town. It don't matter.
We got dick in the bank.

1340
01:16:54,938 --> 01:16:56,872
We dumped it all
into Harry's movie.

1341
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,073
I'm talking about you,
Ray Barboni,

1342
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:02,576
owning a piece
of a major motion picture.

1343
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:04,579
How much of a piece
is entirely up to you.

1344
01:17:04,681 --> 01:17:06,512
What I'm saying is,
you could invest

1345
01:17:06,616 --> 01:17:10,245
part of the 300 grand that
Palmer owes you, or all of it.

1346
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:11,911
It's entirely up to you.

1347
01:17:12,022 --> 01:17:15,185
Where's Chili Palmer?
Where's Leo Devoe?

1348
01:17:15,292 --> 01:17:17,783
Where's my fuckin' money?

1349
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:19,953
Ray... look at me.

1350
01:17:22,232 --> 01:17:23,426
What?

1351
01:17:23,533 --> 01:17:24,761
Look at me, Ray.

1352
01:17:24,868 --> 01:17:27,132
Did you just say look at you?

1353
01:17:27,237 --> 01:17:30,434
- Look at me, Ray.
- I'll tell you what, Harry.

1354
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,633
Why don't you take
a fuckin' look at this?

1355
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:36,101
And have a peek at this.

1356
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:39,877
You know, Harry, this...

1357
01:17:39,983 --> 01:17:42,918
is the exact fuckin' thing
I needed...

1358
01:17:43,019 --> 01:17:45,647
a little fuckin' exercise...

1359
01:17:45,755 --> 01:17:48,918
after that long fuckin'...

1360
01:17:49,025 --> 01:17:51,152
...plane ride.

1361
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:55,720
You got a big problem, Harry.

1362
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:00,363
Well, come on, Harry,
don't pass out on me.

1363
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:02,563
Look at me, Harry.

1364
01:18:02,672 --> 01:18:04,867
Where's my money?

1365
01:18:09,212 --> 01:18:12,306
Harry, I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

1366
01:18:12,415 --> 01:18:13,814
then I gotta shoot you,

1367
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,908
you don't tell me
what I want to know.

1368
01:18:16,019 --> 01:18:19,352
- Where's my money?
- Your money?

1369
01:18:19,456 --> 01:18:21,754
Who the fuck are you?

1370
01:18:21,858 --> 01:18:24,588
I'm Ray Barboni from Miami.

1371
01:18:24,694 --> 01:18:26,559
What, like that's supposed
to mean something to me?

1372
01:18:26,663 --> 01:18:29,598
The man you're standing on there
happens to belong to me and my partner.

1373
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:31,826
- This piece of shit owes me money.
- Get in line.

1374
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,402
But I don't like waiting in lines.

1375
01:18:33,503 --> 01:18:34,902
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami.

1376
01:18:35,004 --> 01:18:37,495
You want something,
you gotta talk to me.

1377
01:18:37,607 --> 01:18:40,838
No, no, no, no. Fuck you, fuck ball.
I mean, L.A. Is an open city,

1378
01:18:40,944 --> 01:18:44,345
and I don't think I have to
get permission from nobody for nothing.

1379
01:18:44,447 --> 01:18:48,377
Oh, really?
Well, uh, I just closed it.

1380
01:18:48,485 --> 01:18:51,579
You must be what they call
one of those quick-draw artists,

1381
01:18:51,688 --> 01:18:55,624
because of the way you've got your gun
stuck way down in your belt like that.

1382
01:18:55,725 --> 01:18:59,058
What do you got there, huh?
A wop 9?

1383
01:18:59,162 --> 01:19:00,925
Fuckin' Fiat of guns.

1384
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:03,294
Always jamming on you
at the wrong time.

1385
01:19:07,704 --> 01:19:09,831
Don't you puke
on my shoes, Harry.

1386
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:14,205
Hey, Harry,
I want you to do me a favor.

1387
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:18,906
I want you to take this gun
and put a pill in the bro over there.

1388
01:19:19,015 --> 01:19:20,539
Now, I know what you're thinking.

1389
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,948
"Why the fuck would I shoot him?
The guy's already dead."

1390
01:19:23,052 --> 01:19:25,384
But you see, Harry,
the police, they have these tests,

1391
01:19:25,488 --> 01:19:27,615
tell you whether or not
a guy fired a gun.

1392
01:19:27,724 --> 01:19:30,887
And I was never here.
Do you understand that, Harry?

1393
01:19:30,994 --> 01:19:33,485
I was never here.

1394
01:19:33,596 --> 01:19:36,258
And if you say I was,
I'm gonna come back

1395
01:19:36,366 --> 01:19:39,028
and I'm gonna throw you
right out of that fuckin' window.

1396
01:19:40,136 --> 01:19:43,162
All right, knock it off, Harry.
We haven't got a lot of time here.

1397
01:19:43,273 --> 01:19:46,071
That's it. That's it.

1398
01:19:48,578 --> 01:19:51,138
Not a worry in the world.

1399
01:19:51,247 --> 01:19:53,147
Your pool needs skimming.

1400
01:19:53,249 --> 01:19:56,047
Yeah. That was Martin.

1401
01:19:56,152 --> 01:19:58,211
He wants to have lunch tomorrow,
if you can make it.

1402
01:19:58,321 --> 01:20:00,915
- Depends on who's paying.
- Definitely not Martin.

1403
01:20:01,024 --> 01:20:03,015
Movie stars, they never
pick up the check.

1404
01:20:03,126 --> 01:20:04,650
They have no idea
what things cost.

1405
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:06,592
Of course, most of 'em
don't know their phone number

1406
01:20:06,696 --> 01:20:08,561
and a lot don't even know
their zip code.

1407
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:09,632
I don't know.

1408
01:20:09,732 --> 01:20:13,293
I just can't get used to the idea
that the two of you were together.

1409
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:16,531
- You don't like Martin much, do you?
- No, I do. I do.

1410
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,869
I think he's... I think he's short.

1411
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:22,311
But, uh...

1412
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,775
I know he's a good actor
and everything,

1413
01:20:25,882 --> 01:20:28,476
but what was it exactly
that you saw in him?

1414
01:20:30,053 --> 01:20:33,784
Martin was different then.
He wasn't a movie star.

1415
01:20:35,258 --> 01:20:38,694
Anyway, what about your story?
You thought of a title yet?

1416
01:20:38,795 --> 01:20:40,854
<i>Yeah. How about Get Shorty?</i>

1417
01:20:40,964 --> 01:20:43,455
<i>How about Chili's
Hollywood Adventure?</i>

1418
01:20:43,566 --> 01:20:45,329
I don't know.
That's a different story.

1419
01:20:45,435 --> 01:20:47,062
I'm still working on that one.

1420
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:49,934
I'm still getting
the visual fabric together.

1421
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:52,234
But I have added to it.

1422
01:20:52,342 --> 01:20:56,438
- Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
- Really?

1423
01:20:56,546 --> 01:20:58,605
She looks a lot like you.

1424
01:21:04,254 --> 01:21:05,721
I think you could be an actor.

1425
01:21:05,822 --> 01:21:08,848
I know you're acting sometimes,
but you don't show it.

1426
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:10,687
You thought I was fakin'?

1427
01:21:10,793 --> 01:21:14,593
No, not then.
I mean in general.

1428
01:21:14,697 --> 01:21:16,756
You don't mean
a movie star, though, right?

1429
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:18,629
You're talking more like
a character actor.

1430
01:21:18,735 --> 01:21:20,293
Well, whichever.

1431
01:21:20,403 --> 01:21:24,169
I could see myself in the parts
that Robert DeNiro plays.

1432
01:21:24,274 --> 01:21:26,970
Maybe even an Al Pacino movie,
you know, playin' a real hard-on.

1433
01:21:27,076 --> 01:21:29,567
But I couldn't see myself
in them movies

1434
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,579
where, like, the three guys
get left with a baby

1435
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:33,205
and they don't know
how to take care of it,

1436
01:21:33,316 --> 01:21:35,284
so they act like
grown-up assholes.

1437
01:21:35,385 --> 01:21:36,716
- Chili, look at me.
- I couldn't...

1438
01:21:44,193 --> 01:21:45,160
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1439
01:21:46,195 --> 01:21:47,753
<i>Hi, Karen, it's Doris.</i>

1440
01:21:47,864 --> 01:21:51,265
<i>Doll, you might want to come by
Cedars tonight and visit Harry.</i>

1441
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:53,198
<i>He's in the emergency room.</i>

1442
01:21:54,837 --> 01:21:56,634
Let's go.

1443
01:21:58,341 --> 01:21:59,638
What can I tell ya?

1444
01:21:59,742 --> 01:22:00,834
I stopped by his office

1445
01:22:00,944 --> 01:22:03,071
to see if he wanted to take me
to Le Dome for dinner

1446
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:06,239
when I see Harry
and some other man lying on the floor.

1447
01:22:06,349 --> 01:22:09,375
Good night, Todd.
'Night, Lewis.

1448
01:22:09,886 --> 01:22:15,017
- Oh, man. Jesus.
- Harry, my God.

1449
01:22:15,124 --> 01:22:16,716
He can't talk...
he's full of Demerol.

1450
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:18,225
What happened?

1451
01:22:18,328 --> 01:22:20,626
According to Todd...
Sergeant Randall...

1452
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:22,561
a man named Ronnie
came by Harry's office

1453
01:22:22,665 --> 01:22:24,633
to collect on a debt.

1454
01:22:24,734 --> 01:22:27,669
- He got rough and Harry shot him.
- You shot Ronnie?

1455
01:22:32,108 --> 01:22:34,975
Hello, hello.
Okay. Here we go.

1456
01:22:35,078 --> 01:22:38,138
Looks like Mr. Zimm here
has a broken jaw

1457
01:22:38,247 --> 01:22:41,876
and some neck trauma
to go with these fractured hands.

1458
01:22:41,985 --> 01:22:44,749
Excuse us, folks.

1459
01:22:48,725 --> 01:22:52,889
Harry, Martin wanted to meet us
for lunch tomorrow at the Ivy,

1460
01:22:52,996 --> 01:22:55,294
and I'd cancel, but he's going
to Cannes next week.

1461
01:22:55,398 --> 01:22:58,390
So I really think that
maybe Chili and I should still go.

1462
01:22:58,501 --> 01:23:01,800
Okay, who wants to take a crack
at wiring Mr. Zimm's jaw?

1463
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:07,873
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!

1464
01:23:07,977 --> 01:23:09,740
Hi, Bo.

1465
01:23:09,846 --> 01:23:13,009
Hey, Farrah.
Little honey bunny.

1466
01:23:13,116 --> 01:23:15,380
You wipe your feet
before you come in here?

1467
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:17,146
- Yeah.
- That's my girl.

1468
01:23:17,253 --> 01:23:20,586
Keep Uncle Bo's carpet
nice and white.

1469
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:22,385
I been calling you.
Where you been?

1470
01:23:22,492 --> 01:23:23,982
See the paper?

1471
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:26,186
Yeah, I seen it.
I don't believe it.

1472
01:23:26,295 --> 01:23:28,923
Says Harry shot Ronnie
five times...

1473
01:23:29,032 --> 01:23:31,432
four through the chest
and one through his foot.

1474
01:23:31,534 --> 01:23:35,436
His foot. Jesus.
Poor Ronnie.

1475
01:23:35,538 --> 01:23:37,438
Tonight, later on,
I got one for you,

1476
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,337
doesn't involve any heavy work.

1477
01:23:39,442 --> 01:23:41,842
I want you to go take a look
around Chili Palmer's hotel room.

1478
01:23:41,944 --> 01:23:43,309
No, I can't. I can't.

1479
01:23:44,414 --> 01:23:48,009
I gotta take Farrah to her mother's
in Costa Mesa, and...

1480
01:23:49,986 --> 01:23:51,783
...and that don't matter,
'cause I quit!

1481
01:23:51,888 --> 01:23:53,412
I don't work for you no more.

1482
01:23:53,523 --> 01:23:55,184
I just came down here to tell you
right to your face

1483
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,553
so we got no misunderstanding.

1484
01:23:56,659 --> 01:23:59,253
Bear, the Colombians are in L.A.,
all upset about their money.

1485
01:23:59,362 --> 01:24:01,421
Now if that ain't enough,
it turns out as a bonus

1486
01:24:01,531 --> 01:24:03,931
that Yo-yo was Escobar's nephew.

1487
01:24:04,033 --> 01:24:06,228
That's your problem.
You're the one that shot the guy.

1488
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:12,733
Hey, honey bunny.
Come here, Farrah.

1489
01:24:12,842 --> 01:24:13,866
Come here, honey bunny.

1490
01:24:13,976 --> 01:24:17,036
Come and see Uncle Bo.
Come on. Yeah!

1491
01:24:17,146 --> 01:24:19,671
You know how Uncle Bo
hates being alone.

1492
01:24:19,782 --> 01:24:21,716
In fact, he hates it so much,

1493
01:24:21,818 --> 01:24:25,254
he takes a fall,
he's not gonna fall by himself.

1494
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:28,812
He's gonna plea-deal his way out...
give up his ace stuntman,

1495
01:24:28,925 --> 01:24:30,688
now one of the West Coast
dope kings...

1496
01:24:30,793 --> 01:24:32,693
if they go easy on the Cat.

1497
01:24:32,795 --> 01:24:34,660
I hear in federal joints,

1498
01:24:34,764 --> 01:24:36,925
they let you spend an extra
five minutes with your daddy

1499
01:24:37,033 --> 01:24:38,364
on Father's Day.

1500
01:24:38,468 --> 01:24:39,935
Just let her go, Bo.

1501
01:24:47,543 --> 01:24:49,738
After this one, I'm out.
You understand?

1502
01:24:49,846 --> 01:24:51,837
This is the last time we talk
to each other.

1503
01:24:51,948 --> 01:24:53,245
You remember Harry's story

1504
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:55,044
about the dry cleaner
Palmer was after...

1505
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:58,086
the one that stole that $300,000
from the airline?

1506
01:24:58,187 --> 01:24:59,950
Yeah, what about him?

1507
01:25:00,056 --> 01:25:01,990
Tonight, you go have a look
around Palmer's hotel room

1508
01:25:02,091 --> 01:25:03,752
while I check out Karen Flores' place.

1509
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,021
See if he hasn't
stashed it somewhere,

1510
01:25:06,129 --> 01:25:08,893
and you meet me back here
at midnight.

1511
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:14,892
So what kind of food they got
at this Ivy place?

1512
01:25:15,004 --> 01:25:16,596
It's Continental,
but it doesn't matter.

1513
01:25:16,706 --> 01:25:18,264
Martin won't order
from the menu anyway.

1514
01:25:18,374 --> 01:25:19,341
Why not?

1515
01:25:19,442 --> 01:25:21,910
Because movie stars can never
order straight from the menu.

1516
01:25:22,011 --> 01:25:24,844
They have to think of something
they have to have that isn't on the menu.

1517
01:25:32,555 --> 01:25:35,319
Harry, what are you doin' here?
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

1518
01:25:35,424 --> 01:25:39,087
Hey, Harry, you look like you oughtta be
in one of your own horror movies.

1519
01:25:39,195 --> 01:25:42,096
- My project.
- What'd he say?

1520
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:43,495
"My project."

1521
01:25:43,599 --> 01:25:45,624
Mr. Zimm!

1522
01:25:46,602 --> 01:25:49,264
Hey, Harry!
Attaboy, killer.

1523
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,464
Right this way.

1524
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:58,813
You're a celebrity, Harry.

1525
01:25:58,915 --> 01:26:01,315
You should have shot someone
a long time ago.

1526
01:26:09,959 --> 01:26:11,392
Hi.

1527
01:26:15,298 --> 01:26:17,630
Excuse me.
How you doing?

1528
01:26:18,067 --> 01:26:19,728
Hello. Hi.

1529
01:26:19,836 --> 01:26:22,566
How you doing?
Whoa. Hey, Chili.

1530
01:26:22,772 --> 01:26:24,103
- Good to see you.
- Great to see you.

1531
01:26:25,508 --> 01:26:27,442
Oh, Harry.

1532
01:26:27,543 --> 01:26:29,170
Oh, my goodness.

1533
01:26:34,317 --> 01:26:36,251
- Hi, Martin.
- Sweet face.

1534
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,118
You look great.
You smell good, too.

1535
01:26:40,223 --> 01:26:41,190
Thanks.

1536
01:26:44,794 --> 01:26:48,924
So, Harry, I hear you had
quite an experience.

1537
01:26:49,031 --> 01:26:51,556
Well, anyway,
I'm glad you're okay.

1538
01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:52,998
You know what else?

1539
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:55,468
I'm really glad that
you rejected me 10 years ago

1540
01:26:55,571 --> 01:26:57,732
when I auditioned for the part
of Eddie Solomon,

1541
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,104
<i>the pedophile clown
in Birthday Boy.</i>

1542
01:27:00,209 --> 01:27:02,541
If I'd gotten that part,
I might have been typecast.

1543
01:27:04,013 --> 01:27:06,504
Have you guys ordered? Because I
really have something after this.

1544
01:27:06,616 --> 01:27:08,846
Can we order?
Excuse me. Could you...

1545
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:11,580
- Hi. What's your name?
- Stephanie.

1546
01:27:11,687 --> 01:27:14,281
Hi, Stephanie.
I feel like an omelet.

1547
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,221
Can you make
an egg-white omelet

1548
01:27:16,325 --> 01:27:20,989
with shallots only slightly browned,
very little olive oil, and no salt?

1549
01:27:21,097 --> 01:27:23,588
Bring one for the table.
We'll pick on it.

1550
01:27:23,699 --> 01:27:24,961
No.

1551
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:28,298
I know. How about having
those strawberry frappes...

1552
01:27:28,404 --> 01:27:30,531
you know, the little drinks
with the little strawberries in them?

1553
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,574
And bring two straws for Harry.

1554
01:27:34,043 --> 01:27:38,412
Anyway, I think the romance angle
In your story is critically important.

1555
01:27:38,514 --> 01:27:41,642
This shouldn't be just
a hop in the sack for either of them.

1556
01:27:41,751 --> 01:27:43,412
These two should fall
deeply in love.

1557
01:27:43,519 --> 01:27:44,850
Which two?

1558
01:27:44,954 --> 01:27:48,788
Later, when their lives are in danger
and the mob guy's chasing them,

1559
01:27:48,891 --> 01:27:50,552
it not only heightens the tension,

1560
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,753
but it adds a wistful element
to their romance.

1561
01:27:52,862 --> 01:27:53,829
Mob guy?

1562
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,397
I have to consider, as the mob guy,

1563
01:27:55,498 --> 01:27:58,194
it's another man's wife
I'm sleeping with, so...

1564
01:27:58,301 --> 01:28:02,032
- And after all, you have such morals.
- Mob guy?

1565
01:28:02,138 --> 01:28:06,768
Look, I have to run,
but what I would like to see is that...

1566
01:28:06,876 --> 01:28:09,401
they begin to have misgivings
about wanting the money.

1567
01:28:09,512 --> 01:28:11,810
This becomes a moral dilemma
for the two of them.

1568
01:28:11,914 --> 01:28:15,577
They rationalize taking it,
but in the end, they can't.

1569
01:28:15,685 --> 01:28:16,913
What money?

1570
01:28:17,019 --> 01:28:18,611
The 300 large.
What other money is there?

1571
01:28:18,721 --> 01:28:20,746
I know I shouldn't be talking about this
until I've read the script,

1572
01:28:20,856 --> 01:28:23,586
but I have such
a good feeling about this.

1573
01:28:23,693 --> 01:28:25,490
I am that shylock.

1574
01:28:29,098 --> 01:28:30,588
Look at me, Harry!

1575
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,202
Not bad.
You're really getting it down.

1576
01:28:36,772 --> 01:28:38,831
It scares me
how well I know this guy.

1577
01:28:38,941 --> 01:28:41,876
I mean, I could do this tomorrow,
no further preparation.

1578
01:28:44,747 --> 01:28:46,237
Doll face...

1579
01:28:46,349 --> 01:28:49,011
you really should think about
getting back into acting.

1580
01:28:49,118 --> 01:28:50,346
We could do something together.

1581
01:28:50,453 --> 01:28:53,718
- I'll give it some heavy thought.
- Okay.

1582
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,160
Take care of yourself, Harry.

1583
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,361
Enjoy.

1584
01:29:13,142 --> 01:29:15,235
Here, let me help you out.
Go ahead.

1585
01:29:19,849 --> 01:29:21,476
Suck harder.

1586
01:29:30,726 --> 01:29:33,627
Chili, wake up.
Somebody's downstairs.

1587
01:29:33,729 --> 01:29:36,630
- It's Harry.
- How you know?

1588
01:29:36,732 --> 01:29:38,791
He's doin' the same thing
you did to him...

1589
01:29:38,901 --> 01:29:40,368
playin' Letterman on TV.

1590
01:29:40,469 --> 01:29:42,266
That's not Dave,
that's a movie.

1591
01:29:43,205 --> 01:29:45,503
- You gonna go down?
- I don't know.

1592
01:29:45,608 --> 01:29:48,873
- You don't know?
- I know, I'm goin', I'm goin'.

1593
01:29:53,816 --> 01:29:56,114
- Karen, you got a gun?
- No.

1594
01:29:56,218 --> 01:29:57,776
Any kind of gun will do.

1595
01:29:57,887 --> 01:29:59,411
- No.
- No?

1596
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:09,122
<i>Sounds like Rio Bravo.</i>

1597
01:30:13,269 --> 01:30:14,793
<i>Maybe this will help.</i>

1598
01:30:29,385 --> 01:30:31,615
<i>Guess I'll take that drink now,
Charlie.</i>

1599
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,745
<i>I thought you would.</i>

1600
01:30:39,829 --> 01:30:42,423
<i>You want that gun?
Pick it up.</i>

1601
01:30:42,531 --> 01:30:44,999
<i>I wish you would.</i>

1602
01:30:47,903 --> 01:30:51,566
- I need the money.
- What money?

1603
01:30:51,674 --> 01:30:54,837
The 300 grand that you got
from a little dry cleaner named Leo.

1604
01:30:54,944 --> 01:30:56,377
Let me get this straight.

1605
01:30:56,479 --> 01:30:58,344
You break into
Karen Flores' house

1606
01:30:58,447 --> 01:31:01,245
and you ask for 300 grand
that doesn't belong to you?

1607
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:02,749
Just give me the money,
I'll be on my way.

1608
01:31:02,852 --> 01:31:05,252
I can't believe how you guys
do business out here.

1609
01:31:05,354 --> 01:31:07,322
I can't believe how fucked up
your organization is.

1610
01:31:07,423 --> 01:31:09,084
I'll tell you what...
how about I count to three

1611
01:31:09,191 --> 01:31:11,318
and I'll organize your fuckin' brain
all over the wall back there?

1612
01:31:11,427 --> 01:31:14,055
- How about that? One...
- You're gonna shoot me now, huh, Bo?

1613
01:31:14,163 --> 01:31:16,563
- Just a second. Two...
- I can't believe this.

1614
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,131
She can't talk right now.

1615
01:31:27,243 --> 01:31:30,235
That's a really nice scream.
They oughtta give you more work.

1616
01:31:30,346 --> 01:31:32,780
All right, I'll get you
the money, but it's not here.

1617
01:31:32,882 --> 01:31:33,849
I gotta go get it.

1618
01:31:33,949 --> 01:31:36,884
Okay, fine. In the meantime,
I'll just hold onto her for safekeeping.

1619
01:31:36,986 --> 01:31:39,716
- Now, you know Laurel Canyon?
- I'll find it.

1620
01:31:39,822 --> 01:31:42,757
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue,
right off of Laurel.

1621
01:31:42,858 --> 01:31:43,882
I'll be there, Karen.

1622
01:31:54,803 --> 01:31:56,293
You get the money?

1623
01:31:56,405 --> 01:31:58,339
No. What is this?

1624
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,839
Plan "B."

1625
01:32:01,977 --> 01:32:03,877
You make yourself comfortable.

1626
01:32:05,347 --> 01:32:08,180
- Karen Flores is plan "B"?
- Don't ask questions, Bear.

1627
01:32:08,284 --> 01:32:11,253
- She's a movie star!
- I don't care what she is.

1628
01:32:11,353 --> 01:32:12,945
- Oh, for Christ sake.
- Gonna make a little trade.

1629
01:32:13,055 --> 01:32:15,046
- Trade for what?
- The money, Bear.

1630
01:32:15,157 --> 01:32:16,317
You get life for kidnapping!

1631
01:32:16,425 --> 01:32:17,483
Just calm down, Bear.

1632
01:32:17,593 --> 01:32:19,959
You're talkin' about life in prison,
you want me to calm down?!

1633
01:32:20,062 --> 01:32:23,259
- Do not fade on me now, Bear.
- You're gonna shoot me now?

1634
01:32:23,365 --> 01:32:25,333
Go ahead, then! Put me
outta my misery. Go ahead!

1635
01:32:25,434 --> 01:32:26,867
I said calm the hell down,

1636
01:32:26,969 --> 01:32:28,732
unless you want to spend
the rest of your life

1637
01:32:28,837 --> 01:32:32,398
holding Farrah on your lap
in a room full of goddamn felons!

1638
01:32:33,842 --> 01:32:38,973
So... this is one of them houses
you see hangin' off the side of the cliff.

1639
01:32:39,081 --> 01:32:40,605
Where's Karen?

1640
01:32:40,716 --> 01:32:43,810
In my bathroom.
Where's the money?

1641
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:51,392
- Let me see her.
- Go ahead.

1642
01:32:53,963 --> 01:32:55,191
You okay?

1643
01:32:55,297 --> 01:32:57,925
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet,
for Christ sake.

1644
01:32:58,033 --> 01:33:00,900
She's great.
Give me the money.

1645
01:33:01,003 --> 01:33:03,836
First, I'm gonna settle something
between you and me.

1646
01:33:03,939 --> 01:33:05,839
I've been shot at before...

1647
01:33:05,941 --> 01:33:07,657
once by accident,
twice on purpose... and I'm still here.

1648
01:33:07,692 --> 01:33:09,373
Once by accident,
twice on purpose... and I'm still here.

1649
01:33:09,478 --> 01:33:11,241
And I'm gonna be here
as long as I want,

1650
01:33:11,347 --> 01:33:13,372
which means that
you gotta be somewhere else...

1651
01:33:13,482 --> 01:33:15,814
and nowhere near me,
Karen, or Harry.

1652
01:33:15,918 --> 01:33:17,146
Now, here's your money.

1653
01:33:17,253 --> 01:33:19,312
Take it, and leave the movie business

1654
01:33:19,421 --> 01:33:21,082
to the rest of us
who know what we're doing.

1655
01:33:22,858 --> 01:33:23,825
Come on, Karen.

1656
01:33:30,199 --> 01:33:32,724
You broke in my house,
and I have a witness to it.

1657
01:33:32,835 --> 01:33:33,961
What?

1658
01:33:34,069 --> 01:33:36,128
Only this time it ain't no
John Wayne or Dean Martin

in El Dorado.</i>

1660
01:33:37,673 --> 01:33:39,607
<i>That was Rio Bravo.</i>

1661
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:42,074
<i>Robert Mitchum played the drunk
in El Dorado.</i>

1662
01:33:42,177 --> 01:33:44,372
<i>Dean Martin played the drunk
in Rio Bravo.</i>

1663
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,345
Basically, it was the same part.

1664
01:33:46,448 --> 01:33:49,508
John Wayne did the same in both...
he played John Wayne.

1665
01:33:49,618 --> 01:33:52,109
I can't wait for you to be dead.

1666
01:33:52,221 --> 01:33:53,711
Are you gonna let him talk to me...

1667
01:33:57,426 --> 01:33:59,826
That's for the stairs,
and that's for the airport!

1668
01:33:59,928 --> 01:34:02,362
Get him off my carpet
before he starts to bleed.

1669
01:34:05,934 --> 01:34:07,629
You want to take this guy out?

1670
01:34:07,736 --> 01:34:10,261
Come out on the deck,
make it look like he came at us.

1671
01:34:10,372 --> 01:34:12,306
You shoot him. Self-defense.

1672
01:34:12,408 --> 01:34:13,375
Get up.

1673
01:34:13,475 --> 01:34:15,272
Shouldn't he have a weapon,
a knife or something?

1674
01:34:15,377 --> 01:34:16,537
Get it later.

1675
01:34:16,645 --> 01:34:18,840
All right, Bear.
That's enough! Enough, Bear!

1676
01:34:18,947 --> 01:34:21,711
You keep hitting him like that, he's not
gonna look like he broke in anymore.

1677
01:34:21,817 --> 01:34:23,876
He's gonna look like somebody
beat him up and then shot him.

1678
01:34:23,986 --> 01:34:25,920
No, he ain't.

1679
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:37,394
Hold on, man.
We're gonna get the fuck outta here.

1680
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:40,795
- What the hell are you doing?
- Karen, what the fuck are you doing?

1681
01:34:40,903 --> 01:34:43,736
- Oh, shit!
- She's shootin' at us! Come on.

1682
01:34:49,078 --> 01:34:51,979
Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry!

1683
01:34:53,048 --> 01:34:54,379
Wow.

1684
01:34:56,819 --> 01:34:59,310
How do you think that happened?

1685
01:34:59,421 --> 01:35:01,184
Beats the shit outta me.

1686
01:35:15,003 --> 01:35:18,029
- Were you scared up there?
- You bet.

1687
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:21,507
- You don't act like it.
- I was scared then, not now.

1688
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:23,578
How long you want me
to be scared?

1689
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:26,878
I'll be right back.

1690
01:35:47,836 --> 01:35:49,326
How'd you get in here?

1691
01:35:49,438 --> 01:35:51,770
It was easy.
I told them I was you.

1692
01:35:51,874 --> 01:35:53,842
I acted real stupid,
and they believed me.

1693
01:35:53,942 --> 01:35:55,933
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?

1694
01:35:56,044 --> 01:35:57,944
Please, don't insult me.
Just turn around.

1695
01:35:58,046 --> 01:35:59,604
Turn around.

1696
01:36:01,984 --> 01:36:04,885
Do you know that you're the dumbest
fuck I ever met in my whole life?

1697
01:36:04,987 --> 01:36:06,955
Let me take a look
in these pockets.

1698
01:36:07,055 --> 01:36:08,579
You should have told me
about Leo Devoe

1699
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:10,317
as soon as you
found out about him.

1700
01:36:10,426 --> 01:36:11,757
Why would I do
something like that?

1701
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,090
Because the guy is a customer
of mine, that's why, dummy.

1702
01:36:14,196 --> 01:36:15,663
He belongs to me.

1703
01:36:17,065 --> 01:36:18,862
Well, well, well, well, well.

1704
01:36:18,967 --> 01:36:22,960
What have we here?
"C-18."

1705
01:36:23,839 --> 01:36:25,534
Now, I wonder what this could be?

1706
01:36:25,641 --> 01:36:29,304
A locker key?
But where's the locker?

1707
01:36:29,411 --> 01:36:31,845
I checked the bag at the airport.

1708
01:36:31,947 --> 01:36:33,175
Which terminal?

1709
01:36:34,783 --> 01:36:36,182
Which terminal?

1710
01:36:36,285 --> 01:36:37,252
Sovereign.

1711
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:42,917
You found Leo, huh?

1712
01:36:43,025 --> 01:36:45,357
You found him, you took
the poor bastard's money,

1713
01:36:45,461 --> 01:36:47,759
you put it in a locker
all ready to go.

1714
01:36:47,863 --> 01:36:50,457
Why haven't you left?

1715
01:36:50,566 --> 01:36:52,557
I like it out here.

1716
01:36:55,170 --> 01:36:57,195
You know, Chili,
I been thinking...

1717
01:36:57,306 --> 01:37:00,798
there's really no reason
why you and I shouldn't get along.

1718
01:37:00,909 --> 01:37:03,343
Forget about all of that stuff
that happened before.

1719
01:37:03,445 --> 01:37:06,141
I don't even remember
how this mess started.

1720
01:37:06,248 --> 01:37:08,045
You took a swing at me
for some fuckin' thing.

1721
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:09,310
I say fuck it.

1722
01:37:09,418 --> 01:37:11,784
I say you owe me money.
I say fuck that.

1723
01:37:11,887 --> 01:37:13,479
I say you owe me
the juice out of the money.

1724
01:37:13,589 --> 01:37:15,284
I say fuck that, too.

1725
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:19,258
I say live and let die, but this...

1726
01:37:19,361 --> 01:37:22,626
this is strictly
between you and I.

1727
01:37:22,731 --> 01:37:26,792
You say nothing to nobody
about this. Understood?

1728
01:37:26,902 --> 01:37:30,394
- Whatever you say, Ray.
- I think it's only fair, don't you?

1729
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:34,903
Well, then, it's all settled.
I'll see you around.

1730
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,847
Dumb fuck.

1731
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,997
Come on.

1732
01:38:03,672 --> 01:38:05,037
The fuckin' airport.

1733
01:38:53,822 --> 01:38:55,756
Bingo, boys. Let's go.

1734
01:38:56,858 --> 01:38:59,088
Hey, Bones. Look at me.

1735
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,893
Fuck you, fuckball.

1736
01:39:10,772 --> 01:39:13,400
- Damn.
- Cut! Cut!

1737
01:39:13,508 --> 01:39:15,237
I am pushing the right button.

1738
01:39:15,344 --> 01:39:16,743
You're not pushing the right button,

1739
01:39:16,845 --> 01:39:18,403
or else that thing
wouldn't fall on the floor.

1740
01:39:18,513 --> 01:39:19,741
But it's all right.

1741
01:39:19,848 --> 01:39:22,715
Bear-man, show him
how to do it, okay?

1742
01:39:22,818 --> 01:39:26,083
- I don't know, maybe it's...
- What do you want to do, Harry?

1743
01:39:26,188 --> 01:39:27,246
We'll get it fixed.

1744
01:39:27,356 --> 01:39:30,291
Wrap. It's a wrap.
Come back tomorrow.

1745
01:39:30,392 --> 01:39:31,825
Fuck!

1746
01:39:31,927 --> 01:39:33,019
Harry, what are you doing?

1747
01:39:33,128 --> 01:39:35,289
You should have
gone into overtime to get that shot.

1748
01:39:35,397 --> 01:39:38,093
This is only the second day.
We're already two weeks behind.

1749
01:39:39,635 --> 01:39:41,193
And do me a favor,
all right, Harry?

1750
01:39:41,303 --> 01:39:43,134
Here's what I don't understand.

1751
01:39:43,238 --> 01:39:45,229
Martin already told me
that he loves it.

1752
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:47,831
Buddy, I just don't think that
Martin is right, okay?

1753
01:39:47,943 --> 01:39:49,103
Why the hell not?

1754
01:39:49,211 --> 01:39:51,805
Because he's too short. Come on.

1755
01:39:51,913 --> 01:39:54,108
Why does he keep pushing
Martin Weir?

1756
01:39:54,216 --> 01:39:55,513
Packaging.

1757
01:39:55,617 --> 01:39:58,177
You can't make a Martin Weir
into a Mel Gibson.

1758
01:39:58,286 --> 01:40:02,154
Do you want to go to Morton's
or Dan Tana's?

1759
01:40:02,257 --> 01:40:03,622
I don't know.
