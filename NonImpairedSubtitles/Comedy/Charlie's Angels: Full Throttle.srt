1
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,633
Northern Mongolia

2
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,629
Get off the babysitter.
Daddy's home.

3
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,608
What is an Angel doing
so far from Heaven?

4
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,218
I'm no Angel.

5
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,246
This is hostel, yeah?

6
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,988
I'm good at the bull, no?

7
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,672
Ray Carter
U.S. Marshal

8
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,911
Marshal Ray Carter? I'm Alex Munday.
I'll be your rescuer today.

9
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,250
I didn't think you'd find me.
How many men do you have?

10
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,517
I've got two girlfriends in the bar.

11
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,320
They have 50 armed men.

12
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,794
I know. It hardly seems fair.
Come on.

13
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,336
- What is it?
- My ribs.

14
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,870
Dylan? Dylan,
we need to get out of here.

15
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,563
I'm on top of it.

16
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:23,449
- They got my ring.
- I'm sure your wife will understand.

17
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:38,895
Kill them!

18
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,097
Kill them all!

19
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,782
Plan B.

20
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,169
Just once, I'd like to walk out of a bar.

21
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,266
Let's go!

22
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,314
Now!

23
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,506
- Get in!
- You got him?

24
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,008
Dylan!

25
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,216
Go for it!

26
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,379
- Dylan!
- I'm trying!

27
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,025
I'm afraid
I underestimated you guys.

28
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,397
Yeah.

29
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,903
That happens a lot.

30
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,758
It was three girls!

31
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,696
Three crazy beautiful girls.

32
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,926
But we have the ring.

33
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,003
I always knew this day would come...

34
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,871
Let's go to plan B.

35
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,239
<i>Once upon a time, there were three</i>
<i>very different little girls.</i>

36
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,760
Come on, Alex. This is the last pass.
You can do it!

37
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,405
Harder! Harder! Harder!

38
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,152
I want you! I want you now!

39
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,354
<i>Who grew up to be three</i>
<i>very different women.</i>

40
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,390
No.

41
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,748
Okay.

42
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,025
You, hot water.

43
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,194
Here it goes. Here it goes.

44
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,432
There we go.

45
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:48,137
<i>Now they work for me.</i>
<i>My name is Charlie.</i>

46
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,172
William Rose Bailey
Department of Justice

47
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,576
Perimeter secure.
We're ready for takeoff.

48
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,243
Well done, Agent McDowell.

49
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,296
Hey, check this out.

50
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,406
Our first piece of mail.

51
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,715
- Your 10-year high-school reunion.
- It'll be a fun night, Nat.

52
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,254
- Isn't that cool?
- It's great.

53
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,091
I still can't believe Nat and Pete
are moving in together.

54
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,857
- Our little Angel's growing up.
- It's wild that Natalie owns property.

55
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,364
The most expensive thing I own
are these boots.

56
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,766
- Excuse me. Those are my boots.
- Whatever. My point is...

57
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,904
I forgot my point.

58
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,273
You're broke, horny
and wearing my boots.

59
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,381
Thank you.

60
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:51,281
So you thought you could escape
my fortress.

61
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,084
Not so fast.

62
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,725
- Oh, my God! Jason.
- Surprise.

63
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,960
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

64
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,796
That was fun.

65
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,802
Fun. Yeah.

66
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:13,437
- What are you doing here?
- I miss you. Look...

67
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,978
What are you doing later, after this?
Later on?

68
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,120
Jason, I thought we were
on a time-out.

69
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,317
What? We can't fool around at all?

70
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,827
Hey, Jason.
I didn't think you'd make it.

71
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:36,093
Yeah, the photo shoot ran late. Plus,
I wanted to miss all the heavy stuff.

72
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,168
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey.

73
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,305
- How's the sequel going?
- Great.

74
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,669
We had, like, 13 writers,
so it should be pretty good.

75
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,743
- I loved the first one.
- Yeah, it was great.

76
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:52,941
Sorry. We got a great title for this
one: <i>Maximum Extreme-2.</i>

77
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,989
The premiere's Friday,
so I brought you tickets.

78
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,523
I love tickets!

79
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,521
- Hello?
- Yeah?

80
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,665
- Be right in.
- Thanks.

81
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,357
Sorry.

82
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,033
- Thanks for helping out, Jason.
- Yeah, yeah.

83
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,197
Charlie.

84
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,806
Bosley!

85
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,675
What's happening, Angels?
How y'all doing?

86
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,041
- Hey.
- Hey, Bos.

87
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,707
Look here. I see my brother
ain't checked the books in a while.

88
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,046
We have a book?

89
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,324
Look here, lovelies, I only been here
a few days, but will you explain

90
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,959
what the hell is this?

91
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,185
Now, what...?

92
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,695
Careful with that, Bos.

93
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,864
I'm all right.

94
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:47,534
And I also see y'all being played.
Five G's for a Kevlar vest?

95
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,539
- We need those.
- They're made especially for us.

96
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,769
What? You all fine, but you crazy.

97
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,340
What?

98
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,075
Bosley, come here.

99
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,076
- Have a seat, Bos.
- Okay.

100
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,549
- Bos.
- What?

101
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,189
B.

102
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,655
Your brother didn't sweat the details.

103
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,091
- We do what it takes.
- Right.

104
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,287
So, what does a Bosley do
around here?

105
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,433
- He does the most important job of all.
- What's that?

106
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,436
He connects us with Charlie.

107
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,674
Okay. All right. All right.

108
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,538
- <i>Good morning, Angels.</i>
- Good morning, Charlie.

109
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,945
<i>Bosley, I hope the Angels</i>
<i>aren't being too rough on you.</i>

110
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:36,076
Man, please. I date fat women.
What are you talking about?

111
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,217
<i>Great work in Mongolia, Angels</i>

112
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,883
<i>but I'm afraid the case</i>
<i>has taken a new turn.</i>

113
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,428
Goddamn! What the f...?
Look... Look...

114
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,131
I know where I'm watching
the game at tonight. Look at that.

115
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,534
<i>Angels, I'd like to introduce Roger</i>
<i>Wixon, senior director of the FBI.</i>

<i>innocent lives at stake.</i>

121
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,147
Hey, I'm busy watching

122
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,948
Good job, Bos.

<i>Angels, you're aware of the Federal</i>

<i>but when they are read together,</i>
<i>their codes unlock each other.</i>

131
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,148
Who wears the rings?

132
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,983
<i>The head of the U.S. Marshal Service</i>
<i>was wearing one.</i>

133
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,091
- Ray Carter.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

- <i>Couple of fractured ribs, but I'll live.</i>

147
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,056
- We'll start at the Caufield house.
- See if that leads us to HALO.

148
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,560
Hey, Charlie, we could really use
Bosley's help on this one.

149
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,222
- Get to drive the racecar?
- Not today.

150

- Blow up a castle?
- Not yet, Bos.

151

Well, what do y'all need me to do?

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,944
Freeze, ladies. If you're not a dead
body, other side of the ropes.

159
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,242
We got a serious situation here.
My men have the area secure.

160
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,613
I have to ask you
to evacuate immediately.

161
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:27,555
We got a 211, a 183, believe it or not,
we got an 11-350, and it ain't pretty.

162
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,893
An 11-350? You found an illegal
chinchilla ranch on the premises?

163
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,532
It's a chinchilla farm.

164
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,427
But you're good.

165
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,797
Negatory to orders
to relinquish locality.

166
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,972
Circumspect to your observation

167
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:45,132
we'll proceed to the interior of the
dwelling with your accompaniment.

168
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,270
Well, I do not copy. Repeat, do not
copy. I'll have to ask my sergeant.

169
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,815
Your sergeant is here.

170
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,928
Hands off.

171
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,337
If you had your game faces on at the
academy, you ought to figure this out.

172
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,408
Simple café coronary.
Freak show choked to death.

173
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,138
Questions?

174
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,512
Examination of soft palate reveals
porcine byproduct

175
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,347
lodged in vestibule.

176
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,021
Okay, let's do this. Come on, baby.

177
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,251
Caufield shows no signs
of trauma to the larynx.

178
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,056
His struggle pattern indicates
that he didn't choke.

179
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,528
He was smothered.

180
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,192
Ladies, we got some
carnauba residue.

181
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,167
Pineapple.

182
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,467
Oh, it's Sex Wax. Best for your stick.

183
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,870
Pardon me?

184
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,136
- The killer's a surfer.
- How do you know?

185
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,441
He used the credit card he uses
to scrape wax off his board

186
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,180
to gain entry into the house.

187
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,650
Thrasher scumbag surfers.

188
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,715
Freeze!

189
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,289
I found a foreign print. He was wearing
reissued 1989 Air Jordans.

190
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,327
A limited promotional version sold

191
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,728
only at the Foot Locker
in Fontana, in the summer of 2002.

192
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,068
There's a discrepancy
in weight distribution

193
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:22,070
between the left and right sides.

194
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,904
An anterior cruciate ligament
that was repaired in the last year.

195
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,408
All right, who did it?

196
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,741
A killer with a scar on his knee
who surfs.

197
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:32,975
Did he stink?

198
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,746
There's a hurricane off Baja. That
means good swells for south beaches.

199
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,219
Was there a lot of blood?

200
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,359
Offshore winds, Third Point.
Malibu's pumping.

201
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,519
- Alex, surfboards are at your house.
- Share it with me, Angels.

202
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,759
Freeze!

203
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,005
Daddy? Daddy!

204
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:58,268
Darling! I was meeting your mother
in Bali, and they cancelled the flight.

205
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:03,142
Some sort of monsoon.
So how is my favorite little ferret?

206
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,647
Do the face.

207
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,386
No, come on. Do it properly.

208
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,455
That is so cute.
I do the whiskers with my dad.

209
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,458
Mr. Munday, it is such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

210
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,134
I'm Dylan.

211
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,462
That's Natalie.

212
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,104
I assure you,
none of the stories are true.

213
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,673
Well, some of them are.

214
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,408
So you work with Alex
at the hospital?

215
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:41,379
Yes! Natalie works
in the psychiatric ward

216
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,613
and Dylan is the head
of gynecology.

217
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,952
Really?

218
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,922
- So young.
- I know.

219
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:54,191
We were just on our way out. We have
a major procedure coming up, so...

220
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,562
- Duty calls. Sorry.
- I've got to prep.

221
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,761
Scrub up.

222
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,303
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

223
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,735
See you in a minute.

224
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,399
It's just a tiny emergency.
Make yourself at home.

225
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,511
We'll talk later.
Go save lives.

226
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,507
Love you.

227
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,143
Head of gynecology?

228
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,428
Wait a second.

229
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,333
Bos? There's a waxer on your 6.

230
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,528
Is that you, Lord?

231
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,366
<i>Get in there and see</i>
<i>if he uses pineapple Sex Wax.</i>

232
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,441
Dylan, check it out.

233
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,139
I got sand in my ass.
I can't hardly walk.

234
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,249
Just blend in. Be cool, Bos.

235
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,152
Got any wax?

236
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,794
Great job, Bos.

237
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,724
Is that grape? It's grape.

238
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,458
It's grape!

239
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,727
Yes, sir!

240
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,494
Suspect four eliminated.

241
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,302
What's up, Angel?

242
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,881
- Madison Lee?
- Natalie Cook?

243
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,312
Oh, my God.

244
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,185
How did you know?

245
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,086
- I get the newsletter.
- Of course.

246
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:31,756
Wow. I've heard so many stories
about you. You're my favorite Angel.

247
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,331
She won the Nobel Prize for her
research on flying mammals.

248
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,695
And predicted Carmine DeSoto's
every move

249
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,167
<i>by using the Cosmo</i>
Bedside Astrologer.

250
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:47,105
I also set the clock on Charlie's VCR.

251
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,244
And she invented the molar mic.

252
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,111
- Dylan and Alex?
- Yeah.

253
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,320
- God, how I miss stakeouts.
- I know. Aren't they the best?

254
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,359
Bring it on Bitch!

255
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,397
Only one waxer left.

256
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,691
Wait a second.

257
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,734
Subpatellar scar, left knee.

258
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:15,134
Check it out. Brown shorts, red board,
11 o'clock. What do you think?

259
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,067
- Yummy.
- That's what I thought.

260
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,077
Case closed. Nat, move in.
Dylan thinks he's hot.

261
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,305
What do you mean?

262
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,109
You always fall for the bad guy.

263
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,652
Then this guy must be really evil.

264
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,584
You should see the new agency.
It's beautiful.

265
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,591
Maybe I will. Tell Charlie hello
for me when you see him.

266
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,861
You know.

267
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,683
There she goes.

268
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,255
Who do you think will be
the first of us to leave?

269
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,294
You, me or Natalie?

270
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,361
- What are you talking about?
- I think it'll be Nat.

271
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,195
Why? Did she say something?

272
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,372
Nat and Pete live together now.
Soon they'll be engaged

273
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,700
and you and I will wear
pink dresses

274
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,207
at the wedding
of Mr. And Mrs. Pete Kominsky.

275
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:32,339
Yeah, but even if she got married,
she'd never leave us.

276
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:36,510
Sooner or later, you and I are gonna
have to break in a new Angel.

277
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,515
<i>Good morning, Angels.</i>

278
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,160
Good morning, Charlie.

279
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,226
- <i>Good morning, Angels.</i>
- Good morning, Charlie.

280
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,198
<i>Good morning, Angels.</i>

281
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,234
Good morning, Charlie.

282
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,310
Good morning, Charlie.

283
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:08,044
I mean, you didn't think it would be
the three of us forever, did you?

284
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,547
I think I lost my nuts.
Your nuts ever get small?

285
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:16,092
When I get in water, they just shrink
up. They become like one marble.

286
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,273
Killer, huh?

287
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,270
I just got so excited.

288
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,276
When it's big like that,
I love to ride it hard and rough.

289
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Sorry.

290
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:43,420
The way I was getting pounded,
I'm gonna be wet for hours.

291
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,003
Catch you later.

292
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,032
Randy Emmers.

293
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,874
- Pineapple Sex Wax.
- "The Coal Bowl."

294
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,539
Hey, check it out.
"Leo," that could be his next target.

295
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,321
This is it.

296
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,326
The Coal Bowl.

297
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,762
Let's get dirty.

298
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,005
- I'll buy in.
- I'll find Leo.

299
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,649
I'll look for Emmers.

300
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,942
- I'll look for Emmers.
- Yeah.

301
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,148
All right, Leo, you're mine.

302
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,954
Good luck.

303
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,626
- You in charge here?
- You know it.

304
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,601
- I want in.
- It's a two G buy-in. Winner takes all.

305
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:07,135
- Rules are, there are no rules.
- I'm down.

306
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,363
Three out of four
don't cross the finish line.

307
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,074
I'll take those odds.

308
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,116
Hey, how's it going?

309
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,515
- Metzger's at the far double.
- Is this your first time...?

310
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,848
Carmichael's at the finish line.

311
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,184
I was thinking may...

312
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,579
You and Pete moving in together
is a big deal.

313
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,548
- Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
- So where do you see this going?

314
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,244
Going? I'm confused.

315
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,357
Okay, say someone was
to come up to me and say:

316
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,017
"Hey, Dylan, do you think
Natalie wants to get married?"

317
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:09,527
What? Did Pete ask you to ask me
if I wanted to get married?

318
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,931
- No.
- Because we just moved in together.

319
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,229
Heads up, I've spotted Emmers.
I'm on him.

320
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,632
Red bike, red helmet.

321
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,658
Nat, number 25. Check it out.

322
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,359
The lion. That's Leo.

323
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,465
I got it. The guy in blue.

324
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,081
I got shut out.

325
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,689
- What was that?
- He's after Leo.

326
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,699
He just took out a guy
in the front double.

327
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,303
- He's making his way up to Leo.
- I'm gonna get him.

328
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,722
That's it! Let's get in there.

329
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,179
I got him, I got him!

330
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,185
- He's gonna crush him!
- Look out, Nat!

331
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,886
What the hell are you doing?!

332
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,523
Nat, he's on your 6.

333
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,666
No, Natalie!

334
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,535
- Natalie!
- I'm okay.

335
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,770
We gotta take him out!

336
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,788
I'll get back in.

337
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,193
Let's go!

338
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,597
Get him at the double.

339
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,343
- You okay?
- Yeah.

340
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,446
Hey, what are you doing with my bike?

341
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,812
Dylan!

342
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,180
The Thin Man.

343
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,955
He's dead.

344
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:06,390
- What the hell is going on?
- Hey, you're just a kid.

345
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,361
I'm 15 and a half.

346
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,001
Photos. Alan Caufield.

347
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,802
- Max Petroni.
- How'd you know my real name?

348
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,467
Helen Zaas?

349
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,946
<i>Helen Zaas.</i>

350
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,917
My name
before I went into

351
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,582
the Witness Protection Program
8 years ago.

352
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,888
And then I became Dylan Sanders.

353
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,588
<i>When the FBI realized</i>
<i>the young lady's potential</i>

354
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,430
<i>they gave me a call.</i>

355
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,434
- Okay, wait. Helen Zaas?
- Yeah.

356
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,003
- That's your name?
- Yeah.

357
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,969
Helen Zaas.

358
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:56,108
So where does that name come
from originally? Is that Ass-tralian?

359
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,948
Yeah.

360
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,108
Oh, my God, you must have been
the butt of every joke.

361
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:06,416
- Did you drive an Aston Martin?
- Alex, we're being asinine.

362
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,115
Yes, you are.

363
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,489
Don't worry, Dylan. We're still
gonna be your best butties.

364
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:17,131
<i>Now, Angels, a rose by any</i>
<i>other name still smells as sweet.</i>

365
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,565
Thank you, Charlie.
It's not that funny.

366
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,863
Yeah, it is.

367
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,802
- Bos, can I get a ruling on this one?
- You sure can.

368
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:28,308
You know what? Personally,
I'm not interested in Helen Zaas.

369
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,241
I'm more concerned about yours.

370
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,508
No matter what,
you're still gonna be our Dylan.

371
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,479
- Thank you, Bos.
- You're welcome.

372
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:39,054
Let me guess,
you fell for the bad guy.

373
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,748
I fell for the worst guy.

374
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,156
But he was so cute,
and I liked him so much.

375
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,920
We had so much fun together

376
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,964
just driving around,
listening to metal and...

377
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,794
8 years ago

378
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,041
And then one night,
things got really bad.

379
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:14,555
I love you!
I would die for you, Seamus!

380
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,124
O'Grady.

381
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,158
You got some balls.

382
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:32,502
He said he'd kill me if I told anyone,
but I had to put him away.

383
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,805
- Of course you did.
- You did the right thing.

384
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,009
- He was my first.
- Really?

385
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,051
- But you told me you never did it.
- My first bust.

386
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,711
- Yeah.
- Who was this guy?

387
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,450
- Seamus O'Grady.
- O'Grady?

388
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,860
- As in the Irish mob?
- I sent him to prison.

389
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,493
Right now

390
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,510
O'Grady.

391
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,577
You're out.

392
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,824
O'Grady, what about your belongings?

393
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,937
So if I have these, she'll find me?

394
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,048
- The O'Gradys killed my parents.
- What?

395
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,240
Sorry, Max.

396
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,877
I testified against them.

397
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:55,251
Wait a second. Alan Caufield.
He testified against the O'Gradys.

398
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,623
That's it. The O'Gradys must have
HALO. This is our one lead.

399
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,889
The Thin Man.

400
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,795
- Our favorite assassin.
- That's right.

401
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,631
- This needs to go get analyzed.
- Yes, let's get up in there and do that.

402
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,432
Let me see it.

403
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,708
Yeah, I know exactly what this is.
I have one.

404
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,740
The nuns gave it to us
at the orphanage.

405
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,745
Orphanage.

406
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,647
- Good work.
- <i>Max is in our protective custody now.</i>

407
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,780
- <i>It's up to us to keep him safe.</i>
- Hey, I know the safest place in town.

408
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,100
Listen, don't you worry about a thing.

409
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,336
No O'Grady ever set foot
in South Central. Can you dig it?

410
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,002
- Yeah.
- This is my mama house.

411
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,978
Rule number one: Don't look
her in the eye. Understand?

412
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,845
Or she'll pop. Can you dig it?

413
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,011
- Bosley.
- Yes, ma'am?

414
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,745
You get over here.

415
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,117
Hey, Mama.

416
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,783
- What kind of trouble you in now?
- I'm not in any trou... Yes, ma'am.

417
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,223
- Come on.
- Yes, ma'am.

418
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,812
- Look at those knockers.
- Boys!

419
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,048
Mother superior will see you now.

420
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,655
Mother, do you recognize this man?

421
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,888
Of course I know who he is.

422
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,330
We called him Anthony,
after St. Anthony of Padua

423
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,495
healer of the mute.
Please come forward.

424
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,798
Please, girls.

425
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,042
But his real name, like so much
about him, was a mystery.

426
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,388
He came to us when he was 7.

427
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:13,363
He was found wandering in the hills,
living off roots and insects.

428
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,791
We believe his family was in
a Romanian circus troupe

429
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,896
who died in a terrible fire.

430
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,096
Although the doctors could find
nothing physically wrong

431
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,241
he never spoke a word.

432
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,607
And there were other idiosyncrasies.
He was a painfully shy child

433
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:34,108
until it came time
for his monthly haircut.

434
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,763
Then one morning,
he was simply gone.

435
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,765
The Thin Man was protecting Max.

436
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,796
So you're saying this man is the sole
benefactor of your orphanage?

437
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,567
Yes, he really is an angel.

438
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,435
Mother, have you had
contact with him since?

439
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,582
Well, not really that much

440
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,149
except for the odd haircut
now and then.

441
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,358
But he does send gifts.
Like this morning.

442
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,920
- Emmers' car.
- That is a nice ride.

443
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:25,865
An original 1967
numbers-matching GTO.

444
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,165
- <i>Thorn Birds.</i>
- I know.

445
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,303
Bird poo.

446
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,973
What order did you girls
say you were from again?

447
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,813
- <i>Larus californicus.</i>
- California gull.

448
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,286
Fecal matter consists mostly
of scaly clypeiform.

449
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,187
Sardines that fed
on large brown algae, I'd say.

450
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,829
There's also traces of tanker fuel
and storm-water runoff as well.

451
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,966
Sea gulls, tankers, storm water.

452
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,533
San Pedro Harbor.

453
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,220
- Who are you?
- What?! Wait.

454
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,020
- What?
- Who are you?

455
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,682
Oh, Jason Gibbons.

456
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,325
The actor.

457
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,658
Maybe you've seen
<i>Maximum Extreme.</i>

458
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,323
No.

459
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,062
- It was such a big movie.
- What are you doing here?

460
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,469
- I'm Alex's boyfriend.
- Alex's boyfriend.

461
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,701
Yeah. Well, technically,
we're on what she calls a time-out.

462
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,737
- What does that mean?
- Exactly. Thank you.

463
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:49,851
Yeah. I gotta say, you must be
the world's most understanding father.

464
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,916
- Why?
- All the wild stuff she does.

465
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,582
When I first met Alex,
I thought she was a bikini waxer.

466
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,025
It was months before
I knew about Charlie.

467
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,730
Who's Charlie?

468
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,461
San Pedro Harbor

469
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,176
<i>Merkin.</i>

470
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,378
That was the name
of Seamus' pit bull.

471
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:31,922
Armed guards.
Security looks pretty tight.

472
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,690
This dock is like a fortress.

473
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,959
ID badges.
I think cargo's our best bet.

474
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,899
- <i>Townsend Agency.</i>
- Bos, recon incoming.

475
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,040
- Got you, baby.
- <i>Yeah, check the photo.</i>

476
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,313
That's our man.

477
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,785
The Treasure Chest.

478
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,746
- Do a little dance.
- Make a little love.

479
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,750
Get down tonight.

480
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:42,063
- There he is, first table on the right.
- Yeah, baby!

481
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,585
Hold.

482
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,438
- Paddy O'Malley?
- Top of the morning to you.

483
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:07,339
You know, you just don't look much
like any Paddy I've ever seen before.

484
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,744
Ain't never heard
of no black Irish?

485
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,437
- Black Irish?
- That's right.

486
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,607
Who do you think invented
the McRib, Lucky Charms, huh?

487
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,913
- Shamrock Shake? That's ours.
- Give me your papers.

488
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,851
- What?
- Your papers.

489
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,685
Let me tell you

490
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,349
you got nerve to ask me
about my papers.

491
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,860
My family suffered, man,
for lack of potatoes.

492
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,965
Foot-and-mouth disease.
Canker sores. Circumcision.

493
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,034
- Circumcision?
- Right, my wife just had a set of twins.

494
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,965
- Both leprechauns.
- Leprechauns?

495
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,936
Get a whiff.
Irish Spring.

496
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,202
You don't believe that,
wipe your ass with a four-leaf clover.

497
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,437
McGinty!

498
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,240
Get this stuff on the ship.

499
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,827
- Tough, eh?
- That was heavy.

500
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,792
I say we should take a break.

501
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,682
Wait a second.

502
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,288
I smell a rat.
