1
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:14,687
If lоок at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull,...

2
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,909
..there's very little of the midbrain
that we can actually see.

3
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:22,279
Yet, as demonstrated
in my lecture last week,...

4
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:28,493
..if the under aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart,...

5
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:33,371
..the upper portion of the stem of the brain
can be seen.

6
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:38,885
This so-called brainstem
consists of the midbrain,...

7
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,394
..a rounded protrusion called the pons,...

8
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,643
..and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata...

9
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:53,519
..which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum...

10
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:56,615
..and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.

11
00:05:57,451 --> 00:06:00,155
Are there any questions before we proceed?

12
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:02,571
I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.

13
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:07,582
That's Fronkonsteen.

14
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,627
I beg your pardon?

15
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:13,417
My name. It's pronounced "Fronkonsteen".

16
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,507
But aren't you the grandson
of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein,...

17
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:22,592
..who dug up freshly buried corpses
and transformed dead components into...

18
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,346
Yes, yes!

19
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:25,552
Yes!

20
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,724
We all know what he did!

21
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:33,396
But I'd rather be remembered
for my own small contributions to science...

22
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:37,527
..and not because of
my accidental relationship...

23
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:41,286
..to a famous... cuckoo!

24
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,956
Now, if you don't mind,
can we have your question?

25
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:51,379
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction...

26
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,551
..between reflexive
and voluntary nerve impulses.

27
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:58,884
Good. Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that distinction,...

28
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:01,051
..why don't we proceed?

29
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,148
Mr Hilltop here,
with whom I have never worked...

30
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:17,076
..or given any prior instructions to,...

31
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:21,158
..has graciously offered his services
for today's demonstration.

32
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:26,204
Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet
and stand beside this table?

33
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,090
Nice... hopping.

34
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,303
Mr Hilltop,...

35
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,558
..would you raise... your left knee, please?

36
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,904
You have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse.

37
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:57,076
lt begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex,...

38
00:07:57,162 --> 00:08:00,661
..passes through the brainstem
and to the muscles involved.

39
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:03,074
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

40
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:08,411
Reflex movements are those
which are made independently of the will,...

41
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,748
..but are carried out along pathways...

42
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:15,339
..which pass between the peripheral nervous
system and the central nervous system.

43
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,756
You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch!

44
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,549
We are not aware of these impulses.

45
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:25,560
Neither do we intend them
to carry out our contraction of muscles.

46
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,141
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.

47
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:32,565
But what if we block the nerve impulse
by simply applying local pressure,...

48
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:35,694
..which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp...

49
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:40,282
..just at the swelling
on the posterior nerve roots...

50
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,495
..for, oh, say... five or six seconds?

51
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:52,501
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard!

52
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,716
As you can see,
all communication is shut off.

53
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:03,016
ln spite of our mechanical magnificence,...

54
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,731
..if it were not for this continuous stream
of motor impulses,...

55
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,897
..we would collapse...

56
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,323
..like a bunch of broccoli!

57
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,365
Ohhh!

58
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,073
ln conclusion, it should be noted...

59
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,623
- Give him an extra dollar.
- Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

60
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,631
..that any more than common injury...

61
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:32,179
- ..to the nerve root is always serious.

62
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,966
Because once a nerve fibre is severed,...

63
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:39,015
..there is no way, in heaven or on earth,...

64
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,262
..to regenerate life back into it.

65
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:44,895
Are there any last questions before we leave?

66
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,941
Uh, Dr Frank...

67
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:50,520
- Fronkonsteen...
- Yes?

68
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:54,992
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case...

69
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,366
..until, by some extraordinary means,...

70
00:09:57,456 --> 00:10:01,074
..it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion?

71
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:04,706
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

72
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:09,000
Why, the worm, sir.

73
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:13,671
Yes! lt seems to me l did read something
of that incident when l was a student.

74
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:17,383
But you have to remember that a worm,
with very few exceptions,...

75
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,683
..is not a human being.

76
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:24,558
But wasn't that the basis
of your grandfather's work, sir?

77
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,727
The reanimation of dead tissue?

78
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,856
My grandfather was a very sick man.

79
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,780
But as a Fronkonsteen,
aren't you the least bit curious about it?

80
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:39,284
Doesn't bringing back to life what was
once dead hold any intrigue for you?

81
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:43,835
You are talking about
the nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind.

82
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,998
Dead is dead!

83
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,926
But look at what has been done
with hearts and kidneys.

84
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,632
Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys!

85
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:54,213
l'm talking about the central nervous system!

86
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:55,339
But, sir...

87
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,972
l am a scientist, not a philosopher!

88
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:00,897
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel...

89
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:03,270
..than of mending a broken nervous system!

90
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:08,317
- But what about your grandfather's work?
- My grandfather's work was doo-doo!

91
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,323
I am not interested in death!

92
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,158
The only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life!

93
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:25,587
Class...

94
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,800
..is...

95
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,545
..dismissed.

96
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,973
Dr Frankenstein...

97
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,605
That's... Fronkonsteen.

98
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,191
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

99
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:55,700
l have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you
the will of your great-grandfather.

100
00:11:56,165 --> 00:12:00,910
Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.

101
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,886
Oh, my sweet darling.

102
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:20,561
Oh, my dearest love.
I'll count the hours that you're away.

103
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,523
Oh, darling, so will I.

104
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,935
- Not on the lips.
- What?

105
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,572
I'm going to that part at Nanna and Nicky's
later. I don't wanna smear my lipstick.

106
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:31,367
- You understand.
- Of course.

107
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,995
All aboard!

108
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:36,701
- Oh, dear!
- Well... l guess this is it.

109
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,784
Freddy, darling!

110
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:43,171
Oh, how can l say in a few minutes
what it's taken me a lifetime to understand?

111
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,333
- Won't you try?
- All right.

112
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,336
You've got it, mister.

113
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,765
I'm yours. All of me. What else can l say?

114
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,391
My sweet love...

115
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,717
The hair! The hair! Just been set.

116
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,804
Sorry... Sorry.

117
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:00,138
I hope you like old-fashioned weddings.

118
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,391
I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights!

119
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,644
Oh! You're incorrigible!

120
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:06,814
Does that mean...

121
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:11,611
- ..you love me?
- You bet your boots it does.

122
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:13,495
Oh, my only love.

123
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:15,657
Taffeta, darling.

124
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,874
Taffeta, sweetheart.

125
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,533
No, the dress is taffeta.

126
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,706
- It wrinkles so easily.
- Oh.

127
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,293
All aboard!

128
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:26,625
Oh, there's that horrid man again.

129
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,637
Well, hurry now,
before l make a fool of myself.

130
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,799
Oh! Nails! Oh...

131
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:33,350
Sorry...

132
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:43,982
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Freddy.

133
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:51,112
Darling!

134
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,936
- Harry, he was at it again.
- So what do you want me to do about it?

135
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,482
Every day!

136
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,394
Let him! Let him!

137
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,318
New York next! Everybody out for New York!

138
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:55,435
Pardon me, boy!
Is this the Transylvania Station?

139
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,848
Ja,ja! Track 29!

140
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,437
Oh! Can l give you a shine?

141
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,606
Uh... No, thanks.

142
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:35,430
Dr Frankenstein?

143
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,189
Fronkonsteen.

144
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,192
You're putting me on.

145
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:48,610
No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen.

146
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:51,945
Do you also say Frodorick?

147
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,117
No. Frederick.

148
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,413
Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen?

149
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,126
It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen.

150
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:01,876
I see.

151
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,510
You must be Igor.

152
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,133
No. It's pronounced I-gor.

153
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,810
- But they told me it was Igor.
- Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

154
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:14,931
Uh... You were sent by
Herr Falkstein, weren't you?

155
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:19,436
Yes. My grandfather
used to work for your grandfather.

156
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:23,239
How nice.

157
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,447
Of course, the rates have gone up.

158
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,654
Of course. l'm sure we'll get along splendidly.

159
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,790
- Oh!

160
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,459
Sorry. I... Uh...

161
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,421
You know, l don't mean to embarrass you,
but l'm a rather brilliant surgeon.

162
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:41,045
Perhaps l could help you with that hump.

163
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,210
What hump?

164
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,218
Let's go.

165
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,386
Allow me, master.

166
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:54,097
Oh... Thanks very much.

167
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,901
Walk this way.

168
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,239
This way.

169
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,640
l think you'll be more comfortable in the rear.

170
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,383
Oh...

171
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:32,888
- Ooh!
- What was that?

172
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:35,057
Oh, that'll be Inga.

173
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,479
Herr Falkstein thought you might need
a laboratory assistant temporarily.

174
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,686
Oh.

175
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:43,775
Ooh!

176
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:47,403
Hello!
Would you like to have a roll in the hay?

177
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,450
It's fun!

178
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:52,276
Roll, roll

179
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,945
Roll in the hay

180
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,580
- Hah!
- Oh...

181
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,018
Oh!

182
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:19,649
Sometimes l am afraid of the lightning.

183
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:22,146
lt's just an atmospheric discharge.

184
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,318
Nothing to be afraid of.

185
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,784
Werewolf!

186
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,953
Werewolf?!

187
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,122
- There!
- What?

188
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:39,042
There wolf!

189
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,211
There castle!

190
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,380
Why are you talking that way?

191
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:46,427
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I don't want to!

192
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:49,428
Suit yourself. I'm easy.

193
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,233
Well...

194
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:56,109
There it is.

195
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:57,903
Home.

196
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:32,682
What knockers!

197
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:35,182
Oh... Thank you, Doctor.

198
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,146
Oh. That's all right.

199
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:41,439
There we are.

200
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:56,332
I am Frau Blucher.

201
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,214
Steady!

202
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,471
How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen.

203
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:11,144
This is my assistant.
Inga, may I present Frau Blucher?

204
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,943
I wonder what's got into them.

205
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:21,819
Your rooms have been prepared, Herr Doktor.

206
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,318
If you will follow me.

207
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:28,245
I-gor! Would you bring the bags
as soon as you're finished, please?

208
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:29,876
Yes, master.

209
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,119
After you, Frau Blucher.

210
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,639
- Blucher!

211
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,409
Follow me, please.

212
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,059
Stay close to the candles.

213
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:35,106
The staircase... can be treacherous.

214
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,868
Und this is your room.
It was your grandfather Victor's room.

215
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:51,037
I see.

216
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,414
Well! Seem to be quite a few books.

217
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,294
This was Victor's...

218
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,296
..the Baron's medical library.

219
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:04,554
- Where is my grandfather's private library?
- l don't know what you mean, sir.

220
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:08,808
Well, these books are very general.
Any doctor might have them in his study.

221
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:12,434
This is the only library I know of,
Dr Frankenstone.

222
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:16,104
- Fronkonsteen.
- Fronkonsteen.

223
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:19,234
Well, we'll see.

224
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:22,284
Good night.

225
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,415
Would the doctor care for a brandy
before retiring?

226
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,455
No... Thank you.

227
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,294
Some warm milk...

228
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:39,177
..perhaps?

229
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:42,091
No... thank you very much.

230
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:45,011
No, thanks.

231
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:47,180
Ovaltine?

232
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:53,354
Nothing!

233
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:55,272
Thank you.

234
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:57,441
I'm a little tired.

235
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,820
Then I will say... good night.

236
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,991
Good night!

237
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:24,138
Good night, darling.

238
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,724
Good night, Herr Doktor.

239
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:32,225
Good night, Frau Blucher.

240
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:55,878
No, no, no, no, no, no.

241
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,424
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

242
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,306
I'm not a Frankenstein.

243
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:10,147
I am not a Frankenstein!

244
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:13,647
I'm a Fronkonsteen!

245
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:16,483
Don't gimme that!

246
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:18,652
I don't believe in fate!

247
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,156
And I won't say it.

248
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,783
All right, you win! You win! I give.

249
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:28,826
I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it.

250
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,047
Destiny! Destiny!

251
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:36,043
No escaping that for me!

252
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:38,297
Destiny! Destiny!

253
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,763
No escaping that for me!

254
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:43,058
Destiny! Destiny...

255
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,222
No escaping...

256
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,521
Dr Fronkonsteen! Wake up!

257
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,903
What is it?

258
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:54,065
You were having a nightmare.

259
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:59,071
- What's that strange music?
- I have no idea.

260
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,449
But it seems to be coming...

261
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,040
..from behind the bookcase.

262
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,665
Behind the bookcase...

263
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,084
Hand me that robe, would you, dear?

264
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,142
You were right.
It's coming from behind this wall.

265
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,558
Where is it?

266
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,606
- Where is it?
- What?

267
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,820
There's always a device.
If l can just spot the triggering mechanism...

268
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,981
Hello!

269
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,369
It seems louder over here.

270
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,538
Hand me that candle, will you?

271
00:25:51,928 --> 00:25:55,213
Put... the candle... back!

272
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:04,599
All right! I think I have it figured out now.

273
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:07,268
Take out the candle...

274
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:11,026
..and I'll block the bookcase with my body.

275
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:24,294
Listen to me very carefully.

276
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:26,964
Don't put the candle back!

277
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,125
With all of your might,...

278
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:34,050
..shove against the other side
of the bookcase.

279
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:37,135
Is that... perfectly clear?

280
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:40,428
I think so.

281
00:26:48,946 --> 00:26:51,022
Good girl!

282
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:54,571
Put... the candle... back!

283
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:05,124
Oh, look, Doctor! A passageway!

284
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:08,298
Whatever that music is,
it's coming from down there.

285
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:12,049
- l'd better take a look.
- Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please.

286
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:14,214
l don't wanna stay up here alone.

287
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:17,343
All right, then.
Close your robe and follow me.

288
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,511
Oh, Doctor! The candle...

289
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:22,554
Good thinking. Let's try this one.

290
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,352
Stand back!

291
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:02,137
Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat.

292
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,355
A filthy, slimy rat!

293
00:28:41,357 --> 00:28:42,637
Good Lord!

294
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:46,478
Oh!

295
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:04,448
- I...
- Ohh!

296
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:07,055
Ain't got nobody

297
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,766
And nobody cares for me

298
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,682
- I-gor!
- Frodorick.

299
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,843
How did you get here?

300
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:18,804
Through the dumbwaiter.

301
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:23,855
I heard the strangest music from the upstairs
kitchen and l just... followed it down.

302
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:25,853
Call it... a hunch.

303
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:26,977
Brrrm-chee!

304
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:29,528
There must have been
someone else down here.

305
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:31,693
It would seem that way.

306
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:34,027
And there's the only other door.

307
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:36,823
Wait, master.

308
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,992
It might be dangerous.

309
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:41,912
You go first.

310
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,758
Aren't there any lights in this place?

311
00:29:56,813 --> 00:30:01,475
Two nasty-looking switches over here,
but l'm not going to be the first.

312
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:03,644
Well...

313
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:08,691
Damn your eyes!

314
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:10,860
Too late!

315
00:30:23,674 --> 00:30:26,461
So this is where it all happened.

316
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:42,726
Just think!A dead brain
ready to live again in a new body!

317
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,321
Look! No blood, no decomposition.

318
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:48,483
Just a few sutures.

319
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,280
- Throw the main switch.
- Yes, master.

320
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:00,458
What a filthy mess!

321
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:04,379
I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers,
couple of throw pillows...

322
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,807
Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist
has disa...p...

323
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,435
- Disa... what?
- ..peared.

324
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,062
Ssh!

325
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:19,895
There is a light
coming from behind that door.

326
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:24,354
Follow me!

327
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,552
Doctor! Look!

328
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:59,729
Well... This explains the music.

329
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:03,270
- It's still warm.
- Mm.

330
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:05,356
But who was playing it?

331
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:07,026
I don't know...

332
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:10,950
..but whoever it was just barely finished
putting out his cigar.

333
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:13,707
Such strange goings-on!

334
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:18,245
What is this place?

335
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:20,211
Music room?

336
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:23,960
But there's nothing here
but books and papers!

337
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:26,545
Books and papers?

338
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:28,847
It is!

339
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:32,348
This is my grandfather's private library!
I feel it!

340
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:35,847
Look! Look at this!

341
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:55,288
"Until, from the midst of this
darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me."

342
00:32:56,295 --> 00:33:00,755
"A light so brilliant and wondrous,
and yet so simple."

343
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:04,422
"Change the poles from plus to minus...

344
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:07,547
..and from minus to plus."

345
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:16,439
"l alone succeeded in discovering
the secret of bestowing life."

346
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:19,017
"Nay, even more..."

347
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:24,402
"I myself... became capable
of bestowing animation...

348
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:27,649
..upon lifeless matter!"

349
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:38,086
It... could... work!

350
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,396
- Kipper?
- Mm. Thank you, Doctor.

351
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,365
"As the minuteness of the parts
formed a hindrance to my speed,...

352
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:11,997
..I resolved therefore
to make the creature of a gigantic stature."

353
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,497
Of course!

354
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,747
That would simplify everything.

355
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:21,466
In other words,...

356
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:26,428
..his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs
would all have to be increased in size.

357
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:28,507
Exactly.

358
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:32,103
He would have an enormous Schwanzstuck!

359
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:39,812
That goes without saying.

360
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:41,863
Woof!

361
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:45,404
He's gonna be very popular.

362
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,328
So then...

363
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:51,742
What we're aiming for is a being
approximately seven feet in height,...

364
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:56,828
..with all features either congenitally
or artificially proportionate in size.

365
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:58,796
Something like...

366
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:01,382
..this?

367
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,425
Hello...

368
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:09,593
You've caught something there.

369
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:13,304
Crude, yes, primitive, yes,
perhaps even grotesque,...

370
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:16,186
..yet something inexplicable tells me...

371
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:21,356
..that this might be our man!

372
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:39,542
All right, all right.

373
00:35:39,635 --> 00:35:42,173
That's good enough for the likes of 'im.

374
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,273
Get down, you fool!

375
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,743
Now!

376
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,817
What a filthy job!

377
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,611
- Could be worse.
- How?

378
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,781
Could be raining.

379
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:37,254
Quick!

380
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:43,549
Need a hand?

381
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:47,259
Uh... No, thanks. I have one.
Thanks very much all the same.

382
00:37:47,354 --> 00:37:49,062
Just a moment, sir!

383
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:53,014
I know everyone around here,
but I've never seen your face before.

384
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,186
Can you account for yourself?

385
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:59,442
Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen,
newly arrived from America.

386
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:02,237
Oh, yes, sir! I was told you were here.

387
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:05,613
Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

388
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,740
How very nice to meet you, Constable.

389
00:38:09,836 --> 00:38:12,872
- Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir.
- Ooh!

390
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:16,000
- A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you.
- Yes, yes.

391
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,509
A little nip from the old bottle
wouldn't be too bad either, sir.

392
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:21,884
That's the ticket, yes!

393
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:25,556
Well, if you have everything in hand, sir,
I'll say good night.

394
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:27,720
Thank you very much, Constable.

395
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:30,849
- At your service, sir, always.

396
00:38:32,735 --> 00:38:35,522
- Good night, Constable.
- Good night, sir.

397
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:55,793
Oh, what an awesome sight!

398
00:38:57,178 --> 00:39:00,926
What a profound and reverend night is this.

399
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:04,597
With such a specimen for a body,...

400
00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:09,563
..all we need now is
an equally magnificent brain.

401
00:39:11,568 --> 00:39:14,522
- You know what to do?
- l have a pretty good idea.

402
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,689
Good man.

403
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:20,735
Didn't you... Didn't you use to have that
on the other side?

404
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:22,904
- What?
- Your, uh...

405
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,907
Oh, never mind.

406
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:33,252
- Do you have that name I gave you?
- l have it written down.

407
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:37,510
- H Delbruck.
- Hans Delbruck.

408
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:35,245
- He is hideous.
- He's beautiful.

409
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,929
And he is mine!

410
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:50,771
Hurry now.
We're fighting time and the elements.

411
00:41:50,862 --> 00:41:54,942
- Are you ready?
- Are you sure this is how they did it?

412
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:57,654
Yes, yes! It's all written down in the notes!

413
00:41:57,745 --> 00:42:00,864
Now tie off the kites
and hurry down as fast as you can.

414
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:02,450
What's the hurry?

415
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:06,491
There's a possibility of electrocution.
Do you understand?

416
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,214
I say "There's a possibility of electrocution!"

417
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,839
Do you understand?

418
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:20,343
I understand, I understand.
Why are you shouting?

419
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,180
Did you...

420
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:26,639
- Did you tie off the kites?
- Of course.

421
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:29,227
Oh... All right. Good.

422
00:42:32,073 --> 00:42:34,860
- Uh... Check the generator.
- Yes, master.

423
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:44,615
l-gor!

424
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:48,162
- Release the safety valve on the main wheel.
- Yes, master.

425
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:58,265
Can you imagine the brain of Hans Delbruck
in this body?

426
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:00,843
Oh, Frederick!

427
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:03,430
This is the moment.

428
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:06,475
Well, dear...

429
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:08,644
Are you ready?

430
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:10,813
Yes, Doctor.

431
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,316
Elevate me.

432
00:43:15,035 --> 00:43:17,111
Now? Right here?

433
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,656
Yes, yes. Raise the platform.

434
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:22,741
Oh! The platform!

435
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:24,911
Oh, that! Ja... yes.

436
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:48,817
From that fateful day
when stinking bits of slime...

437
00:43:48,904 --> 00:43:53,613
..first crawled from the sea
and shouted to the cold stars...

438
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:56,912
.."I am man!",...

439
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:02,992
..our greatest dread has always been
the knowledge of our own mortality.

440
00:44:03,753 --> 00:44:05,829
But tonight...

441
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:08,709
..we shall hurl the gauntlet of science...

442
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,717
..into the frightful face of death itself.

443
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:16,549
Tonight...

444
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:20,143
..we shall ascend into the heavens!

445
00:44:21,606 --> 00:44:24,560
We shall mock the earthquake!

446
00:44:25,234 --> 00:44:27,807
We shall command the thunders...

447
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:30,689
..and penetrate...

448
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:37,449
..into the very womb
of impervious nature herself!

449
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:49,499
When I give the word,
throw the first switch!

450
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:52,087
You've got it, master.

451
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:58,260
Get ready!

452
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:02,725
Get set!

453
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:04,476
Go!

454
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:13,279
Throw the second switch!

455
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:19,908
Throw the third switch!

456
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,998
Not... the third switch?

457
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:25,495
Throw it, I say! Throw it!

458
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:40,263
Life!

459
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:42,432
Life, do you hear me?

460
00:45:43,067 --> 00:45:45,143
Give my creation...

461
00:45:45,862 --> 00:45:48,353
..life!

462
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:12,796
Turn everything off and bring me down!

463
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,124
Nothing!

464
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,792
- Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry...
- No, no.

465
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,046
Be of good cheer.

466
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,595
If science teaches us anything,...

467
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:37,681
..it teaches us to accept our failures...

468
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,557
..as well as our successes...

469
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:44,563
..with quiet... dignity...

470
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:48,691
..and grace.

471
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:01,701
Son of a bitch, bastard! I'll get you for this!

472
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,874
What did you do to me?

473
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,336
- What did you do to me?
- Doctor! Doctor! Stop it!

474
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:09,719
You'll kill him!

475
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,004
Agh!

476
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,759
l don't wanna live!

477
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:16,220
l do not want to live!

478
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:20,558
Quiet dignity and grace.

479
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:23,228
Ohhh! Mama!

480
00:48:25,698 --> 00:48:29,398
Oh, tosh! This man is different, I tell you!

481
00:48:29,494 --> 00:48:33,159
You can see that after you've talked to him
for five minutes.

482
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,916
Yes?

483
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:40,538
He's a Frankenstein!

484
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:43,881
- And they're all alike!

485
00:48:44,593 --> 00:48:47,131
It's in their blood. They can't 'elp it.

486
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:50,342
All those scientists, they're all alike.

487
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,134
They say they're working FOR us.

488
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:56,887
What they really want is to rule the world!

489
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,407
That's enough now! I will not have
this meeting become a free-for-all!

490
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:11,363
These are very serious charges
you're making,...

491
00:49:11,455 --> 00:49:16,532
..and all the more painful to us, your elders,
because we still have nightmares...

492
00:49:16,627 --> 00:49:18,999
..from five times before.

493
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:26,293
Now... we haven't heard from the one man
most qualified to judge the situation fairly.

494
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:29,965
Inspector Kemp!

495
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:33,466
Will you talk to us, please?

496
00:50:01,216 --> 00:50:04,834
A riot... is an ugly thing...

497
00:50:04,928 --> 00:50:09,056
..und once you get one started...

498
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:12,517
..there is little chance of stopping it...

499
00:50:13,312 --> 00:50:15,388
..short of bloodshed.

500
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:21,478
l think... before we go around killing people,...

501
00:50:22,113 --> 00:50:27,736
..we had better make damn sure
of our evidence.

502
00:50:29,204 --> 00:50:31,280
Und...

503
00:50:35,586 --> 00:50:38,705
..we had better confirm the fact...

504
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:42,796
..that young Frankenstein is indeed...

505
00:50:43,261 --> 00:50:46,464
..vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps!

506
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:47,718
What?

507
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:50,808
Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps!
Vootstaps!

508
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:52,388
Oh! Footsteps!

509
00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:54,555
I think...

510
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:56,973
..what is in order...

511
00:50:58,861 --> 00:51:03,855
..is for me to pay a little visit
on the good doctor...

512
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:10,204
..und to have a nice... quiet... chat.

513
00:51:15,211 --> 00:51:17,287

514
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,456
Reputation!

515
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:24,204
Oh, Doctor!
You mustn't do this to yourself.

516
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:27,295
You've got to stop thinking about it.

517
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:30,969
Why, look!
You haven't even touched your food.

518
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:34,432
There!

519
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:38,188
Now I've touched it. Happy?

520
00:51:39,904 --> 00:51:43,023
You know... I'll never forget my old dad.

521
00:51:43,992 --> 00:51:48,868
When these things would happen to him...
the things he'd say to me.

522
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,664
What did he say?

523
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:55,627
What the hell are you doin'
in the bathroom day and night?

524
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:59,331
Why don't you get outta there
and give someone else a chance?

525
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:07,758
Oh, maybe it's better this way.

526
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:10,969
The poor lifeless hulk.

527
00:52:11,521 --> 00:52:13,597
Maybe it is better off dead.

528
00:52:33,586 --> 00:52:35,377
What is this?

529
00:52:35,463 --> 00:52:37,539
Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte.

530
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,838
Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to
desserts myself, but this is excellent.

531
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:47,008
Who are you talking to?

532
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:52,223
To you! You just made a yummy sound,
so I thought you liked the dessert.

533
00:52:52,314 --> 00:52:55,480
I didn't make a yummy sound.
I just asked you what it is.

534
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:58,818
- But you did. I just heard it.
- It wasn't me.

535
00:52:58,905 --> 00:53:00,981
It wasn't me!

536
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:04,822
Well, now, look here.
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you...

537
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,679
Alive! It's alive!

538
00:53:31,439 --> 00:53:34,143
It's alive!!

539
00:53:36,987 --> 00:53:39,063
Stand back.

540
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:48,531
Hello, there.

541
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:51,284
I'm going to set you free.

542
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:57,283
- Is the sedative ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

543
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,766
I want you...

544
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,444
..to sit... up.

545
00:54:31,878 --> 00:54:35,710
Stand... on your feet.

546
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:42,379
You can do it.

547
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,936
Now... walk!

548
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:03,659
Doctor, I'm frightened!

549
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,656
Don't worry.

550
00:55:09,293 --> 00:55:11,369
Good.

551
00:55:13,214 --> 00:55:15,290
Good!

552
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:18,961
What is it? What's the matter?

553
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:21,967
- Quick! Give him the...

554
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:23,467
Quick! Give him the...

555
00:55:23,558 --> 00:55:25,846
- What? Give him the what?

556
00:55:26,562 --> 00:55:30,097
Three syllables.
First syllable - sounds like...

557
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,562
Head! Uh, sounds like head!

558
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:35,019
Bed! Uh... Said...

559
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:36,940
Said!

560
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:38,525
- Said!
- Said!

561
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:40,655
Second syllable - little word.

562
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:42,403
Uh... this, that, the...

563
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:44,238
A...

564
00:55:44,747 --> 00:55:46,823
- Said a...
- Said a...

565
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,451
Dirt word! He said a dirt word!

566
00:55:50,212 --> 00:55:52,288
Oh, sounds like...

567
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,457
Uh, to give! Give!

568
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:57,545
Said... Said a give... Give him a said a give!

569
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:01,174
Oh! Tive... tive... Sedative!

570
00:56:01,265 --> 00:56:03,341
On the nosey!

571
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,156
Said a give?!

572
00:56:33,216 --> 00:56:35,374
Oh, Frederick! Are you all right?

573
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:38,211
Yes!

574
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:42,927
- Would you excuse me for one minute, dear?
- Of course, Doctor.

575
00:56:43,477 --> 00:56:45,553
I-gor...

576
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,350
- May I speak to you for a moment?
- Of course.

577
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:51,599
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

578
00:56:54,947 --> 00:56:56,820
No, no. Up here.

579
00:56:57,408 --> 00:56:59,281
Thank you.

580
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:06,572
Now... that brain that you gave me...

581
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,211
Was it... Hans Delbruck's?

582
00:57:12,215 --> 00:57:14,753
- No.
- Ah! Good.

583
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:18,423
Uh... Would you mind telling me...

584
00:57:20,391 --> 00:57:24,519
..whose brain... I did put in?

585
00:57:24,604 --> 00:57:29,396
- Then you won't be angry?
- I will not... be... angry.

586
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:32,269
Abby someone.

587
00:57:32,904 --> 00:57:35,145
Abby someone...

588
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,909
- Abby who?
- Abby... Normal.

589
00:57:40,621 --> 00:57:42,909
Abby Normal...

590
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:45,490
I'm almost sure that was the name.

591
00:57:49,547 --> 00:57:54,173
Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain...

592
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:58,587
..into a seven-and-a-half-foot long,...

593
00:57:59,682 --> 00:58:02,885
..54-inch wide...

594
00:58:04,729 --> 00:58:06,805
..gorilla?!

595
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:10,186
Is that what you're telling me?!

596
00:58:10,611 --> 00:58:12,603
Quick, quick! Give him the...

597
00:58:12,696 --> 00:58:14,190
What?

598
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:17,863
- Three syllables, yes!

599
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,277
I wonder who that could be at this hour.

600
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,999
Inga, quick! See who that is.

601
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:35,085
You... put that thing
back on the operating table.

602
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,883
And strap him down tightly!

603
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,928
- Where are you going?
- To wash up. I've got to look normal.

604
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,393
We've all of us got to behave normally!

605
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,685
Hah! Monsters!

606
00:58:56,284 --> 00:58:58,276
Excellent shot.

607
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,996
This is the 20th century, Kemp.
Monsters are passe like ghosts and goblins.

608
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:07,412
Not to the good people
of this village, Herr Doktor.

609
00:59:09,006 --> 00:59:10,548
To them...

610
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:13,088
..he is a very real thing.

611
00:59:14,554 --> 00:59:20,224
Especially when...
there is a Frankenstein residing in this house.

612
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:37,240
Nice grouping.

613
00:59:37,328 --> 00:59:39,404
Thank you.

614
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:47,752
I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you
would fall for all this superstitious rot!

615
00:59:48,715 --> 00:59:53,507
It is not superstition that worries me,
Herr Doktor, but genes und...

616
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:55,637
..chromosomes!

617
00:59:56,556 --> 00:59:59,806
- Rubbish!
- Hm, well, you might say, but this is...

618
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:01,929
..Transylvania!

619
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:06,105
Und you are a...

620
01:00:06,192 --> 01:00:07,602
..Frankenstein!

621
01:00:10,488 --> 01:00:15,731
You, uh... seem unusually upset
by this discussion.

622
01:00:15,827 --> 01:00:17,570
Not in the least.

623
01:00:18,705 --> 01:00:20,946
I find it extremely amusing, that's all.

624
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,620
Well... this was fun!

625
01:00:25,712 --> 01:00:28,582
Now, if you don't mind, Inspector,
I'm a little tired.

626
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:29,872
Then...

627
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:33,383
..I may give the villagers
your complete assurance...

628
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:39,719
..that you have no interest whatsoever
in carrying on your grandfather's work?

629
01:00:42,814 --> 01:00:44,890
May I take that for a yes?

630
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,353
Very well.

631
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:51,611
- You can find the way out by yourself?
- Of course.

632
01:00:52,825 --> 01:00:57,368
Until we meet again,... Herr Baron.

633
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:00,075
Yes. Drop by any time. We are always open.

634
01:01:08,258 --> 01:01:10,334
Dieser verdammte Arm!

635
01:01:43,128 --> 01:01:45,204
Oh, Victor!

636
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,547
Victor...

637
01:01:47,633 --> 01:01:49,709
We have done it!

638
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:55,595
I'm going to set you free.

639
01:01:55,683 --> 01:01:59,218
Would you like that, meine Seuchekopf?

640
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:11,106
They wanted to hurt you!

641
01:02:12,117 --> 01:02:14,193
But I'm going to help you!

642
01:02:15,788 --> 01:02:17,864
Thank heavens that's over with.

643
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,909
- Frau Blucher!

644
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:25,326
Stop! Don't come closer!

645
01:02:25,423 --> 01:02:28,542
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to set him free!

646
01:02:28,635 --> 01:02:30,711
No! No, you mustn't!

647
01:02:30,804 --> 01:02:32,179
Yes!

648
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:35,553
Are you insane? He'll kill you!

649
01:02:36,893 --> 01:02:38,969
No, he won't. Not this one.

650
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:41,268
He is as gentle as a lamb.

651
01:02:42,649 --> 01:02:46,943
Stand back! Stand back!
For the love of God, he has a rotten brain!

652
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,855
It's not rotten. It's a good brain!

653
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:52,025
It's rotten, I tell you! Rotten!

654
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,909
Ixnay on the ottenray.

655
01:02:57,123 --> 01:03:00,823
I'm not afraid! I know what he likes!

656
01:03:16,185 --> 01:03:18,261
That music!

657
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:24,134
Yes! It's in your blood!
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins!

658
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:28,399
It reaches the soul when words are useless.

659
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:32,155
Your grandfather used to play it
to the creature he was making.

660
01:03:32,244 --> 01:03:34,865
- Then it was you all the time!
- Yes!

661
01:03:34,955 --> 01:03:37,991
- You played that music in the night.
- Yes!

662
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:40,870
- To get us into the laboratory.
- Yes!

663
01:03:40,961 --> 01:03:44,579
- That was your cigar in the ashtray!
- Yes!

664
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:48,090
And it was you who left
my grandfather's book out for me to find!

665
01:03:48,177 --> 01:03:49,457
Yes!

666
01:03:49,554 --> 01:03:51,297
- So that I would...
- Yes!

667
01:03:51,389 --> 01:03:53,630
- Then you and Victor were...
- Yes!

668
01:03:54,267 --> 01:03:56,425
Yes! Say it!

669
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,387
He was my boyfriend!

670
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:14,321
You will never catch him now!

671
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:17,783
He's free! Do you hear?

672
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:20,248
Free!

673
01:04:33,851 --> 01:04:35,309
Gone!

674
01:04:35,853 --> 01:04:37,263
Gone!

675
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:39,893
We've got to find him, do you understand?

676
01:04:39,982 --> 01:04:42,936
We've got to find him
before he kills someone!

677
01:04:43,653 --> 01:04:45,729
What have I done?

678
01:04:46,156 --> 01:04:48,444
Oh, God in heaven!

679
01:04:49,492 --> 01:04:51,568
What have I done?

680
01:04:57,881 --> 01:05:01,426
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

681
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:05,180
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

682
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:08,308
Oh, I love my flower

683
01:05:14,728 --> 01:05:16,804
That monster is loose...

684
01:05:17,856 --> 01:05:19,932
Boards must be tight!

685
01:05:22,694 --> 01:05:24,770
There.

686
01:05:26,407 --> 01:05:28,483
Thank God you put Helga to bed.

687
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:32,870
With all this monster business,
I take no chances. I remember the last time.

688
01:05:32,955 --> 01:05:38,080
But, Papa! I told you that I was turning
the Rostbraten, don't you remember?

689
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:40,245
I asked you to put Helga to...

690
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,255
You...

691
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:48,587
Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye.

692
01:05:57,106 --> 01:05:59,394
Oh, dear. Nothing left.

693
01:06:00,026 --> 01:06:02,647
What shall we throw in now?

694
01:06:07,158 --> 01:06:09,696
Maybe she was in the bathroom
when you looked!

695
01:06:09,786 --> 01:06:13,071
But I didn't even look upstairs.
I thought you did!

696
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:17,410
You didn't look upstairs?

697
01:06:19,129 --> 01:06:21,205
Sit down.

698
01:06:22,341 --> 01:06:23,751
Sit down!

699
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,636
A visitor is all I ask.

700
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:19,058
A temporary companion to help me
pass a few short hours in my lonely life.

701
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,357
Thank you, Lord. Thank you!

702
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:39,205
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't say a word.

703
01:07:39,757 --> 01:07:42,960
Oh, my joy... and my prize from heaven.

704
01:07:43,803 --> 01:07:47,006
Oh, you must have been
the tallest one in your class!

705
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:50,015
My name is Harold and I live here all alone.

706
01:07:50,852 --> 01:07:52,678
- What is your name?

707
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:54,976
- I didn't get that.

708
01:07:55,064 --> 01:07:56,973
Mmm! No...

709
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:59,143
Oh, forgive me.

710
01:07:59,986 --> 01:08:02,062
I didn't realise you were a mute.

711
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,358
You see how heaven plans.

712
01:08:05,451 --> 01:08:08,867
Me, a poor blind man,
and you, you... a mute.

713
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:13,032
An incredibly big mute.

714
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:15,826
Ahh! But your hand is frozen, my child.

715
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,620
- How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh?

716
01:08:28,934 --> 01:08:32,801
Well... I know what it means to...
to be cold and hungry.

717
01:08:32,896 --> 01:08:33,975
Yes...

718
01:08:34,064 --> 01:08:37,764
And how much it means to have
a little kindness from a stranger.

719
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,611
- Are you ready for your soup?

720
01:08:42,323 --> 01:08:44,399
Hold out your bowl, then.

721
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:48,820
Oh, my friend, my friend...

722
01:08:48,913 --> 01:08:51,486
You don't know what your visit means to me.

723
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,248
How long I've waited for the pleasure
of another human being.

724
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:59,121
Sometimes in our preoccupation
with worldly matters,...

725
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:03,381
..we tend to forget the simple pleasures...

726
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:06,506
- ..that are the basis for true happiness.

727
01:09:06,599 --> 01:09:08,971
Yes, yes, yes. Oh...

728
01:09:09,685 --> 01:09:12,010
And now a little wine with your soup?

729
01:09:13,398 --> 01:09:15,474
- Good, good.

730
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,365
Huh? Good... Yes...

731
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,082
Wait!

732
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,748
A toast!

733
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,333
A toast to...

734
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,082
Yes! Long friendship!

735
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,843
- How hungry you must have been.

736
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,427
Now... now, now for a little surprise.

737
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:55,274
For a special occasion, I've been saving...

738
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:02,570
..cigars!

739
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:05,572
- Take one.

740
01:10:09,624 --> 01:10:10,454
What?

741
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:12,618
No... no, no.

742
01:10:13,253 --> 01:10:15,245
Fire is good.

743
01:10:15,338 --> 01:10:18,422
Fire is good, yes. Fire is our friend.

744
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:21,292
Yes. I - I'll show you. I'll show you.

745
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,972
You see? You see?

746
01:10:32,607 --> 01:10:34,398
You have your cigar?

747
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:36,560
Let me see. Let me see.

748
01:10:36,653 --> 01:10:38,277
All right.

749
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:40,439
Now, now, now...

750
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:43,446
Just hold it right there. Now...

751
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:47,364
..don't inhale until the tip glows.

752
01:11:05,725 --> 01:11:07,801
Wait!

753
01:11:09,813 --> 01:11:11,355
Wait!

754
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,516
Where are you going?

755
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:16,143
I was gonna make espresso.

756
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:02,190
Now!

757
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:08,949
Quick! Give him the sedative!

758
01:12:26,352 --> 01:12:28,428
He's out!

759
01:12:29,523 --> 01:12:31,183
I know.

760
01:12:39,992 --> 01:12:42,068
I'm going in there.

761
01:12:42,161 --> 01:12:44,402
Bring me that candle.

762
01:12:51,212 --> 01:12:53,204
Love...

763
01:12:53,298 --> 01:12:56,714
..is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.

764
01:12:57,427 --> 01:13:00,546
And I am going to convince him
that he is loved...

765
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:04,759
..even at the cost of my own life.

766
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:11,147
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you,...

767
01:13:11,776 --> 01:13:14,730
..no matter how terribly I may scream,...

768
01:13:15,655 --> 01:13:20,068
..do not open this door,
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

769
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,737
Do you understand?

770
01:13:21,828 --> 01:13:24,994
Do not open this door!

771
01:13:25,082 --> 01:13:26,540
Yes, Doctor.

772
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:30,911
Nice working with you.

773
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,283
Let me out. Let me out of here!
Get me the hell out of here!

774
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:09,788
What's the matter with you people?
I was joking!

775
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,120
Don't you know a joke when you hear one?

776
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:18,045
Jesus Christ! Get me outta here!

777
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:24,891
Open this goddamn door
or I'll kick your rotten heads in!

778
01:14:24,978 --> 01:14:26,388
Mommy!

779
01:14:26,897 --> 01:14:28,142
Nein!

780
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:37,141
Obviously...

781
01:14:41,204 --> 01:14:42,746
Hello, handsome!

782
01:14:46,585 --> 01:14:48,992
You're a good-looking fellow, you know?

783
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:51,163
People laugh at you.

784
01:14:51,715 --> 01:14:54,502
People hate you, but why do they hate you?

785
01:14:54,593 --> 01:14:58,460
Because they are jealous!

786
01:14:59,682 --> 01:15:01,758
Look at that boyish face.

787
01:15:04,312 --> 01:15:06,388
Look at that sweet smile.

788
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:10,681
Do you wanna talk about physical strength?

789
01:15:11,278 --> 01:15:14,611
Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?

790
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:19,277
Do you want to talk
about the Olympian ideal?

791
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:21,658
You are a god!

792
01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:25,074
And listen to me...

793
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,533
You are not evil.

794
01:15:29,964 --> 01:15:34,258
You... are... good!

795
01:15:42,394 --> 01:15:45,430
This is a nice boy.

796
01:15:46,148 --> 01:15:48,224
This is a good boy.

797
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:51,227
This is a mother's angel.

798
01:15:52,363 --> 01:15:54,651
And I want the world to know,...

799
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:59,526
..once and for all and without any shame,...

800
01:16:01,206 --> 01:16:03,993
..that we love him!

801
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:10,542
I'm going to teach you.

802
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:15,543
I'm gonna show you how to walk,
how to speak, how to move, how to think!

803
01:16:16,597 --> 01:16:18,221
Together,...

804
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,346
..you and I...

805
01:16:20,434 --> 01:16:26,472
..are going... to make
the greatest single contribution to science...

806
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:30,068
..since the creation of fire!

807
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:34,153
Dr Fronkonsteen! Are you all right?

808
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:36,317
My name...

809
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:40,369
..is Frankenstein!

810
01:17:34,012 --> 01:17:37,511
Distinguished colleagues,
ladies and gentlemen.

811
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,758
Tonight it is my great privilege...

812
01:17:39,852 --> 01:17:44,181
..of introducing to you a man
whose family name was once both...

813
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:46,312
..famous...

814
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:48,689
..and... infamous!

815
01:17:49,237 --> 01:17:55,738
And now may I present to you
Doktor Baron Friedrich von Frankenstein!

816
01:18:04,378 --> 01:18:06,619
- My fellow scienti...

817
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,798
..tists... and neurosurgeons,
ladies and gentlemen.

818
01:18:13,638 --> 01:18:16,425
A few short weeks ago,
coming from a background,...

819
01:18:16,516 --> 01:18:21,723
..believe me, as conservative and traditionally
grounded in scientific fact as any of you,...

820
01:18:21,813 --> 01:18:26,807
..I began an experiment in,
incredulous as it may sound,...

821
01:18:27,945 --> 01:18:30,518
..the reanimation of dead tissue.

822
01:18:33,701 --> 01:18:36,986
What I have to offer you might possibly be...

823
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:41,160
..the gateway to immortality.

824
01:18:46,381 --> 01:18:52,300
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for
your intellectual and philosophical pleasure...

825
01:18:54,139 --> 01:18:56,215
..the Creature!

826
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:04,764
Remain in your seats, I beg you.

827
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:08,228
We are not children here. We are scientists.

828
01:19:09,155 --> 01:19:11,562
I assure you there is nothing to fear.

829
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:18,945
First... may I offer for your consideration...

830
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:23,703
..a neurological demonstration
of the primary cerebellar functions.

831
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:27,749
Balance and coordination!

832
01:19:30,094 --> 01:19:33,095
Walk... heel to toe.

833
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:48,403
Backwards!

834
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:09,549
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen
the Creature perform simple motor activity,...

835
01:20:09,636 --> 01:20:11,712
..but for what you will see next...

836
01:20:11,805 --> 01:20:16,597
..we must enter... quietly...
into the realm of genius.

837
01:20:20,606 --> 01:20:22,479
Ladies and gentlemen,...

838
01:20:22,566 --> 01:20:24,439
..mesdames et messieurs,...

839
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:26,400
..Damen und Herren,...

840
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:31,030
..from what was once
an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues,...

841
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:35,161
..may I now present
a cultured, sophisticated...

842
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:38,407
..man about town!

843
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:43,252
Hit it!

844
01:20:47,535 --> 01:20:50,976
If you're blue
and you don't know where to go to

845
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,852
Why don't you go where fashion sits

846
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:56,502
Puttin' on the Ritz

847
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:30,526
Nothing! Nothing, I tell you!

848
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,078
Five, six, seven, eight...

849
01:22:36,417 --> 01:22:39,583
Come on! Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

850
01:22:44,217 --> 01:22:46,090
Please! I beg you!

851
01:22:46,177 --> 01:22:48,881
For safety's sake, don't humiliate him!

852
01:22:52,142 --> 01:22:56,186
Come back! Do you hear me?
I will not let you destroy my work!

853
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:58,975
As your creator
I command you to come back!

854
01:23:52,581 --> 01:23:54,372
Chained.

855
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:57,127
Chained like a beast in a cage.

856
01:23:58,087 --> 01:24:00,578
Oh, Doctor... I feel so terrible.

857
01:24:00,673 --> 01:24:02,749
There's only one answer.

858
01:24:02,842 --> 01:24:07,587
If I could find a way to equalise
the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid,...

859
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,550
..why, he'd be as right as rain.

860
01:24:11,268 --> 01:24:12,928
But how?

861
01:24:13,019 --> 01:24:15,307
How, before it's too late?

862
01:24:16,523 --> 01:24:18,266
Oh, Frederick...

863
01:24:18,358 --> 01:24:20,516
If only there was some way I could...

864
01:24:21,612 --> 01:24:24,316
..relieve this torture you are going through.

865
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:28,568
If there was some way I could help to...

866
01:24:30,371 --> 01:24:32,909
..relieve the tension. If there was just...

867
01:24:32,999 --> 01:24:35,953
..some way I could give you a little peace.

868
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:45,961
Doctor, I have...

869
01:24:46,054 --> 01:24:47,927
Doctor?

870
01:24:48,974 --> 01:24:51,050
What is it?

871
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,394
Doctor...

872
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:57,722
Where are you?

873
01:25:10,914 --> 01:25:14,496
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This cable came while you were gone.

874
01:25:14,585 --> 01:25:19,461
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me while I'm working!

875
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,500
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought this was an emergency.

876
01:25:24,595 --> 01:25:28,545
You see, your fiancee
will be arriving any second!

877
01:25:28,641 --> 01:25:31,262
What?! Elizabeth here tonight?

878
01:25:31,353 --> 01:25:34,686
Yes. I will go prepare a room at once.

879
01:25:36,316 --> 01:25:38,392
I suggest you put on a tie!

880
01:25:58,715 --> 01:25:59,746
Darling.

881
01:26:00,967 --> 01:26:03,090
Darling!

882
01:26:03,178 --> 01:26:04,720
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

883
01:26:04,805 --> 01:26:06,881
- Love me?
- Love you?

884
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:09,926
Well...

885
01:26:10,686 --> 01:26:13,355
- Let's turn in.
- Darling!

886
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:18,065
It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired.
I'll just pay the driver.

887
01:26:18,486 --> 01:26:19,517
Darling!

888
01:26:19,987 --> 01:26:21,647
What?

889
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:24,736
- Surprised?
- I, uh... Yes.

890
01:26:24,826 --> 01:26:26,902
- Love me?
- Well...

891
01:26:26,995 --> 01:26:29,283
- Well... Let's turn in.
- Ohh!

892
01:26:29,372 --> 01:26:30,949
- Darling!
- Yes!

893
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,749
Say nothing, act casual.

894
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:35,538
- Ready?
- Yes... l think...

895
01:26:36,213 --> 01:26:37,956
Yes.

896
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:40,124
I am a bit tired after all.

897
01:26:42,303 --> 01:26:45,506
I'd like you to meet
my assistants, Inga and I-gor.

898
01:26:45,598 --> 01:26:47,674
How do you do?

899
01:26:48,559 --> 01:26:49,590
How do you do?

900
01:26:49,686 --> 01:26:53,683
- Uh... This is my financier Elizabeth.
- I'm so happy to meet you at last.

901
01:26:53,773 --> 01:26:54,804
Uh... Financee.

902
01:26:54,900 --> 01:27:00,523
Excuse me, darling.
What is it exactly that you... do do?

903
01:27:03,283 --> 01:27:07,327
Uh, well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen
in the laboratory.

904
01:27:07,788 --> 01:27:10,195
We have intellectual discussions und we...

905
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:12,663
As a matter of fact, we were just having one...

906
01:27:12,752 --> 01:27:14,162
- May I...?
- What?

907
01:27:14,253 --> 01:27:15,913
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

908
01:27:16,005 --> 01:27:18,756
Uh... I-gor, would you
give me a hand with the bags?

909
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:22,377
Certainly, you take the blonde
and I'll take the one in the turban.

910
01:27:28,143 --> 01:27:30,847
Stop that! I'm talking about the luggage.

911
01:27:30,938 --> 01:27:32,598
Yes, master.

912
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:35,308
Ladies, this way.

913
01:27:36,569 --> 01:27:38,229
It'll be a long night.

914
01:27:38,179 --> 01:27:41,724
- If you need any help with the girls...
- Get in there!

915
01:27:47,205 --> 01:27:49,281
You settle down now.

916
01:27:50,584 --> 01:27:53,288
Cos... we gonna be pals.

917
01:27:55,088 --> 01:27:58,207
- Right?

918
01:27:58,884 --> 01:28:00,960
Nice and cosy.

919
01:28:01,053 --> 01:28:04,137
Just like old friends.

920
01:28:12,148 --> 01:28:14,306
- What's the matter?

921
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:17,266
- You're afraid of this little fire?

922
01:28:17,362 --> 01:28:19,235
This can't hurt you.

923
01:28:19,323 --> 01:28:21,399
- See?

924
01:28:22,326 --> 01:28:24,532
Oh, some monster you are.

925
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:26,778
See, Mama was right.

926
01:28:26,872 --> 01:28:30,371
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.

927
01:28:31,586 --> 01:28:34,255
Is they? Cos they might get hurt!

928
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,987
Halt!

929
01:29:04,078 --> 01:29:05,786
Up.

930
01:29:05,872 --> 01:29:08,541
A riot is an ugly thing!

931
01:29:09,584 --> 01:29:13,795
Und I think that it is just about time
that we had one!

932
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:17,758
Kill the monster!

933
01:29:18,135 --> 01:29:20,376
As heaven is my witness... Up.

934
01:29:21,388 --> 01:29:25,053
..he will curse the day...

935
01:29:25,142 --> 01:29:28,974
..that he was burn a Frankenstein!

936
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:30,970
What?

937
01:29:31,941 --> 01:29:35,985
I said "He will curse the day
that he was born a Frankenstein!"

938
01:29:36,529 --> 01:29:38,605
Yeah!

939
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,005
Loose?!

940
01:29:53,005 --> 01:29:54,499
Loose?!

941
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:58,255
He's broken loose!
Do you know what that means?

942
01:29:59,304 --> 01:30:01,973
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

943
01:30:04,392 --> 01:30:06,384
I suppose you're right.

944
01:30:06,478 --> 01:30:08,387
Of course I am.

945
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,556
Now come along like a good boy.

946
01:30:11,066 --> 01:30:13,023
What would I do without you?

947
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:17,772
Is your room just down the hall
in case I get the frights during the night?

948
01:30:18,324 --> 01:30:23,235
Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight,
under the circumstances, I might...

949
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:25,238
..stay here with you.

950
01:30:25,999 --> 01:30:28,075
Would you want me like this now?

951
01:30:28,752 --> 01:30:32,500
So soon before our wedding,
so near we can almost touch it?

952
01:30:35,258 --> 01:30:37,546
- Yes!
- Whoa, boy!

953
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:46,470
..to wait just a little while longer when
I can give myself to you without hesitation,...

954
01:30:46,562 --> 01:30:50,476
..when I can be totally
and unashamedly and legally yours?

955
01:30:54,612 --> 01:30:56,688
That's a tough choice.

956
01:30:56,781 --> 01:30:59,616
You're a tough guy.

957
01:31:02,287 --> 01:31:04,160
I suppose you're right.

958
01:31:04,248 --> 01:31:06,324
Of course I am. I always am.

959
01:31:07,459 --> 01:31:09,784
Now give me a kiss and say good night.

960
01:31:13,299 --> 01:31:15,375
No tongues.

961
01:31:22,058 --> 01:31:23,849
Good night, darling.

962
01:31:25,103 --> 01:31:27,475
- Good night, sweetheart.

963
01:31:27,564 --> 01:31:29,805
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

964
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,726
- You love me?

965
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,858
- l love you, honey.

966
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:36,353
- Sweet dreams, darling.
- Sweet dreams.

967
01:31:36,448 --> 01:31:39,781
- Good night, don't let the bedbugs bite.

968
01:32:57,201 --> 01:32:59,277
Where am I?

969
01:33:00,162 --> 01:33:04,206
Who are you?
W-What... What are you?

970
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:07,079
- What... What are you going to do to me?

971
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:10,003
Calm down.

972
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:12,497
I'm not afraid of you.
How much do you want?

973
01:33:12,592 --> 01:33:16,174
My father is very rich.
You would have the world at your fingertips.

974
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:21,803
Listen. I have to be back by 11.30.
I'm expecting a very important call.

975
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,808
Speak! Speak! Why don't you speak?

976
01:33:25,898 --> 01:33:27,974
What are you doing?

977
01:33:28,067 --> 01:33:30,355
Oh, no, you can't be serious!

978
01:33:32,655 --> 01:33:34,731
I'm af... I...

979
01:33:35,492 --> 01:33:37,484
Oh, my God!

980
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:38,608
Woof!

981
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,700
I-I'm engaged.

982
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:46,496
And once he... But I didn't... It was never...

983
01:34:36,515 --> 01:34:38,591
Penny for your thoughts.

984
01:34:41,186 --> 01:34:43,427
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

985
01:34:44,648 --> 01:34:46,687
You little zipper-neck!

986
01:34:49,695 --> 01:34:51,771
Oh, all right.

987
01:34:51,864 --> 01:34:54,568
Seven has always been my... lucky number.

988
01:34:55,952 --> 01:34:58,703
Come over here, you hot monster!

989
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:03,788
- What is it?

990
01:35:03,877 --> 01:35:06,035
What's the matter?

991
01:35:06,129 --> 01:35:08,335
Is it that music?

992
01:35:08,423 --> 01:35:12,255
It's probably from some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.

993
01:35:12,344 --> 01:35:14,420
Where are you going? Where...

994
01:35:14,764 --> 01:35:16,756
You men are all alike!

995
01:35:16,849 --> 01:35:19,850
Seven or eight quick ones
and you're off with the boys.

996
01:35:19,936 --> 01:35:23,186
To boast and brag!
You better keep your mouth shut!

997
01:35:24,107 --> 01:35:26,183
Oh, I think I love him...

998
01:36:14,452 --> 01:36:17,156
He's coming back! Oh, look! The music...

999
01:36:17,247 --> 01:36:19,820
Oh! Keep playing! It's the music!

1000
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:22,917
It's the music that's bringing him back!

1001
01:36:25,964 --> 01:36:27,458
Come on! Come on!

1002
01:36:35,433 --> 01:36:37,224
Come on, come on!

1003
01:36:41,856 --> 01:36:43,932
Oh, come on! You can do it!

1004
01:36:50,407 --> 01:36:53,076
Come on! You can do it!

1005
01:36:59,333 --> 01:37:02,120
Don't touch him!
He wants to do it by himself!

1006
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:06,922
You can do it! You can do it!

1007
01:37:07,717 --> 01:37:10,255
Please, my creation!

1008
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:21,730
Quick! Catch him!

1009
01:37:27,613 --> 01:37:31,148
Have all the preparations
been made for the transference?

1010
01:37:31,242 --> 01:37:32,736
Yes, Doctor.

1011
01:37:32,827 --> 01:37:35,365
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

1012
01:37:35,455 --> 01:37:37,946
It's the only thing that can save him now.

1013
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:41,660
You realise you're risking... both your lives?

1014
01:37:44,089 --> 01:37:46,165
Yes.

1015
01:37:58,854 --> 01:38:00,930
Switching off!

1016
01:38:20,836 --> 01:38:23,124
How... how will I know when they are done?

1017
01:38:23,214 --> 01:38:25,539
The doctor said to allow 15 minutes.

1018
01:38:26,217 --> 01:38:28,423
Not one second more...

1019
01:38:28,511 --> 01:38:30,337
..or less.

1020
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:40,647
How long now?

1021
01:38:40,732 --> 01:38:42,392
Two more minutes.

1022
01:39:04,799 --> 01:39:06,875
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

1023
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:09,293
- What time is it?
- Almost time.

1024
01:39:13,892 --> 01:39:15,968
Oh, my God! It's the villagers!

1025
01:39:19,023 --> 01:39:21,311
No! No! Please!

1026
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,688
Just another seven seconds!

1027
01:39:26,948 --> 01:39:29,024
No! No!!

1028
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:32,695
No! No! No!

1029
01:39:33,371 --> 01:39:35,826
- Put that man down!
- It's the monster!

1030
01:39:35,916 --> 01:39:37,540
- No, it can't be.
- It is.

1031
01:39:37,626 --> 01:39:40,829
I said "Put that man down!"

1032
01:39:50,139 --> 01:39:52,808
Und just who do you think you are...

1033
01:39:52,892 --> 01:39:55,299
..that you order these people about?

1034
01:39:55,937 --> 01:39:58,013
I am the monster!

1035
01:40:00,066 --> 01:40:02,391
Ja. I see that you are the monster.

1036
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:05,020
For as long as I can remember...

1037
01:40:05,697 --> 01:40:07,773
..people have hated me.

1038
01:40:08,492 --> 01:40:10,650
They looked at my face and my body...

1039
01:40:11,787 --> 01:40:13,863
..and they ran away in horror.

1040
01:40:13,956 --> 01:40:19,662
In my loneliness, I decided that if I could not
inspire love, which was my deepest hope,...

1041
01:40:20,797 --> 01:40:23,003
..I would instead cause fear!

1042
01:40:25,135 --> 01:40:27,211
I live...

1043
01:40:28,472 --> 01:40:33,763
..because this poor, half-crazed genius
has given me life.

1044
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:36,387
He alone held an image of me...

1045
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,556
..as something beautiful.

1046
01:40:39,275 --> 01:40:41,184
And then,...

1047
01:40:41,277 --> 01:40:45,144
..when it would have been easy enough
to stay out of danger,...

1048
01:40:45,615 --> 01:40:48,699
..he used his own body as a guinea pig...

1049
01:40:48,785 --> 01:40:50,861
..to give me a calmer brain...

1050
01:40:52,539 --> 01:40:58,708
..and a... somewhat more... sophisticated way
of expressing myself.

1051
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:03,747
Well, this is, of course,
an entirely different situation.

1052
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:06,751
As the leader of this community,...

1053
01:41:07,221 --> 01:41:10,969
..may I be the first to offer you my hand...

1054
01:41:11,684 --> 01:41:13,760
..in friendship.

1055
01:41:19,776 --> 01:41:22,183
- Thank you.
- You are entirely welcome.

1056
01:41:22,279 --> 01:41:27,237
Und now let us all go to my house
for a little sponge cake und a little wine...

1057
01:41:28,535 --> 01:41:30,611
..und... Shit!

1058
01:41:33,124 --> 01:41:35,200
To the lumberyard!

1059
01:41:58,984 --> 01:42:01,605
Hello, Mrs Frankenstein.

1060
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:05,606
Mrs Frankenstein! What a beautiful name!

1061
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:07,408
Oh, darling!

1062
01:42:07,493 --> 01:42:09,569
Hold on to your hat.

1063
01:42:10,997 --> 01:42:11,945
What?

1064
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,076
I'll be right back.

1065
01:42:29,308 --> 01:42:31,929
I'm holding on to it, darling!

1066
01:42:32,774 --> 01:42:35,068
Just a few more seconds!

1067
01:43:15,566 --> 01:43:19,610
Honey! Honey, I hope you didn't find
Daddy's little part too boring.

1068
01:43:19,695 --> 01:43:23,277
I mean, he did it just for you
and he meant so well. Say you liked it.

1069
01:43:24,575 --> 01:43:26,651
Honey, did you see?

1070
01:43:26,744 --> 01:43:30,243
I put a special hamper in the bathroom
just for your shirts...

1071
01:43:30,331 --> 01:43:33,664
..and the other one is just for socks
and poo-poo undies.

1072
01:43:33,752 --> 01:43:35,246
Here I come!

1073
01:44:04,367 --> 01:44:06,443
The feeling is mutual.

1074
01:44:09,164 --> 01:44:11,240
You know, it's a puzzlement.

1075
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:15,829
There's something I've always wanted
to ask you about that operation.

1076
01:44:15,921 --> 01:44:18,127
You know in the transference part...

1077
01:44:18,215 --> 01:44:23,719
The monster got part of your wonderful brain,
but what did you ever get from him?
