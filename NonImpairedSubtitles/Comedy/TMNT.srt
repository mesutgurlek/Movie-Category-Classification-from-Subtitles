1
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,445
Four turtles...

2
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,779
...four brothers...

3
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:15,255
...genetically reborn
in the sewers of New York.

4
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:20,720
Named after the great
Renaissance masters...

5
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:23,661
...and trained as ninjas.

6
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:33,633
They battled many creatures and foes
before defeating their archenemy...

7
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,144
... the Shredder.

8
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:45,046
But now a greater evil is poised
to destroy their very brotherhood.

9
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:50,284
An evil born 3000 years ago.

10
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:01,567
It was in that time
that a warrior king named Yoatl...

11
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:06,766
...led a brotherhood that fought
side by side with one purpose:

12
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:12,574
To conquer all the kingdoms
of the world.

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,452
Nothing could stand in their way...

14
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,189
...as they left a trail of destruction
behind them.

15
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,779
In his quest,
the warrior learned of a constellation...

16
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,472
...known as the Stars of Kikan.

17
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:50,517
Every 3000 years,
the stars would align...

18
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:55,420
...opening a portal
to a world of unknown power.

19
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,556
He became immortal...

20
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:03,961
...but at a price.

21
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:11,496
His brotherhood was turned to stone.

22
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,235
And upon the portal's opening...

23
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,246
... 13 monsters were released
into our world.

24
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,170
The warrior king was left
to eternally walk the Earth...

25
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:58,583
...unable to die
or forget his horrible mistake.

26
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:09,587
And the monsters
that were unleashed...

27
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:15,295
...continue to plague mankind
to this very day.

28
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,664
Monsters.

29
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,257
No.

30
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,359
We appreciate the generous donation...

31
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,473
...for the continued protection
of your village.

32
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:58,006
After all, the jungle
can be a very dangerous place.

33
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,082
-Mama!
-Oh, she is dangerous.

34
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,446
There's monsters out there.

35
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,634
Watch where you're going.

36
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,871
There's a log on the road, señor.

37
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:35,609
Well, if you're not too busy, remove it.

38
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:55,095
Who are you? Show yourself.

39
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,469
The ghost of the jungle.
He punishes those who prey upon the weak.

40
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:00,973
He's coming.

41
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:06,576
I just remembered I left the stove on.
My wife hates that.

42
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:10,344
-Coward. Get back here.
-You're on your own, jefe.

43
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,616
Show yourself.
Do you realize who you're dealing with?

44
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,328
What is this-? What?

45
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,272
I am not afraid of a myth.

46
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,506
I'm not afraid of a ghost.

47
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,990
What are you?

48
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:07,538
It's a miracle.

49
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,016
The ghost of the jungle.

50
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,420
There. That's where I saw him.

51
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,721
Thank you.

52
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,000
You'd better get home now.

53
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,432
Do you know the ghost?

54
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,272
He wasn't always a ghost.

55
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,558
Hello?

56
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:10,303
Is anyone here?

57
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:14,099
Hello?

58
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,943
It's a long way from the city
to just drop in.

59
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:28,483
Leo.

60
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,928
You came all the way down here
to look for me?

61
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,087
Actually, I was already here
on business.

62
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,756
But then the local legend
started sounding familiar...

63
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,425
...so I decided to snoop around.

64
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,595
-What kind of business?
-Ancient artifacts.

65
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,071
Some tycoon with too much time
on his hands...

66
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:49,575
...has his heart set on a collection
of 3000-year-old statues.

67
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,805
Well, you always did run
with a strange crowd, April.

68
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:57,544
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd
hasn't been the same without you.

69
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,685
Things aren't looking so good
back home.

70
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,188
How bad could it be?

71
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,022
Donnie's probably got everything
under control.

72
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:08,527
Sir? Sir. Sir.

73
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:13,160
Did you turn the computer on?
Have you plugged it in?

74
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,530
Yeah, that would help.

75
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,296
No, I'm not playing hard to get.

76
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,134
I'm telling you, sir,
it's not that kind of phone line.

77
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,869
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie,
your friendly IT tech support...

78
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:25,013
...here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.

79
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,914
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am.

80
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:33,244
But Donnie's a genius.
Why would he take a job like that?

81
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:34,787
At least he's keeping busy.

82
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:38,017
Well, if he's doing that,
who's keeping an eye on Mikey?

83
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:43,097
Mike's gotten into
the entertainment business.

84
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,556
Yeah.

85
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:49,933
Happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.

86
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:55,141
Take it easy, little dudes.
I bruise easily.

87
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,644
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green,
dudes. Hey, that's-

88
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:00,213
He's a big hit.

89
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:03,716
All right. Let's hear it.
What's Raph doing?

90
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:07,913
No one really knows.
He just sleeps all day.

91
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,081
Well, what's he do all night?

92
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:27,702
2802, 2802, burglary in progress
at 55th and Broadway.

93
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,277
Suspects considered
armed and dangerous.

94
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,841
Time to punch in.

95
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,159
Good work, boys. That was easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

96
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:57,170
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.

97
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,709
I love your work ethic, Tommy.
It's an inspiration to us all.

98
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,843
What was that?

99
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,284
What's going on, guys?

100
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,891
What in the-?

101
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,767
Looks like it's just you and me, shaky.

102
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:31,564
Take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you...

103
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,269
...much.

104
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,854
I love when they play hard to get.

105
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,526
The Nightwatcher.

106
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,069
-He's doing our job for us again.
-Tommy.

107
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,899
-Keep your hands to yourself.
-Hey, who's tickling me?

108
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,999
Your training period ended a year ago.

109
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,645
And Splinter says
you don't write anymore.

110
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,475
Splinter sent me down here
to become a better leader.

111
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,981
I can't go back a failure.

112
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,054
Besides, these people need me
more than my brothers do.

113
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:22,017
If Master Splinter were here...

114
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:24,887
...he would ask you,
"What is your heart telling you? "

115
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,394
I don't know.
I just know something's missing.

116
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,234
Your brothers need you, Leo.

117
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,066
They're lost without you.

118
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,507
Leo?

119
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:25,783
Why skate a halfpipe
when you can skate a sewer pipe?

120
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:38,394
Sewer's up, bra.

121
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:44,097
Hey.

122
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,378
Cowabunga.

123
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,493
Dude. Going down.

124
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,827
Yeah.

125
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,373
Here's Mikey.

126
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,136
Guys?

127
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,975
Anyone?

128
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,414
Hello?

129
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,642
Whatever.

130
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,683
This place used to be fun.

131
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:39,759
And with rocketing interest rates,
that's bad news for homeowners...

132
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,797
...as the real-estate market
continues its downward spiral.

133
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,264
Coming up, the vigilante known
as Nightwatcher strikes again.

134
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:51,664
Now, I can 't say for sure,
but he was definitely an alien.

135
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,207
I think it's a disgrace, taking the law
into your own hands like that.

136
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:58,107
-Leave it to the police.
-Up next...

137
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,148
I remember how that used to feel,
busting up crime syndicates.

138
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,618
Sure, they had a bunch of guns,
but they weren't like these guns.

139
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:10,225
Why do you do this to yourself, Mikey?
Those glory days are over.

140
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:14,226
Forget about them. Get on with your life.
Concentrate on your work.

141
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,422
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.

142
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,195
Well, look who woke up.

143
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:23,566
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher
is some kind of hero.

144
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:27,534
Beats sitting around doing nothing
while dirtbags run free.

145
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,645
I would love to know what it is
that you do that's so great.

146
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,475
We're contributing around here.
All you do is sleep.

147
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,847
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right.
You got me all figured out.

148
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,512
I know that your attitude has been
a source of contention to this team.

149
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,352
You think fear is the best way
to accomplish things.

150
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,825
First of all, this team you speak of
doesn't exist anymore.

151
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,624
And second of all...

152
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:51,231
Raphael.

153
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,070
Enough.

154
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,203
I think I made my point.

155
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,501
That doesn't prove anything.

156
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:05,912
Why couldn't you send him away
for training?

157
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:09,983
Donatello, this home
has become like an empty shell.

158
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:13,747
Each of your brothers
has strengths and weaknesses.

159
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:17,050
You must learn to be strong
when they are weak.

160
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,888
If you don't learn to recognize this...

161
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,158
...then all hope is lost for our family.

162
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,247
Keep it coming.

163
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:50,924
Hey, careful.

164
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,720
Those aren't souvenirs.

165
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:55,719
Sorry about that, ma'am.

166
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,730
Where are you, Casey?

167
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:05,171
Come on. Come on, pick up.

168
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,969
Don't do this to me again. Not now.

169
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:12,409
Casey can't come to the phone right now
because we're hardly working.

170
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,407
This better be good.

171
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:22,023
Casey, I am standing on the dock with
a priceless statue and no delivery truck.

172
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,922
-So my question is, where are you?
-April.

173
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,462
Hey, babe. I am so sorry.
I set the alarm clock, but...

174
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:35,236
It' s broken. The clock...

175
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,198
It' s bad enough that you ' re
out every night playing vigilante...

176
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,708
-...but we've got a deadline to meet.
-I'm sorry.

177
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,315
Oh, wait, babe, real quick.
You left a message saying you found Leo.

178
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,475
-I mean, is he there with you?
-No.

179
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,678
I found him. He's not coming back.

180
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:58,689
But didn't you tell him how weird things
have gotten with the Turtles?

181
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:01,694
Look, Casey, we're gonna lose
the biggest client we have...

182
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:03,661
...if you don 't get down here.

183
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,801
All right. I'm on my way.

184
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:16,472
Please tell me we're getting paid
by the pound here.

185
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,910
Is this place a museum or what?

186
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:22,107
-You've never heard of Winterscorp?
-That's what I'm telling you.

187
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:26,448
They're into everything: real estate,
technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.

188
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,647
-I don't wear hair gel.
-Really?

189
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:32,157
I'm the caveman type, au naturel.

190
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,761
Just make sure you don't
touch anything in here.

191
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,660
Hey, I was born careful.

192
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,199
Hope that wasn't expensive.

193
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:45,173
Oh, wait- Just- I'm-

194
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,832
-Oh, boy.
-Please tell me that wasn't you.

195
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,647
-Mr. Winters.
-Miss O'Neil.

196
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,385
All the pieces are coming together.

197
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,792
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.

198
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,296
-Nice to meet you, Kenny.
-Boyfriend. It's Casey.

199
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:14,128
-So you were successful?
-Yes. The fourth general.

200
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,032
I want to ask you before I go...

201
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:19,663
...if I could take one last look?

202
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:33,253
I believe this is the one
they call General Akeela?

203
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,290
It's actually "Aguila,"
but that was a good try.

204
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:42,155
These statues may appear
to be only stone...

205
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:46,324
...but they're like family to me.
I didn't choose them.

206
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:50,232
Friends you can choose,
but never your family.

207
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,304
Okay, then.

208
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,604
Take care, Mr. Winters.

209
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,411
If you've come to kill me,
could you make it fast?

210
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:10,456
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10.
I'd rather miss it.

211
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:17,798
If we had come here to hurt you,
you'd be hurting already.

212
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,197
The Foot Clan and l
have come to hear your offer.

213
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,238
Well, it appears that today
is my lucky day.

214
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:28,332
I must warn you,
we do not come cheap.

215
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,035
Does it look like
money is of any concern to me?

216
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:34,182
Only time is of the essence, my dear.

217
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,614
Since you're so rich and powerful...

218
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:39,720
...what is it we could possibly have
to offer you?

219
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,913
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

220
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,320
I have some friends coming to town...

221
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,621
...that I'd like to roll out
the red carpet for.

222
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:52,732
Greet them warmly
and bring them to me.

223
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:56,265
And how will we know these friends?

224
00:20:56,438 --> 00:21:00,636
Don't worry, they're impossible to miss.

225
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,500
And you keep them up. Got that?

226
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,433
And don't let me catch you
calling the cops.

227
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,234
What? Not again.

228
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:41,911
Didn't I take care of you last week?

229
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:45,815
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.

230
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:49,116
I'm very disappointed in you,
knucklehead.

231
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,555
Guess night school's in session.

232
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,786
Hope I'm not disturbing class.

233
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,556
Hey, Nightwatcher,
need any teaching assistants?

234
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,700
Oh, no. Casey.

235
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:02,735
I got this one covered, pal.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

236
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:08,001
You think you own these rooftops?
I happen to think you could use my help.

237
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,043
And I could use a sidekick.

238
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:13,340
You may have everyone else fooled,
but you haven't fooled me, Raph.

239
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:16,177
Yeah, well, guess what, pal.
Now you-

240
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:19,650
Hey, wait a minute.
How did you know it was me?

241
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:23,981
Wasn't that hard, man.
You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.

242
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,285
It's that obvious, huh?

243
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:32,891
-I should've stayed in law school.
-Ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.

244
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:38,802
Well, looks like I got a sidekick.

245
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:42,273
Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.

246
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:50,046
-What, is it performance art? I don't get it.
-What was I supposed to do...

247
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:52,982
...sit around, wait for Leo to come back
and save the day?

248
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,248
I mean, we haven't
heard word one from him...

249
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:58,257
...since Splinter sent him away
on his little vacation.

250
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:01,828
You think these lowlifes take vacations
at the first sign of pressure?

251
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:05,899
No. The criminal element of this city
may be guilty of a lot of things...

252
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,400
...but being quitters ain't one of them.

253
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:11,536
You know, I don't even care
about Leo anymore.

254
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:13,367
Kind of hope he never comes back.

255
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,375
Come on, aren't you being
a little hard on the guy?

256
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,274
I don't know. It's possible.

257
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,473
I guess if I could live anywhere
other than the city, I'd go too.

258
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,811
But I could never leave this place.

259
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:28,115
I can't even sleep without the sound
of the subway rumbling over my head.

260
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,350
I guess it comes from growing up
with a houseful of brothers.

261
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,858
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

262
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:38,022
I'm just saying that if it was my brother,
I'd find a way to work it out.

263
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,827
But that's just me.

264
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,993
I got my own issues, you know?
Like back at home, with April.

265
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,571
There's this whole thing
about settling down...

266
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,799
...that makes me miss the old times.

267
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:51,377
I don't know if I can be the grownup
she needs me to be.

268
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,082
Good talk, Raph.

269
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,907
Arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.

270
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:29,107
The Stars of Kikan align.

271
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:34,017
All ye generals,
wake from your stone slumber.

272
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,364
Dude.

273
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:27,166
Dude.

274
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,293
Enter.

275
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,656
Kneel, my son.

276
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:00,975
I return from my training, master.

277
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:06,307
I was so caught up in my own world,
I forgot about everyone else.

278
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:10,276
I'm sorry I failed.

279
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,087
On the contrary, my son...

280
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:21,224
...now you are much stronger.

281
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:33,006
Your strength is needed here now.

282
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:39,044
You owe me no apology,
but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.

283
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:43,514
Your absence has been
particularly difficult for him...

284
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:46,385
...though he'll never admit it.

285
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:49,887
I'm certain things will be back to normal
in no time, master.

286
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:56,556
Good. Because until you can act as one,
you are forbidden to fight.

287
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:58,966
Yes, sensei.

288
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,899
I have missed you, Leonardo.

289
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:05,665
I've missed you too, Father.

290
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,240
Raphael.

291
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,345
Your brother is home.

292
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,285
-Hey.
-Hey.

293
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:21,784
Welcome home.

294
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:23,890
Yeah. Thanks.

295
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,189
Well, I'm going to bed.

296
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:34,191
Hey, Leo's back.
Better go say hello before he leaves again.

297
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,997
-What? Leo.
-Hey.

298
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,402
-Hey.
-Huh, Leo?

299
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,974
-Is that really you?
-Yeah.

300
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:46,341
-I'm, like, dreaming, aren't l?
-No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.

301
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:50,951
Oh, good.
I have nightmares about birthday parties.

302
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:57,057
Okay, Leo, I'll bite.
What are we doing up here?

303
00:27:57,225 --> 00:28:00,285
I told Splinter
I'd get this team in shape again.

304
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:05,297
Hey, I've been training. Since you left,
my video-game scores have, like, doubled.

305
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:08,129
Right, and while you've been
playing games, brother...

306
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,464
...Nightwatcher's
come into the neighborhood...

307
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:13,630
...like some kind of vigilante showboat.
But his days are done.

308
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:15,639
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo...

309
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,938
...and the Nightwatcher
was the only guy to pick up the slack.

310
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,140
Crime never took a break. You did.

311
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:26,151
I heard his bike turns into a plane or,
like, a jetpack.

312
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:29,381
Hey, Don, you're so smart,
why don't we have jetpacks?

313
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:32,720
That's good, Mikey. I don't even
trust you with a driver's license.

314
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:35,454
Have you seen
the way this guy behaves-

315
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:42,025
Someone's cranky.

316
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:48,101
-Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine.
-Raph, wait.

317
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,937
Splinter told us not to fight.

318
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:53,103
"Jungle boy." Good one.

319
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,446
All right. But remember,
we're only up here for training.

320
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,589
You know what I always say,
"Train by doing, dude."

321
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:04,316
Mikey, when have you ever said that?

322
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,792
You smell that?
It's like a monkey cage up here.

323
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:13,623
Wow, good news is,
there's a bunch of Foot ninjas...

324
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:16,134
...getting the snot kicked out of them.

325
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:24,136
Bad news is, this thing
is gonna run out of bodies soon.

326
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:27,281
Yeah, so?
You think we should help these guys?

327
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:30,850
I'd rather enjoy the show.
What do you say, fearless leader?

328
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,816
-We're not-
-I say we stop talking.

329
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,220
Come here, fuzzy wuzzy.

330
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:44,762
You.

331
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:50,294
I think we're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

332
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:54,640
-We're trying to help you.
-Never.

333
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,077
Team.

334
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:03,413
Wait, the Shredder's dead.

335
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,987
Who are you working for?

336
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:13,920
Hey, a little help, O fearless one.

337
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:20,267
That was too easy.

338
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:22,460
Like I said, too easy.

339
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,230
Bad dog.

340
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:34,212
Look at me. Found the elevator.

341
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,109
Oh, my shoulder.

342
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,050
My spleen.

343
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:55,994
This place needed a skylight.

344
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,668
This is why we need jetpacks.

345
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:07,474
-Okay, any more bright ideas?
-How about this?

346
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:15,383
When this is over,
I'm totally calling the architect.

347
00:31:55,163 --> 00:32:00,032
Wait a minute. How did something
that big just disappear? It doesn't-

348
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:02,703
Dude, it's the cops.

349
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,234
Raph. Raph!

350
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:20,315
Oh, yeah. The turtles are back, dudes.

351
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:24,424
I give us a 10 for style,
an eight for skill...

352
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:27,857
...and a two for stealth.

353
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:38,529
What seems to be the problem?

354
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:42,233
The problem is that we were hired
to merely patrol the city...

355
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,878
...and report anything strange to you.

356
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:49,706
You never said anything about monsters.

357
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:57,815
Now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group
have been reduced to hired guns...

358
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:01,758
...but I believe we made a deal, Karai.

359
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:04,124
And I expect you to honor it.

360
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:09,260
You do understand honor, don't you?

361
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:14,631
So how did we fare?

362
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:23,644
My, my, my. And what is your name?

363
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:28,920
Were there any problems, general?

364
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,081
None, my lord.

365
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,558
Then show these fools
how a true warrior acts.

366
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,924
Keep them on schedule
in completing their task.

367
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,759
We do not need any help.

368
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:43,427
Nevertheless, Karai,
I trust my family more than I trust you.

369
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,597
You may be the eyes and ears,
but they are the muscle.

370
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,938
They will help you gather
the remaining 12 of these abominations...

371
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,445
...so we can finally see
our birthrights fulfilled.

372
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,941
It's going to be quite a party.

373
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:07,554
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate
of that thing that hit us last night?

374
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:09,060
My head.

375
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,428
Okay, that was just weird. I mean,
first the Foot, then that hideous monster.

376
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:17,628
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude.

377
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,400
Yeah, that would make her
your mom too, doofus.

378
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,100
Yeah, whatever.

379
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:25,609
Keep laughing.
Last night was an embarrassment.

380
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,045
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You can't follow a single order.

381
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:32,186
Oh, how cute.
You've been back for five minutes...

382
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:35,015
...and now you're schooling us
on your master plan?

383
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:37,282
Okay, so this is my fault now,
huh, Raph?

384
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,722
I'm the only one
that has to be responsible?

385
00:34:39,894 --> 00:34:41,828
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.

386
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,294
Dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter.

387
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:54,970
Good morning, my sons.

388
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,134
-Good morning, sensei.
-Sup?

389
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:05,377
Every ninja's day should start
with a healthy breakfast.

390
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:10,320
It fills me with pride
to see you boys together again.

391
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:14,484
If anyone needs me,
I'll be watching my stories.

392
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,556
-Hothead.
-Splinter Jr.

393
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:23,267
Cody is going to break up with Donna.
I just know it.

394
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:26,736
We interrupt the Gilmore Girls
for this special news report.

395
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:28,500
Monsters loose in the city?

396
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:31,076
Strange reports are coming in
about an incident...

397
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,679
...that sounds like something
out of science fiction.

398
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,509
Boys!

399
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:40,884
Leonardo,
I am most disappointed in you.

400
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,250
You are the eldest of your brothers.

401
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:48,628
I was counting on you to bring order
to the chaos of this family.

402
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:52,823
This is why I have forbidden
any surface activity.

403
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,867
We cannot return to the surface
to fight evil...

404
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:58,505
...if we continue to fight each other.

405
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:01,267
But Master Splinter,
how can I be expected to do so-

406
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:05,435
There are no excuses
when you are the leader, my student.

407
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:11,974
We have to go out
and find who's responsible for this.

408
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:13,552
There ain't no other solution.

409
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:16,713
Save the brute-vigilante junk
for that Nightwatchman.

410
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:18,222
-Nightwatcher.
-Nightwatcher.

411
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,292
Yeah, whatever.

412
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,361
I'm going out.

413
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,544
Witnesses say
there are holes in the floors...

414
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,815
...as if something or someone had just
blasted straight down through them...

415
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,857
...leaving authorities
scratching their heads.

416
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:36,023
Well, at least some people
care about justice these days.

417
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:38,131
Hey, Casey.

418
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,624
-Raph?
-Meet me on the roof, okay?

419
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,393
What is it?

420
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,437
The roof.
You know what the roof is, don't you?

421
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,096
Pushy sidekick.

422
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:49,902
We've gotten this image
in from an amateur cameraman...

423
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,068
...and I do stress "amateur. "

424
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:56,742
Casey, come look at this.

425
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:03,286
Be safe.

426
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,993
What's this all about, Raph?

427
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:10,630
We got bigger things to worry about
than criminals.

428
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,322
Like what?

429
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:18,027
Come on.

430
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,787
I think we lost it.

431
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,551
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

432
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:41,792
I don't think so.

433
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,264
What's going on, Raph?

434
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,567
Did I mention
we ran into a monster last night?

435
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:58,542
No, you kind of failed to tell me
about that one, buddy.

436
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,340
You do know I only have
a wooden bat, don't you?

437
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:11,482
The Foot? I thought they were history.

438
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:23,069
And now we got walking statues?
You got a plan for those?

439
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:25,865
Yeah. Hey, those are a first for me too.

440
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:28,639
And who knows?
These guys might be friendly.

441
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,172
Friendly.

442
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:46,557
Wait a second. Those statues look-

443
00:40:55,102 --> 00:40:56,763
Witnesses.

444
00:40:58,439 --> 00:40:59,838
Watch out.

445
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,001
I don't feel so good.

446
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,846
That can't be good.

447
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,886
That's just rude.

448
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:21,556
Hey, wait up.

449
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:24,521
-Raph?
-Come here.

450
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:27,792
-What, you never heard of smoke pellets?
-Warn me next time.

451
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:29,299
I got allergies.

452
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:34,099
Come on.
That's the second mask this week.

453
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,566
They'll never find us in here.

454
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:42,270
Stay with me, now.
We'll be out of here soon.

455
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:50,287
No.

456
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,059
And I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.

457
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,100
Some people just can't take a hint.

458
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:06,797
This is the police. You on the roof,
put your hands behind your...

459
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,304
What is that? Tommy, you see this?

460
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,176
Yeah, you better run.

461
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,680
I gotta hand it to you, Raph...

462
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:22,583
...you sure know how
to show a lady a good time.

463
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,647
Raph?

464
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:30,491
Oh, no.
I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.

465
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:37,101
My compliments to the chef.

466
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,109
Anyone for dessert?

467
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:45,711
-No.
-Yes.

468
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:48,507
Cowabunga Carl Party Services.
Cowabunga, dude.

469
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:51,947
-Raph 's hurt. You need to get over here.
-Slow down, April.

470
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,145
-What happened to Raph?
-I don 't know. He's unconscious.

471
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,119
We'll be right there.

472
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:07,960
Leo. You came back.

473
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:09,830
Leo.

474
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,939
Sorry the reunion
isn't under better circumstances.

475
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,699
Nice pad, kids.

476
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:18,310
Oh, hey, Raph.

477
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,073
Well, his vital signs seem to be okay.

478
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,880
Pupil dilation is normal.

479
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:37,893
Some sort of stone.
Probably obsidian, I think.

480
00:43:38,332 --> 00:43:40,562
Well, is he gonna be all right?

481
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:43,398
You're still here?
Go back to your jungle.

482
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,437
Well, at least
his personality's still intact.

483
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:50,338
And there's an engraving on it.
Looks South American.

484
00:43:50,944 --> 00:43:53,378
That's your department, April.

485
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:59,679
Would it help if I told you that those statues
you collected for Winters...

486
00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:02,549
...were shooting these things
at me and Raph?

487
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:08,918
"The legend of Yoatl." It can't be.

488
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,122
It was just a myth...

489
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:14,825
...a scary story the locals told kids
around a campfire.

490
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:17,095
Whoa, what are you talking about?

491
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:23,200
They say 3000 years ago,
some great warrior...

492
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:27,939
...actually found a portal
to another dimension.

493
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,651
And when the portal opened...

494
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:40,453
...the energy from it
gave the warrior eternal life.

495
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:44,893
But it also turned his generals to stone.

496
00:44:45,232 --> 00:44:48,793
What if this warrior
just kept living forever?

497
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:51,938
He would spend
the rest of his days in regret...

498
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:56,065
...spending all of his riches
and all of his power...

499
00:44:56,243 --> 00:44:59,337
... to find a way
to revive his stone generals.

500
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,249
Maybe, just maybe...

501
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:10,390
...he 's built a new empire.

502
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:28,704
But, hey, like I said, it' s just a myth.

503
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,841
If you ask me, guys,
this has Winters' name written all over it.

504
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:36,847
-How do you figure that, Donnie?
-Yeah.

505
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:40,885
Because this has Winters' name
written all over it.

506
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,648
Now I know who to thank
for this shot in the arm.

507
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,292
So where do we find this guy
and his stone jokers?

508
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,951
We're not going
until we get Splinter's blessing.

509
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:52,724
You're gonna quote a rulebook to me
that you ain't been following for a year?

510
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,199
If you got something you wanna
get off your shell, now's the time.

511
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,464
But I'm not gonna stand here
and debate Splinter's orders with you.

512
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:04,303
Fine, then. I quit.

513
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,372
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.

514
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:13,006
Sometimes just taking a breather
is the best thing to do.

515
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,715
Whatever.

516
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:56,426
To picking up the pieces.

517
00:46:58,229 --> 00:46:59,696
What is it?

518
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:03,459
Two creatures remain, my lord.

519
00:47:03,635 --> 00:47:07,628
Well, by all means, then,
let's finish it.

520
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:12,402
And you will finally be free
of your stone prison.

521
00:47:12,577 --> 00:47:17,674
But if the curse is broken,
we will no longer be immortal.

522
00:47:18,283 --> 00:47:21,719
Brother, do not question my command.

523
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:29,660
-Here we go, now.
-So, what are we looking for?

524
00:47:29,828 --> 00:47:32,991
Well, according to these star charts,
the portal is set to open...

525
00:47:33,164 --> 00:47:37,066
...directly over Winters Tower
in the next 24 hours.

526
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:40,329
So the legend is right.
Three thousand years.

527
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:44,339
And when the portal opens,
we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.

528
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:49,344
Within days, the country.
And within weeks, the world.

529
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:56,083
Oh, so it's like Halley's comet,
only monsters come out?

530
00:47:57,722 --> 00:48:00,452
Yes. I guess so.

531
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:03,752
I'm smart.

532
00:48:06,598 --> 00:48:07,929
I'm okay.

533
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:09,657
Why do we need Raph, anyway?

534
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:12,803
It's his temper that always
jeopardizes all our missions.

535
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:16,532
Okay, Leo. Whatever you say.
Nobody was talking about him.

536
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:22,910
Leonardo, this team
you are so eager to lead is incomplete.

537
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,777
You know what you must do.

538
00:48:27,452 --> 00:48:29,784
Yes, sensei.

539
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:44,528
Generals, I think our brother
has plans to betray us.

540
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:50,039
The 13th monster must not be found.

541
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:56,472
Why don 't we take one more call
about these monster sightings?

542
00:48:56,648 --> 00:48:58,878
Suffern, New Jersey, you're on.

543
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:02,813
Monster sightings.

544
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:25,638
A monster!

545
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,471
Attention, all on-duty officers:

546
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:30,170
Report of a disturbance on 32nd.
No units available.

547
00:49:30,348 --> 00:49:32,373
They're playing my song.

548
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:38,349
Where are the cops?
How come the cops haven't shown up?

549
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:41,515
Just remember what my analyst said,
just go to my happy place.

550
00:49:41,693 --> 00:49:44,890
Everything's gonna be fine. Happy place.
I'm feeling good. I'm thin.

551
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:47,896
Don't get up. I'll serve myself.

552
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:55,530
Look at you. Ain't you cute?

553
00:49:55,707 --> 00:49:59,302
You want a butt-kicking, little fella?
Yes, you do. You do.

554
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:03,880
Come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you
to hurty town. Come on, little guy.

555
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:09,545
Get off of me, you little monster.

556
00:50:14,192 --> 00:50:16,217
You're scratching the helmet.

557
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:21,229
Okay, that was different.

558
00:50:30,308 --> 00:50:34,074
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof.
Get off of me.

559
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:47,921
Come on.

560
00:50:57,635 --> 00:50:59,762
How about a snack, little fella?

561
00:51:00,805 --> 00:51:02,295
Catch.

562
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:19,816
Keep on running,
you filthy little hermit crab.

563
00:51:19,991 --> 00:51:22,653
That spicy meatball's on the house.

564
00:51:23,194 --> 00:51:25,492
Big guy, please don't hurt me.

565
00:51:25,663 --> 00:51:28,063
What? I'm not robbing you,
I'm helping you.

566
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:31,360
Okay, whatever you say, sir.
Please, I got kids in college.

567
00:51:31,536 --> 00:51:32,662
Community college.

568
00:51:33,004 --> 00:51:34,904
Here you go, pal.
Make sure this is safe.

569
00:51:35,073 --> 00:51:37,064
Take everything.
I'm not even looking. Go.

570
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:41,268
Why is it everyone's got such a hard time
believing I am a good guy?

571
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:44,142
I just saved your life.

572
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:53,185
This night just keeps getting
better and better.

573
00:52:23,755 --> 00:52:25,120
Get off my car.

574
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:59,484
I want you to know
that I appreciate your intentions...

575
00:52:59,657 --> 00:53:01,955
...but you can't change the world
like this.

576
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:04,825
-The road you're on is a dead end.
-Is he kidding?

577
00:53:04,996 --> 00:53:06,725
-I've tried it.
-He's lecturing.

578
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:09,458
So I'm gonna give you one chance
to just walk away...

579
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:12,535
...and stop this vigilante nonsense.

580
00:53:13,404 --> 00:53:15,235
Okay, Leo...

581
00:53:15,406 --> 00:53:19,001
...time to teach you a lesson.

582
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:27,348
Look, trust me when I tell you,
you don't wanna do this.

583
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:33,820
Oh, yeah.
Well, I notice you got quite a temper.

584
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,357
Hey, have you ever done this before?

585
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:43,824
Oh, come on. You call that an attack?

586
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:55,743
All right. Finally, some excitement.

587
00:54:07,325 --> 00:54:08,883
Funny thing about anger:

588
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,722
Let it consume you,
and soon enough...

589
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:18,066
...you lose sight of everything.

590
00:54:29,147 --> 00:54:31,308
Good night, dark prince.

591
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:36,576
Raph?

592
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:39,215
What?

593
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:44,558
You are so smug, you know that?

594
00:54:44,729 --> 00:54:47,095
You think the world revolves around you,
don't you?

595
00:54:47,265 --> 00:54:50,234
We couldn't survive without
the mighty and powerful Leonardo...

596
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:52,232
...to guide us through our problems.

597
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:56,066
Well, I got a news flash for you:
We got along just fine without you.

598
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,109
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"?
Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?

599
00:55:01,279 --> 00:55:05,215
Risking the safety of our family?
I mean, come on, what were you thinking?

600
00:55:05,383 --> 00:55:07,681
Don't push it.
You can't leave and come back...

601
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:10,685
...expecting us to fall in line
like your little soldiers.

602
00:55:10,855 --> 00:55:15,519
Hey, I was training.
Training to be a better leader, for you.

603
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:19,026
-Why do you hate me for that?
-And whoever said I wanted to be led?

604
00:55:19,197 --> 00:55:22,064
I'm better off calling my own shots now.
Get used to it.

605
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:26,169
You aren't ready.
You're impatient and hot-tempered.

606
00:55:26,337 --> 00:55:30,273
And more importantly,
I'm better than you.

607
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,178
Oh, you know something, big brother?

608
00:55:34,345 --> 00:55:37,837
I'd have to disagree with you
on that one.

609
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:42,281
Don't do this, Raph.

610
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:45,721
I'm done taking orders.

611
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:52,114
Not human...

612
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:56,917
...but clearly not the final monster.

613
00:57:57,688 --> 00:58:00,851
Yoatl won't know the difference.

614
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:06,622
By the time our brother discovers
this turtle is not the 13th monster...

615
00:58:06,998 --> 00:58:10,695
...it will already be too late.

616
00:58:14,939 --> 00:58:16,600
Leo.

617
00:58:30,154 --> 00:58:33,419
Leo. Hang on.

618
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:39,057
Leo.

619
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:42,021
Leo.

620
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:55,243
No!

621
00:59:14,732 --> 00:59:17,963
Raphael. What is the matter?

622
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:20,467
I was out. I was out and I did-
I did something.

623
00:59:20,638 --> 00:59:23,607
Something happened
and then l- And l...

624
00:59:25,242 --> 00:59:28,177
Raphael. Kneel.

625
00:59:29,613 --> 00:59:31,444
I did something.

626
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:33,947
I did something really stupid,
Master Splinter.

627
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:36,678
Go on.

628
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:39,646
I know why you chose him now.

629
00:59:39,824 --> 00:59:43,726
I know that there's a reason
why he's the better son and I'm not.

630
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:49,924
Raphael, you always bear
the world's problems on your shoulders.

631
00:59:50,101 --> 00:59:56,370
It is an admirable quality
when you are a protector of others.

632
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:02,570
But you must realize that while, at times,
you may not be my favorite student...

633
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:07,240
...it does not mean
that you are my least-favorite son.

634
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:12,481
You are strong, passionate
and loyal to a fault.

635
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:16,649
These are the merits
of a great leader as well...

636
01:00:16,827 --> 01:00:21,025
...but only when tempered
with compassion and humility.

637
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:24,656
But, Master Splinter,
I messed up big tonight.

638
01:00:24,835 --> 01:00:27,326
I mean big.

639
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:31,931
They took him.

640
01:00:38,716 --> 01:00:40,479
Leonardo.

641
01:00:41,118 --> 01:00:42,676
Yeah.

642
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,493
Then the time for hiding is over.

643
01:00:52,663 --> 01:00:58,329
We must return to the surface
to take back what is ours.

644
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:03,198
By your wish, Father.

645
01:01:06,043 --> 01:01:10,275
Long have we been in hiding.
Perhaps too long.

646
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:13,507
Well, what do we do now?

647
01:01:13,684 --> 01:01:15,413
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

648
01:01:15,586 --> 01:01:19,955
We're gonna rescue our brother,
and then we're gonna save New York City.

649
01:02:26,724 --> 01:02:29,750
I got it on my last trip to Japan.
You like it?

650
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:31,827
Oh, yeah.

651
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:36,126
No way.

652
01:02:38,602 --> 01:02:40,968
You can't go trick-or-treating
without your mask.

653
01:02:42,006 --> 01:02:45,032
Oh, babe. Thanks.

654
01:03:01,325 --> 01:03:04,783
As ordered,
no one gets into the tower...

655
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:10,127
...no one interferes,
no one bears witness.

656
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,174
You've got to be kidding me.

657
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:28,511
Cowabunga, dude. I'm here
for little Maxie's 13th birthday party.

658
01:03:28,686 --> 01:03:30,017
Leave now.

659
01:03:30,187 --> 01:03:33,020
Oh, but you don't understand, lady.
I got...

660
01:04:21,138 --> 01:04:27,008
At last. After 3000 years,
the time is finally at hand.

661
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:50,932
What-? What have you done?

662
01:04:51,802 --> 01:04:54,771
Your time for giving orders is over.

663
01:04:54,972 --> 01:04:56,337
You don't understand.

664
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:58,532
I want to send these creatures back...

665
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:01,371
...to undo the damage
that was done so many years ago.

666
01:05:01,545 --> 01:05:04,605
Time has done nothing
but made you weak.

667
01:05:04,782 --> 01:05:07,046
We have our own plans.

668
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:09,412
Immortality is a curse, brother.

669
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,986
Trust me, I've lived long enough to know.

670
01:05:12,156 --> 01:05:15,284
We have to find that 13th monster.
It's time to end it.

671
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:17,051
No.

672
01:05:18,362 --> 01:05:21,559
Our time is just beginning.

673
01:05:44,154 --> 01:05:46,622
-Little help, Don.
-I'm on it.

674
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,768
Heads up, dudes.

675
01:05:58,936 --> 01:06:01,097
Goal.

676
01:06:04,775 --> 01:06:07,539
Guys, front door's open. Now.

677
01:06:07,945 --> 01:06:10,470
Two minutes for high sticking.

678
01:06:13,851 --> 01:06:17,912
Dudes, that rocked. Let's go again.

679
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:30,892
-Dudes, what do we do?
-I'm working on it.

680
01:06:32,169 --> 01:06:34,034
You break it, you buy it.

681
01:06:39,142 --> 01:06:41,201
Yeah. All right.

682
01:06:41,378 --> 01:06:44,006
All right. Nice.

683
01:06:44,181 --> 01:06:47,309
-Nice work, Jones.
-I have my moments.

684
01:06:47,484 --> 01:06:49,509
Whoa, check it out.

685
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:53,281
That would be the swirling vortex
to another world, I assume.

686
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,448
Cool. I want one.

687
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:00,052
Leo, is that you?

688
01:07:01,999 --> 01:07:03,796
Sorry, wrong cage.

689
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,503
-Leo. I got him.
-Out of the way, please.

690
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:20,078
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.

691
01:07:20,684 --> 01:07:22,549
There you go.

692
01:07:33,797 --> 01:07:37,096
You're gonna need these
if you're gonna lead us out of here.

693
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:40,999
I'm gonna need you too.

694
01:07:47,678 --> 01:07:50,738
-Winters.
-Looks more like fall. Get it?

695
01:07:50,914 --> 01:07:52,609
Mikey, remember our talk.

696
01:07:55,552 --> 01:07:58,248
Looks like someone got to him
before us.

697
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:02,748
Is he dead?

698
01:08:08,165 --> 01:08:10,531
Not so immortal, huh, dudes?

699
01:08:14,438 --> 01:08:17,407
Your time's run out, Winters.

700
01:08:18,008 --> 01:08:19,498
Miss O'Neil.

701
01:08:19,676 --> 01:08:24,238
I must have hit my head pretty hard.
I'm seeing giant turtles.

702
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:27,383
We know what you're up to, Winters.
We know about the portal...

703
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:30,816
...and we think that it's time
you sent all these monsters home.

704
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:36,222
I couldn't agree with you more.

705
01:08:36,393 --> 01:08:40,386
It is time to put an end to the curse
that I have brought upon myself...

706
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:42,862
...and this world.

707
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:47,436
That's what this is about, Miss O'Neil:
penance.

708
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:52,906
I must return all 13 beasts
or our curse will continue.

709
01:08:53,076 --> 01:08:57,513
And that is a torment
I can no longer bear.

710
01:08:57,681 --> 01:09:01,777
Then you should be
put out of your misery.

711
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:05,886
I think we walked in
on a family feud, guys.

712
01:09:06,156 --> 01:09:10,991
The time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the Earth.

713
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:13,129
Nothing will stand in our way...

714
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:16,265
...when we have an army
at our command.

715
01:09:16,433 --> 01:09:19,960
-My brothers, l-
-We are no brothers to you.

716
01:09:20,137 --> 01:09:25,939
With one monster still free,
the curse will never be broken.

717
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:30,546
We shall finish what we began
all those years ago.

718
01:09:30,714 --> 01:09:33,478
And we will finally have our victory.

719
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:36,619
Join us. Join us, Foot Clan.

720
01:09:36,787 --> 01:09:40,723
Swear your allegiance to us
and no harm will befall you.

721
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:48,457
The Foot ninja is not without honor.
We work for Winters, not you.

722
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:55,267
Okay, what does that mean?

723
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:58,431
It means we're going to help you.

724
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:03,511
My ninja will find the last monster
and you will bring it back here.

725
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,409
Hurry, we don't have much time.

726
01:10:09,052 --> 01:10:11,452
Hey. I got shotgun.

727
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:13,179
Forget about them.

728
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:17,190
By the time they return,
the portal will already be closed...

729
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,988
...with you inside it.

730
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:22,322
I hate to see brothers fight like this.

731
01:10:22,499 --> 01:10:25,366
Unless it's together.

732
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:31,766
Hate to rain on your parade, pal,
but we thought we'd even the odds.

733
01:10:31,942 --> 01:10:34,911
We're going to enjoy this.

734
01:10:40,884 --> 01:10:44,115
If you please. They can defeat them.

735
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:46,619
They are a team.

736
01:10:47,057 --> 01:10:50,493
Let's hope so, because if not,
Aguila will use the portal...

737
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:55,893
...to draw forth an army of evil
and the world will be lost.

738
01:10:57,634 --> 01:11:01,866
More beasts.
Let's send them back where they belong.

739
01:11:07,878 --> 01:11:09,539
Temper, temper.

740
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,857
Come to daddy.

741
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:35,398
Thing about you immortal stone guys is...

742
01:11:35,572 --> 01:11:38,268
...you know, you're immortal
and made of stone.

743
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:40,432
I sound like Mikey.

744
01:11:41,778 --> 01:11:44,838
You fight well. You should join us.

745
01:11:45,148 --> 01:11:47,514
No, thanks, I'm good.

746
01:11:56,259 --> 01:11:59,626
These guys really don't die.
Sensei, are you all right?

747
01:12:00,797 --> 01:12:03,129
We must do this more often.

748
01:12:05,936 --> 01:12:07,733
I still got it.

749
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,872
They'd better hurry
with that last monster.

750
01:12:13,043 --> 01:12:15,910
I'm sure my man Casey's
got it all under control.

751
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,348
That's what I'm afraid of.

752
01:12:25,088 --> 01:12:26,749
Can't this piece of junk go faster?

753
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:28,982
-Wanna drive?
-I would, as a matter of fact.

754
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:35,064
You would think they would be
more concerned about the 13th monster.

755
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:01,987
Boys, we must finish this now.

756
01:13:27,651 --> 01:13:29,141
So did we win?

757
01:13:36,426 --> 01:13:40,863
Foolish creatures.
We are immortals made of stone.

758
01:13:41,031 --> 01:13:43,795
Without the final monster
to break our curse...

759
01:13:43,967 --> 01:13:46,959
...we will never be stopped.

760
01:13:49,339 --> 01:13:51,170
Special delivery.

761
01:13:57,147 --> 01:13:58,341
Look out.

762
01:14:39,322 --> 01:14:41,552
So did we win now?

763
01:14:41,725 --> 01:14:44,489
-Yeah, I think we did.
-We won.

764
01:14:44,661 --> 01:14:45,821
-All right.
-Yeah!

765
01:14:45,996 --> 01:14:48,965
All right. That's what I'm talking about.

766
01:14:49,366 --> 01:14:50,697
Yeah!

767
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:53,496
Nice parallel parking.

768
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,935
Next time, I'm driving.

769
01:15:01,244 --> 01:15:03,940
Hey. Watch the hair.

770
01:15:08,718 --> 01:15:12,381
Typical. We do all the work,
he gets all the thanks.

771
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:21,729
You are every bit the warriors
I was informed you were.

772
01:15:21,898 --> 01:15:23,388
You have passed.

773
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:26,501
Savor your victory tonight.

774
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:30,571
For soon, we will have
further business together.

775
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:35,439
The kind that involves familiar faces
from your past.

776
01:15:36,613 --> 01:15:38,706
She doesn't mean...

777
01:15:43,787 --> 01:15:47,951
Come on. What is it with ninjas
and smoke pellets?

778
01:15:54,197 --> 01:15:56,461
Looks like you picked a good time
to come home.

779
01:15:56,633 --> 01:16:00,433
Thanks for bringing me back.

780
01:16:05,442 --> 01:16:06,932
Winters?

781
01:16:11,815 --> 01:16:14,511
I'm never usually that happy
to be in pain.

782
01:16:14,684 --> 01:16:17,676
He's happy because he's mortal again,
Mikey.

783
01:16:17,854 --> 01:16:21,085
April. I've had my eye on you
for a long time.

784
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:22,724
I knew it.

785
01:16:22,892 --> 01:16:28,694
I've always known that you'd be the one
to help me find my way home.

786
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:31,694
And thank you...

787
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:33,763
...brothers.

788
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:40,274
You've made a very old man
very, very happy.

789
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:44,576
So, what happens now?

790
01:17:28,825 --> 01:17:33,057
Okay. Just a little bit creepy.

791
01:17:33,963 --> 01:17:39,424
Oh, gross. I think he's in my no-
My no- My no-

792
01:17:42,105 --> 01:17:44,801
Gross. Somebody give me a hankie.

793
01:17:46,476 --> 01:17:48,706
Now he's in my mouth.

794
01:17:48,878 --> 01:17:51,278
Tastes awful.

795
01:18:21,444 --> 01:18:23,878
You got room for one more?

796
01:18:41,231 --> 01:18:44,166
Can I get rid of this too?

797
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:03,450
We live together. We train together.

798
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:07,147
We fight together.
We stand for good, together.

799
01:19:07,323 --> 01:19:09,314
We are ninjas.

800
01:19:09,492 --> 01:19:14,828
We strike hard, defend, protect,
and fade into the night.

801
01:19:14,998 --> 01:19:18,161
And there ain't no bad guy or monster
gonna ever change that.

802
01:19:18,334 --> 01:19:20,097
That's what's important.

803
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:24,104
And that's why
we'll always be brothers.

804
01:19:25,675 --> 01:19:28,439
Oh, I love being a turtle.
