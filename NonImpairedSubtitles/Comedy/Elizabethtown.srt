1
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,800
Welcome back, boys.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>As somebody once said...</i>

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
<i>there's a difference between a failure...</i>

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>and a fiasco.</i>

5
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,100
Watch your head.

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm fine.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,300
<i>A failure is simply the non-presence</i>
<i>of success.</i>

8
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,500
<i>Any fool can accomplish failure.</i>

9
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm fine.

10
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,100
I'm fine.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,700
What the hell's he doing here?

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>But a fiasco...</i>

13
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,100
<i>A fiasco is a disaster</i>
<i>of mythic proportions.</i>

14
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,000
<i>A fiasco is a folktale told to others...</i>

15
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,400
<i>that makes other people</i>
<i>feel more alive...</i>

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>because it didn't happen to them.</i>

17
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,900
I'm fine.

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm fine.

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
I'll take you to Phil so you don't get lost.

20
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,900
<i>Mercury Worldwide Shoes,</i>
<i>which is actually Phil...</i>

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
<i>contains some of America's</i>
<i>finest artists' masterworks...</i>

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,100
<i>seen only by people</i>
<i>heading for very important meetings...</i>

23
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,700
<i>a promotion...</i>

24
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,600
<i>or otherwise.</i>

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,100
<i>"We are not just employees,"</i>
<i>as Phil once said.</i>

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,100
<i>"We are denizens of greatness."</i>

27
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,700
<i>Phil says, "The world is full of those</i>
<i>who achieve through negativity...</i>

28
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,100
<i>"or theft.</i>

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
<i>"We succeed through original thought."</i>

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,400
<i>A shoe is not just a shoe.</i>

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,700
<i>It connects us to the Earth.</i>

32
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,500
<i>The right shoe can transport us...</i>

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,600
<i>make us believe</i>
<i>we are capable of more.</i>

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,400
<i>But there are sacrifices</i>
<i>for a goal like pure greatness.</i>

35
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,100
<i>Like birthdays</i>
<i>or last Christmas with my family.</i>

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,900
...through Christ our Lord. Amen.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Dig in.
And no making fun of my cooking.

38
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
- This must be homemade.
- Oh, Dad.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,500
<i>Though we sometimes celebrate</i>
<i>odd things at Mercury...</i>

40
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>like the day the Italians invented rubber.</i>

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,200
<i>Which they didn't, of course.</i>
<i>But that's beside the point.</i>

42
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,400
Where exactly is Drew, anyway?

43
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,200
We've contained magic in a shoe!

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,500
<i>It was meant to approximate</i>
<i>walking on a cloud.</i>

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Hey, if you ever need anything
around here...

46
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm your girl.

47
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,900
<i>Any true student</i>
<i>of functional shoe design...</i>

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,300
<i>is also a student of Phil himself.</i>

49
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,200
<i>He is a master.</i>

50
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,800
<i>And Phil's innate wisdom</i>
<i>of what people want and need...</i>

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,200
<i>has never failed to date.</i>

52
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm fine.

53
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,500
<i>He's also obsessed</i>
<i>with the number two.</i>

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>These are Phil's prized</i>
<i>two Norman Rockwells.</i>

55
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,700
<i>The pair of paintings that once hung</i>
<i>outside the White House office...</i>

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
<i>of John F. Kennedy.</i>

57
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,300
<i>And yes, the two treasured doors...</i>

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,200
<i>Phil once purchased from a church</i>
<i>on vacation in Tunisia...</i>

59
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
<i>and had sent back home for a total cost</i>
<i>too enormous to mention.</i>

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,600
<i>$762,000.</i>

61
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,000
Each.

62
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,700
Just two more minutes
and I can send you in.

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
<i>Because we have a moment here...</i>

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,200
<i>let me tell you that I have</i>
<i>recently become a secret connoisseur...</i>

65
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,800
<i>of last looks.</i>

66
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,900
<i>You know the way people look at you</i>
<i>when they believe it's for the last time?</i>

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,200
<i>I've started collecting these looks and...</i>

68
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, he's ready for you.

69
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,700
<i>There's one right now.</i>

70
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
How are you, Drew?

71
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,800
I wanted to jump out of the window
of that helicopter...

72
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
and just splatter on the trees,
to tell you the truth.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,500
Don't do that.

74
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
It's only money.

75
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,000
The American psyche is in turmoil,
Drew, and we have miscalculated.

76
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I have no rulebook for this situation.

78
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,300
They tell me
that we are about to lose 972...

79
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,700
million dollars.

80
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,800
I am...

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,500
ill-equipped
in the philosophies of failure.

82
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Walk with me, Drew.

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,500
My basketball team.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,700
They don't even know yet.

85
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,400
My Global Environmental Watchdog
project will have to go.

86
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,400
Sweet people.

87
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,300
We could have saved the planet...

88
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,300
but...

89
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,700
How do I make the concept
of $972,000,000...

90
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
more real to you?

91
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,700
It's the operating budget
of a midsize country...

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,500
a small civilization.

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,700
It's big!

94
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
It's so big...

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,400
you could round it off to a billion dollars.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,700
I cry a lot lately.

97
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,600
The promise of a global future...

98
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
pinned to a groundbreaking shoe,
your design...

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,100
with a new form of material,
launched this week to great fanfare.

100
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,100
And now, meeting a growing
international roar of laughter...

101
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,200
and rejection.

102
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,000
Enough to cause this memo...

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,300
from Jeffrey Barlow, CEO of DCS.

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,300
"This once highly-anticipated product...

105
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,300
"may actually cause an entire
generation to return to bare feet."

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,400
We are about to enter...

107
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,700
a free-fall plunge.

108
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,700
And the sound you hear
is the sound of shit hitting the fan.

109
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,400
Globally.

110
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,100
You hear it?

111
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,800
I wish there was something I could do.

112
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,500
Actually, there is.

113
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,400
In a room downstairs is a reporter
from <i>Global Business Today.</i>

114
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,100
We need to make him understand...

115
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,500
we hired you
from our National Scholarship Program.

116
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,900
We supported,
invested in your brilliance.

117
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,700
This was a very creative endeavor...

118
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,800
and I think you should stand up...

119
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
for your incredible work.

120
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,500
You okay?

121
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm...

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,200
It's a little bit like knowing the plane's
going down before anyone else, isn't it?

123
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,800
- When does this run, a week?
- A week.

124
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,200
Come Sunday evening,
it'll be on the stands.

125
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,900
Any last words?

126
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,900
<i>And in that moment, I knew.</i>

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,400
I know we hired you
at the last minute but...

128
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
<i>Success...</i>

129
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,500
<i>Success, not greatness...</i>

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,200
<i>was the only god</i>
<i>the entire world served.</i>

131
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,600
Home sweet home.

132
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,900
<i>Eight years. Night and day.</i>

133
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,500
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

134
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,200
<i>An entire life wrapped up in a shoe.</i>

135
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,300
Yello?

136
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,500
Drew? It's your sister.

137
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,100
<i>I have some really bad news.</i>

138
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,700
Could you call me tomorrow?

139
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
No.

140
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
- Could you call me a little later?
<i>- No, honey.</i>

141
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Dad died!

142
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,500
<i>He had a heart attack back in Kentucky.</i>

143
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,800
<i>He was still visiting Uncle Dale.</i>

144
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,300
Mom is in total shock.

145
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You have to handle this.

146
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,700
<i>You're the oldest.</i>

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,100
You're the responsible one.

148
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,100
I don't know why he went to Kentucky.
I don't know what the attraction was.

149
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
He was born there.

150
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,700
They never liked me there.
They never have.

151
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,100
Drew will take care of everything.

152
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,300
Honey, you understand I can't go
because of the baby.

153
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,500
- I'll be back in two days.
- I'll man the phones.

154
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,300
I'll always be the one
that snatched him away from them.

155
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
The two sides of this family
have never integrated well...

156
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,100
so don't expect to make a lot of friends
when you go there.

157
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,300
- Drew doesn't make friends, Mom.
- I have friends.

158
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,800
- Do you have the blue suit?
- I have the blue suit.

159
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,500
He loved that silly blue suit.

160
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,900
God only knows
if I made him truly happy.

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,100
I'll call from Kentucky.
I'll be there in the morning.

162
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,700
- We have a plan!
- We have a plan...

163
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,900
and you hold your head up high...

164
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,100
because don't you forget, you go back
there as the most successful man...

165
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,300
in the history of this family.
Don't let them try anything.

166
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,900
Oh, my God. I have to call people.

167
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
I have to clean out the office,
I'm a widow!

168
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,000
We'll figure this out, we'll figure this out.
Just get Dad home. Hurry.

169
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,400
I was still waiting for everything to start,
and now it's over.

170
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,100
I'll bring him home.

171
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,800
Wait, wait! Stay close.
Come, come, come.

172
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,300
Now, what was it that Dad always said?

173
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,000
- If it wasn't this...
- It would be something else.

174
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200
Now, you go.
You go and you make him proud.

175
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,900
And you call and tell me
what's going on, okay? All right.

176
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,500
<i>I would go to Kentucky...</i>

177
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,800
<i>put my father in the blue suit,</i>
<i>bring him home...</i>

178
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,600
<i>and then get back on that bike.</i>

179
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,200
<i>Nothing would stop the plan.</i>

180
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Sir.

181
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Sir.

182
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,200
By flying this flight,
you've helped save all our jobs.

183
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Definitely mine.
Maybe even the entire airline.

184
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We would like to reward you
with a free seat in first class.

185
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm fine.

186
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Okay, let me try it like this.

187
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm really tired.
Please don't make me keep walking...

188
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,200
all the way back down here
all night long.

189
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,100
Louisville, Kentucky, huh?
Home, business, or family?

190
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
My dad.

191
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,200
Where does he live in Louisville?

192
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,300
Actually, he's near Louisville.

193
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,000
Louisville.

194
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,100
He's in Elizabethtown.

195
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,900
Oh, good.
I hope someone's driving you...

196
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,500
'cause the roads around there
are hopelessly and gloriously confusing.

197
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,600
I'll keep that in mind.

198
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,800
I'll draw you a quick map.

199
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,700
I mean, I'm so happy we're sitting here
having this conversation...

200
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
at 3:00 a.m., or whatever time it is.

201
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,300
You know, it's such a great time.
Everyone's sleeping but us.

202
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,200
It's really nice to have a conversation
with you and that you're really listening.

203
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
<i>I feel like I can really talk to you...</i>

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So, you want to get to 264,
and then you want to not miss 60B.

205
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm going to be obnoxious about that.

206
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,300
Bens are strangely delightful
and very intuitive.

207
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,300
Complex. Almost too complex
to be around.

208
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,700
- Do you know any Bens?
- I know one Ben.

209
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm a student of names.

210
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
For example, what's your dad's name?

211
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Mitchell.

212
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,300
- Mitchell.
- Yeah.

213
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,900
Or Mitch?

214
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,300
Mitchell. Sometimes Mitch.

215
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,900
Son of a Mitch.

216
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
And today I was fired by a Phil.

217
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,100
Phil? Phils are dangerous.

218
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,900
Phils are less predictable than Bens.

219
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,500
And your girlfriend is a...

220
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,200
Ellen.

221
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,700
- How's that going?
- Sort of a wait-and-see.

222
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,000
- Oh, yeah?
- But then I waited and I saw.

223
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,700
I was gonna say.

224
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,000
I have never had a good experience
with an Ellen or a Phil.

225
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,700
- How about with a Mitch?
- Never met a Mitch I didn't like.

226
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,500
Fun. Full of life, you know?
You know what I mean when I say fun?

227
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,800
Like you want to be a part
of Mitch's club.

228
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Am I close?

229
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,600
Close.

230
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,400
He's okay, right?

231
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,300
Yeah. He's...

232
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,800
He's fine.

233
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,100
You give him a big old hug for me.

234
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm Claire, by the way.

235
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Drew.

236
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,800
- Nice.
- Same to you.

237
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,400
Please.

238
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,900
I'll let you sleep. Here's your map.

239
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,100
Let me take this.

240
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,500
I can handle this.

241
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Let go.

242
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,400
<i>I am not asleep.</i>

243
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,200
<i>I'm not.</i>

244
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,100
<i>I won't really be able to sleep.</i>

245
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,600
<i>I won't really be able to sleep.</i>

246
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,200
Okay. Ready to go, Drew?

247
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,800
<i>I'm not asleep.</i>

248
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
<i>Blue suit.</i>

249
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,100
<i>Losing the business.</i>

250
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,300
<i>Louisville.</i>

251
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,500
<i>I'm not asleep.</i>

252
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,900
<i>We'll go next year.</i>

253
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
<i>Come back.</i>

254
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,700
<i>One billion dollars.</i>

255
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,700
Good morning.

256
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
And congratulations, Drew.

257
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,800
You've earned your wings
as our ten millionth passenger.

258
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And here is a coupon
for any four-diamond hotel...

259
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,000
in the greater western Kentucky area.

260
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Better move quickly.
Lots of people behind you.

261
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,300
- Well, thank you.
- Absolutely.

262
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
And good luck with Ben.

263
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,900
Look, I know
I may never see you again...

264
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
but we are intrepid.

265
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,400
We carry on.

266
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,300
Drew!

267
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,200
Rental cars around the corner.
You'll see the signs.

268
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,500
Bluegrass Parkway turns into exit 60B.
Don't forget, 60B.

269
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,800
Okay. Thanks.

270
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,300
You okay to drive?

271
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,500
I'm fine.

272
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,800
60B!

273
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
60B!

274
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,600
Uncle Dale.

275
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm in Louisville. Just landed.

276
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,800
I'm on the road.

277
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,200
60B. Yeah.

278
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,700
I have a map.

279
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,500
And I'll be there by 2:00.

280
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,300
I have the blue suit.

281
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,300
Where's 60B?

282
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,500
Shit, man.

283
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Oh, man!

284
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,800
Did I miss 60B?

285
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Did I miss 60B?

286
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,800
Did I miss 60B?

287
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Did I miss 60B?

288
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Elizabethtown.

289
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Elizabethtown! Yes!

290
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,500
Elizabethtown! We're in!
Oh, yeah. Okay!

291
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
Oh, yeah.

292
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Jessie?

293
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,000
Cuz.

294
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,300
Cuz.

295
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,600
This loss will be met
by a hurricane of love.

296
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,800
Charles Dean,
meet grown-up Drew Baylor.

297
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,000
Drew, it's good to see you.

298
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,900
Thank you. My condolences.

299
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,500
And here's my dad, your Uncle Dale.

300
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,700
Wonderful to see you again.

301
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,000
Well, Drew, this is Mitch's plot.

302
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,500
And it has been in your family
for 272 years.

303
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,200
Now, I've endeavored...

304
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,400
to keep this area here
clear for your daddy.

305
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,200
We're still discussing that issue.
There is a possibility of cremation.

306
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,800
Now, here are some of your daddy's
personal things.

307
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,600
The brown wallet.

308
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And here's his ring from West Point.

309
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Now I don't know how y'all feel
out there in California...

310
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,900
but West Point sure does matter
around here.

311
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,900
It matters a lot.

312
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,100
Even though we now live in Oregon.

313
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,100
Everybody.

314
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,700
This is Mitch's boy from California.

315
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
One of the California Baylors.

316
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,100
This is Drew.

317
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,600
And just like your daddy was,
we are all very excited...

318
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,100
about your eight-year triumph
with that beautiful shoe.

319
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,700
My condolences to all.

320
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,400
No, sir. I'm not going to let you feel bad
'cause that was from your heart...

321
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,600
but let them say condolences to you.

322
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,500
- I thought condolences was...
- It's incoming. It's an incoming phrase.

323
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,100
Did I not capture your daddy?

324
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,900
I don't know what the word is.

325
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
It's just a look I never saw before.

326
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,000
What's the word?

327
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,800
Drew, if you just move around a bit...

328
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,000
you will see different aspects.

329
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,000
Go ahead and cry.

330
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,100
<i>What's the word?</i>

331
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,700
Whimsical.

332
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
The word is whimsical.

333
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,900
Hey...

334
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,900
why not?

335
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,500
Whimsical.

336
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,700
- Turkey hash brown casserole.
- It's Russ!

337
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,900
Aunt Dora, Aunt Dora.

338
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,500
Aunt Dora, look what I found.

339
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,200
Oh, my God!

340
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,100
Look at Mitch's baby!

341
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,100
You look just like your daddy.
And who's been feeding you?

342
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Wait just a minute. I gotta talk to Drew.

343
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,800
- We hope you're gonna stay for a while.
- You're a credit to Etown.

344
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,400
Sorry about your dad.

345
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,900
This is your blood.

346
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,500
And that's Samson, my son.
Clearly up to no good.

347
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Samson.

348
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,900
Uncle Mitch always wanted us to meet.
Everybody says we look alike.

349
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,400
Weird, huh? It's like looking in a mirror.

350
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,300
Hi, Drew. I'm Connie.
I was your daddy's first girlfriend and...

351
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Hi, Drew, I'm Charlie.

352
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,300
- I'm a huge fan of shoes...
- My son. My son.

353
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,100
...and the work you've done
in the shoe business.

354
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,400
- We'll talk.
- Absolutely.

355
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,800
We got memorial plans to discuss.

356
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,200
Your daddy was one of my
10 most favorite people.

357
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Sure did miss him
when he went out West.

358
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,200
Drew, I'm E. Russell Marlowe...

359
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,700
with the American Legion
in Bardstown, Kentucky.

360
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,000
Drew, I want to sign you up
with the American Legion...

361
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,400
or the Sons of the Legion.

362
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,800
And I got a hat that I want to give you
as a souvenir, in honor of your dad...

363
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,200
Bill Banyon's not coming, is he?

364
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,600
Bill Banyon is not coming.

365
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,900
Bad dog! Stop that!

366
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,400
Bad dog!

367
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,500
- Samson?
- What a mess!

368
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,700
So, come on in.

369
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
You know, it's not every day I invite
good-looking men to my bedroom...

370
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,000
but I just wanted you
to meet your family...

371
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,800
the Baylors and the Conleys.

372
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,100
Let's start with Dickey Conley.

373
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,600
Now, he was an alcoholic.
He had a drinking problem.

374
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,400
And he also had three nipples.
He had three nipples.

375
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
And he was a poet.

376
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,600
How's your mother, Drew, honey?
You know...

377
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,700
I really should have a picture of her
in here.

378
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,900
And this picture is...

379
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,400
- Aunt Dora!
- Coming!

380
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,200
Lena, just watch over it.
Two more minutes! I'm coming!

381
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,400
This was the last picture taken
of your daddy.

382
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,600
This was just three days ago, Drew.

383
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,900
He was the most loving man.

384
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
- Dora!
- Coming!

385
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,600
Honey, you stay as long as you need to.

386
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
Samson.

387
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,200
My God!

388
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,400
- Oh, man.
- Was he driving that?

389
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,900
Samson, you all right, boy?

390
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,700
- You all right?
- You all right?

391
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,500
Oh, my God!

392
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,400
Where the hell's his father?
That's what I want to know.

393
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,000
What happened?

394
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,900
- Hey, who taught you how to drive?
- What the hell do you mean?

395
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,100
- What do you mean?
- You gotta keep your eye on him!

396
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
So!

397
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,600
Y'all obviously made a group decision
not to call and invite me.

398
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,100
Hi! Bill Banyon. How are you?
Good to see you.

399
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,800
Bill Banyon. How are you?
Good to see you.

400
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
I hear Drew Baylor's here, is that right?
Hi, Connie, how are you?

401
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm fine.

402
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,400
- Is this Samson?
- It is. This is Samson.

403
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,300
Come here, Samson! How you doing?
Give me a big boy hug!

404
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm so sorry.

405
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,200
I should just go over to the kitchen.
Good to see you. Cute kid.

406
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,300
Drew, can I have your autograph,
please?

407
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Of course.

408
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Where can I find an original model
of Adidas SL 72s?

409
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,000
That boy is looking for rules from you!

410
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,500
Blame me, everybody does.

411
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,300
You can't be a kid and raise a kid.

412
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,600
Dad, I'm taking this moment to tell you
that I'm untraditional.

413
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,500
When we celebrate the life of Mitch,
we're gonna do it with no tears...

414
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,200
we're gonna do it with excitement,
and I'll take care of everything.

415
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,000
- All right.
- Hear, hear.

416
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,400
We know what's up, and it's shoes.
We're so much alike!

417
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,700
I teach him things
that everybody should know.

418
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,000
I teach him about Abraham Lincoln
and Ronnie Van Zant...

419
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,100
because in my house,
they are both of equal importance.

420
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
You don't get what I'm saying.

421
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,300
You can't be buddies with your own son.

422
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,800
Beautiful night. Does it ever cool off?

423
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,500
No, this time of year,
it's hotter than the hinges of hell.

424
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,700
We got stars, though.

425
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,700
Gotta say I'm surprised your mom
didn't make it.

426
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Yeah, she's pretty broken up.

427
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,200
She sends her love
to everybody, though.

428
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,300
Yeah. I don't blame her.

429
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,500
Around here, their favorite thing to do
is to get offended by something small...

430
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
and hold on to it for 50 years.

431
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,100
Of course, you and your dad were close.

432
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,300
Very close.
And I knew him very, very well.

433
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,500
He was my dad.

434
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,400
We were actually going to drive here
together this year.

435
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,300
Then it became next year and no.

436
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,900
I knew him very well. Very, very well.

437
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,900
Very well.

438
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Yeah, I don't know my dad very well,
either.

439
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,900
That was my band.

440
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,200
This was the show we opened
for Lynyrd fucking Skynyrd.

441
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,100
- Two of the original members.
- Cool.

442
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Ruckus.

443
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,500
Keep going.

444
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,100
Keep going.

445
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,800
Right below the reggae tribute.
Look at that.

446
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Ruckus.

447
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,300
Well, we almost opened for them.

448
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,400
It's a really long story. We never played,
and we never played since.

449
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,200
And now you fix computers.

450
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,800
<i>All those postcards I sent</i>
<i>to Birmingham</i>

451
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,900
<i>All the way from those windows</i>
<i>of Amsterdam</i>

452
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,600
<i>Copped a gram from Dapper Sam</i>

453
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,500
<i>Just a four letter man in another jam</i>

454
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,800
<i>Oh yeah</i>

455
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,200
Welcome to the Louisville Brown Hotel.
How long will you be staying with us?

456
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,500
Two nights.

457
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,400
That coupon I have not seen.

458
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,300
You with the Hasboro Wedding?
Chuck and Cindy?

459
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,900
I'm leaving Friday.

460
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,800
Okay.

461
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,100
Put it on my company card. Let it rip.

462
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,600
We're not married yet.

463
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,400
Hey, Rebecca.

464
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Don't change the schedule
or Cindy will freak out!

465
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
She's been planning this for a year.

466
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,400
Don't forget,
there's a rehearsal dinner in...

467
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,700
Chuck and Cindy.

468
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,800
"Lovin' life."

469
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Heather? Pick up, sis. I'm exhausted.

470
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm at the Brown Hotel in Louisville.
Call me on the cell.

471
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,500
Hey, Mom, are you there?

472
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,300
Ellen. Hey, it's Drew. Are you there?

473
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,700
Call me back.

474
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,000
Somebody call me back.

475
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,200
<i>That's what happens to a man when he</i>
<i>lets a woman take over, George!</i>

476
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,200
<i>You listen hard, laughing boy.</i>

477
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,000
<i>Did you bring the stuff?</i>

478
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,500
<i>No, Blinky, no!</i>

479
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,800
<i>Here's a knife that you'll really like.</i>
<i>This is my chef's knife.</i>

480
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,600
<i>These knives are really razor sharp!</i>

481
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,600
Claire Colburn. It's Drew Baylor.

482
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,100
You don't have to call me back. It's...

483
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,700
It's all good.

484
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,600
What am I saying?
I don't even say, "It's all good."

485
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,600
Good night.

486
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,700
Yello.

487
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,700
You have to come home.

488
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,000
Mom has decided
that she wants to learn to cook.

489
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
Oh, no.

490
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,300
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

491
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,700
Have you cried yet?

492
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,500
A little.

493
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,900
When it happens, it's gonna be for days.

494
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,500
You should come home.
She's out of control.

495
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,000
Wait a second. I'll be right back.

496
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,900
- Please come home.
- Hello?

497
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,200
Great to hear from you.
I didn't expect for you to call.

498
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,700
Then again, I did leave
a few thousand numbers.

499
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,500
It's Claire Colburn. American Airlines.

500
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,200
- Claire. Can I call you right back?
- I'll hold.

501
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Okay.

502
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,000
- Hello.
- Please come home.

503
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,200
I want to learn to cook,
I want to learn to laugh...

504
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,600
and I want to tap dance.

505
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,600
<i>It will be my salvation.</i>

506
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,300
She won't stop moving, Drew!

507
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Heather, we need a decision here.

508
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,400
What's your opinion
on the whole burial issue?

509
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,700
Because there's a lot of people here
with big opinions!

510
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,200
And there's a problem with the blue suit
that I can't put my finger on...

511
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,100
Wait, wait, wait.

512
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
How you doing, Mom?

513
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Great. I'm great. We are gonna make it!

514
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,800
- Hello.
- Drew, it's Ellen. You called me?

515
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Ellen.

516
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,200
<i>Ellen? Ellen,</i>
<i>thank you for calling me back!</i>

517
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,200
I'm so happy you called.

518
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,400
<i>Could you just hold on one second?</i>

519
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,900
- Hello?
- You need to come home, Drew.

520
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,900
I'll be right back. Hello?

521
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,100
<i>Drew.</i>

522
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,900
Ellen, I called you about that
silly goodbye.

523
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,200
Could you hold on for just one second?

524
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, but I'm actually
on my way out to dinner.

525
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,200
Just hold a second.

526
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,700
- Can we...
- I'm just in the middle of...

527
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,700
- See, I've gotta...
- Ellen.

528
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,100
- Just call me later, okay?
- Don't go.

529
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Okay.

530
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
Hello.

531
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,000
- Hello, stranger.
- Claire, hold on.

532
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,200
Here's what's great
about the Nashville airport.

533
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,700
I just wanted to call you and thank you.

534
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,100
So, you know, goodbye, thank you and...

535
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,500
- I'll hold.
- Okay.

536
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,500
<i>Hello?</i>

537
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,700
Cremated, don't you agree?

538
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,900
Heather, they really love him here.

539
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,900
They're not buying cremation.
They don't even acknowledge the word.

540
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,400
But I need to call you right back.

541
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Is there anything more important
than the conversation we're having?

542
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,900
I will call you right back.

543
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,400
No problem.
Just dial "hell" and I'll answer.

544
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,500
I'll call you right back.

545
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,800
I miss Dad.

546
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,600
Was he a fun guy?

547
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,400
Of course he was a fun guy.

548
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,400
Especially in the last few years
when you got so busy.

549
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,900
I'll call you right back.

550
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,200
<i>- I know you're late for dinner.</i>
- I am late.

551
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,300
- I'm in Kentucky.
- Drew.

552
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,900
It was real and it was great,
and it was really great.

553
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,200
<i>Call me anytime, okay? Goodbye.</i>

554
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,000
<i>It's just goodbye, you know?</i>
<i>It's not "goodbye." It's just goodbye.</i>

555
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,600
<i>Take care.</i>

556
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Goodbye.

557
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,700
Goodbye.

558
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,600
Hello?

559
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,600
Good Lord. Did I win the phone lottery?

560
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,600
<i>Tell me about the Nashville airport.</i>

561
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm over it.
I'm actually almost home now.

562
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,400
Were the roads as hellish as I told you?

563
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,900
Claire, my dad's dead.

564
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,200
I know.

565
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,200
You knew?

566
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,800
I don't know a lot about everything...

567
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,500
but I do know a lot about
the part of everything that I know...

568
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,200
which is people.

569
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,200
And I thought I was so mysterious.

570
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,900
Trust me, everybody is less mysterious
than they think they are.

571
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,000
And they all know me,
and I don't know any of them...

572
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,000
and I had never seen
a dead body before.

573
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,600
To have never taken a solitary road trip
across country?

574
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,100
I mean, everybody's gotta take
a road trip at least once in their lives.

575
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,100
Just you and some music.

576
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,800
You have no idea of the sheer volume
of my cousin's kid when he cries.

577
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,500
I mean, I think there is definitely
a higher spirit.

578
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,600
But I agree, what's left behind finally...

579
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,500
are the impressions
you made on people.

580
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,500
More important is to know where to go.

581
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,400
You haven't traveled at all, have you?

582
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,000
I just recently decided
that things really are black and white.

583
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,600
And so, we all became helpers.

584
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,700
Which I still can't help.
I can't help helping.

585
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,600
Okay, I'll drive back home.
At least part of the way.

586
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,600
I will take a road trip.

587
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,800
<i>I was actually gonna go</i>
<i>with Mitch next year.</i>

588
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,600
Why am I calling him Mitch?

589
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,200
I spend so much time thinking
about all the answers to the problem...

590
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,600
that I forget
what the problem actually was.

591
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,500
If you're smart, you'll just wear your
shoes and never ask any questions.

592
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,700
Just enjoy your footwear.

593
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,900
Do you ever just think,
"I'm fooling everybody"?

594
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,400
You have no idea.

595
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,800
Men see things in a box.

596
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,100
And women see them in a round room.

597
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,200
Look at this. He was so young here.

598
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,500
My mom.

599
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,800
Not the one they wanted him to marry.

600
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,400
They met in an elevator.

601
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,600
I think I've been asleep most of my life.

602
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,600
Me, too.

603
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,500
Good Lord!

604
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,300
Do you want to have a beer
over the phone?

605
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,400
Chuck and Cindy.

606
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,300
<i>Cindy and Chuck.</i>

607
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,500
I am currently stealing...

608
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,000
Chuck and Cindy's wedding beer.

609
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,700
You're a friend of Chuck's, right?

610
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,800
- Yes.
- No, you're not. I'm Chuck.

611
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,700
Of Chuck and Cindy?

612
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,900
- Is that Chuck?
- It's Chuck.

613
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Who are you?

614
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,000
Drew Baylor. Your neighbor.

615
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
- You're here for my wedding?
- No.

616
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Business?

617
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,100
My dad died. I'm here for his funeral.

618
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,000
I'm sorry. I can't...

619
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,000
- That's hard.
- It is hard, yeah.

620
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,400
- No, no, please.
- Shit!

621
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,200
Please, no. No, no, Chuck. No, Chuck.

622
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,100
Chuck, please.

623
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,500
Death and life and death and life.

624
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Right next door to each other!

625
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,100
There's a hair between them.

626
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,700
We're here for the next three days.
If there's anything I can do for you...

627
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,500
Chuck Hasboro.

628
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,300
Hi, Claire.

629
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,100
Look, if there's anything I can do
for you guys, okay? Anything.

630
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,600
Thank you, Chuck.

631
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,000
I love you, Claire.

632
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,200
Okay.

633
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,500
It's all about family, bro.

634
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,000
Thank you, Chuck.

635
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,500
<i>But they say it will hit you.</i>

636
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,500
It could be 10 minutes
or it could be 10 years from now.

637
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,000
So it's good that you talk about it,
or don't talk about it.

638
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,500
Well, we have talked about it,
but that's what they say.

639
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,200
That's what they say, huh?

640
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,400
Yes, that's what they say.

641
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,300
I've always wondered this.
Who are "they"?

642
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,900
You know, "them."

643
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,300
"Them."

644
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,600
The inimitable collective "them."

645
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,500
And who says we're supposed to listen
to them?

646
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,000
They do!

647
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,700
<i>Doesn't your ear hurt?</i>

648
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,000
Yes, it does.

649
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,500
<i>And I have to get up in two hours</i>
<i>and be charming.</i>

650
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,600
I'm going to Hawaii.

651
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,600
- You'll get there and have fun.
- I'll get there and sleep.

652
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,000
It's just a little vacation
I traded routes for...

653
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,400
I'll let you go.

654
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,000
<i>Wait.</i>

655
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,500
When will you be back?

656
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,900
<i>Hello.</i>

657
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,700
<i>You still there?</i>

658
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,500
Yeah.

659
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,300
I'm just wondering if this whole thing
is better on the phone.

660
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,900
You're so much better on the phone.

661
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,400
Maybe we should never
face each other again.

662
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,700
I enjoyed this.

663
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,700
<i>Hey, you're only 45 minutes away.</i>

664
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,600
You want to meet halfway
and see the sunrise?

665
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,300
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>it's probably easier to stay up.</i>

666
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,100
You think so?

667
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,500
I think that's what they say.

668
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,800
<i>Hey, you still with me?</i>

669
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,500
Yeah, I'm still here.

670
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,000
- Take exit 43.
<i>- Okay.</i>

671
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,200
I see your headlights.

672
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,800
I see your red hat.

673
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,600
There you are.

674
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,600
Hello.

675
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,500
Hey.

676
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,200
Should we hang up now?

677
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,200
Follow me.

678
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,800
We peaked on the phone.

679
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,100
- Yeah, I'm a little tired.
- Yeah, me too.

680
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,500
<i>Last looks.</i>

681
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,900
Have fun in Hawaii.

682
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,900
<i>There's one right now.</i>

683
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,300
<i>Aloha.</i>

684
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,900
<i>Aloha.</i>

685
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,500
You will not defeat me.

686
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,300
What are you doing?

687
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,600
Mom, are you sure?

688
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,500
Are you sure about the...
Are you sure about the cremation?

689
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Honey, I don't know when
I'm going to crash...

690
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,700
but as of right now,
we are learning about the car...

691
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,700
and I'm learning organic cooking,
I'm gonna tap dance...

692
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,600
and later on today,
I am going to fix the toilet.

693
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,700
It is five minutes at a time.

694
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,100
Do you all know about
out in California...

695
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,900
how many people they cremate
out there?

696
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
- No. How many?
- 80%, I read.

697
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,700
- Get out!
- I'm not kidding you.

698
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,400
Mom, I think you need to slow down.

699
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,100
Look, everybody tells me
that I should take sedatives...

700
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,300
but, hey, I am out here
and I'm making things happen.

701
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,800
All forward motion counts.

702
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,700
<i>Sweetheart,</i>
<i>when are you coming back?</i>

703
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,500
There's a memorial this Saturday.

704
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,700
Okay. And who's there helping you
plan all of this, sweetheart?

705
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,200
Uncle Dale and Bill Banyon.

706
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,700
Bill Banyon is there?

707
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,800
- Bill Banyon?
- Yeah.

708
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,100
He is a con man.

709
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,300
He swindled your father
out of thousands of dollars.

710
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,100
<i>Seventeen years ago,</i>
<i>he did something...</i>

711
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,000
which almost ruined this family
to its very core.

712
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,100
Mother...

713
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,500
Wrapping himself in the nobility
of your father's memory.

714
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,000
- Boy, he's getting an earful.
- Boy, I'll tell you.

715
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,600
Mother! Listen! Focus!

716
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,900
Beware.

717
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,900
I know it's all very charming
with the pickled things in jars...

718
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,600
and the Southern charm
and the hams that hang in the garage...

719
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,600
until they're so covered with mold
you could grow penicillin on them...

720
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,400
Are you sure about the cremation?

721
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,900
If Bill Banyon is there,
definitely cremation!

722
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,100
<i>And you tell Bill Banyon, I'll be there.</i>

723
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,100
Hello.

724
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,300
Aloha.

725
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,800
I talked to my friend, Kendra...

726
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,800
who had a girlfriend with a kid
who is exceedingly loud like Samson...

727
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,400
and she's given me a videotape
that works absolute miracles.

728
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,600
Hey, thanks, Claire.

729
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,700
What, you're already tired of me?

730
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,300
I just haven't slept. I'm sorry.

731
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,900
How's Hawaii?

732
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,200
Well, I'm checking out this cute guy.

733
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,800
Why are you telling me that?

734
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,900
How could I leave you in distress?

735
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,100
I'm taking you out.

736
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,600
- I thought you were in Hawaii.
- What's this?

737
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,200
"When cremation is your preference."

738
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,100
I just got some brochures
I want you all to look at.

739
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,600
And these are some choice of urns...

740
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,700
available here
at the Cave Hill Cemetery.

741
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
You can take them home and...

742
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,000
You can look at those brochures and...

743
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,300
Y'all can look at those,
take those home with you.

744
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,200
Whatever makes you happy.

745
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,800
<i>We are shopping for an urn.</i>

746
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,600
And you can pick this up tomorrow
immediately following the procedure.

747
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,800
<i>The Jim Morrison of Kentucky.</i>

748
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
You're kind of great, Claire.
You do know that.

749
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,600
- Sort of amazing, even.
- Oh, come on!

750
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,700
- I don't need an ice cream cone.
- It's not an ice cream cone.

751
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,500
What's an ice cream cone?

752
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,200
You know.

753
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,700
"Here's a little something
to make you happy.

754
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,700
"Something sweet that melts
in five minutes."

755
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,300
I'm completely cool with anything
you want to say or not say.

756
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,300
I don't need it.

757
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,500
Besides, Ben is coming in tomorrow.

758
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,400
- Do you want to hear my theory?
- Of course.

759
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,400
You and I have a special talent,
and I saw it immediately.

760
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,500
Tell me.

761
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,200
We're the substitute people.

762
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,300
The substitute people.

763
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,100
I've been the substitute person
my whole life.

764
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,000
I'm not an Ellen.
I never wanted to be an Ellen.

765
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,200
And I'm not a Cindy, either.
Although Chucks love me.

766
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,900
I'm sure they do.

767
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,700
I like being alone too much.

768
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,500
I mean, I'm with a guy who's married
to his academic career.

769
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,700
I rarely see him.
And I'm the substitute person there.

770
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,200
I like it that way. It's a lot less pressure.

771
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,000
Here.

772
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,300
Play this for the loudest kid in the world.

773
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,300
I'm not used to girls like you.

774
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,800
That's because I'm one of a kind.

775
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,600
You don't have to make a joke.

776
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,600
I like you without the jokes.

777
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,100
Get some sleep.

778
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,700
I have a personnel interview
tomorrow morning...

779
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,700
and if I get transferred, Ben will die.

780
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,500
Didn't it just feel better...

781
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,900
that we just didn't
do something impulsive?

782
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,600
- I mean...
- Yes.

783
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,000
Now we actually have a shot
at being friends...

784
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,600
for the rest of our lives.

785
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,200
The rest of our lives.

786
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,100
Okay, now for the celebration proper
we got the military bands...

787
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,100
the right mix of seven speakers,
no crybabies...

788
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,900
It's official. Paul, Doug and Rick
are flying in from Florida.

789
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,900
Ruckus will reunite for this one evening.

790
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,500
How we doing on balloons?

791
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,500
I sent to Balloon City,
I got a bunch of them.

792
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,100
And, Drew, my casket did come in
from Lexington...

793
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,800
and I got to tell you, it's quite beautiful.

794
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,200
Look, Drew, I am getting the question
constantly, okay?

795
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,300
Why isn't he buried in Elizabethtown?

796
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,800
It's not an insult to anybody here.

797
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,800
Well, is there such a thing
as partial cremation?

798
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,700
Bill Banyon, how can you even say
such a thing?

799
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,000
I know you all love my dad.

800
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,300
You can't dismiss my mother's wishes.

801
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,500
And we're not from California.

802
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,400
Jessie, can you do something
about your son?

803
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,600
Yeah. All right.

804
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,000
A couple of good ass-kickings
might be in line.

805
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,200
I think what Charles Dean
wants to say...

806
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,500
I know what he's saying.

807
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,900
You all have different versions of him
that you love a lot.

808
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,400
This is ours.

809
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,900
My family's record of the last thing
he said on the subject.

810
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,500
That's the plan.

811
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,900
That is the way it's going to be, guys.

812
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,700
Sprinkled at sea!

813
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,200
Samson...

814
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,400
And that's the decision from California.

815
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,100
Shit. Oregon.

816
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,800
We really are from Oregon.

817
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,900
Don't make me come spank you.
Leave him alone!

818
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,400
Jessie, I have something for you.

819
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,300
Samson, we're gonna watch this.

820
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,700
One second.

821
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,900
<i>Hi. My name's Rusty.</i>

822
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,600
<i>I helped build this house</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

823
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,200
<i>But wood-eating insects</i>
<i>called termites...</i>

824
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,200
<i>have compromised the integrity</i>
<i>of this once fine structure.</i>

825
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,600
What's that sound?

826
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,200
<i>So today, I'm gonna blow it up.</i>

827
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,400
Silence.

828
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,500
<i>Now...</i>

829
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,900
<i>if I blow this house up...</i>

830
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,900
<i>will you promise to behave</i>
<i>and mind your mommy and daddy?</i>

831
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,800
Yes!

832
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,700
<i>Good.</i>

833
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,200
<i>Let's blow it up.</i>

834
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,100
<i>- Joe, we ready to go?</i>
<i>- Yeah, Rusty, light it up.</i>

835
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,900
<i>Fire in the hole!</i>

836
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,700
<i>Three...</i>

837
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,200
<i>two...</i>

838
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,800
<i>one.</i>

839
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,600
<i>Now, let's build a new house.</i>

840
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,800
Thank you
for taking an interest in Jessie.

841
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,700
Feels good, doesn't it?

842
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,800
It's like Mitch is here.

843
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,100
I can see Mitch right now, so proud...

844
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,600
in that blue suit.

845
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,200
Can't you?

846
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,500
Stop the cremation!

847
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,700
Stop the cremation!

848
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,600
- Stop the cremation!
- What the hell's going on, man?

849
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,900
Hold on. Wait right here.

850
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,800
I'm sorry.

851
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,100
Here's your dad, man.

852
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,300
I agree with her.

853
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,900
It takes a year and a half
to plan a wedding properly.

854
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,100
It does...

855
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,100
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

856
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,900
This is Claire.
I feel like I've known her my whole life.

857
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,100
He was at my door last night yelling,
"Cindy, you get out here."

858
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,800
And I was like, "Chuck, not tonight!
Not until we get married..."

859
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,700
Is that...

860
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,700
Hey, Mitch.

861
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,300
So, what happened to Ben?

862
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,100
There was a storm in Georgia.
They grounded all the planes.

863
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,800
And he doesn't like to fly.

864
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,000
And now they want him to speak
at some trustees event...

865
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,900
and trot out some big ideas.

866
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,300
Claire, I want to see you...

867
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,200
on the tour of Maker's Mark tomorrow
at 10:00 a.m. Sharp.

868
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,500
- All right?
- All right.

869
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,800
I love this girl!

870
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,300
You look great.

871
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,900
I'm a mess.

872
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,200
- You're crazy, Claire. You look amazing.
- Thank you.

873
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,400
And this dress...

874
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,500
Did well on the personnel interview,
though.

875
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,800
Right. The interview. I forgot.

876
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,900
I know. I'm impossible to forget,
but I'm hard to remember.

877
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,000
Drew! Lovin' life, lovin' you.

878
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,500
Hey, missed you
at the rehearsal dinner.

879
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,300
- Claire?
- Yeah?

880
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,000
Let's show Mitch the site
of his memorial.

881
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,200
"Chuck and Cindy, the wedding!"

882
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,100
Here you go, Dad.

883
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,400
<i>Welcome to the annual meeting</i>
<i>of people who...</i>

884
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,500
<i>annually meet!</i>

885
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:38,100
<i>- And we'll see you all again next year.</i>
- Very nice. Come on.

886
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,900
I'm just going to say right now
what we're not saying...

887
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,700
and let the chips fall, let the chips fall...

888
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,500
let the chips fall where they may.

889
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,900
Yes, I may be embarrassing myself,
but I'm just going to say it.

890
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,200
<i>I like you!</i>

891
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,400
<i>What?</i>

892
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,400
I think you should eat something.

893
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:14,400
I've been starving myself all week long!

894
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,800
- For Ben.
- Man, I'm gonna eat.

895
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,000
- We'll eat in my room.
- Room service?

896
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,100
I want cheese
and cheese-related things.

897
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,400
No, eggs and fries.
With cheese on everything.

898
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,200
- Cheese it is.
- Cheese and Coca-Cola.

899
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,700
And don't worry.

900
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,600
Because as great as you look tonight,
you are safe with me.

901
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,500
Of course, it's safe. It's a full moon.

902
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,000
- I look good.
- You do look good.

903
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,600
I'm wearing these clothes. I mean...

904
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,400
Have you ever had unlucky clothes?

905
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,200
This dress that you like?

906
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,700
Good things have not happened to me
in this dress.

907
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,100
But I saw it tonight and I said:

908
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,400
"I'm gonna give you one more chance."

909
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,600
And I refuse to be let down
by this dress again.

910
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,900
Anyway, forget all that.

911
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,600
You're here, and we're together,
and it's a get-out-of-jail-free card.

912
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,500
It's almost midnight.

913
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,400
Life cannot be so cruel
that we don't deserve to be together...

914
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,100
to eat.

915
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,200
- Hi, Chuck.
- Hey, Cindy.

916
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,300
Wait. Where's Mitch?

917
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,400
I left him in the ballroom.

918
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,000
I'm sorry Ben missed the flight.

919
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,400
He forgot?

920
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,400
No storm in Georgia. No trustees.

921
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,400
No big ideas.

922
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,000
- What a fucking jerk.
- He's not a jerk.

923
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:14,900
He's a brilliant man who gives himself
permission to be preoccupied.

924
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,600
Come on.

925
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,800
You know, there is nothing greater
than deciding in your life...

926
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,800
that things maybe really are
black and white!

927
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,000
And this guy, Ben,
who clearly takes you for granted...

928
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,900
who serially takes advantage of you,
is bad!

929
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,300
And what I am saying is good.
See what I mean?

930
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,200
You shouldn't be the substitute
for anybody.

931
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,300
This guy should be right here,
right now, doing this.

932
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,500
Maybe so.

933
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,500
He's lucky I'm not
the right person for you.

934
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,600
I know why it's not you, but just tell me...

935
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,800
so I can see it from your perspective.

936
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,200
See, I know what you deserve.

937
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,400
What do I deserve?

938
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,300
You deserve...

939
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,600
You deserve...

940
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,300
You deserve...

941
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,000
a guy who says:

942
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,600
"I can't imagine a world without you.

943
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,600
"We will start a winery when we are 70.

944
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:08,000
"We will snowboard every December,
and one year take our kids.

945
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,500
"And we will always have
the twin red Lexuses...

946
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,900
"with the license plates reading:
'Chuck and Cindy."'

947
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,000
You deserve all this and more.

948
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,800
It's not you, I know.

949
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,200
- Please don't take this as rejection.
- I really don't.

950
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,900
<i>Ben's very lucky. All we did was kiss.</i>

951
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:02,700
<i>Most of the sex I've had in my life</i>
<i>was not as personal as that kiss.</i>

952
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,100
I'm putting on my shoes now.

953
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,200
Excuse me. Sorry.

954
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,300
I'm walking out the door...

955
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,100
in last night's clothes.

956
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,300
"Hey, Claire. Don't leave.

957
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,000
"Stay. Let's have breakfast."

958
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:25,700
I will miss your lips
and everything attached to them.

959
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,100
See you, Mitch.

960
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,600
Claire, you slut!

961
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,500
- Claire! Swear to God!
- Claire!

962
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,200
Wait up!

963
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,000
Just tell me you love me
and get it over with.

964
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,400
Claire, I'm just going to say this
because you deserve it.

965
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:38,600
It's not easy for me, but here goes.

966
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,200
Four days ago...

967
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,100
I lost a major
American shoe company...

968
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:54,000
Frankly, you could round it off
to one billion dollars!

969
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,000
And by tomorrow afternoon,
everyone will know.

970
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,400
Something's gonna be published
that pinpoints me as the most...

971
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,800
spectacular failure in the history
of my profession...

972
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,400
which is all I know how to do.

973
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,800
And I've been here this whole time
trying to be responsible and charming...

974
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,100
and live up to this success...

975
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,600
that doesn't exist.

976
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,100
All I really want...

977
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,300
is to not be here.

978
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,500
I'm sorry.

979
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,100
I have a very dark appointment
with destiny.

980
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,500
That's my secret.

981
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,300
That's who I am.

982
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,400
That's it?

983
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,300
Yes, that's it.

984
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

985
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:55,100
I guess I just thought a small part of you
might be a small bit sad to see me go.

986
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,300
But I guess this is all mostly
about a shoe.

987
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,600
Of course, I'm sad about you.

988
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,000
But this is just a little bit bigger
than you and me!

989
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:07,100
And by the way, I didn't say million.
I said billion!

990
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,800
A billion dollars!

991
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,400
That's a lot of million!

992
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,800
So, you failed.

993
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:24,900
- No, you don't get it.
- All right, you really failed.

994
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,400
You failed, you failed, you failed.

995
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,900
You failed, you failed, you...

996
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,800
You think I care about that?

997
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,400
I do understand.

998
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,700
You're an artist, man.
Your job is to break through barriers.

999
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,000
Not accept blame and bow and say:

1000
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,300
"Thank you, I'm a loser,
I'll go away now."

1001
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,000
"Phil's mean to me..." So what?

1002
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,200
I don't cry.

1003
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,100
You want to be really great?

1004
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:04,000
Then have the courage to fail big
and stick around.

1005
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,500
Make them wonder
why you're still smiling.

1006
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,800
That's true greatness to me.

1007
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,500
But...

1008
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,200
don't listen to me, I'm a Claire.

1009
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,900
- Well, thank you, Claire.
- You're welcome.

1010
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Now would you quit
trying to break up with me?

1011
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,500
You're always trying
to break up with me...

1012
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,800
and we're not even together.

1013
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,000
I know.

1014
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,800
Wait.

1015
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,500
We're not?

1016
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,000
Of course not.

1017
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,100
We're the substitute people, remember?

1018
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,000
I'll see you at Mitch's memorial,
if I can make it.

1019
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,700
All right, when I give you the signal
pull the pulley slowly across.

1020
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,000
All right, slow and soulful.

1021
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,300
Will do. Slow and soulful.

1022
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:52,000
- She came!
- That is her.

1023
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,200
That is her. That's Hollie.

1024
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,500
Hollie!

1025
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,800
- Hollie.
- It's really good to see you.

1026
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:02,000
- You look more beautiful than ever.
- Thank you.

1027
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:35,000
<i>Mitch wrote letters.</i>
<i>Never once sent an e-mail.</i>

1028
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,800
<i>He was always there for me.</i>

1029
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,700
<i>Where are you, Mitch?</i>

1030
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,600
<i>And I loved him.</i>

1031
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,600
<i>And y'all know that.</i>

1032
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,100
<i>I loved him!</i>

1033
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,000
<i>Even though he moved to California...</i>

1034
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,100
<i>God love him,</i>
<i>he always came back to his roots.</i>

1035
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,000
<i>And I will miss his laugh.</i>

1036
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,900
<i>I don't have anything funny to say.</i>

1037
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,500
<i>And I don't have a funny story to tell.</i>

1038
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:11,300
<i>I will tell you, it wasn't easy for Mitch</i>
<i>to leave the military...</i>

1039
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,400
<i>and start over again in California.</i>

1040
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:32,500
<i>And I apologize, per se,</i>
<i>for my role in that deal, per se.</i>

1041
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,500
<i>And to all of you</i>
<i>who put this evening together...</i>

1042
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,300
<i>it has gone beautifully, and thank you.</i>

1043
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:42,400
- Lena, it hasn't hit him yet.
- It will. It will.

1044
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1045
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,600
<i>Hollie Baylor.</i>

1046
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,800
I want you to stay awake for this,
all right?

1047
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,500
<i>I'm a little nervous.</i>

1048
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,100
<i>But here we are.</i>

1049
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,800
<i>It's been a while.</i>

1050
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,400
<i>There was this shorthand</i>
<i>of a long marriage.</i>

1051
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,000
<i>We were complete opposites,</i>
<i>and it worked.</i>

1052
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,400
<i>The plan was to send...</i>

1053
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,400
<i>my son to represent the family.</i>

1054
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,200
<i>I was terrified</i>
<i>that you would look at me and see...</i>

1055
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:50,200
<i>that woman from California</i>
<i>who took him away.</i>

1056
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:54,400
<i>Even though we only lived in California</i>
<i>as a family...</i>

1057
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,700
<i>for 18 months, 27 years ago...</i>

1058
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,800
<i>I always... felt it.</i>

1059
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,100
<i>All because I was standing</i>
<i>in an elevator in Tokyo...</i>

1060
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,700
<i>and this handsome captain walked in...</i>

1061
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,800
<i>on his way home to Elizabethtown.</i>

1062
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:19,400
<i>And he was engaged. And so was I.</i>

1063
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:25,700
<i>And somehow I hijacked him</i>
<i>and took him to Disneyland!</i>

1064
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,200
<i>But something happened between us...</i>

1065
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,800
<i>that was not part of the plan.</i>

1066
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:43,600
<i>We were in love.</i>

1067
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:54,100
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about life</i>
<i>without Mitch.</i>

1068
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,300
<i>I wanted to get to know</i>
<i>about Mitch's car...</i>

1069
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,400
<i>and it actually ate me.</i>

1070
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,200
<i>I went to the bank</i>
<i>and the teller looked at me strangely...</i>

1071
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:07,500
<i>and I got home</i>
<i>and I looked at myself in the mirror...</i>

1072
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,600
<i>and my face was still green</i>
<i>from a facial mask...</i>

1073
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,000
<i>that I had forgotten to take off.</i>

1074
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:15,100
<i>And I called our insurance man</i>
<i>of 30 years...</i>

1075
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:19,200
<i>whose son Mitch had actually helped</i>
<i>to get into West Point...</i>

1076
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:22,500
<i>to tell him that Mitch was gone.</i>

1077
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,000
<i>He didn't call me back for two days.</i>

1078
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:32,400
<i>The car, the bank, the insurance man,</i>
<i>the world.</i>

1079
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,700
<i>I mean, nobody truly cared.</i>

1080
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,100
<i>Not like us.</i>

1081
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,600
<i>I always wanted to learn to tap dance...</i>

1082
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,500
<i>so I took tap dance lessons.</i>

1083
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,400
<i>And I wanted to learn... Yeah, I did.</i>

1084
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,500
<i>And I wanted to learn</i>
<i>to cook organically...</i>

1085
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,300
<i>and so I attempted that.</i>

1086
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,600
<i>And I fixed the toilet.</i>

1087
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,100
<i>Yeah. All by myself.</i>

1088
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,900
<i>And I wanted to learn to laugh.</i>

1089
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,600
<i>Why couldn't I be funnier</i>
<i>when Mitch was alive?</i>

1090
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,400
<i>But you know, I figured it out.</i>
<i>It takes time to be funny...</i>

1091
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:21,000
<i>and it takes time to extract joy from life.</i>

1092
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,800
<i>So I enrolled in comedy school.</i>

1093
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,400
<i>Yeah, I did. I know, I know.</i>

1094
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:33,400
<i>I was the oldest one in the class.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1095
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:38,000
<i>And we were told to tell a story.</i>

1096
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,400
<i>Something true,</i>
<i>something that really happened to us.</i>

1097
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:45,300
<i>So I got up there</i>
<i>and I talked about my husband...</i>

1098
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,800
<i>and the love he left behind.</i>

1099
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,900
<i>A few days after Mitch died...</i>

1100
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,600
<i>I was walking through the yard</i>
<i>and I saw our neighbor...</i>

1101
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:03,000
<i>who was a very good friend</i>
<i>of Mitch's, Bob...</i>

1102
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,700
<i>and he saw me coming</i>
<i>through the gate...</i>

1103
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:11,600
<i>and he said,</i>
<i>"I am so sorry for your loss."</i>

1104
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,200
<i>And I knew that he needed</i>
<i>to feel that loss, too...</i>

1105
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:17,400
<i>and to share it,</i>
<i>and I wanted to help him.</i>

1106
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:22,200
<i>And he put his arms around me,</i>
<i>he cradled me...</i>

1107
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,000
<i>and his embrace tightened.</i>

1108
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,100
<i>Finally, here was somebody</i>
<i>who truly cared.</i>

1109
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,500
<i>And then...</i>

1110
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,900
<i>I felt something else.</i>

1111
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,200
<i>Something huge.</i>

1112
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:03,000
<i>Let's just say it, let's just say it!</i>

1113
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:04,300
<i>A boner.</i>

1114
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:09,900
<i>I know.</i>

1115
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,800
<i>A boner, that's what I get.</i>

1116
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,900
<i>That's what I get</i>
<i>for trying to do everything myself.</i>

1117
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,300
<i>Boner Bob, my neighbor.</i>

1118
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,700
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

1119
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,600
<i>He rooted for all of you.</i>

1120
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,700
<i>I love you.</i>

1121
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:56,000
<i>This is for you, your favorite song...</i>

1122
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,500
<i>on a Saturday night.</i>

1123
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,800
Well, you really brought
everybody together...

1124
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,700
I'll give you that.

1125
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,800
I have this thing for you.

1126
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:26,600
It's a very unique map.

1127
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,700
It's for your road trip home.

1128
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,600
Right, a map.

1129
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:37,600
You promised. Remember?

1130
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,100
No. No, I do, I remember.

1131
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,400
This is for you, Mitch.

1132
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,300
<i>Free Bird,</i> huh?

1133
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,200
- Well, I better get back to...
- Ben.

1134
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,900
He finally made it.

1135
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,600
Does Ben even exist?

1136
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:56,200
Just call me when you get home...

1137
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,500
and not until.

1138
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,700
I want you to get into the deep...

1139
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:06,300
beautiful melancholy
of everything that's happened.

1140
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,000
It's a great map.

1141
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,800
- Jessie!
- Just keep going!

1142
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,800
Oh, my God!

1143
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,900
I am a licensed flight attendant!
Use this exit, please!

1144
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:31,100
<i>As a specialist</i>
<i>in the field of last looks...</i>

1145
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,600
<i>this one was pretty iconically Claire.</i>

1146
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,600
Friends and neighbors,
we are gathered here...

1147
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:04,700
to say our final goodbyes
to our dear friend...

1148
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,600
Mitch.

1149
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,900
Come on, General.

1150
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,500
<i>The route of Claire's map...</i>

1151
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,500
<i>with accompanying music</i>
<i>and detailed instructions...</i>

1152
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,900
<i>would take 42 hours...</i>

1153
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,100
<i>and 11 minutes.</i>

1154
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,200
"Turn on ignition."

1155
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,000
<i>"Begin your journey</i>
<i>and do not skip ahead."</i>

1156
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,800
<i>She had laid out the entire road trip...</i>

1157
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,300
<i>and timed it to music</i>
<i>she herself had put on CDs.</i>

1158
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:09,700
<i>The songs, of course,</i>
<i>were classic mix tape songs.</i>

1159
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,600
<i>About her, of course.</i>

1160
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,800
<i>And the rich flurry</i>
<i>of our almost romance.</i>

1161
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:28,400
<i>60B.</i>

1162
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,300
<i>This is The Hombres.</i>

1163
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,000
<i>And she had even provided music</i>
<i>for what would happen next.</i>

1164
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,300
<i>Down to the minute.</i>

1165
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,900
<i>You have five minutes to wallow</i>
<i>in the delicious misery.</i>

1166
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,800
<i>Enjoy it, embrace it, discard it...</i>

1167
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,500
<i>and proceed.</i>

1168
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:54,800
<i>Here is a river</i>
<i>leading to the Mississippi.</i>

1169
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:00,300
<i>"This is America," she wrote.</i>

1170
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,500
<i>And if everybody gets a vote</i>
<i>where their Mitch gets buried...</i>

1171
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,900
<i>here are a few</i>
<i>where my Mitch gets buried.</i>

1172
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:10,700
<i>Or scattered.</i>

1173
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,700
<i>"Pause for 30 minutes</i>
<i>for the greatest chili in the world."</i>

1174
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,900
<i>And elsewhere in Memphis.</i>

1175
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:50,200
<i>This would be a good time</i>
<i>to stop in at Earnestine & Hazel's...</i>

1176
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:52,800
<i>and say hello to Russ.</i>

1177
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,100
How you doing?

1178
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:57,400
<i>He's hung onto the place</i>
<i>for 38 long years.</i>

1179
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,700
<i>He'll tell you a few stories.</i>

1180
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:08,300
Look. Look at this. That's the blues!

1181
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:14,400
<i>And just around the corner,</i>
<i>the Lorraine Motel.</i>

1182
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:22,800
<i>The hotel balcony where</i>
<i>Martin Luther King drew his last breath.</i>

1183
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:07,900
<i>His death was only the beginning</i>
<i>of his victory.</i>

1184
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,100
<i>You go across the bridge</i>
<i>traversing Mark Twain's muse...</i>

1185
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,900
<i>Jeff Buckley's funeral bed...</i>

1186
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,800
<i>as the night air</i>
<i>whips through your hair...</i>

1187
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,700
<i>around your face,</i>
<i>and out the other window.</i>

1188
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,200
<i>You can feel the soul of that dark water</i>
<i>even as you arrive on the other side.</i>

1189
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,000
<i>Some music needs air.</i>

1190
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,600
<i>Roll down your window.</i>

1191
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,600
- All right! Good!
- I love you, Daddy.

1192
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:09,300
<i>I love you too, Drew.</i>
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

1193
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,900
<i>- Tucky.</i>
<i>- Kentucky?</i>

1194
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,300
<i>Good morning.</i>

1195
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,100
<i>How you doing?</i>

1196
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,800
<i>The Survivor Tree.</i>

1197
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:56,500
<i>It's my favorite tree in the world.</i>

1198
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,200
<i>And I like trees.</i>

1199

<i>"This once highly-anticipated product...</i>

<i>Sadness is easier</i>
<i>because it's surrender.</i>

1202

<i>I say, make time to dance alone...</i>

1203

<i>with one hand waving free.</i>

1204

Look at us.

1205
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:17,400
You with your many almost-great
projects, me with my fiasco.

1206
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:21,900
Oh, God.

1207
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,400
Both of us working so hard...

1208
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,900
for what?

1209
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,300
We should have taken this trip
years ago.

1210
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:48,800
And the fact that I wanna go home
and kill myself is really not your fault.

1211
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:52,100
For what? For Phil?

1212
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:53,800
No!
