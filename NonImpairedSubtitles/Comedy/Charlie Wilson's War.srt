1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,796
The breakup of the Soviet Empire,

2
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:22,700
culminating in the
crumbling of the Berlin Wall,

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,400
is one of the great events
of world history.

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,400
There were many heroes in this battle,
but to Charlie Wilson must go this

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,200
special recognition.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
Just thirteen years ago
the Soviet Army appeared to be invincible.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,191
But Charlie, undeterred,
engineered an almost whole bodied

8
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:46,100
world that weakened
the Communist Empire.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,600
Without Charlie, history would be hugely
and sadly different.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,300
And so for the first time,
a civilian is being given

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,800
our highest recognition,
that of an "Honored Colleague".

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,863
Ladies and gentlemen of
the clandestine services,

13
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:07,300
Congressman Charles Wilson.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,300
It'd be like "Dallas".

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,300
You are right.
- You know what I'm sayin'?

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,100
It'd be like "Dallas", but set in Washington.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,065
Yeah.

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
You shouldn't say it
like that.

19
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,101
What I meant...

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,400
"Dallas" set in Washington DC.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,800
About people,
power, the national monuments...

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,800
the glamour, the power...

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
It's like Dallas or Paris?

24
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,700
except that it's in Washington.

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's talk to Charlie about that.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Charlie... it's like "Dallas",
but in Washington.

27
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,300
With Crystal in the starrin' role?

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,565
Yeah.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,100
Tell me when to watch.

30
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,100
I'll make sure I'm home.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,100
You don't think I can make it happen?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
I don't know anything about
how any of that works.

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,600
I do.

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,900
He said that you would listen to him,
that's why we're here.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,966
Isn't it routinely against honor
rules to offer network programs

36
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,900
to people who haven't
acted professionally before?

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,900
Crystal appeared on the
cover of Playboy, Charlie.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,900
Well, I guess that's just the same thing.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Would you take this seriously, please?

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm taken' it seriously.
Give me something to drink.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,100
What's Dan Rather wearin' there?

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,700
- What?
- Dan Rather. What's he wearing?

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,150
You're watching TV?

44
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:39,400
Why'd he shave?

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Who else is that?

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,500
Excuse me, hey.
Hey you, can you turn that up?

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,400
Can you just turn up the volume,
on the TV?

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm completely high.

49
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,683
Yeah, well, OK.

50
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:54,400
You know, can you just grab the remote
there and find the volume button?

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
Charlie, are we going to do business?

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Dan Rather is wearing a turban,
don't you want to watch?

53
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,000
He is doing some thing on India.

54
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,100
No, it's Afghanistan.

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Appreciate it.

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
You have ammunition for it?
He has three, but does he have ammunition?

57
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
He's talking to the Mujahideen.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,265
Priests?

59
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,700
Mujahideen. It means holy warriors.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,865
Priests...

61
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,600
How the hell am I supposed to know.

62
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,100
Come on.

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,200
America seems to be sleeping. It does not seem to
realize that if Afghanistan falls

64
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,400
and the Russians reach the Gulf,
it will be bad for the United States as well.

65
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,100
Me and my friend want to know.
What do you do for a living?

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm not a police officer,
if that's what you're asking.

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,033
No, we don't meet
many guys here who know

68
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:53,700
about the world
and likes to party.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,600
I'm a member of the US
House of Representatives.

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,065
I'm sorry?

71
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,500
I'm a Congressman.

72
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,100
Are you kidding?

73
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,600
No, I'm serious.

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,900
I'm Charlie Wilson.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,700
I represent the Texas Secon...

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,300
And this is Crystal Lee and this is Paul Brown.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,800
What are your names?

78
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,200
Stacy.
Stacy?

79
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,465
Kelly.
Kelly?

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,600
Glad to meet you both.

81
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,400
If you are a Congressman, should you
be in here with strippers and booze?

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm not a stripper.

83
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,200
I am.

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,200
I am too.

85
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,100
See? They were talking
about themselves.

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,200
You know you do have a point there.

87
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,665
Maybe I really should get goin'.

88
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,900
Charlie, I need twenty-nine thousand
dollars to make this happen.

89
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,700
You know I can make it happen,
and you know you want it.

90
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,400
Hey, who wants to take a ride
with me to the airport?

91
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,700
They say if they get weapons...
from us or anyone

92
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:58,500
else in the free world,
they will win.

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, I'm with Congressman
Charles Wilson and Crystal Lee...

94
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,900
I wish it were not so.

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,900
They will do a program on
Washington? I never saw.

96
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Not me.

97
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,700
We have a suite another night.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Should I go back?

99
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,765
No.

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,900
There can be another night?

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,900
Stay another night.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,900
I can't.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,300
- I have a vote.
- Something important?

104
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,400
Yes.

105
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
What are we talking about?

106
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,500
It is a non-binding resolution
expressing the sense of the Congress

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,300
that the Department of
Defense should continue to do

108
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,400
what's necessary to support
the Boy Scouts of America.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
Are you fucking kidding me?

110
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,800
Come on Charlie, call in the vote.

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I need an answer on this
Crystal thing as soon as possible.

112
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,400
First, I'd appreciate it if you
didn't throw my name around quite so much.

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,200
From time to time, I use it
myself and I need it in good condition.

114
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,475
Second, I'm from Lufkin, Texas, and
I'm the son of a common bookkeeper,

115
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:51,699
and I that take home
about 700 bucks a week.

116
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,138
And I pay alimony, so the
idea that I got twenty-nine

117
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,200
thousand dollars in the
bank is pretty hysterical.

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,900
That's it.
I hope your ideas work.

119
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Chrystal,
will you look during the week.

120
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,200
Stacey and Kelly, nice to meet you both.

121
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,600
They live here?
Yes.

122
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Don't forget to vote.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Bye. Love you.

124
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
I have to go.

125
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,000
- Oh, that's for you.
- Thank you, sir.

126
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Bye!

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,200
I love Las Vegas.

128
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,300
Okay, what else?

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,800
The man you wanted
is sitting in the office.

130
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
Yeah, I thought we could talk.

131
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,500
He wants to talk to you about a crèche.

132
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,700
What, a Nativity scene
of the baby Jesus?

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,900
It's on public property and the city
is making them move it.

134
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,900
Shoot, I thought he was just coming
to get his picture took.

135
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Hello Congressman, my name is Jack Donnelly,
do you have moment, Sir?

136
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,500
Sure.
Tip asked me to talk to you.

137
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,400
OK, he wants me to talk to you
about John Russell.

138
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh yeah?

139
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
The prosecutor is going to go after him.

140
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
They will not find anything.

141
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
John Russell is as clean as
my mother's kitchen floor.

142
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,600
Yeah but Tip would like to put you
on the Ethics Committee just the same.

143
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,400
You're kidding?

144
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:51,265
No.

145
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,400
Oh Jesus, nearly everybody in town knows
that I'm on the other side of the issue.

146
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Ethics?

147
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:56,865
Yeah.

148
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,300
Well, the Speaker would like
to put you on the Ethics Committee anyway.

149
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,100
Ok.

150
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,500
Anyone asks what the hell I'm doin' on
the Ethics Committee just tell them

151
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,000
I like chasing women and drinking whisky,
and speaking trouble like a Representative.

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
It has my vote.

153
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:10,565
Exactly.

154
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
Tip said that he'll return the favor.

155
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,800
Tuesday, right?

156
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Right, Tuesday.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,900
So, if anything comes up will you let
me speak with him about it, please

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,100
Yes.

159
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,500
Yes.

160
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,500
I'd like to be on the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center.

161
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,200
Charlie!

162
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,200
Sorry?
It turns out..

163
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,500
Congress approves the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center,

164
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,900
it's a great place to take a date
and I can never get tickets.

165
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,200
Consider it done.

166
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
Excellent.

167
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,600
You're a phony.

168
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,500
Let's take a few minutes and
see what's going on in this world.

169
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,100
What can't you arrange for newspapers
like everybody else?

170
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,627
Well, every thing is productive
and I like today's news today

171
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,300
and that makes me one
day smarter than you

172
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
and this could help you as well.

173
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:45,700
No thank you.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,300
Don't you think its a little crazy?

175
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,100
"Pan Am and Eastern are lower on defense"

176
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,700
You know what I know.

177
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
What's so crazy?

178
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,050
That you want on the Kennedy so you can get
free tickets to the Royal Ballet?

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,300
Wait.

180
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,465
What?

181
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
A story of Kabul.

182
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,700
Pakistan?

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Afghanistan.

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel and Egypt.

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,345
Jim Van Wagenen is our point man

186
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,000
for Agriculture and Defense Subcommittee?

187
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

188
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,810
Tell him come to our office
as soon as possible.

189
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
I already voted in this?

190
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:20,100
Yes.

191
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,900
Are you sure?

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Yeah.

193
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,300
Boy Scouts.
Uh-huh.

194
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,900
Jim Van Wagenen, get him.
And show him that wire.

195
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:25,901
Yes sir.

196
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,300
Charlie'll probably be here in a moment.
He's just come up for a vote.

197
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm sure it's important.

198
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,465
No, not really.

199
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,400
Can you reschedule this?

200
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,900
Office of Charlie Wilson,
good morning.

201
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
It is.

202
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,400
How are you?

203
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,465
Miss.

204
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,365
Yes sir.

205
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,900
It seems to me that looking around,
its almost all women workin' here.

206
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
And they all are very beautiful.

207
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Is this common?

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Congressman Wilson has an expression...

209
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,500
He says that you can teach them to type,
but you can't teach them to grow tits.

210
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Well, that's charming.

211
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,300
Larry.

212
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,210
Congressman.

213
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,800
No, no, no, for five thousand dollars
every two years, you can call me Charlie.

214
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,900
For ten thousand you can call Betty Sue
and I'll clean out your rain gutters.

215
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,300
This is my daughter, Jane.

216
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,000
Charlie Wilson's office.
Welcome to the United States Congress.

217
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm gonna to talk to your daddy
for a couple of  seconds.

218
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,600
Larry, we uh... get you a drink?

219
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,700
It's ten o'clock in the morning!

220
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,900
Fair enough.

221
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,300
Grab a seat.

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Now this situation with the crèche,
I know all about it.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,400
Wilson...

224
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,100
Every seven years since when
the world was young,

225
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:43,101
Uh-huh

226
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,100
the Firehouse in Nacogdoches Township
has displayed a crèche.

227
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,101
Um-hmm

228
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
Now the ACLU filed a suit

229
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,099
against the Township for displaying
a religious ceremony on public property.

230
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,500
Huh.

231
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,400
It's Christmas time, it's crèche. I can
understand if it we were in gosh darn Scarsdale,

232
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,000
but this is East Texas and
I want to know who we're offendin'

233
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,900
except for two lawyers from the ACLU.

234
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,600
It's a terror thing to understand
and a complicated question.

235
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,200
Let me make this suggestion though.

236
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,199
There's a church about a block
and half from that firehouse,

237
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,200
the First Baptist Church of Nacogdoches,
they got a beautiful rollin' lawn...

238
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,300
This is a Christian country Charlie,
founded on Christian values.

239
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:22,901
Sure.

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,300
We mock a lot of things to
worship as they wish,

241
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,360
but when we cannot put a Nativity
scene in front of the firehouse

242
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,782
at Christmas time in
Nacogdoches Township,

243
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,300
something's gone terribly wrong.

244
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,100
That's not really true, Larry.
I mean, you could move that

245
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,900
crèche over to that church,
and everything's just fine.

246
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,500
That's not the point.

247
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,432
Ok, why don't we just
go back to the beginning?

248
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,710
What can I do for you?

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
You can intervene in the case.

250
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Intervene?
How?

251
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
You appointed the Judge.

252
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,100
I don't appoint judges,

253
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:51,900
I just made a recommendation
to the President.

254
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,798
Uh-huh,

255
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,300
I think you and I
both know what that means.

256
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,400
I cannot just call up a Judge
and tell him what to do.

257
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,500
Why?

258
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,400
Because it's against a shitload
of really good laws, Gary.

259
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,800
Larry.

260
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,800
Oh, Larry.

261
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,325
I gotta go to talk to this
guy out here for a second.

262
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:09,400
Will you excuse me.

263
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,999
By the way, I love Jesus Christ
and his mother Mary

264
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,050
as much as anybody,
about 38 churches

265
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,750
you could move that crèche to
and everyone would be happy.

266
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
Call me.
Ok.

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Hello, how are you?

268
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,300
Want a cup of coffee, something to drink?
Ok.

269
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,400
Jim.

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
You see AP story I copied you?

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,300
Yeah, with respect to Kabul.

272
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,900
He saw the Dan Rather report last night?

273
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:33,150
Yeah.

274
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,994
Tell me somethin',
what is the Committee's budget

275
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,749
for covert ops against
communist activities in Afghanistan?

276
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,000
- Total?
- Total.

277
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,500
It's five million.

278
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,300
They can't shoot down helicopters
for five million dollars.

279
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,301
No.
We already tried that

280
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,800
It's like throwing rocks.

281
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,650
Get everybody together for me, will ya?

282
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
And double it.

283
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,500
I'm sorry, sir?

284
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
The covert ops budget,
double it.

285
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay.

286
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,900
It won't be much longer, okay?

287
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,100
Thank you.

288
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Here's what I'm gonna do, Larry...

289
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,500
Charlie Wilson's office.

290
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,000
Maybe in 20 minutes.

291
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
He's in meeting.

292
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,700
Sure.

293
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,600
And so, wrote in a report I was the
the best officer who he ever served at Sea with.

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And the worst officer that he ever
served with in Port.

295
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,275
Can you figure that out?

296
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,689
I graduated from Annapolis
with the second most demerits

297
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,900
of any mid-shipmen in the
history of the Naval Academy.

298
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,600
Who had the most?
I want to speak with him.

299
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,450
It's hotter here
than it is in Nacogdoches.

300
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
I hope you don't mind,
I took off my hot clothes.

301
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm just going to have to live with that, Jane.

302
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Come on, I want to show you the
best view in the business.

303
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Want a cigarette?

304
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,400
No, I have this.
- I like both.

305
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,400
- It must be great being mixed.
- They say it is.

306
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,950
The Iwo Jima Memorial...
The Lincoln Center...

307
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
The Washington Monument...

308
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Jefferson Memorial, the Ponte Bridge, and...
the Pentagon.

309
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,400
- Ah, yes the Pentagon...
- That is the Pentagon...

310
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
And now I'll show you the second
best woman in the district.

311
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,100
Ok.

312
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
That was predictable.

313
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
I have to go for a second.

314
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,265
Hello.

315
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,800
What did you do today,
is something extraordinary.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,365
Who is this?

317
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,700
It's Joanne.

318
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,300
Joanne.

319
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Ah, so nice speaking to you,
can I call you back in a little bit?

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Is Ronald Reagan in
your bedroom right now?

321
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,865
No.

322
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Then I'm considerably
more important than whoever it is.

323
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,300
Do you want me to leave?

324
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
No, this is just going to be a second or two.

325
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,300
Okay, I am all yours.

326
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
What did I do that was so extraordinary?

327
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,200
Double it.

328
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,800
Now you told me you didn't have a girlfriend.

329
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,965
What?

330
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,700
You told Jim Van Wagenen to double it.

331
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,479
Oh shit Joanne, I don't know
what you are talking about,

332
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,100
and if I did, it's classified.

333
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,100
I'd wonder where you got your
information from the subcommittee.

334
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,500
You can't hide anything...

335
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a really a matter of National Security.
Can't help but...

336
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm really Sorry.

337
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,500
Hold on.

338
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,600
I understand, Laurez told me
you didn't have a girlfriend.

339
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,204
I don't, this isn't my girlfriend,
but the sixth wealthiest woman in Texas.

340
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:46,550
But she's still pretty good.

341
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay, so.

342
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,453
A friend of mine has
made a terrific movie

343
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,649
about the need for
American aid to Afghanistan.

344
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,800
Need for ammo?

345
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah. I'm gonna run this movie Friday night
at my house, I want you to be there.

346
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,200
You've never been to my house, Charlie.

347
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,500
You really want me to come to
Houston to see a movie.

348
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,600
There'll be women with bells on.
See you Friday.

349
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Yes Ma'am.

350
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:18,401
Hey.
Hey.

351
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,500
Thank you.

352
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,000
Ok, so I know it was difficult for
you to come here hat in hand.

353
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,794
It's not the kind of... upbringing,
I guess is the word I was looking for.

354
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:37,750
It's not the kind of man
you are.  I understand that.

355
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm not looking to humiliate you
or attack your pride in any way

356
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:43,000
so why don't you just apologise.

357
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,500
We'll call it water over the dam
and we'll go about our business.

358
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
Excuse me,
what the fuck?

359
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
What?

360
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
What the fuck are you talking about?

361
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,400
Claire George said you
were coming in here to apologise.

362
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Na, I was supposed to come to in here to
see if you would apologise to me.

363
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,200
According to whom?

364
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,065
Claire George.

365
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,900
You told me to fuck myself,
I'm supposed to apologise to you?

366
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,100
Oh, so the water goes over a dam and under a bridge,
you pompous schoolboy

367
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,300
Clearly, there's been a mis-communication
between Claire George and somebody.

368
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,500
Excuse me.
Yes.

369
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,800
Fine.

370
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,500
I have no fuckin' idea who this guy is.

371
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,300
He is here to fix the glass
you broke last time you were here.

372
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
Can you give us a second?

373
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,985
You tell me to fuck myself
and I'm supposed to apologise?

374
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,400
You break my window, I'm
supposed to apologise?

375
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
The Helsinki job was mine!

376
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,200
The Helsinki job wasn't yours.
If it was yours you'd be in Helsinki now.

377
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,800
Alan Wolf promised me.

378
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Alan Wolf is no longer here.

379
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,041
Alan Wolf is no longer the Director
of European Operations.

380
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,800
He did not make those appointments.

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The promises were made.

382
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:34,865
Not by me.

383
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,043
I've been with the company
for twenty-four years.

384
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:38,500
I was posted in Greece for fifteen.

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,400
Popideau wins that election
and I don't have the junta taken prisoner.

386
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,500
I've advised an army,
I've disarmed champions of communism,

387
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,800
I've spent the last three years
learning Finnish,

388
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,500
which will come in handy here in Virginia
and I've never even seen Helsinki.

389
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,400
So I want to know why I'm not
going to be Helsinki Station Chief?

390
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,800
You're coarse.

391
00:16:58,835 --> 00:16:59,665
Excuse me?

392
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,982
For Helsinki, I need someone
with diplomatic skills.

393
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:02,800
You don't have them.

394
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,765
Is that right?

395
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,252
That is right.

396
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:05,769
I don't know why the
hell they didn't fire you,

397
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,600
when you broke my fucking window!

398
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Oh, sure you do, Gravely.

399
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,565
Look, Gust...

400
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,550
They're talking about our seance in here
and you know I know.

401
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,100
I'm not even going to dignify
that with a response.

402
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,199
Yeah, yeah dignify it or in your ass
the Jefferson tower with 12:10

403
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,900
But let me ask you,
the 3000 agents Turner fired,

404
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,100
was that because of their
lack of diplomatic skills as well?

405
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,100
You're going to Admiral Stanfield Turner?

406
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Yeah, 3000 agents, each and
every God Damn one of them 1st or 2nd

407
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
generation Americans, not because they
lacked the proper diplomatic skills.

408
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,400
But it was Turner that thought
it was a good idea that the spies

409
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,100
should speak the same language as the
people they were fucking spying on.

410
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,400
Well, I'm sorry,
but you can hardly blame the Director

411
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,399
for questioning the loyalty
of America people who are just barely

412
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,700
Americans in the first place.

413
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,500
Yeah, well I'll take a moment to review
the several ways you're a douche-bag.

414
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
Get the fuck out of my office!

415
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,165
Yes sir.

416
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,100
This will end your career, asshole.

417
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes sir.
My friend, I'm gonna...

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,700
need this for a second.

419
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,600
God Damn it!

420
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,300
My loyalty...

421
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,672
For twenty-four years, people
have been trying to kill me.

422
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:06,500
People who know how.

423
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,165
Now you think that just
because my dad was a Greek

424
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
soda pop maker,
or you think just because

425
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,983
I'm an American spy...
go fuck yourself,

426
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:14,900
you fuckin' child!

427
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,100
How was I?

428
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,900
There is a woman in Pennsylvania,
named Nitza.

429
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,900
She thinks she's a witch.

430
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,900
She offered to put a curse on
Gravely for me.

431
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:34,901
Yeah.

432
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,300
She uh, asked me if I want a
professional curse or a health curse.

433
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,200
A health curse I can do right away,
but a professional curse takes longer.

434
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm uncomfortable about that.

435
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,800
You get the brownie?
- No, you...

436
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,500
I got ya.

437
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,536
Transcripts of phone conversations
between French and German generals

438
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,900
ordering their office space
in NATO Headquarters.

439
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,600
Analyzing wire taps of
communications in New Zealand.

440
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,700
Historically a hotbed of Anti-American activity.

441
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Nobody can come near me.
Even the weebs.

442
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,200
You know with that typical police officer,
he walks into his boss's office

443
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,900
and winds up in a bucket of shit.

444
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
Twice.

445
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,931
I just told ya I met a
witch in Pennsylvania and

446
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,800
I already was going to put a
curse on Henry Gravely this morning.

447
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,000
Does that sound like
a typical police officer?

448
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,900
No.

449
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,200
Then lets assume that I'm not.

450
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,000
If you're really not doing anything wrong,
then I'm sure you can work it out.

451
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,500
What do you do?

452
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,000
Killing Russians.

453
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,900
Our next slave girl
is a Texas homegrown, Ashley Winslow.

454
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,300
Ashley is a Playboy beauty and comes from
Delta Delta Delta,

455
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,000
So hold up your cards if you want to bid.

456
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,900
So who wants to bid?...

457
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,300
Oh my gosh, she is a knockout.

458
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,300
No, she's just charged up.

459
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
No, she is a neat one, Charlie.

460
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Oh, Joanne.

461
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
She's a direct descendant of
George Washington's sister.

462
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,900
Says she had a great uncle
who was killed at the Alamo.

463
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,700
Oh, and Miss Cotton bowl.

464
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,100
Federal and local television options.

465
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
"Pakistan draws the right council of
Texas ", how's that for a title?

466
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,900
This is a hotbed of
Anti-Communist fanatics.

467
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,800
They're not all from Right Wing.

468
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
What are they?

469
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,400
Well, they're local family.

470
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
What are you doing with this woman?

471
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,000
You haven't heard me talk
about the former Miss Cotton bowl?

472
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,400
You are unbelievable.

473
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,600
We will, you will like. What is
Here is release the woman.

474
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,100
And what better way than with
a slave girl auction?

475
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,100
Charlie?

476
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,700
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

477
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,900
No problem, Joanne.

478
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,765
This is Bonnie Bach.

479
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,500
Nice to meet you.

480
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,300
It's a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Herring. Wonderful party.

481
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,300
Why don't you give us a few minutes?

482
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:22,500
Sure.

483
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,300
Oh Bonnie, could I ask you for a
Bombay Martini, very dry?

484
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,500
Oh, I'm not a slave girl actually, I'm
the Congressman's Administrative Assistant.

485
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,100
And how wonderful for you!

486
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,665
Yes.

487
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,500
No ice please.
And you can go.

488
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Certainly.

489
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
She doesn't like me.

490
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Everybody likes you.

491
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,050
She's a liberal.

492
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,200
I'm liberal.

493
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,500
Not where it counts.

494
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,165
Have you seen the house?

495
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,300
Well, I've seen the downstairs.
What's upstairs?

496
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,200
Fourteen bedrooms.

497
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,200
Let's have a look.

498
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
What'd you think of the film?

499
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
What we saw?

500
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,200
The reason for the party, yes.

501
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm not an expert in the field,
but the production quality seemed amateurish.

502
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm not submitting it
for a Golden Globe nomination, Charlie.

503
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
You know what I am talking about.

504
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Well, as a member of
the Defense Subcommittee, I wondered

505
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:21,100
if the Soviet Union's
invaded Afghanistan?

506
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,383
The problem is my
government is aware of it.

507
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,365
I was wondering if they were
thinking of doing anything

508
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,700
about it other than a
Boycotting the Olympics this year.

509
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,034
I think that agreeing with the pathetic response
is the greatest National Security

510
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:34,200
threat this nation has faced
since the Cuban missiles crisis.

511
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,850
Well, I don't think
making more movies about it

512
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:38,800
is going do the trick,
if that's what you're asking.

513
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,000
You think not?

514
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,600
Tell me, how much power do you have
as a member of the subcommittee?

515
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,200
Which one, I'm on two?

516
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,450
Foreign Ops.

517
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:50,300
Eight Members and myself hand
out eleven billion in promises.

518
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,300
And what about the
Defense Subcommittee?

519
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,400
What about it?

520
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,800
The funds are unlimited.

521
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,900
Yes.

522
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,600
Would you like to see my room?

523
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,600
Yes.

524
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,000
So, unless I'm wrong,
and that would be unusual for me,

525
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,500
you oversee the aid section of the State Department,
the Pentagon and the CIA.

526
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,400
You meet in a sound proof room
underneath the Capitol.

527
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,252
And you design or direct a secret and unlimited

528
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:21,300
budget for the three agencies
that are needed

529
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,100
to conduct a covert war.
Isn't that right?

530
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,100
I also have seats in the Kennedy Center.

531
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,672
Isn't that how you were
able to double the CIA budget

532
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:32,699
for advisory personnel to
Afghanistan just by saying so?

533
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,200
Why are you only asking me questions
you already know the answers to.

534
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,900
Why is Congress is sayin' one thing
and doing nothin'.

535
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
We're traditional.

536
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,200
Come here.

537
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Ok.

538
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,500
I don't understand the energy that
women have after sex.

539
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,900
After a while, they bake a pie,

540
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,000
Charlie?

541
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Yes, Ma'am

542
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,700
Why is the CIA runnin' a
fake war in Afghanistan?

543
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,700
They do everything they can.

544
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
They're doin' it badly.

545
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,150
The CIA is arming the Mujahideen,

546
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:20,250
where do you think
they get their weapons?

547
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,857
They're arming them
with 12.7 mm Dushkas,

548
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,600
Which would be good, except ....

549
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,200
the Soviets have specifically
armor plated their helicopters to

550
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,200
deflect a 12.7 mm shell.

551
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,028
They sold Pakistan 16's,

552
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:36,200
but they didn't give them enough
ammo to shoot down the radar.

553
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,459
If this were a real war,

554
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,657
they would just
show up and outline the

555
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:43,000
communist threat the way
they did in El Salvador.

556
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,000
If this were a real war,
there'd be a national bipartisan commission...

557
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,001
on Afghanistan,

558
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,900
headed by Henry Kissinger,
the way they did in Central America.

559
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,269
If it were a real war,

560
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,500
Congress would authorize
twenty-four million dollars in

561
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,100
covert operations,
the way they did in Nicaragua.

562
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,600
If it were a real war...

563
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,400
You are the sexiest woman ever.
I'm not kidding. You are Helen of Troy.

564
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,865
You patronizing me?

565
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
What do you want me to do, Joanne?

566
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,400
This is what I want you to do.

567
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,489
I want you to save Afghanistan
for the Afghans.

568
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,610
I want you to deliver such a
crushing defeat for the Soviets

569
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,400
that Communism crumbles and in so doing,
end the Cold War

570
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,432
I'm sorry, I'd do it too,

571
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,900
but I got some Dairy Queen
problems and now you know...

572
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,300
Don't underestimate me, Charlie.
Believe everything you've heard.

573
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,200
Exactly what do you want me to do?

574
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,200
Go to Pakistan and meet with Zia.

575
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Zia.

576
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Muhammad Zia Ul-Haq.

577
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,300
He's the President of Pakistan.

578
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,465
I've already arranged it

579
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,800
You arranged a meeting between me
and the President of Pakistan?

580
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,139
Yes.

581
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,858
You're going to Israel next
week so we need to figure out

582
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,800
how it'll be a last minute adjustment and
we'll just add Pakistan to this trip.

583
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,900
I meet with the President?

584
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,134
And convince you that it's
a Christian imperative to

585
00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:00,090
the let the Afghans rid
their country of Communism.

586
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,973
Ok, it's unlikely the President
of Pakistan is a Christian,

587
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:07,300
but how am I going to do this, Joanne.

588
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,882
'Cuz you saved my ass
from the pro-lifers

589
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:14,500
and I owe you my seat in Congress,
and you presently look very good naked.

590
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,800
But I have to tell you,
I'm elected by Jews.

591
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,200
How many Jews do you
have in your district?

592
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,310
Un...seven,

593
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,300
but Congressmen aren't elected by voters,

594
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,290
they're elected by contributers,

595
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,185
and I'm wondering... wondering
about New York, Florida,

596
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,400
'cause I'm one of
Israel's guys on the Hill.

597
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,800
I don't know how they're
gonna feel about me taking 'em a card...

598
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,200
Well, that's your problem.

599
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,700
Yes it is.

600
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,300
You have this war and win it, Charlie.
Everything possible is on the line. Even you and me.

601
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,300
I was afraid you were going to said that.

602
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,300
Well, I guess it ain't be twice tonight.

603
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,600
Well, I guess somebody can't count.

604
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,200
Oh god, I'm real tired and beat.

605
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,000
- Congressman, Congressman.
- Mr. President.

606
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,400
Joanne Herring speaks very highly of you.

607
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,100
Thank you, Sir

608
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,500
These are two of my greatest advisers
covering the problem of Soviet.

609
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,900
This is the Brigadier Rashid.

610
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,100
How do you do?
-- Very happy.

611
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,700
Colonel Mahmood.

612
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

613
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,100
Please sit down.

614
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,799
You must be exhausted,
let me get you a ginball.

615
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,500
Actually, I'd love a glass of ice, with
any kind of whisky... Rye, Canadian.

616
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,700
I'm sorry Congressman, we don't have
alcohol in the Presidential Palace.

617
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,200
Of course you don't.
I apologize.

618
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Fruit juice?

619
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I bet a lot of people
made that mistake.

620
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,800
No.

621
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,700
Ok.

622
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,700
Brigadier.

623
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,700
So, you understand the situation
on our border?

624
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,676
Yes sir, I think I do,
and I think it's terrible.

625
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:21,300
And I know I speak for all the people in
the Texas Second Congressional District,

626
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,400
when I say that our thoughts
and prayers are with you.

627
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,100
All the people of the Texas Second
Congressional District you represent?

628
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes it is.

629
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,850
Three million Afghan refugees
are living like livestock.

630
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,000
And other two million have fled into Iran.

631
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,700
And it's just what the doctor's ordered for Iran,
don't you think.

632
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,800
People dying by tens of thousands.

633
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
And those that aren't are crossing
into Pakistan every day.

634
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Would you like to know how many?

635
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,200
1/5 of Afghan now lives in Pakistan's
northwest frontier province.

636
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,500
So, I had asked me
That the

637
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,200
your State Department
would someone here

638
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,000
who things he understands the problem.

639
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,900
But I don't think that Representative of the

640
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,900
Texas Second Congressional District
understands very well the subject.

641
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,900
Well, I came not representing them. Vim
At the request of a friend in Houston.

642
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
So this is a courtesy call.

643
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,100
I don't need courtesy. I need
airplanes, guns and money.

644
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,700
Well, we just doubled
the CIA budget for covert ops.

645
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
From five to ten million?

646
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,750
That's right.

647
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:22,700
It was a joke.

648
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,365
No.

649
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,600
Is that meant to be a funny joke?

650
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,865
No sir.

651
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,100
What they're saying is $10 million for
the US to fight the Russian army,

652
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,600
I can only figure that the
10 million is taken for a joke.

653
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,500
Call this sarcasm here sir,
but let me be clear,

654
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,700
The United States is eager to assist you.

655
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,765
No, you're not.

656
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
You're not.
Absolutely not.

657
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,900
I went to Oxford and I know
what that word means.

658
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,510
The US is not "eager" to assist us.

659
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,100
I not offended, we offered to sell you
F15's, and you didn't want 'em.

660
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Because you refused
to sell us the radar.

661
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,365
To hell with that.

662
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,365
And this is typical of
Relation to ...

663
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Americans when it comes to fighting the Soviets.

664
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,600
To hell with it!

665
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,200
You sell us the planes,
but not the radar.

666
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,865
In offering arms of the 1st World War,

667
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,100
while Soviet helicopters
are killing everything they can find,

668
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,800
people, animals, food supplies.

669
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,065
To hell with it.

670
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,500
The Soviets said that we would give the radar
so that's why they said , "to hell with it."

671
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,900
And I... I understood.

672
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,800
Also, the arms and funding
should go through us.

673
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,765
I'm sorry?

674
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,700
That's a big part of the problem.

675
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,700
The arms and the funding
should flow through us.

676
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We have experience
with warfare of this kind.

677
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,500
And you the CIA has an
unimpressive record.

678
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,755
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

679
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,900
They missed 130,000 Soviet soldiers
walking just walking in Afghanistan.

680
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Yeah, we were wrapped up.

681
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,900
I would say so.

682
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,289
Well, I don't want to use up
any more of your possible time.

683
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,400
I will uh, take your message back

684
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,550
to my Committee Chairman and
we will give it our fullest attention.

685
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,700
Let me walk you to the door.

686
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,400
I read about you before you came here.

687
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,100
I learned that you are a man
of many character flaws.

688
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,865
I am.

689
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,600
But I also learned that you  never
promise anything that cannot deliver.

690
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
No I don't, Mr. President.

691
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,065
Then promise me this.

692
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,800
Go take a shower and see the refugees camps.
Right now, today.

693
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,500
Have a shower, and see
with your own eyes.

694
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,100
I have a helicopter waiting.

695
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,400
Alright. I'll do it.

696
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,300
Thank Mr. Congressman.

697
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Mr. President.

698
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,100
Alright, lets go.

699
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,765
How did it go?

700
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,100
There were three of them.
It was like I was receiving punches from all sides.

701
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,733
He's pretty much a rock bottom man and

702
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:06,200
he told me he was a qualified man behind
his predecessor in a military coup.

703
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,165
Can we go home now?

704
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,000
No, no, we have to
make one more stop.

705
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,100
There are about 350 people
in three small villages.

706
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,179
But uh, instead of killing all at once,

707
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,375
the Russians have made the parents watch

708
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:24,810
as they slit the throats
of their children.

709
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,000
And so the Russians
gathered all the defenders

710
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,800
into the center of the village

711
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,400
then played honor with them
with their tanks.

712
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,200
I saw something shining on the ground,
I thought it was a toy.

713
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,700
When I went to grab it,
exploded in my hand.

714
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,965
I should have known.

715
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,700
Because last year my brother
tried to pick up a piece of candy,

716
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,400
And it cut him in half.

717
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,900
It takes more work take care of a
wounded child, than it does an adult.

718
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,431
So when the Russians cover
the field with toy bombs,

719
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:12,410
I don't see why held to the war
act to take care of the children.

720
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,100
You like them?

721
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,300
Make you look a like a bug.

722
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,900
They're beautiful.

723
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,300
How many children you have?

724
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,100
He had 6.

725
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
What we want to be when they grow up?

726
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,500
Hi, Congressman Wilson

727
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,700
We have an invitation
with the Station Chief.

728
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,200
Down the hall,
second door to the left.

729
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,260
Look sir, we met the delegation
and we give courtesy briefings

730
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,390
We've been delayed?

731
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,100
We don't have a whole
lot of time anyway, so...

732
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,900
Fuck your contract,
I'm on Defense Appropriations and I'm catching

733
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
a plane back to Washington
in just a few minutes now.

734
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:51,200
I need a full classified
briefing right now!

735
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
120,000 Soviet troops in all.

736
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,065
120,000?

737
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,100
The 40th army is garrisoned
in the cities and at the airports.

738
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
The 7th and 8th divisions are in Kabul.

739
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,500
A 18th in Bazard.

740
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,000
The 4th Armored is in...

741
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,100
Manage anything in government?

742
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,100
I'm sorry?

743
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,400
They control any government themselves?

744
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,700
Soviet advisers have appropriated
the Afghan Intel Service and other ministries.

745
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What ministries?

746
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,065
All of them.

747
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:24,300
Anyway, the 4th Armored covers
Bagram Air Base, the 7th Armored...

748
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Do we need to be shootin'
down these helicopters?

749
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,400
Sorry?

750
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,400
The helicopters, why not send in someone
who can shoot down the helicopters?

751
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,200
The helicopters are a problem.

752
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,400
You think?

753
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,653
Congressman...

754
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:47,100
They're shooting at Soviet gunships
with Enfield rifles that's basically not cutting it.

755
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,500
The Soviet hides gunships with specialty
armor modified to diffuse those bullets.

756
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,500
Yeah, I know, I know.
So you tell me what you need to shoot them down.

757
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
What do you mean?

758
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,600
Tell me what you need.

759
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,165
You understand what I'm saying?

760
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,800
You tell me what you need and
I will go about getting it for you.

761
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,341
Congressman,
I appreciate your generosity,

762
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:08,900
but a sudden influx of
money and modern weaponry

763
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,100
would draw attention.

764
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,765
What?

765
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
A sudden influx of money ...

766
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,600
It would call attention?

767
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,500
Yeah.

768
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,300
I don't know what this means.

769
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
This is the Cold War,
everybody knows about it.

770
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,400
Should I continue with the briefing?

771
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,700
Have you been to these refugee camps?
Have you listened to their stories?

772
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,000
Congressman,
I'm required to give you a briefing.

773
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,600
Should I continue?

774
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,000
No, thank you.

775
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,088
You know, I had a neighbor
when I was growing up,

776
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,600
whose name came right out of Dickens.

777
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,500
Mr. Charles Hazard

778
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,358
And Mr. Hazard didn't like

779
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,400
the neighbourhood dogs
messing up his flower beds.

780
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,910
One day I hear a bunch of
yelling across the street, so I ran over

781
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:10,310
to Mr. Hazard's
and there were about 15 grownups

782
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:11,369
standing around my dog.

783
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,285
Teddy was wriggling on the ground,
in obvious agony.

784
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:17,900
Blood was pouring out of his mouth.

785
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:24,000
Mr. Hazard ground glass bottle
and put it in a bowl of dog food and gave it to him.

786
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,900
What did you do?

787
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,968
Well, I got some gasoline and
burned down his flower bed.

788
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,600
But that wasn't satisfying enough.

789
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,900
And then I remembered
that Mr. Hazard was

790
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
an elected official.
He was on the town council.

791
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,200
He re-elects every two years,
it was a foregone conclusion.

792
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,700
So, come election day,
I drove over to the black section of town.

793
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,382
These people hadn't voted
in any of these elections.

794
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:54,100
I was only thirteen,
but I had a learner's license.

795
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,500
I filled up a car with black voters and
dropped them at the polling place,

796
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:00,401
and waited and took them on home.

797
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,190
Before they got out of the car to vote,

798
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,850
I said, I don't mean to influence you,

799
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,520
but I think you should know
that Mr. Charles Hazard

800
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:12,500
intentionally killed my dog.

801
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,600
About 400 ballots were cast in that election
and I drove 96 of them to the polls.

802
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,000
Hazard lost by sixteen votes.

803
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,610
And that's the day
I fell in love with America.

804
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,400
What time do we arrive?

805
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,900
7:30 AM in DC.

806
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,400
I want CIA in my office at 10.

807
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,000
Assistant Deputy Director or higher.

808
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,532
Tell them that if I
don't see someone at 10,

809
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:51,100
I'm going to start docking their allowance
and they won't get more money off of me.

810
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,800
Yes Sir.

811
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,500
Get me another one of them,
would you please?

812
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,800
Yes sir.

813
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,700
PMKs, R57 grenade launchers and
82 mm mortars are coming to

814
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,500
Pakistan by air and sea and then in trucks
taken to the Afghanistan border.

815
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,300
And we take 'em across on mules

816
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,700
They gotta be checked out.

817
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
For what?

818
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,700
Diseases - foot and mouth.

819
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,200
The mules have better
health care than the Afghans.

820
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,900
They said it will cost a little extra if
we want them pre-trained.

821
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,865
To do what?

822
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,600
Walk over a mountain
with ammunition their back.

823
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,200
Why do they need to
be trained to do that,

824
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,600
isn't that something they
want to do naturally?

825
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,900
Afghanistan thinkin' about
building some fuckin' roads?

826
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,900
Gust.

827
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:38,265
Yeah?

828
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,300
I got something for you.

829
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,300
It changed everything. Take your newspaper.
-- Ok

830
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,900
No problem.
Thank you.

831
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,900
He should be here in a minute.

832
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Don't worry about me,
I'm fine.

833
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,465
Good morning.

834
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,600
Good morning, Congressman.
Welcome back.

835
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Hello, Marla.

836
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,800
Welcome back.

837
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,600
- Suzanne.
- Welcome back.

838
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,300
Who are you?

839
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,500
This is Gust Avrakotos,
he's here to bring the information that Congressman wanted...

840
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,200
Bonnie! Yes sir.
I said Assistant Deputy Director or higher!

841
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,700
I know that. No Deputy will be coming here without a subpoena.
The man who Mr. Need, Member.

842
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,300
You're on the Afghanistan desk?

843
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,400
Yeah.

844
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,800
Well, I wouldn't be to proud of that.
I just go back from there.

845
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,092
Well, I know. And then there's
that a hell of a flight too.

846
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:30,500
The nine hour flying time. The stop
in Brussels plus the time difference.

847
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,300
I'm a little grumpy myself...
I'm not grumpy because that flight...

848
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,400
We wanted to give you this.
We know you like single malt.

849
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,900
It's called Talisker
Imported from Scotsmen that turn Europe

850
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:47,600
The Kings took it. It is very good.

851
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,000
Who are you again?

852
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,700
Gust Avrakotos.

853
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Have Bobby come in.
Yes sir.

854
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,465
Why this present?

855
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
From the Afghanistan desk because
you doubled the budget for Mikado team.

856
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,600
Well.

857
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:03,967
Thank you.

858
00:44:04,002 --> 00:44:05,300
Ah, it was nothin'.

859
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,500
It's a nice bottle of Scotch.

860
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,800
Must have been hard to get.

861
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,265
Doubling the budget was nothing.

862
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,000
$10 million for covert ops is
meaningless for making a difference.

863
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,300
Now hang on just one second.
I don't remember your name.

864
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,409
- Gust Avrakotos.
- Gust Avrakotos.

865
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,190
Yeah.

866
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,200
You mind if I call you Gus?

867
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, my name is Gust, t,
but I don't care.

868
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,181
Fifteen hours ago, I offered
Harold Holt the keys to the safe.

869
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:31,500
- OK.

870
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,300
I stood there his office of his level 5 and
I said "how much do you need".

871
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,500
And Harold was apparently annoyed.

872
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,544
Well, Harold Holt is a
best tool, Congressman.

873
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,910
He's a cake eater, he's a
clown, he's a bad Station Chief

874
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:44,806
and I don't mean to cast
dispersions on a guy,

875
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,200
but he's going to get us all killed.

876
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,950
Really?

877
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:47,565
Yeah.

878
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,700
How does expect to defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan without...

879
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,565
He said a sudden influx of money...

880
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,100
Of course your money and
weaponry draw attention,

881
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,500
he's not trying to defeat
the Soviets, Congressman.

882
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,200
What the hell are you talking about?

883
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,100
Excuse me.

884
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,500
I'm the Congressman's aide, Bonnie Bach.

885
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,200
Gust Avrakotos.

886
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,200
Gus, I need a moment, please.
- Sure.

887
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,700
Girls.

888
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,100
Tell me what's happening.

889
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,205
A Justice Department task force that
was formed last year to investigate the

890
00:45:19,206 --> 00:45:21,610
reports of sex between Members of
the House and their male interns,

891
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,579
has recently widened to
increasing use of operational clout

892
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,140
by the Senators and Congressmen.

893
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,900
Do you know a man named Paul Brown?

894
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,810
Shit.

895
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,860
Paul Brown,
under investigation by federal prosecutors for fraud,

896
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,600
He wanted me to invest in TV show for Crystal.

897
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,400
He said that he had witnessed you
using cocaine nine times in Las Vegas.

898
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,900
According to the records.

899
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,365
Alright, guys.

900
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,800
I was in Las Vegas with
Crystal and Paul Brown,

901
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:51,400
because she wanted me to
talk to him about this thing.

902
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,300
No cocaine?

903
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,090
I want you to go in the other room
and start on a statement.

904
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,500
You two go start on the phone.

905
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,800
Alright everyone, it going to be alright.
Gus!

906
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,700
Some problem?

907
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,700
No.

908
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
What do you mean he's not
trying to defeat the Soviets?

909
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,700
Well, he wants to bleed them.

910
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,650
They'll be like Vietnam,
making them keep sending troops,

911
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,800
sending more money,
more troops, more money,

912
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,100
blow their fucking minds,
the way we did.

913
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,900
You mean to tell me that
US strategy in Afghanistan

914
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,213
is to have the Afghans keep
walking into machine gun fire,

915
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:24,509
until the Russian run out of bullets.

916
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,200
That's Harold Holt's strategy,
its not US strategy

917
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What is US strategy?

918
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,200
Well, strictly speaking, we don't have one,
but we're working hard on that.

919
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,000
Who's we?

920
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,800
Me and three other guys.

921
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,400
Would you excuse me?
Sure.

922
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,465
Alright, what do we have?

923
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,400
Representative Charles Wilson informed
he is joining several Members of Congress

924
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,890
who are under investigation by a
Justice Department task-force...

925
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,290
Remove "task-force",
it sounds like LA is running this thing.

926
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,000
Who is the prosecutor?

927
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,100
Rudolph Giulianni, the New York 7th District,
you know him?

928
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,565
No.

929
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,500
This has been going on forever.
We should say that too.

930
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,500
Representative Charles Wilson informed
he is joining several Members of Congress

931
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,900
who are under investigation by the
Justice Department,

932
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,228
for what is now an 18
month long wide-ranging

933
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:08,300
examination that has
resulted in no convictions.

934
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,118
Congressman Wilson has not
been charged with any crime

935
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,900
nor has he been questioned
by the authorities.

936
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,220
He denies any allegation of
illegal or improper behavior.

937
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:17,450
He said he would cooperate
with the ongoing investigation.

938
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Run it by Stu.

939
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,900
Yes sir.

940
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,300
Gus.

941
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,800
You and three other guys.

942
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,800
Yeah well...
I'll tell you what I know.

943
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,800
I can get the money, now.
If the $10 million is a joke,

944
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,000
fine, what do you need?

945
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,265
To do what?

946
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,600
Shoot down helicopters.
Shoot down helicopters.

947
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,700
We need to help them shoot down
the god damned helicopters.

948
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,500
Everything's going
to start going our way.

949
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,600
There's a story about a
Zen Master and a little boy.

950
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:47,601
Yeah.

951
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,100
It's Stu.

952
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,600
Oh, you should be in on this.

953
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,000
Stu?
No, no, everything's fine.

954
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,200
The party's in Vegas.
A lot of drugs, a lot of people I don't know.

955
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,400
And there was Crystal Lee,
and this guy, Paul Brown.

956
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:09,100
He wanted me to invest in a
TV show for Crystal.

957
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,565
I don't know.

958
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,300
I don't know, it was going to be
like a "Dallas" set in Washington.

959
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,200
Ok

960
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,000
Ok

961
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,800
Will Crystal back up your story
that you we're using?

962
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,000
Just go.

963
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,200
or I'll start.

964
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,600
Yeah right.

965
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,800
You should never been in
same room, Congressman.

966
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,500
Gus.

967
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,565
Yeah.

968
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,500
This Swiss mega anti-aircraft gun...

969
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,400
Listen, Charlie...

970
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,100
20 mm...

971
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,200
Don't forget the limo driver.

972
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,300
What limo?

973
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,446
Yeah, the limousine from the
casino to the airport maybe.

974
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:52,300
Its easy enough to
track that limo driver

975
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
and ask him what went
on in the back seat, so...

976
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,500
in terms of cleaning up this...

977
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,500
Were you listenin' at the door?

978
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,965
I wasn't listenin' at door.

979
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,400
Were you standing at the god
damned door listening to me? - No.

980
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,400
How could you even.... that's a thick door.

981
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,200
You stood there
and you listened to me.

982
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,700
That door don't mean anything,

983
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,700
I brought the scotch bottle.

984
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
What?

985
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,400
It's got a little transmitter on it and
I got a little thing in my ear, get past it

986
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,200
I don't believe this.

987
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,700
Who the fuck are you?

988
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,900
I got this thing in my ear right now,
take it easy.

989
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,300
I was gonna tell you about it,
when I left the room for a second while you being indited.

990
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,900
Is there a camera in here?

991
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,965
That's a little paranoid.

992
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Will could take the bug off my Scotch bottle now?

993
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:33,001
Sure.

994
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,100
I saw two kids,
they had their hands blown off,

995
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,670
while they were trying
to pick up something shiny.

996
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,400
Sometimes those kids
think those bombs are toys.

997
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,900
The children suffer.

998
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,565
Yeah.

999
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,900
And they're rapin' their women.
Yeah.

1000
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,600
Half of them pregnant.

1001
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,700
It's as bad as it can be..

1002
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,200
But they still want to go out
and fight the Red Army.

1003
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,899
Each and every one of them.
I've never had seen anything like it.

1004
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,500
Speaking of that,
let's be clear.

1005
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,300
I want to kill Russians
as much as you do.

1006
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,600
And the Swiss? The right weapon, it is what you want?

1007
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,700
You know what?
It's a long flight,

1008
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,500
you're under a lot of stress.
You need a rest.

1009
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,400
I don't need to rest.
You need a drink?

1010
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,700
Oh god, yeah.

1011
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,400
You ever try out this stuff,
you know does it release gas?

1012
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,000
I don't think so,
but open it over there.

1013
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,700
What's a guy like you doing at the Agency?

1014
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,700
You mean a street guy?

1015
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,865
You mean like James Bond.

1016
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,900
You ain't Thomas Jefferson,
so call it even.

1017
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,100
Not a big deal.

1018
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,400
the orders at the Bureau are still not very good at this.

1019
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,100
You ready to shoot down helicopters, Gus?

1020
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,400
We need at least 50 armor guns.

1021
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,150
That's going to cost a lot more than
10 million dollars.

1022
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm just sayin' for the fourth time,
I can find the money.

1023
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,365
How?

1024
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,650
Use the oil company.
be recommended

1025
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,100
I'm not sure.

1026
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,065
Who is sure?

1027
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,600
We have a weapons guy named Mike Vickors.

1028
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,850
I'll call him.
Let's call him right now.

1029
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,400
Here is a test.

1030
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,600
You see the nerdy looking kid in the white shirt,
playing against the four guys at once?

1031
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,265
Yeah.

1032
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,500
Which one of the guys do you
think is a strategic weapons expert with the CIA?

1033
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:24,501
Hmmm.

1034
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,000
That was a trick question, Charlie.
It's the nerdy looking kid in the white shirt.

1035
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,800
I just couldn't resist having fun.

1036
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,400
Mike.

1037
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,965
Just a second.

1038
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,200
We need you now, Mike.

1039
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,500
Checkmate.

1040
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,500
Mike Vickers, this is Congressman Charles Wilson

1041
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,300
with the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.

1042
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,800
How are you, sir?

1043
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,500
Fine, thank you.

1044
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,800
How old are you?

1045
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,065
I'll thirty next week.

1046
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,500
This is the CIA weapons expert?

1047
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:56,965
That's right.

1048
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,500
Well he's a little seedy.

1049
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,900
Mike!
Yeah, the Bishop to Queenside seven.

1050
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,600
See, he's not even looking at the board.

1051
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,000
That's beautiful skill.

1052
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,600
Afghanistan never more respect
Time to play chess during the war.

1053
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,100
Did my office did I not make it clear that
I am in no mood to be fucked around with!

1054
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,250
You answer to me,
you answer Jim Baker, which do you want?

1055
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,650
That's a fuckin' Green Beret, Charlie.

1056
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,400
He's trained with the Seals.
Nobody is trying to fuck with you.

1057
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,900
Mike?
Ready when you are.

1058
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,800
Knight to Queen's bishop five.

1059
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,000
Queen's to King's Rook three,
diagonal right, you don't wanna trade queens with me.

1060
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,600
Shit.

1061
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,250
Alright.
I apologise.

1062
00:52:31,035 --> 00:52:32,165
Ok

1063
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,165
Are we friends?

1064
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,100
As a former Naval Officer myself Mike,
I should have, I should have known better.

1065
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
As a former Naval Officer,
I'd be surprised if you had.

1066
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,400
Hey, what the fuck.
He said he was sorry.

1067
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,700
What can I do for you, sir?

1068
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
He wants to make a recommendation
to the subcommittee.

1069
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,400
Swiss made oil and exterior anterior aircraft cannon unfortunately
uses dolomite 2400 gunships in the mountains, right?

1070
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, it's a good start,
but the Russians will just start

1071
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,200
flying higher altitudes missions.

1072
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,600
So what else would they need?

1073
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:58,900
XP 170s, X174s, AMS.

1074
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,800
Soviets didn't come to
Afghanistan on a Euro-Rail pass.

1075
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,400
They've come in P-55 tanks.

1076
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,480
The Burgers need RPG-7
anti-tank grenade launchers,

1077
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:07,600
A condition 170mm rockets, wire mines,

1078
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,900
plastic mines, bicycle bombs, starky weapons,

1079
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,100
ammunition for all of the above.

1080
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,102
Frequency hopping radios
and burst transmitters,

1081
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:14,500
these are not going to be easy to find.

1082
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,000
You can read it all in a report that I made,
you'll be the first one that did.

1083
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,900
Send a copy over to me
by courier right away.

1084
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,600
Alright.

1085
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,365
That was a report?

1086
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,900
It's not that simple.

1087
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,965
Why not?

1088
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,400
Well, one thing it's covert,

1089
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,940
An Afghan Freedom Fighter gets captured

1090
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:37,590
it can't be with an
American made weapon on him,

1091
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,700
that's how a Cold War
turns into an actual war,

1092
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,500
not somethin' you want to keep a lid on.

1093
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,229
So, anything we
give 'em has to look like  it

1094
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,400
could have possibly been
captured from the Soviets.

1095
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,065
That's right.

1096
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,200
You know who's good at that?

1097
00:53:49,235 --> 00:53:50,517
The      .

1098
00:53:50,552 --> 00:53:51,800
That' right.

1099
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,300
What he just described there costs
as much as $40 million.

1100
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,100
I can get the appropriate...

1101
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,800
How?

1102
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,076
I wanna know how you are
going to get the approval

1103
00:54:02,077 --> 00:54:04,300
of Congress from the city
noted accomplished for nothin',

1104
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
for five million dollars
requested by the President?

1105
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,696
When a blanket vote makes
it through the subcommittee,

1106
00:54:09,697 --> 00:54:11,200
the full body has to vote on it blind.

1107
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,800
They know the dollar amount,
but they don't know what it's for.

1108
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,100
So theoretically, your $10 million
can become $40 million,

1109
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,800
without anyone ever noticing
but the Russian Army.

1110
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,100
Most Congressmen wouldn't
know they voted on it.

1111
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
That's the beauty of it.

1112
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,190
How do you get it by the nine
other sub-committee members.

1113
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,700
All I need to get is
the Committee Chairman.

1114
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,110
Doc Long.

1115
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,400
He darts back in and gets the votes
of the other committee members.

1116
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,285
Yep.
I don't believe you.

1117
00:54:33,286 --> 00:54:33,900
I don't care.

1118
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,900
Up until the phone rang this morning,
Charlie, I never heard of you.

1119
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,300
Well, ask away.

1120
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,965
I did.

1121
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,065
What'd you find out?

1122
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,400
That you've had slim achievements in six terms,
and you been re-elected five times.

1123
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,665
Anything else?

1124
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,600
That you hold more IOU's than
any member of the House.

1125
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,900
How about that.

1126
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,800
I represent the only district in America
that's got one candidate.

1127
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,400
They want their guns,
and they want no taxes.

1128
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,765
That's it.

1129
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,900
I can do favors.

1130
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:01,000
I get to vote yes a lot.

1131
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,000
Me and three other guy
are killing Russians.

1132
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,400
Is it possible, that I've got the only
elected official in town that can help?

1133
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,700
Give me a week to set things up.
No backup plan.

1134
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,000
I have a friend.
???

1135
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,300
He's what we need for this,
God help us.

1136
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,100
Should be interesting.

1137
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,700
Yeah.

1138
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,100
Alright.

1139
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,600
We need you.

1140
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,600
You would be our man for

1141
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,600
I am not part of anything yet.

1142
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,700
That's what makes you so perfect.

1143
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,600
No one has     will bother you.

1144
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,100
No one has to know of your
relationship with the speaker.

1145
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,900
We need to turn around,
Seeing everything that happens   it turns out.

1146
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,800
But we will working with the Saudi's.

1147
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,865
Careful...

1148
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,900
Careful, what do you mean?

1149
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,800
I'm not sayin' anything.

1150
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,765
Why not?

1151
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,400
I don't like these two other guys over there.

1152
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,800
Oh, are they bodyguards?

1153
00:55:57,835 --> 00:55:58,700
There're not ours.

1154
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:00,711
(speaks Hebrew)

1155
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,500
I'll just tell you something and I'll shut up.

1156
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,350
Do you want me to move Israel

1157
00:56:09,351 --> 00:56:14,350
toward a partnership with
Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan?

1158
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,400
And Saudi Arabia.

1159
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,900
Well, just a couple of problems I can foresee,
off the top of my head.

1160
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,300
Look...

1161
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,100
Charlie, Pakistan and Afghanistan don't
recognize our right to exist.

1162
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,400
Calm down.

1163
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,900
We just got back from
fighting a war with Egypt,

1164
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,500
and every person who has ever tried
kill me and my family

1165
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,700
has been trained in Saudi Arabia!

1166
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,400
That's not entirely true, Zvi.

1167
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,400
Some were trained by us.

1168
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,870
Zvi, Gust's sense of humor
is really quite bizarre.

1169
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,790
Zvi, we're gonna miss...
this front of the Cold War,

1170
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,800
it's not in Berlin, it's not in Cuba,
it's not in Czechoslovakia.

1171
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,410
It's in a pile of rocks called Afghanistan.

1172
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,500
These are the only people
who actually shoot at the Russians,

1173
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,500
and you and I know we have
to get Soviet made weapons

1174
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:05,500
into the hands of the Mujahideen.

1175
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,499
You and I know where
the largest stockpile

1176
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,310
of Soviet weapons
outside Soviet Union is.

1177
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,600
I can't say what kind of armaments and
what kind of weapons are confiscated.

1178
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,500
I can.

1179
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,900
These are uh... TL-11 satellite photos.

1180
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
They've been degraded
so I can show 'em to you.

1181
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,400
That's a five wheel chassis tank.

1182
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,600
That's not an MK-1,
it's a T-55.

1183
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,000
Four of those are about 12 miles from here.

1184
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,800
What do you want tanks
in the mountains for?

1185
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,700
We don't, I just wanted you to know
I know what you have.

1186
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,300
and $4.5 million.

1187
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,600
This you can appropriate?

1188
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,600
Yes.

1189
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,600
Without the press asking questions about it.

1190
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,720
Well there's good news there,

1191
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,000
because the press will
be busy asking him about

1192
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,300
a week in Vegas and his pending arrest
on charges of narcotics possession.

1193
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Oh, Gust.

1194
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,100
Shit! Charlie?

1195
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:52,700
It's nothin'.

1196
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:53,565
Is this true?

1197
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,900
It doesn't really matter.
- Why?

1198
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,129
I'll just explain no matter what, as long as the
pressing section goes to be on the left hand,

1199
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,300
the department burial carrier will be on the
right hand, no one's going to fuckin' notice.

1200
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,865
What the hell happened?

1201
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,200
It's not germane, what's germane is these people
are fighting and they're dying

1202
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,600
and are being massacred in their own homes.

1203
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
Now, for the love of Christ,

1204
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,000
will you help us help them shoot down
these fuckin' helicopters?

1205
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,800
I love you, Charlie.

1206
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,300
But you are grown man who
still hasn't learned to look both ways

1207
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,100
before he crosses the fucking street.

1208
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Yes, I'm in.
Good!

1209
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,300
But I don't like this guy.

1210
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I know how you feel.

1211
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,500
What happens now?

1212
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,000
You come with us to Cairo.

1213
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,300
This meeting is going to be
a lot of professionals.

1214
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,205
Oh absolutely, we'll be talking to a

1215
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:52,499
Deputy Defense Minister while his boss is with
a belly dancer that's a friend of Charley's.

1216
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,400
What?

1217
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,600
A good friend mine from Unita, Texas
is a well known belly dancer

1218
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,700
so it's been agreed to perform in Egypt,
so she's over there.

1219
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,400
While she's dancing for the Defense Minister,
we'll be talking to the Deputy.

1220
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,800
Oh, my God!

1221
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,100
Yeah, she's supposed to be good.

1222
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,700
She's an extraordinary woman.

1223
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,600
She dances very well.

1224
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,800
That's why I wanted the
Defense Minister to see her.

1225
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,400
This is your girlfriend?

1226
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,000
No, she's a friend.

1227
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,600
I understand that her father wouldn't
allow dancing because of their religion.

1228
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,100
Yeah, that's correct.

1229
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,200
What religion is that?

1230
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,100
Baptists.

1231
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:15,100
As I was saying,
the Russians observed an important thing the hard way.

1232
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,900
To fear God's vengeance upon those

1233
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,635
who oppress Islamic servants
to submit to his law,

1234
01:00:21,636 --> 01:00:24,699
their sculls were
hanging from the treetops.

1235
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,200
You can do whatever you want
with the sculls, I suppose.

1236
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,000
But as Gust's concern is the SA-7 Sierra missiles y'all have,

1237
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,300
for some reason he thinks they're a scoring problem.

1238
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,500
No, no, no.

1239
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,600
SA-7's will score properly.

1240
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,800
What about the oppression by my people?

1241
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:44,201
Oh, Zvi.

1242
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,600
I beg your pardon?

1243
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,000
Do we have to do this now?

1244
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,499
I am about to arrange for probably
$5 million worth of guns to be put

1245
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,400
into the hands of Muslims.

1246
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,300
I meant no disrespect.

1247
01:00:54,335 --> 01:00:56,065
Oh, really?

1248
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, none of that's important.

1249
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,600
The Soviets have arranged five years ago
to have moved 25,000 a week.

1250
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,300
That's correct.

1251
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,000
What about an incinderary device?

1252
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,500
What kind?

1253
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,700
Bicycle bombs, mines, plastics,
trip wire mines.

1254
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,265
Yes.

1255
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,600
Whatever you need.

1256
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,500
We can't give triple pricing now

1257
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,700
We when get back from
home we'll make it up to you.

1258
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,000
I agree.

1259
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,200
Alright.

1260
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,500
Hey, when you get back there,
I'm orderin' the shift.

1261
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,400
'cause these people are totally fuckin' use cold.

1262
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,500
And I'm not just talking about the Muslims.

1263
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,900
It's alright.

1264
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,600
I know it is.

1265
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,700
The Mousaad by the way, to talk about your friend in Houston.

1266
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,000
He has many reasons for not wanting
That the press knows it.

1267
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,500
Joanne is reasonably discreet.

1268
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,900
Uh, she's usin' a....
non-secular vocabulary.

1269
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,200
I fear that it does not know
plenty of reasons for this war.

1270
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,100
Americans don't fight in religious wars.

1271
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,765
Is that right.

1272
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,600
Yeah, that's what I like about America.

1273
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,300
Ladies and gentlemen this is your Captain.

1274
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,400
we have started our descent
landing in Washington ...

1275
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,800
I am going to Houston,
and then ...

1276
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,600
Talk to her.

1277
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,200
Yes, I come with it.

1278
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,200
You want me to go into
business with the Israelis?

1279
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,400
Just for this one purpose,
yes Mr. President.

1280
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,950
The Israelis have the largest stockpile of
Soviet made weapons in the free land.

1281
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,600
Yes, I know that.

1282
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,200
I have to transact this in secret.

1283
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,300
Pakistan and Israel have been
public enemies for a long time.

1284
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,800
Yeah, but I don't think that's a tough sell.

1285
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,600
You have authority to do this?

1286
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,099
No, I'm just getting the weapon, and I'm pretty close to that.  I need to get by the Voting Act.

1287
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,700
I don't know that is...

1288
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,609
But Charlie...
Yes.

1289
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,350
If I see one fucking start ?  I'll give a  ?   .

1290
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,500
You're welcome.
We're very close.

1291
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,200
Excuse me.

1292
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,900
Whether I make the speech?

1293
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,000
Why?

1294
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,800
It is an option. Not want?

1295
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,700
It's an introduction, Charlie.
I'll be fine.

1296
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,300
Today, we honor President Zia Ul-Haq of Pakistan.

1297
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,900
Before we go any further,
I would like y'all to hear this.

1298
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,500
President Zia did not kill Butto.

1299
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,400
His entire message has been refreshing,
all things in Pakistan

1300
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,200
has changed, radically.

1301
01:03:57,235 --> 01:03:58,500
I asked you all here today...

1302
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You disappeared.

1303
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,800
You weren't serving alcohol.

1304
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,900
It's a condition of
of Pakistan values

1305
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,400
You had to do this, with all these people,
Under one roof at the same time?

1306
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,100
I think I felt happy to
Say what we had to say.

1307
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,300
Zia did not kill Butto.

1308
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,300
That's not something you commonly hear in a introduction

1309
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,600
He didn't do it, Charlie.
Butto had a trial and was found guilty.

1310
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,300
He was shot in front of the ?.

1311
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,300
What are you talking about?

1312
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,600
Enjoy the moment.
a trial down was.

1313
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,065
What?

1314
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,100
We can not divest the
people who support me.

1315
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,300
It's lunches like this that are
raising the money we need.

1316
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,100
That wasn't done by people
Which were in Houston.

1317
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,900
This was done by the CIA.

1318
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,500
It's being done in Pakistan,
and it's going to get done quietly.

1319
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,275
And you start makin' people think

1320
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:02,600
we're trying to convert
everybody to Christianity...

1321
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,500
I'm saved by Jesus Christ, Charlie,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

1322
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,800
My point is, this is not about religion,
it's about freedom of religion.

1323
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,500
We have they want the communist's scarin' them for.

1324
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,600
And I     Not understood.

1325
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,800
Just tamp it down a little.

1326
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,900
I can't watch this against God's will, sweetie.

1327
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,800
You can try.

1328
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,400
I gotta get back to DC,
they've set up a briefing for me at Langley.

1329
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:26,800
On what?

1330
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,400
About gettin' the guns.

1331
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,900
Afghanistan's barely a country.

1332
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,100
No phones or roads outside the cities.

1333
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,700
It's like met a villager can pass
Long without contact

1334
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,700
With another, 5 km away,
Even without the war.

1335
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:45,800
I believe they are divided into
Hundreds of small militias

1336
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,400
Totaling about 150,000.

1337
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,400
These guys have been training.  Twenty different wars since    World War I
And it has the ability to sustain a war long.

1338
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,000
Do you have anyone in mind?

1339
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,199
The most successful rebels today are in the Panjshir Valley.

1340
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,799
They're called the United Fronts,
or the Council of the North.

1341
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,115
We're locked in for
$10 million in weapons

1342
01:06:02,116 --> 01:06:04,700
and ten to fifteen Agency
advisers to train them.

1343
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
Who's their leader?

1344
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,000
Akmed Shamasud.

1345
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,500
He is Tajik so he's not well liked Pashtuns.

1346
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,500
So then, what?
The Tajiks have a problem with the Pashtuns?

1347
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,700
They say when a Tajik wants to make love

1348
01:06:16,735 --> 01:06:19,700
to a woman, her first choice is always a Pashtun man.

1349
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,400
It's fun in the original languagmane.

1350
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,500
Well, it is enough.

1351
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
I will take care of my part.

1352
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,700
Don't fuck us up now.

1353
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,100
I think not.

1354
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,100
Afghanistan, Egypt,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia

1355
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,200
These are from the dictator list.

1356
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,655
And they'd like to
blow the only democracy

1357
01:06:41,656 --> 01:06:43,900
in the region right
into the Mediteranean.

1358
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,300
The Israelis will be with us.

1359
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,900
Well, Zvi Rafiah is crazy.

1360
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:54,600
These people are extremists.
Among Communists
And fundamentalists, if they settle

1361
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,900
Be killed, the better. It is a public service
They do the rest of the world.

1362
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,500
You're wrong about that, Doc
and you know      that's not so.

1363
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,200
In Pakistan, a blind girl gets raped,

1364
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,400
but there's a witness.

1365
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,600
Now, in Pakistan it takes four witnesses,
so the rape is thrown way and

1366
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,000
The girl was arrested. Can you tell me why?

1367
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,900
Fornication.

1368
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,600
That's right.

1369
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:19,900
Mr. Chairman of them is the only assume that
The risks of train and fund the Mujahideen.

1370
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,100
While Egypt and Arabia ...

1371
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,800
The Saudis ask some funding
To Congress?

1372
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:24,600
Exactly.

1373
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,700
So the $40 million that you asked,
Will be 80.

1374
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,800
$40 million to us.

1375
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,600
You want to put 80 million dollars
in the hands of these people?

1376
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,400
Doc, if you were me up there,
You would stop talking about "these people".

1377
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,400
They are farmers and children.

1378
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,300
And face the enemy forces.

1379
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,800
It is a great opportunity for America.

1380
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,800
And how is an opportunity for America

1381
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,500
Send help to these children, and
For the mothers of our enemies.

1382
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,300
All you have to do to change things is
to support me in the committees.

1383
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,100
I'm sorry Charlie,
but doubling from five to ten million is one thing,

1384
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,400
You know, I just can't get behind this.

1385
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,200
Joanne Herring's residence.

1386
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,500
Ms. Herring,
I have Congressman Wilson for you.

1387
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,250
Hello.

1388
01:08:10,285 --> 01:08:11,165
Hey.

1389
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,100
Tell me what's happening.

1390
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,300
Well, I need Doc Long,
and he's not gettin' on board.

1391
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,400
Now, he's a church goin' guy,

1392
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,200
So now I need ...

1393
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,300
So now you need God.

1394
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,700
Yeah.
Let me give you his private line.

1395
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:24,400
I've got it.

1396
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,000
Trish.
Yes Miss.

1397
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,500
Hey, that's a nice sweater.

1398
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,265
Oh, thank you.

1399
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,199
Uh, the Washington Times wants to know
if you have ever been in rehab.

1400
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,200
and what are you going to tell them?

1401
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,700
That you don't go to rehab cause
they won't serve liquor there.

1402
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,900
That's why you're the best secretary, Boo-boo.

1403
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,300
I got Stu on the line,
can you talk to him?

1404
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,300
Hey Stu, how you doin' today?

1405
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,665
Alright.

1406
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,700
She's not a stripper, Stu.
She just posed for the cover.

1407
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,400
What the hell difference does it make?
They talked to Crystal.

1408
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,200
Yeah.

1409
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,300
Giulliani's been talkin' to the limo driver.

1410
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,000
That's what Gust said they would do.

1411
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,200
But the driver said he didn't see anything.

1412
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,600
He didn't see anything.

1413
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,800
So Giuliani's been giving every
limo driver between the Audosy

1414
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,000
and Silver Springs to see if any of them
can recall seeing you using cocaine.

1415
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Joanne Herring on the line.

1416
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,765
Hey you.

1417
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,900
We're on again in the morning.

1418
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
You're kidding?

1419
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:21,065
No.

1420
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,800
What'd you have to promise him?

1421
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,600
There's a blind girl in Jail, she was raped.
Yeah.

1422
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,500
You're gonna get her out.

1423
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,200
What, I gotta bust somebody out of jail?

1424
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,823
Don't be stupid, Charlie.
You're gonna tell Zia to pardon her.

1425
01:09:32,824 --> 01:09:33,799
It's Doc's condition.

1426
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,700
Our flight's tonight, buy me a drink.

1427
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,800
Yes ma'am.

1428
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:38,800
We are almost there, Charlie.

1429
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,700
I'm goin' back to Pakistan tomorrow.

1430
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,500
Whoo!

1431
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,800
Charlie!
- Thanks.

1432
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,100
We need another round.

1433
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,100
Hey, Joanne. Can I join you?

1434
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,100
Yes.

1435
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,000
You have to wear so
More humble when at the border.

1436
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,394
Well, thank you, but I been
passonatley involved in the cause

1437
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:24,699
of Afghans for three years,
I've been there many times.

1438
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,700
I tell you what,
I'll just go fuck myself.

1439
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,200
I'm not easily shocked, Mr. Avrakotos.

1440
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,400
Did you know you were acertariam fast.

1441
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,600
Charlie, sorry.

1442
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,100
Stu on the phone for you.

1443
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,500
You can take it at the bar.

1444
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,500
Stu? That can't be any good.

1445
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,930
How'd you hook up with Charlie?

1446
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:48,190
Are you also passonately invloved
in the cause of the Afghans?

1447
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,600
Naw, I just delay  to do anything else

1448
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,400
I mean, how did you get into the CIA?

1449
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,700
I didn't.
I'm with the Department of Agriculture.

1450
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,600
Division of food and plants.

1451
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,100
The apple imports.

1452
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,700
You don't seem like the apple type.

1453
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,600
Yeah, I know.

1454
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,300
It wasn't me.

1455
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,100
Where you are from?

1456
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,000
What do you care?

1457
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:09,900
Are you a Catholic?

1458
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,700
Greek-Orthodox.

1459
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,200
At least you're a Christian.

1460
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,800
Imagine my relief.

1461
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,200
What's your problem with me?

1462
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,200
What I've found in my business,
is that people with time on their hands get involved with politics

1463
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,500
I start forgetting who I'm supposed to be shootin' at.

1464
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,700
That being the apple import business.

1465
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,465
Yes ma'am.

1466
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,100
I have to remember that.
Please do.

1467
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,600
It's Over!

1468
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,265
It's Over!

1469
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,400
It's over!  That was Stu and it is over!.

1470
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,489
Has Crystal framed you?
Well, she's witnessed been doin' coke in the Cayman Islands.

1471
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,700
Oh shit, Charlie.

1472
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
No it's alright.
It's out of the Justice Department's juristiction.

1473
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,700
It's over!

1474
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,700
I'm goin'  home.

1475
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,140
Gust.

1476
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:58,239
Joanne... the most
important trip in my life,

1477
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,200
see you in the morning,
get plenty of sleep,

1478
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,600
I'm goin' home.

1479
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,800
Mario, take me.

1480
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,665
Yes, Mr.

1481
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,300
He may be in trouble with the press, but he's staying out of jail.
And is out of the chain, now,

1482
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,400
And you ve not the hand of God in this?

1483
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,200
Some people will disagree with me, but
I see God kilometers of the story.

1484
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,100
Moreover, if you sleep me,
Assure that try to change their minds.

1485
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,700
Oh, you change.

1486
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,100
I'll see you on the plane.

1487
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:37,800
Sluts.

1488
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,400
Ponham beyond that.

1489
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,200
Doc's eatin' this up.

1490
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,100
We're gonna get the money.

1491
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:07,700
Charlie!

1492
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:10,900
Charlie!

1493
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,700
He's a little senile.
Don't be silly.

1494
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,000
He's chairs the subcommittee.
Alright.

1495
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,100
Charlie, Joanne, this certainly has
been an eye opening experience.

1496
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,450
It's absolutley stunning.

1497
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,100
How'd you pull this off, Mr. Ar.....

1498
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Conte.

1499
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,100
They only to go back there and fight.

1500
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
and you're their savior, Mr. Chairman.

1501
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,300
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

1502
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,700
Look now.
She loves it.

1503
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,400
These people were expecting you.

1504
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,800
They're sitting here, and bleedin',
and waitin' and prayin' for you.

1505
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,700
It's only gonna be a man like you
that can save them.

1506
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,100
We know don't we?

1507
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,900
About our men.
What we are able to do when you want.

1508
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,000
Charlie, I think they want
you to make some comments.

1509
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,500
No, you should do it Mr. Chairman.

1510
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,000
This people have been
waiting a long time for this.

1511
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,800
Show them you're     you can do it.
Show your wife.

1512
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,500
I feel a little emotional right now.

1513
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,800
Show them.

1514
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,000
You can do it.

1515
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,000
Alright.

1516
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,000
Good job, buys.

1517
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,100
No, this is great.
It is a great move.

1518
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,800
My friends.

1519
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,500
My son served in Vietnam.

1520
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,200
He was wounded fighting and got a medal

1521
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,900
against the Soviet oppressors.

1522
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,100
I didn't know about the child.

1523
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,700
So you see, I am not so strange ...

1524
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,800
I am no stranger to

1525
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,700
the horrors and atrocities
of the communists.

1526
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,000
I you talk about God, for
A simple reason.

1527
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,600
We need him on our side.

1528
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,000
These Russian weapons, every last one of them

1529
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,000
... We explodi them to
Far from here!

1530
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,800
Summer that we will give them weapons.
Summer we going training.

1531
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,100
I believe that the word of God are:

1532
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,100
"Sooner or later, God can't be on both sides "

1533
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,000
This is the good against evil

1534
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,700
and I want you to know that the America
is always going to on the side of good.

1535
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,000
And God will always punish the wicked.

1536
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,700
It has been a year of setback and frustration.

1537
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,800
And the Soviet army, more than at any time,
Want to win this war soon.

1538
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,565
Now, it's offensive.

1539
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,700
The Mujahideen attack and retreat.

1540
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,300
The Afghan resistance, which has
been stimulated by the United States

1541
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:48,600
but although the support has not been
translated into military hardware.

1542
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,500
The guerrillas still claim to be using
the AK 47 ...

1543
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,400
... But it has not been enough.
They have waited in vain ...

1544
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,800
... For modern weapons, to
fight the Red Army.

1545
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,400
The guerrillas survive and hope.

1546
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,100
The Soviet armed forces
Increased the bombing in the war.

1547
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,800
The Soviets send more
troops and equipment back in.

1548
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,800
Commie bastards.

1549
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,900
We'll send them drugs and medicine.
in giving weapons to continue shooting.

1550
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,700
It's called Milan anti-tank missille

1551
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,500
Can the Afghans win without it?

1552
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,600
No.

1553
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,800
End of discussion.

1554
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:47,400
... I submit a request to increase
At $30 million, totaling $70 million.

1555
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,400
I present the Milan anti-tank Missile

1556
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,900
We've got 300 in the field.

1557
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,000
Let's kill some Russians!

1558
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,200
Voting for the increase in the allocation for the Afghans is
The only way to prove that our support is serious.

1559
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,900
How much are you asking for this?

1560
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,497
I want to go from $70
million to $100 million,

1561
01:18:19,498 --> 01:18:22,200
and if you vote for me, I
can deliver the electronics.

1562
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,200
Something in the sky?

1563
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,100
... I asked what the reason.
How had arrived by then?

1564
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,200
I swear, like a face durão.

1565
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,500
... This is the group of Bamian.
They will make Fuladi ambush on the bridge.

1566
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,200
What will take?

1567
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,500
4 truckloads of supplies, which
Go to the Bagram Air Base.

1568
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,400
They will set the 8 th Infantry
Soviet, the horse?

1569
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,700
You betcha.

1570
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,100
These guys are very good.

1571
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,500
We can't control this anymore.

1572
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,500
The guy was in my office,
Islamabad, and I said to him ...

1573
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,100
... That the flow of money and weapons ...

1574
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,500
Me give that belt.
Please.

1575
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,700
How is it possible that this Congressman,
of no particular importance,

1576
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,800
is doing this by himself.

1577
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,900
Admittedly, it is not impressive.

1578
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,100
This is a war that we are fighting, Henry?

1579
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,700
Harold, sejá there what he is doing,
Believe me

1580
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,650
The CIA estimates that seven out evry ten times,
The increase ...

1581
01:23:19,685 --> 01:23:24,300
The attacks of the Mujahideen
Helicopters and airplanes.

1582
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,300
Each ship costs Soviet
20 million dollars ...

1583
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,400
As each missile costs
Between 60 and 70 thousand.

1584
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,900
What do you want to do?

1585
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,700
Well, I want to double the $250 million.

1586
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,400
I remember again:
They started with?

1587
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,000
$5 million.

1588
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,365
Hello.

1589
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,300
Is this Mrs. Joanne Herring?

1590
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,800
Where's it at, Charlie?

1591
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,500
How was the honeymoon?

1592
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,600
He already had a vision of you naked?

1593
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,500
Where's is it at, Charlie?

1594
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,300
$500 million.

1595
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,700
The same the Saudis.

1596
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,000
1 billion dollars.

1597
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,700
That same. One Billion.
We will have.

1598
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:14,700
When this was related
A secret war?

1599
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,200
There has never been anything like this.

1600
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,600
Since when?

1601
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,100
Always.

1602
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,000
I miss you, Charlie.

1603
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,800
Ah, Joanne, I miss you too.

1604
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,400
I'd better go.

1605
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,600
I could not go wrong.

1606
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,700
I said, it was only see the candidate on the other side ...

1607
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,600
To know who spoke the truth!

1608
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,000
What was?

1609
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,665
Go ahead, Gust?

1610
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,800
Congratulations on your re-election.

1611
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,700
Thanks. What do you have again?

1612
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,600
Uh, Doc Long still losing.

1613
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,700
Yes, we have imagined.

1614
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,500
So now, who's your man now?

1615
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,100
John Martha.

1616
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:11,800
You sure?

1617
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,050
Yep.

1618
01:25:13,085 --> 01:25:14,200
Why?

1619
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,400
I voted on it,
on the Ethics Committee.

1620
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,000
you're very, very   Congressman.

1621
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,300
Call me tomorrow morning at high noon.

1622
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,200
I will. Love ya.

1623
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,700
We presenteamos with this weapon.

1624
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,800
There was wild joy inside the country of Afghanistan

1625
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:54,050
After that, last week, they
became the first country in history to defeat

1626
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,800
the mighty Soviet Union.

1627
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,500
The retreat of Soviet military power
from Afghanistan is complete.

1628
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,200
The last Regular Army conventional force is out.

1629
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:09,100
With a mix of relief and happiness,
Soviet command announced ...

1630
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,200
That the last troops crossed
The border. Our correspondent, Direct

1631
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,100
Afghanistan, Barry Peterson,
Continues with the coverage.

1632
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,500
It was the last celebration. The latest
Soviet troops crossing

1633
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,400
crossing the Friendship Bridge on the border
between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.

1634
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,000
See what you did, Charlie.

1635
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,700
Hey, hey.  It's traditional to make a toast at a banquet   if offered
A toast in wins.

1636
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,300
Gust, your honor.

1637
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:36,400
Ok

1638
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,200
Well,

1639
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,600
Here's to you, motherfuckers.

1640
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,600
"And so now the Soviet military intervention
in other countries is now over."

1641
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,200
Well, I you spoke.

1642
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,600
He spoke what?

1643
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,400
All I needed to do was shoot down a helicopter.

1644
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,800
Hum It is not for nothing, but I finished
To tell the story of the teacher and the boy?

1645
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:14,000
In the great witch Nitsa, Pennsylvania?

1646
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,200
It is, indeed it is.

1647
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,700
There was a boy who in his birthday
14 years, won a horse.

1648
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,700
And everybody said: - "What wonder,
He won a horse. "

1649
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,100
The teacher told him: - "Let's see."

1650
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,900
Two years later, the boy falls off his horse, and breaks his leg,

1651
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,500
And everyone said: - "What terrible."
The teacher said: - "Let's see."

1652
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,900
Then a war started, and
All were called to the fight,

1653
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,400
Except for the boy because his leg
Was broken,

1654
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,100
And people said: - "What great."

1655
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,800
And the teacher said: - "Let's see."

1656
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,100
Then you get it?

1657
01:27:47,135 --> 01:27:48,500
No. No.

1658
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,800
Because I am a donkey.

1659
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,700
You are not a donkey, only
Is in the Congress.

1660
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,665
Send more money.

1661
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,100
Open roads, build schools ...

1662
01:27:55,135 --> 01:27:56,400
Gust, today is a party.

1663
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,600
Reeducar the pastors, give them
Work, give them hope ...

1664
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,600
I am trying.
-- Try more.

1665
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,900
I mourn for every dollar.

1666
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,300
I took you to U $ 5 million to
U $ 1 billion.

1667
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,265
I quebrei the ice with
The zac(ite-antitanque

1668
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,500
I am a Democrat MEP, which
It is controlled by a Republican president

1669
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,465
And I don't sirvo why I
Secret agent and you now

1670
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:18,200
Is a hero that saw a mad on TV,
In Kandahar, in his hot tub.

1671
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,300
My God, Gust, you know the depressed
When people fill their faces.

1672
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,700
Hey, listen to what I am speaking!

1673
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:49,900
You did a great job, so
A son, pipoqueiro.

1674
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:53,100
Let's see.

1675
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,800
He said the teacher.

1676
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,500
One million dollars for the
Reconstruction of schools?

1677
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,900
Oh, that shit, Charlie!

1678
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:14,800
Hey, I listen ...

1679
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,700
You are not a member of Kabul.

1680
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,600
You heard me say it was 1 million,
Or 1 billion for the reconstruction of schools?

1681
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,900
Heard. Everyone heard since
The delta of Delaware.

1682
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,800
I hope you have not angry, Bob,
Because it is the last thing I want to do.

1683
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,100
Look, I was with the President in
Roosevelt Room last week ...

1684
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,100
You know what he said?

1685
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,000
He said that Afghanistan must
Move forward.

1686
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,000
Well, so has to be.

1687
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,500
Half the population is under 14 years ..
-- Charlie!

1688
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:42,300
Half of the population is under 14 years.

1689
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,800
Now, think how much this is dangerous.
They will return to their homes and

1690
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,100
Their families are killed,
Their villages were burned ...

1691
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,100
Yes, but the help kill
The guys who did this.

1692
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,100
Yes, but they don't know, Bob. Why
They don't get the New York Times,

1693
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,300
And even if we receive it
Was secret, remember?

1694
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,200
This is what we always do.
We come with our ideals,

1695
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,300
Change the world! And
Then we will leave.

1696
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,500
Whenever we leave.

1697
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,300
But the ball still rolling.

1698
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,065
How?

1699
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,300
The ball! Continued rolling.

1700
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,900
We are now half occupied, reoganizando
The East European, you don't think?

1701
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:21,700
We spend billions. Gastemos a few
Million of the budget now, building schools.

1702
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,800
Charlie, nobody gives anything for a
School in Pakistan.

1703
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,700
Afghanistan.

1704
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,800
So for the first time, one civilian
Receive our highest decoration,

1705
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,200
The honour of his colleagues,

1706
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,700
Ladies and gentlemen of Services
Foreign Affairs, Mr Charles Wilson.

1707
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:55,800
"These things happened. Were
Glorious and changed the world ...

1708
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,600
... And we fodemos them at the end of the game. "

1709
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:03,601
