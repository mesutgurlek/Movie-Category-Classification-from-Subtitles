MARCUS: Tuck ass.

1233
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,028
I got my rights.

1234
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:41,573
I'm worried. There's too much heat
around in Miami.

1235
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:44,659
I can feel it. I can feel it.

1236
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,706
We need to put my money
in coffins to Cuba faster.

1237
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,043
You should tell the mortuary
to speed things up. All right?

1239

That's the channel marker way out there.

1240
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:09,476
They make the drop mostly at dawn,
but there'll be one today, though.

1241
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:17,859
Syd, you talk to Mama? She's got hives.

1242
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,654
Oh, and I told Mama
about your Cubano boyfriend.

1243
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,573
He ain't invited to Christmas dinner.

1244
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,743
Change the station.
More music, less Marcus.

1245
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:31,873
If you open the door, he'll be a black
Dr. Phil for the next 40 minutes.

1246
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,169
Syd, you might not want
to get too flirty with Mike.

1247
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:39,381
Your boyfriend might
cut off his trigger finger.

1248
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,135
Maybe Mike's been flirting with me.
Did you ever think about that?

1249
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:46,596
Ooh. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

1250
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:48,139
Ha! Trigger Mike?

1251
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:50,433
MIKE:
Not like this. Don't play with that boy.

1252
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:53,812
- Seriously. Don't play with that boy.
- Just tell him about New York.

1253
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,688
- Do it.
- Tell me what?

1254
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,941
MIKE: Oh, shit. Is he
walking down the steps?

1255
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:01,236
Oh, shit. He coming down.

1256
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:04,114
- It's okay.
- Yeah, you done fucked up.

1257
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:05,782
You done fucked up.

1258
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:09,244
Um, you remember...

1259
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,246
Remember I went to New York?
You remember?

1260
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:13,415
And...

1261
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,208
I said, "Syd."

1262
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:16,876
I ran in...

1263
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,630
Syd ran into me in New York
on the street in that place.

1264
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,715
And I said:

1265
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:24,217
"What's up?"

1266
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:27,262
And we was hungry, so then...

1267
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,806
she had fish.

1268
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:32,851
It was grouper.

1269
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,895
And then I had some chicken.

1270
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:40,775
Remember I was supposed
to come home? But I didn't.

1271
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,069
We went out on a date.

1272
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:47,031
Five, actually.
Now we're seeing each other.

1273
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:49,909
Hold up.

1274
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:53,997
You know, really out of respect for you,
Marcus, you know, nothing happened.

1275
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,250
Hey, Mike, why you tripping, man?

1276
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,836
I mean, we wanted to make sure
you was cool with it.

1277
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:03,756
Doesn't matter what I think, you know.
Hey, I had to find out like this, right?

1278
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,175
Don't matter.

1279
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:08,678
Let me ask you a question, y'all gonna
have babies? Little bunch of mini Mikes?

1280
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:11,598
Huh? Bunch of little lying,
violent motherfuckers?

1281
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,600
Marcus, nothing happened.

1282
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,935
I just want to say,
Mama's gonna be thrilled.

1283
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,562
MIKE: You know what,
you need to go ahead...

1284
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,355
and "whoosah" or something for a second.

1286
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,110
Whoosah.

1287
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,364
- Mike, just leave it alone.
- Why you acting like that?

1288
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,408
Hey, Mike. Go on about
your business, man.

1289
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:33,286
- Wait, no. We gonna talk about this.
- No. Get the fuck out of my face.

1290
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,206
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- Get the fuck off me, Mike.

1291
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:40,210
What the hell is your problem, man?!
Why you acting so stupid?!

1292
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,338
This is a dysfunctional partnership.
That's why the fuck I'm acting like that.

1293
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,131
- All right...
- There ain't no trust, Mike.

1294
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,591
I didn't lie to you!

1295
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,053
I was waiting for the right time to tell
you. But that ain't what your issue is.

1296
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:53,473
Why don't you bring it to me real.
What is your problem with this?!

You know what? You a dog, man.

1298

- That's it. There it is. I said it.
- Oh, okay.

1299
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:03,316
You like a pit bull with that
little pink thing hanging out, Mike.

Oh, it's like that. Oh, okay.

Okay. We gonna handle that shit.
