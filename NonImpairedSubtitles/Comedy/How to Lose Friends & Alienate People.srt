1
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,160
Supposing Queen Elizabeth had been
misguided enough to marry an English Commoner.

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,920
Janet.

3
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,360
I'm sorry Ms. Fox, I didn't quite hear.

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,840
Obviously you're immersed in problems of far
greater significant than Elizabeth's foreign policy.

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,480
When I was a kid, I used to think
there was a special place where

6
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
All the movie stars lived

7
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
A kind of Shangri La.

8
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,600
And if you could just get inside there,
You'd be happy.

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,520
Forever.

10
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,480
All these years later,
I'm finally inside.

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,520
I've made it... to Shangri La.

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,160
My name is Sidney Young.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,560
I am a celebrity correspondent.

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,800
A journalist, a friend to the stars.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,480
Yeah... that... that isn't me.

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,040
This is me.

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,040
At the Apollo Film Awards
in L.A., this year.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,920
That's my Armani tuxedo.

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,280
That's an Omega Speed Master Pro
watch I'm wearing.

20
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
That's the actress, Sophie Maes.

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,480
Last night she told me she'd let
me have sex with her if she won...

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,680
the best actress award.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,080
Oh!... She just won the Best Actress Award

24
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,520
My life didn't used to be like this.

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,600
Only a year ago, my alternative magazine,
"The Post Modern Review", was on the ropes.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,000
I needed a big celebrity scoop to save
me from bankruptcy and humiliation.

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,160
But there was just one problem.

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,080
To cross the thin red line
that separates the Lookie Loo's from the stars,

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,080
You had to be famous.

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
Babe?

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
Babe 3 yeah..

32
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,920
But it hasn't got any ID...

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,720
How many pigs are coming tonight?

34
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,440
You want me to leave him with you?

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
No, no, no, you can not leave him here...

36
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,280
If you're positive you're supposed to...

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,240
Well, well... Sidney Young.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,160
Well, well, clipboard Nazi type woman.

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,880
The pig doesn't get in.

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,160
What about me?

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
I was talking about you.

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,120
Plan B: If you cannot crash
the awards ceremonies

43
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,120
You had to get in to one
of the after show parties.

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
Of these, the most exclusive,
was the Sharp's Magazine party.

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
Hosted by legendary editor
Clayton Harding.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,240
Here the A-list could finally relax.

47
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,040
Safe in the knowledge that no Lookie Loo
would book a room in one of

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,320
London's most expensive hotels
just to be close to them.

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,560
OK Kevin, I want you in bed
by 10 o'clock, OK?

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
And no porn.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,440
When I'm in L.A. I like to stay
at the Chateau, where else...

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,480
And then when I'm in London I also
like to stay here at the Haymarket.

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
It's got to the point where I don't
feel at home unless I'm in a hotel.

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Do you know what I mean?

55
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,400
What is it you do?

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm a writer, I'm a movie writer.

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,880
Great.

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,120
Hello.

59
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
Sir?

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Is everything all right?

61
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,880
You have the most amazing cheekbones.

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,680
Have you had plastic surgery?

63
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,880
No, and you?

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
Me? No..

65
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Penis reduction when I was a kid...

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,960
- You are too much!
- I am, aren't I?

67
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,800
What's your name again?

68
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,120
Clark, Clark Baxter.

69
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,920
How do you do?

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,040
Your... little... moustache...

71
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,640
Oh shit!

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,520
Sara, get security.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
Sidney Young got in.

74
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,560
Who's Sidney Young?

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh fuck!

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Plan C: keep a low profile and leave
as unobtrusively as possible.

77
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,520
Can you get that?

78
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Can you get the phone please?

79
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,680
The post modern review with an English
celebrity is a text to be deconstructed...

80
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
No we don't hate celebrities..

81
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,520
.. I am an internationally respected academic.

82
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
And prick.

83
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,640
You answer the phone,
What do I pay you for?

84
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,240
You don't pay me.

85
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,880
Answer the phone.

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,760
Hello, Post Modern Review.

87
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,920
If she doesn't apologize, I'm quitting.

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,760
You're going to have to apologize,
okay, George can't leave.

89
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Why can't George leave?

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,480
Because he owns the Fax machine, that's why.

91
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
What?

92
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,080
It's Sharp's magazine.

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,360
We're finished.

94
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,640
We're not finished.

95
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,880
If they sue we're finished...

96
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,280
It's going to be OK,
give me the phone...

97
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
Be quiet.

98
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
Sidney Young.

99
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,200
This is Clayton Harding,
editor of Sharp's Magazine.

100
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,880
Ah, Lord Vader.

101
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,040
I saw you at my party. Just before you
ruined it with your little pig stunt.

102
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,800
Oh, you liked that did you?.

103
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Sure.

104
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,920
I especially liked the part where
Clint Eastwood beat the shit out of you.

105
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
Well, you listen to me,
I'm not scared of you Harding.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,040
You can sue if you like,
but it's like... Jimmy Stewart said...

107
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,920
You sit up there in your spindly little webs,

108
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,240
And you think the whole world revolves
around you and your money, but it doesn't Mister.

109
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,920
Mister..
- Potter.

110
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
Potter!

111
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,640
You may sue us OK, but I warn you
if you strike me down...

112
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,000
- Mr Johnson's here to see you.
- I will become more powerful than
you can possibly imagine

113
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,880
Destroy me and a hundred men
will spring up in my place.

114
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,680
Men who care nothing for success, men who
can't be bought, men who's only loyalty...

115
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,840
I want you to come to work for me
at Sharp's magazine in New York.

116
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,540
Fight!
Fight!

117
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,840
That's not coming out!

118
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,640
Can You say that again please?

119
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,640
Thanks asshole.

120
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,280
Sorry.

121
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,520
Oh fuck!

122
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,280
This magazine you're working for,
it is good?

123
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,960
Yeah, it's Sharp's.

124
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,640
You know, Sharp's Magazines?

125
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,760
High society, fashion, fine..
finance, Hollywood celebrities.

126
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,280
Hollywood?

127
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,160
It's Sodom and Gomorrah.

128
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,200
Now everybody is celebrity.

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
You take out your breasts
you are celebrity.

130
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
I think it really depends
on the breasts.

131
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,480
In Poland, someone was famous
because they done something.

132
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,640
Marie Curie..
Paul John Paul...

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,920
Yes, well they don't make entertainers
like that any more, do they.

134
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,040
They brought your things yesterday.

135
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,960
Great.

136
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,480
Yeah.

137
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,080
It's nice.
I like it.

138
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,960
I'll put my drums in
the corner over there.

139
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,560
Joking.

140
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,000
Just a little.

141
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,880
When you start work?

142
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
In the morning.

143
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
So got to be fresh,
make a good impression.

144
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,680
Go to bed.

145
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
That's exactly what I intend to do.

146
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,840
Make that two.

147
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,080
I'm Clark.
Clark Baxter.

148
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
Nice to meet you, cheers.

149
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,920
What is this?

150
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
That's a water, sir.

151
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
That's not right is it, put a
bit of beer in or something.

152
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm sorry, my boyfriend's sitting there.

153
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,040
Is he?

154
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,520
He's fucking small isn't he.

155
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,040
That's his White Russian,
he'll be here any second.

156
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,800
Excuse me? Can you reserve
seats in this bar?.

157
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
No.

158
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm a journalist.

159
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,080
I work for a little periodical
you might have heard of.

160
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,520
Sharps Magazine.

161
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm the Cultural Editor.

162
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,680
This is library card, from Gloucester.

163
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,280
It's the wrong one isn't it...

164
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,520
Happy now?

165
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,320
Just doing my bit for the gene pool.

166
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,120
Who is that with Clint Eastwood?

167
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Morgan Freeman.

168
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,840
No, in the head-lock.

169
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
You got this laminated?

170
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,520
Shit... Sorry, sorry.

171
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,520
No, no, no, just leave it.

172
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
OK then.

173
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,920
It's pronounced "gloster" by the way.

174
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,800
Are you going to get off that seat?

175
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,680
No.

176
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
Do you know the meaning of Karma?

177
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
A curry?

178
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,880
What goes around, comes around.

179
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,240
The moment is approaching where you'll
pay the price for being an asshole.

180
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
And when my boyfriend gets here, I'm going
to encourage him to take you outside...

181
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,920
Hello?

182
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Hi honey.

183
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,120
All right, I'll see you then.

184
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,880
Boyfriend not coming?

185
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm Sorry.

186
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,840
Do you think..?

187
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,920
Do you think I can have his drink?

188
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,200
Bobby.

189
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,840
You want my seat?
I'm just leaving.

190
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,400
Thanks.

191
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,200
Who do you think that is
with Clint Eastwood?

192
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm going to go powder my nose.

193
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,600
Why don't you put on something
a little more romantic?

194
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,800
Mrs Labowski.

195
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,120
Kowalsky.

196
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,280
You know what time it is?

197
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,400
The music blaring, the door open.

198
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,840
Was it?

199
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,160
Fuck..
I mean sorry...

200
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,040
Shit...

201
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,200
I mean sorry..

202
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,920
I ran into an old friend...

203
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,160
and came back for a little...

204
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,760
... Penis.

205
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,440
You can do this.

206
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
You can do this.

207
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
You can do this.

208
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,320
You so can do this.

209
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,360
Come on Bob... A quick cup
of coffee, then you gotta go.

210
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,440
This is my city.

211
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,320
This is my building.

212
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
This is my Lobby.

213
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,760
These are my models.

214
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,960
This is my work place.

215
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,560
And this is my boss.

216
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
What the fuck are you wearing?

217
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,640
You like it?

218
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,120
I've got another one actually.

219
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,000
Thanks.

220
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,280
The next time you come here dressed like
that you follow this shirt, you understand?

221
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,880
Sit down.

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,960
How was your flight?

223
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,480
It was good. Thanks to the
business class tickets, Clay?

224
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,880
That was a mistake.

225
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,320
And don't call me Clay.

226
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
Oh, can we smoke?

227
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,200
We... no.

228
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,760
Actually I'm a big fan of your
early... funnier, stuff

229
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,880
Snipe Magazine, really good.

230
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,720
You've actually been a big influence on me.

231
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,600
And I think together we can inject
some of that Snipe spirit into Sharp's.

232
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,080
In fact I've got some
idea which you might...

233
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,640
You think you've arrived don't you?

234
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,280
I hate to break it to you,
but you're only in the first room.

235
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,600
It's not nothing, don't get
me wrong, but eh...

236
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,720
It's not that great either, believe me
there's plenty of people in this town

237
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,480
Who made it to the first level
and didn't get any further.

238
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,800
And in about a year,
maybe longer,

239
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,400
You'll discover a secret doorway,
at the back of the first room,

240
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,120
That leads to the 2nd.

241
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,000
And in time, if you're lucky,
you'll discover...

242
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,800
another doorway in the back of the
2nd room, that leads to the 3rd.

243
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,960
There are 7 rooms, altogether.

244
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,320
You are in the 1st.

245
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,120
I'm in the 7th.

246
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,240
Don't you forget it.

247
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Can I use the bathroom in the 7th,
cause the one in the 1st really smells.

248
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,040
Which leads us to the subject
of your sense of humor.

249
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,960
I had a look through
your magazine here.

250
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,400
Oh, what did you think?

251
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,160
Oh, it was kind of snarky...
and bitter... and witless.

252
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm gonna try you out in
the "I Spy" section.

253
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,720
You're going to report
to Lawrence Maddox.

254
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,040
Plausibly, I know we've only just met,
already I perceive I'm in the presence

255
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,400
of a rare common sensibility.

256
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,280
Oh, thanks.

257
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,280
Harding is going to be your Rabbi,
show you the ropes.

258
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,640
Oh, Mr Maddox.

259
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,320
Are you aware of what
we do at "I Spy"?

260
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
You photograph famous people
when they're drunk.

261
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,800
"I Spy" is the nation's
window to high society.

262
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,560
The Lookie Loo's read us because...
they weren't there.

263
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
The glitterati read us because
we tell them they were there.

264
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,760
For the system to work,
we have to know what "there" is.

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,160
So when we go out to clubs and stuff,
is that on expenses?

266
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,160
This isn't a vacation, it's a vocation.

267
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,040
And when we do go out, you're going to
have to wear something more suitable.

268
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
What do you mean by suitable?

269
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,920
Something that covers all this up.

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Is that Mussolini?

271
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,720
No Sydney, it's Richard Heywood,
owner of this magazine.

272
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,560
Who's this funny looking kid,
is that his son,

273
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,800
It's his daughter.

274
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,840
Elizabeth.

275
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,160
And my wife.

276
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,720
Really?

277
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,720
She's very... she's got...

278
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,760
I mean babies are all like Mussolini.

279
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,040
Miss Olsen takes care of book launchings,
gallery openings and other intellectual fare.

280
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,360
Ms Olsen will you find our new
rookie something to do?

281
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,240
I hear the Cultural Editor's
job is up for grabs.

282
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,800
Seeing I'm going to be sitting
just there, don't you think we
should put last night behind us?

283
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
No, now get off my desk.

284
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,560
Yeah, but...

285
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,880
I don't really know what
I'm supposed to be doing.

286
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Are you gonna help me out?

287
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,440
Sure, which way did you come in?

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Here, Chris Blick exhibition opening.

289
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,400
Caption it.

290
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,680
Now get out off my desk.

291
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,200
Hi.

292
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,440
Oh, hi Ingrid.

293
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,320
Aren't you going to introduce us?

294
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,640
This is Clark Baxter.

295
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,800
It's Sidney actually, Sidney Young.

296
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Clark Baxter is my alias.

297
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,680
He's English.

298
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,400
Oh, right.

299
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,680
Hello.

300
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
Is that the Parsons Gallery.

301
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,520
Yes it is, this is
Celia Parsons speaking.

302
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,880
Hi, this is Sidney Young
from Sharp's magazine.

303
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,120
We're running some photographs from your
opening of the Chris Blick exhibition,

304
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,640
And I've been asked to caption them...

305
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,240
I was wondering if you could help
me to identify a few people.

306
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,680
All right.

307
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,520
Thanks.

308
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
Chris Blick, man or woman?

309
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,720
Is Chris Blick a man or a woman?

310
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,680
Are you sure you're calling
from Sharp's Magazine?

311
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Yes I am.

312
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
Well then tell me Stanley,
why are they giving you this assignment,

313
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,800
If you do not know who one of the
most famous artists in America is?

314
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
I don't know.

315
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,040
He's a man.

316
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,640
Great, OK, is he an old man?

317
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,760
He's an older man, yes.

318
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,960
Cause I've got two old men here,
is he the fat one?

319
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,760
You do realize that Clayton Harding
is a personal friend of mine?

320
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,040
What's that got to do with anything?

321
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,040
Right...

322
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,600
Parsons Gallery?

323
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,120
Is he the one with the wonky eye then?

324
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,120
It's fashion sensitive.

325
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,960
If you're not wearing Prada,
it'll take your arm clean off.

326
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,280
But I am wearing Prada.

327
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,320
This place isn't what I expected.

328
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,400
What did you expect?

329
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,680
I don't know, like the Argunkle circle.

330
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Dorothy Parker...

331
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,240
Martinis...

332
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,480
Quips... nobody here is drunk.

333
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,800
It's called being professional,

334
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,040
You should try it sometime.

335
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
Here's something you gotta understand,
okay, I'm not really one of you.

336
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,760
By you, do you mean human?

337
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,400
No, I mean one of the "Glossy Posse",

338
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,520
A bunch of Zombies walking about...
pets to the stars.

339
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,040
Acting like they're
working for the UN.

340
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,440
I'm here to shake things up.

341
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,840
Where are you from?

342
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,480
Not that it's any of your business, but
Port Huron, Michigan.

343
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Ah... small-town girl.

344
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,880
"I bet you couldn't wait to get out,
get anywhere, get all the way to the NYC"

345
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
"Silence of the Lambs".

346
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,800
Let me give you a bit of advice, OK.

347
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Don't take the celebrity
fluff too seriously.

348
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,800
You arrogant...

349
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,800
Are you insane?

350
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That was Lawrence Maddox's wife,
Elizabeth, her father owns Sharp's.

351
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,360
That was her?
The Mussolini baby.

352
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,200
I can go back...

353
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,040
No, you do not approach Elizabeth Maddox.

354
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,360
You do not talk to her, don't even
make eye contact with her.

355
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,720
Do you understand?

356
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,080
What, am I supposed to be afraid?

357
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Yes.

358
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
I don't know the meaning of
the word "fear"

359
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm sure there are many words
you don't know the meaning of.

360
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,320
What's that mean?

361
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,120
When I think of all the people
who'd kill to be where you are,

362
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,520
And you lumbering here, spitting food,
haven't the brains god gave a mollusc...

363
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,400
Why did Clayton hire you?

364
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,760
Snipe Magazine.

365
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,800
What?

366
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,880
When Clayton left college he
started this magazine called Snipe.

367
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,440
It was fantastic, just took on all the
self-important celebrities in town,

368
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,440
It was completely fearless.

369
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,400
It was like my magazine,
But 20 years earlier.

370
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
I am the young Clayton Harding,
that's why he hired me.

371
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,080
He looks at me and
he sees his glory days.

372
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,080
His "glory days"?

373
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,120
Sharp's is one of over 40
national magazines in the world.

374
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,120
That increased its advertising pages
by 60% since he took over.

375
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,840
He makes millions of dollars a year,
he lives in a Bank Street town house,
and week-ends in the Hamptons.

376
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,360
Clayton Harding is one of the lynch pins
of the media industrial complex.

377
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,320
Don't worry about that.

378
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,310
I think I just might be
in time to save him.

379
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,720
Hello, you've reached Sidney Young.

380
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,240
I'm Sorry, but my answering
machine is out of order, so

381
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
The voice you're hearing is actually me.
What do you want?

382
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,840
Sidney.

383
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,120
Are you there?

384
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,040
Sidney.

385
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,680
It's your father.

386
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,720
If you're there Sydney, please
answer the phone.

387
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
Sidney, are you there?

388
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Wow! Look at that.

389
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,360
Are you two texting each other?

390
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,640
There's about a hundred grand's worth of
food here, and I'm the only one eating it.

391
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,880
Want some?

392
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,680
No.

393
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,000
This place is just wall to wall totty.

394
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,480
Wall to wall, what?

395
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,600
Totty, you know, babes.

396
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,080
Sexually attractive women.

397
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,560
- Do you mind?
- What?

398
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,440
Hey Lawrence, how are you?

399
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,600
Good to see you.

400
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,400
Look at that.

401
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,480
All night long people have
been treating us like royalty.

402
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,160
In London, the journalist motto is
everybody hates us and we don't care.

403
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,960
Well now your one of the high priests
of what's hot and what's not.

404
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,240
I shouldn't even be here.

405
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,640
I get thrown out of places like this.

406
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,960
Lawrence Maddox, oh my goodness...

407
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Long time.

408
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,120
Yeah.

409
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,000
Rachel.

410
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,080
Rachel, how are you?

411
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,040
Well I'm wonderful, just wonderful.

412
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,160
How are you?

413
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,600
You know it is so funny
I should run into you.

414
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,520
I've just done this great
little film, it's called 5 Burros.

415
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,520
It's low-budget,
first time director,

416
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
But it's really moving.

417
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,960
Hey, maybe you could do a little...

418
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,080
Vincent.

419
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,960
Good to see you.

420
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,160
Lawrence, right?

421
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,160
Yeah.

422
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,400
How are you sir?

423
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,720
- Good,
- Good to see you too.

424
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,520
How's the picture?

425
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,400
Pretty close to perfect, if I can just
get all the experts to leave me alone.

426
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,040
I think we're gonna have
some screenings next week.

427
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,400
Hey! That was Rachel Petkoff.

428
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Fantastic actress.

429
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,000
She hasn't done anything for
a while, but in her day...

430
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,800
- Sure...
- No seriously, I think she's due for a comeback.

431
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,200
You should get in there,
do a profile, before anyone else...

432
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,720
Sidney, I'd like to introduce
you to Vincent Lepak, "Enfant Terrible".

433
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,920
In my opinion the most exciting
new director in American cinema.

434
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,600
This is the worst fundraiser
I've been to my whole life.

435
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,000
It's a ratfire isn't it?

436
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,880
Excuse me.

437
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,920
Can I have your autograph please?

438
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,200
I'm a huge fan.

439
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,480
Is that so?

440
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,040
Yeah, I've seen everything
you've been in.

441
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Those episodes of "The Love Boat".

442
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,800
"The Bionic Woman",
and "Songbirds".

443
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,920
"In the Night",

444
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,480
And I saw your first ever TV appearance
"The Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors".

445
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,400
Right.

446
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,680
But my all-time favorite has
to be "A Day Too Long".

447
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,640
You were great in that.

448
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,440
What's you name, honey?

449
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,200
Sidney.
Sidney Young.

450
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,560
Thanks.

451
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,960
I'll remember that.

452
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,200
Thank you.

453
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,120
I mean you look around you
and it's all shit, you know.

454
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,680
No-one's making movies that
are fucking worthwhile.

455
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,960
I have disagree with you Vincent.

456
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,840
You're making movies
that are worthwhile.

457
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,440
This is what I'm saying.

458
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,600
You have to inspire yourself.

459
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,000
I am my role model,
I want to be me.

460
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,960
What's the greatest film ever made?

461
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,920
Excuse me?

462
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,560
What is the greatest film ever made?

463
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,480
Have a guess.

464
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,720
Well... I don't know,
I don't think there is one...

465
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
Have a guess!

466
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
Yeah, have a guess,
what's the greatest film ever made.

467
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,000
It's hard to say.

468
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
I personally love
La Dolce Vita.

469
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,880
Incorrect.

470
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,600
Con Air.

471
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,520
I beg your pardon?

472
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,600
Con Air.

473
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,200
Right? It's got everything hasn't it?

474
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,840
You got Malkovich for your acting chops.

475
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,320
You got Nicky Cage for your action.

476
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,600
And Steve Buscemi for your comedy.

477
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,440
John Cusack for the gays...

478
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,960
It's like a smorgisboard isn't it?

479
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,680
I don't think we've been introduced.

480
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,880
Mr Young, this is Eleanor Johnson.

481
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,560
Queen of New York.

482
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,040
Sidney is from England.

483
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,160
He's our very own "idiot savant",
without the "savant".

484
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,080
Well it's always nice to have
fresh blood to these things.

485
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,960
Which reminds me,
I am here with Sophie Maes.

486
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,120
I want you to meet her.

487
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,400
His new film,
"The Making of a Saint".

488
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,200
The buzz is amazing.

489
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,280
The release is being tied in with the
roll-out of the Versace campaign.

490
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,040
And Louis Vuiton is on the line.

491
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,760
This train is leaving the station.

492
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,400
What, you're a publicist?

493
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,280
I don't really like that word Sidney.

494
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,400
What do I call you then?

495
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,160
You can call me Eleanor.

496
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
All right.

497
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,440
There she is.

498
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,360
Sophie, give us a smile!

499
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,640
This one will go far.

500
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,320
Where is the car?

501
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,720
What's it doing at the back?

502
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,320
Well, forget what I said,
I want it at the front now.

503
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,560
I just think it's so awful
how we're still exploiting animals,

504
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,120
Which is why I won't wear fur,
or leather, or wear makeup.

505
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm a vegetarian.

506
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm with you on that one.

507
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,480
I won't eat anything with eyebrows.

508
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,500
Or something that can chuckle. I would
never eat an animal that could chuckle.

509
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I'm sorry, I can't really
understand your accent very well.

510
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,640
I just.. nothing.... just

511
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,480
So you're an actress?

512
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,240
So you've not won any Oscars then?

513
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,200
No.

514
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,440
Cause I would definitely vote for
you for best supporting dress.

515
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,400
I haven't been nominated for anything.

516
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
I realise, I'm just saying...

517
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,680
Sophie, dear,
Are you ready?

518
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Yeah.

519
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,040
I was joking...
cause your dress was obviously...

520
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,400
You know what to do.

521
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,720
Thank you.

522
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,760
Lovely.

523
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,320
Sophie, Sophie!

524
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,440
I'm going to the circle club,
I'll see you tomorrow.

525
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,880
Okay, good night.

526
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,680
Push up.

527
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,840
Where are you going?

528
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm going to the club.

529
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,160
I'm sorry, you're not on the list.

530
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,240
Cuba!

531
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,480
See, even Cuba says so.

532
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,280
Cuba...

533
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
Who's a good boy.

534
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,400
To the Circle Club.

535
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,360
It just turns my stomach.

536
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,640
He's pouring all over her, he's
old enough to be her father.

537
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,760
No he isn't.

538
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,720
Yes he is.

539
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,720
Actually I was producing
sperm when I was 13...

540
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,000
For your information he wasn't pawing
her, he was just doing his job.

541
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,040
In case you haven't noticed, Sharp's has
to have a star on its cover every month

542
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,920
And most of these stars are
Eleanor's clients so...

543
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,400
do not piss her off.

544
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,360
She's a flack.
Hacks do not take orders from flacks.

545
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,640
And I wouldn't call that doing his job,
he had no blood left in his upper body

546
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,640
Oh, and the next time you want to do that
hilariously ironic "I love Con Air" skid...

547
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,320
- I wasn't being ironic...
- would you mind?

548
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,280
Not doing it in front of Vincent Lepak,
who happens to be very important.

549
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,240
Yeah, I could tell that by the way he was
allowed to stay up past his bedtime.

550
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,240
Do you think she'll go out with me?

551
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,160
Who?

552
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,800
Sophie Maes, do you think
she'll go out with me?

553
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,760
No.

554
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,800
Girls like Sophie do
not date journalists.

555
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,240
As far as she's concerned
you're the help.

556
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,760
What do you know anyway?

557
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,440
A lot of these starlets
are lonely.

558
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,960
All they do is look around for men.

559
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,520
This is New York, Sidney, women
only date men who are successful.

560
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,680
I'm gonna be successful.

561
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,960
And tall.

562
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Have you seen this?

563
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,760
She's everywhere.

564
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,600
Good cover.

565
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,360
From Sophie Maes.

566
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,560
Thanks for the great night.

567
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,040
Sweet kid.

568
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,400
Sidney...
about last night.

569
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,760
A word of advice.

570
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,480
Don't talk to the celebrities.

571
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,440
Sophie said you made her uncomfortable.

572
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,000
So Brad's people finally
got back to me with the agreement.

573
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,840
We have the whole afternoon
before the shoot.

574
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,160
Good work Lawrence.

575
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,840
OK, if that's it...

576
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,960
Actually I was thinking Clay...

577
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,880
Paris Hilton.

578
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,240
I do a profile of her as if
she's this complete recluse,

579
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,000
Like a hermit.

580
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm tracking her down.

581
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,760
Who is the elusive Paris Hilton,
and why she's so publicity shy?

582
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,320
Good...

583
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,640
Just changing....

584
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,360
That's first room stuff, Sidney,
and call me Clay one more time

585
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
see what happens.

586
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,280
Sorry.

587
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,320
No, I love this, but I'm
so fat I couldn't.

588
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,480
Get out of here.

589
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,920
You look totally rexy.

590
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,760
God, that's so sweet.

591
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,760
I don't mean to be rude Sidney,
but what the fuck do you want?

592
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,760
You know how things work here,

593
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,640
How am I gonna get a piece
of the magazine?

594
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,040
I thought all this fluff
was beneath you.

595
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,640
It is beneath me,
but things have changed.

596
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,520
What's changed?

597
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,760
I know everybody thinks I'm
a bit of an idiot.

598
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,760
And maybe I didn't have the
best start here, but...

599
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,720
I want...
I want...

600
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,360
I want to have sex with Sophie Maes,
before Maddox does.

601
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
You're loathsome, do you know that?

602
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,120
I know he's got a bit of a head start.

603
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,240
But I think I can win her back,
cause once I get my hooks into a girl,

604
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,640
She never gets free.

605
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,800
Like ringworm?

606
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,040
If you like.

607
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,240
Where you going?

608
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Hey buddy, you big corporate
dick lick...

609
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,160
Hello, I'd like to apply for a
a Master Card, please.

610
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,840
Yeah.

611
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,480
Hon. Sidney Young.

612
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,760
Hon, H-O-N, it's short for honorable.

613
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,960
Yeah, it's a British title.

614
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,880
The Queen?

615
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,120
Yeah, I know the Queen.

616
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,320
She used to be in my
break-dancing posse.

617
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,440
She's a buddy more than anything.

618
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,720
Fuck!

619
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
Hello Cuba...

620
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,560
He likes you.

621
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,560
So, how does it feel to be a star?

622
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,040
No, no, it's so embarrassing,

623
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,320
Those pictures are everywhere now, and I
had no idea that dress was so see-through.

624
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,200
Plus everybody's talking like
it was some kind of stunt.

625
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,640
Such a cynical age, hmm?

626
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,640
Hello Sidney.

627
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,720
I was looking for my...

628
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,000
Lawrence is taking us to
lunch at Cipriani.

629
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,160
That's nice.

630
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,560
Can I leave Cuba here?
He doesn't like Italian food.

631
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,040
Of course you can,
he can stay in my office.

632
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,920
Sidney, fetch Cuba a bowl of water.

633
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,080
Well, of course.

634
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,160
That is a lovely ring.
Where is that from?

635
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,040
It was my mother's,
she gave it to me.

636
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,240
Oh, you sweetie.

637
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,400
It's very very...

638
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,880
So listen.

639
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,800
You've met Vincent Lepak,
haven't you Sidney?

640
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,080
Eh, yeah.

641
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,520
He has a new movie coming out soon.

642
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,080
And Lawrence is already
stretched as it is.

643
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,320
How would you like to
do the feature on him?

644
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,600
Yeah, I would actually.

645
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,000
Yes, very much.

646
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,960
Well, great.

647
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,000
Maybe we can get together
and discuss the angle.

648
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,800
Okay.

649
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,640
What do you mean, angle?

650
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
Well I need to know how
we're going to present Vincent,

651
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,160
Check the story and so on.

652
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,520
Are you saying you want copy approval?

653
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,680
Any stories written about
my clients need to be

654
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,960
in their best interest.

655
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,080
That's all.

656
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,560
If things work out with Vincent,
maybe we can talk about a follow-up

657
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,240
story on Sophie.

658
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,080
What do you think?

659
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,680
I'm sorry, I don't work that way.

660
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,800
Sidney, dear...

661
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,160
Think of it like this,

662
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,280
You write about one of my clients,
you are borrowing some of their starlight,

663
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,240
To help sell your magazine.

664
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,640
All I'm saying is "quid pro quo".

665
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,000
Starlight?

666
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,800
Hello Cuba...

667
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,520
Hello.

668
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,520
It's uncle Sidney, I've come to
see how you are, yes.

669
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,360
What's this?

670
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,680
Would you like a little play?

671
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,440
Fetch!

672
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,680
There you go.

673
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,200
That's it, that's it.

674
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,840
Well done.

675
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,920
You and me are going to
be pals, aren't we?

676
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,440
You're going to like me much much better
than that prick Maddox. Yes you are.

677
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,440
Ready?

678
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,640
Come on...

679
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,800
Shit...

680
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,600
That's my bag.

681
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,320
Yes, I was going to borrow
it for a second.

682
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,200
What are you talking about?

683
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,600
I'll bring it right back, I'm just..

684
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,040
Oh my!

685
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,480
It was an accident.

686
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,680
What did you do?

687
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,400
I was just trying to
make friends... and then...

688
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,815
Please don't tell her,
don't tell her.

689
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:11,120
Cuba!

690
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,560
Fuck no.

691
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,560
What are you doing?

692
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,400
Alison!

693
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,880
Have you seen Cuba?

694
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,800
What?

695
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,560
Have you seen Sophie's dog?

696
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,600
No, no idea.

697
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,720
Well come and help us find him.
Don't worry.

698
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,040
Clay, you got a minute?

699
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,800
You find that rat yet?

700
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,400
No, not yet, probably just
got out of the building.

701
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,880
Congratulations on the
"Man of the Year" thing.

702
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,840
How was lunch?

703
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,040
I don't know.

704
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,720
A thousands dollars a plate
all I could taste was ass.

705
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,880
I'm kissing their ass,
they're kissing my ass.

706
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,760
I get this dream sometimes.

707
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,960
Someone's set fire to the building.

708
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,960
Heywood, Sharp's magazine,
the whole thing up in flames.

709
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,600
My analyst, he thinks it's
an anxiety dream.

710
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,800
I never let him know how happy
I am watching the fucker burn.

711
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,280
What do you want?

712
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,880
I want to write a story
about Vincent Lepak.

713
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,920
Not a puff piece, something funny, with
teeth, like Snipe would have done.

714
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,360
Everyone's treating him like some sort
of genius, and he's not, he's an idiot.

715
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,760
Look at this.

716
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,040
Why do I have a closet full of
blue fucking shirts?

717
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,120
I don't know...

718
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,520
I don't know either.

719
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
This is an office, for god's sake.

720
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,360
Why do I even have a fucking closet?

721
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,240
Do it.

722
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,435
Fuck, yeah!

723
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:17,680
Do it.
He's an annoying little prick.

724
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,680
We'll take him down.

725
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,360
This is your shot.

726
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Thanks Clayton.

727
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,920
You're my little hit-man.

728
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,200
Yes, I am your little hit-man.

729
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,120
Go do it.

730
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
Okay!

731
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,960
You can call me "The Jackal".

732
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,880
Out!

733
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,840
Okay.

734
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,240
Mr Young.

735
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,560
Yes.

736
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,920
I'm Sophie Mae's assistant.

737
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,160
I'm afraid Sophie isn't
here right now.

738
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,720
Well, I know she's here.

739
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,880
I'm not a stalker.
I just know she's upset because...

740
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,320
She lost the dog.

741
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,720
She isn't here.

742
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,120
All right, well can you please just find
out if she got my presents?

743
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,800
Okay...

744
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,200
Did you send the flowers?

745
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,040
Flowers?

746
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,320
Yeah, cause she doesn't get enough
flowers, does she? I sent the fish.

747
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,120
You know, goldfish,
in a bowl.

748
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,680
Did she get 'em?

749
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,560
Yes, but they were dead.

750
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,320
All of 'em?

751
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,360
Yeah.

752
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,200
It was kind of shocking actually.

753
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,400
Were they dead when you sent them?

754
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,920
No!

755
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,640
Who sends people dead fish?

756
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,520
The Mafia.

757
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,400
Oh my god!
You're like a serial killer.

758
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,320
No, no, no, that wasn't me.

759
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,360
I laid him to rest.

760
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,320
Cuba.

761
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,680
I took him out to the eh...

762
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,200
I don't want to know.

763
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,240
You might want your bag back.

764
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,320
Stop.

765
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,880
Also just the whole, not telling thing,
just wanted to say I appreciate that...

766
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,600
because you didn't have to do it,
a lot of people wouldn't have done it.

767
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,160
Why didn't you?

768
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,440
You don't need my help to
screw up here Sidney.

769
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,880
The only thing you make are mistakes.

770
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,280
And stains.

771
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,680
Can I help you?

772
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,640
Just a couple of straws please.

773
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,800
Let me ask...
What is it with this book?

774
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,000
You're always writing in it.
Is it like a diary?

775
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,240
It's a novel I'm working on.

776
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,960
- Wow!
- Yeah, I know, I'm a walking clich.

777
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,160
No, it's all right,
it's very impressive.

778
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,400
And you're writing it by hand?

779
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,960
Yeah.

780
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,960
I don't know, it keeps it separate from
the magazine work, makes it seem special.

781
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,320
You're full of surprises, sister.

782
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,400
Ah, White Russian, been waiting
for your boyfriend?

783
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,920
Yeah, he'll be here soon.

784
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,500
What does he do this mystery guy?
Is he like a hack too, or...

785
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,360
Actually he's a poet.

786
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,000
Oooh is he?

787
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,760
What does he look like?

788
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,920
What?

789
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,080
Poets are not known for
being that good-looking,

790
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,520
'cause they're always in dark rooms,
and they look like Golum

791
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,880
He's very handsome, thank you.

792
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,380
Of course he is.

793
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,380
You know what I don't understand.

794
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,200
You're so desperate to get
a story in the magazine,

795
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,740
So why wouldn't you play
ball with Eleanor, write a puff piece?

796
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,360
I resent being bribed to gush
sycophantically by the star.

797
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,560
I choose to gush sycophantically.

798
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,360
Okay.

799
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,880
Anyway, Clayton's given me
a story so, I'm on my way.

800
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,080
That's good.

801
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,520
In a world where passion is
forbidden, and belief divine,

802
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,640
The love you've held for a man,
she gave to all mankind.

803
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,200
You've given yourself
to Christ my child.

804
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,000
How can it be wrong...?

805
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,600
I believe in love,
that is all we have.

806
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,520
And we must give it
wherever it is most needed.

807
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,240
Sometimes, before you can
find God,

808
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,720
You have to find the world.

809
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,120
Calcutta.

810
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,800
Stand up, Mother Teresa.

811
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,800
Sophie Maes is Mother Teresa in
"The Making of a Saint".

812
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,720
Anyway I got to shoo off,
I leave you in peace.

813
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
With your poet.

814
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,840
Bye.

815
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,240
Bye.

816
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,640
I've still got the receipt so...

817
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,440
Which, makes it a half a page left,

818
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,720
Lawrence, any ideas?

819
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,520
Yes, Rachel Petkoff, fabulous
Sundance actress.

820
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,840
One of my all-time favorites.

821
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,600
Just made a movie called 5 Burros.

822
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,440
I think she's poised for a comeback.

823
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,880
And I think we should get
there first, do a piece

824
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,280
Sounds good.
Let's do it.

825
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,720
Okay, that's it people.

826
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,480
What?

827
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,400
Did you read my piece
on Vincent Lepak?

828
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,120
Yeah, that...

829
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,440
That's not gonna work.

830
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,560
Oh, and for those of you
who haven't heard.

831
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,880
Alison will be running the
"I Spy" section from now on,

832
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,200
As Laurence here is moving up in the
world, he's replacing Greg Roberts

833
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,360
as Deputy Editor.

834
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,400
Congratulations.

835
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,560
I'm Sorry.

836
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,360
Since when is Rachel one of
your favorite actresses?

837
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,760
You'd never fucking heard of her.

838
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,960
That was my idea.

839
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,120
And so it was yes.

840
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,360
If you have any more good ideas don't
forget to bring them by my new office.

841
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,440
By the way.

842
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,160
There's been complaints about you
skulking by the water cooler.

843
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,000
Trying to talk to women,
that's inappropriate behaviour.

844
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,040
What?

845
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,000
You spend your life chatting
up the staff.

846
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,640
When I do it it's called
flirting,

847
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,520
When you do it, it's called
sexual harassment.

848
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,000
Consider this an official warning.

849
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,160
I will not tolerate
sexist behavior.

850
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,240
I know that wasn't Greg's
way of working.

851
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,120
But Greg isn't Deputy Editor any more.

852
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,280
I am.

853
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,640
And I,

854
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,920
Am making changes.

855
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,680
What?

856
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,440
Hi Lawrence. There's a lady
here that's been looking for you.

857
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,120
Can I help you?

858
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,920
Are you Lawrence Maddox
the new Deputy Editor?

859
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,720
Yes?

860
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,520
I'm here to congratulate you
on your promotion.

861
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,600
Thank you.

862
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,040
I'm sorry, you are?

863
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,200
I'm your present.

864
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,360
Laurence this is inappropriate
behavior, wouldn't you say?

865
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,320
This is wrong, I should record this.

866
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,240
Fuck the misuse of company time.

867
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,680
- Stop.
- I'm not doing anything.

868
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,440
Hey Mrs. Harding

869
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,880
Oh my god,

870
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,480
So adorable.

871
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,360
This is Ingrid from the
fashion department.

872
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,680
You're getting so big.

873
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,880
Where's Mr Maddox now?

874
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,880
He moved to room 217,
and it's just over there.

875
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,160
Ok.

876
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:15,920
Bye.

877
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,920
Bye.

878
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,920
Girls, let's go see Mr. Maddox.

879
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,240
My God this is terrible.

880
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,360
There's a surprise.
Look at this.

881
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,000
What do you think?

882
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,000
Mrs. Harding?

883
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,240
Girls.

884
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,840
I got cock on my hand.

885
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,760
Get in.

886
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,640
I didn't know it was
"take our daughters to work" day.

887
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,880
I didn't know there was a
"take our daughters to work" day.

888
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,280
Shut up.

889
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,160
You know, when I told my wife...

890
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,960
I hired another Brit.

891
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
She was excited.

892
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,120
She still thinks you're all like
something out of "Pride and Prejudice".

893
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,840
But after what she just saw
in that room.

894
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,240
Now she thinks you're a
British person born in New Jersey.

895
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,000
Why did I hire you?

896
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,840
I don't know, why did you hire me?

897
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,440
I had an attack of nostalgia.
But it's passed.

898
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,920
Like gas.

899
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,800
What was wrong with my story?

900
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,720
What?

901
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,560
Why did you kill my
Vincent Lepak Story?

902
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,200
Sidney, it wasn't good enough.

903
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,840
Simple as that.

904
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,000
Wasn't good enough!

905
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,360
We don't do hatchet jobs here.

906
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,200
It wasn't a hatchet job.

907
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,240
Your opening quotation...

908
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,600
It's only too easy to catch
people's attention by...

909
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,160
Doing something worse than anyone
else has dared do it before.

910
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,080
Who you thinking of here,

911
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,400
Yourself or Vincent?

912
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,800
He is a talentless, pretentious little twat
who thinks that cinema began with Tarantino.

913
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,520
And somebody needed to say that.

914
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,800
You told me to do something with teeth.

915
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,000
I'm trying to run a fucking
magazine here.

916
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,680
A free press is the last defense
against the tyranny of stupidity.

917
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,920
Save me the tin-pot philosophy.

918
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,600
It's not mine it's yours.

919
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,320
First issue of Snipe.

920
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,960
Would you grow the fuck up?

921
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,640
You are not Robin Hood.

922
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,240
You never were.

923
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,680
You bitch about famous people for the
same reason I used to bitch about them.

924
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,160
Because they got invited to the party.

925
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,640
And you didn't.

926
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,480
Well Sidney,

927
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,240
You're at the party now.

928
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,280
Quit your bitching and
do your fucking job.

929
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,280
You're on your last life here,
do you understand that?

930
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,840
One more fuck-up like today,
you're gone.

931
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,280
Wouldn't you have to run a decision
like that past Eleanor first?

932
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,360
Get out.

933
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,360
I can't believe you hired
Bob as a stripper.

934
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,400
I didn't hire him,
she did it as a favour.

935
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,560
I thought you wanted to
be a success here.

936
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,920
I do.

937
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,280
It wasn't me it was Clark.

938
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,320
Oh, your alias, right.

939
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,160
I don't think Clayton is going to
publish anything I write you know.

940
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,200
I've been on salary for
4 months now,

941
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,940
And I've written probably a 175 words.
I think dollar per word basis,

942
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:10,000
I am the highest paid writer
in the history of this magazine.

943
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,840
He's not going to renew my contract.

944
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,400
Well, what do you expect?

945
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,600
I mean, Vincent's one
of Eleanor's clients.

946
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,880
I told you they're untouchables.

947
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,960
I thought Clayton was different,
I really did.

948
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,640
The only thing I'm good at
is pissing people off.
And they won't even let me do that.

949
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,480
"My glory walks hand in hand with my doom".
It's "Troy".

950
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,320
Troy who?

951
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,440
"Troy" the movie.

952
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,080
Clayton only hired me so
I could be shunned.

953
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,120
Everybody hates me.

954
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,680
You're the only one who
would talk to me.

955
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,160
You cornered me.

956
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,040
I'm serious.

957
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,200
You're the only person who's been...
you know.

958
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,720
Most... abusive to me.

959
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,000
Excuse me for a sec.

960
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,520
Rachel, hey.
Hello again.

961
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,000
Hello.

962
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,280
Laurence is a wonderful writer, I really
felt like he got to the heart of me.

963
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,400
I'm sorry, have we...?

964
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,480
It's Sidney, Sidney Young, we met
at the pool-side benefit.

965
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,360
I saw 5 Burros the other day,

966
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,040
And I just wept.

967
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:23,960
No...

968
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,800
Like a baby.

969
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,200
Absolutely incredible.
I just thought it was the best
piece of work I've seen in...

970
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,400
Sophie darling.

971
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,480
We were just talking, did you know
that Lawrence published a book of poetry.

972
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,080
No.

973
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,960
Called "The Whole Heart", yeah,
really terrific.

974
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,040
You write poems?

975
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,160
In another life.

976
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,080
Cointreau?

977
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,400
And the White Russian.

978
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,560
Right here.

979
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:52,880
So Sidney.

980
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,240
What time does the stripper come on?

981
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,240
Shut up Maddox.

982
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,040
Where's your sense of humor
Sidney?

983
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,200
Choke, choke, choke, choke, choke.

984
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,560
Hi, Mrs. Harding.

985
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:23,960
Hi.

986
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,440
It's a lovely party.

987
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,720
Having fun.

988
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,200
Jesus!

989
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,160
Has anyone ever told you before
that you have an unusually dark aura?

990
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:37,960
Yes.

991
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,080
You should walk with bare feet
as much as possible.

992
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,840
Ground all that negative energy.

993
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,080
What are you, a wizard, what?

994
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,200
I'm a spiritual healer.

995
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,200
Oh, can you make a
living out of that?

996
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:54,960
God no.

997
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,200
I'm a dentist.

998
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,760
You want do some coke?

999
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,160
Oy! Orlando, you used to be English.

1000
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,200
Fuck!

1001
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,520
You OK?

1002
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,000
What?

1003
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,560
I said, are you OK?

1004
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,760
Yeah, I'm fine.

1005
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,720
You?

1006
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,960
Yeah.

1007
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,440
No, actually I'm not.

1008
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,840
I hate my life, so you know
I'm going to get drunk.

1009
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,200
Right, I'll see you then.

1010
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,520
How could you?

1011
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,400
What?

1012
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,760
How could you and Maddox
have an affair.

1013
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,040
For god's sake.

1014
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,680
The man with hidden shallows.

1015
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,600
Goddamit Maddox!

1016
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,960
How can you live with yourself?

1017
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,920
I couldn't.

1018
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,160
That's why I've broken up with him.

1019
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,680
You broke up with him?

1020
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,800
Which leg did you hurt?

1021
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,880
This one.

1022
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,000
God... Fuck... God!

1023
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,640
You know what?

1024
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,080
There's something very
damaged about you.

1025
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,600
Like an animal that's been
hit by a car or something.

1026
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,760
Like a deer or like a pig,
maybe.

1027
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:34,160
You walk all funny and the other
animals keep away from you.

1028
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,960
Little limpy pig.

1029
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,760
I'm Joan of sick animals.

1030
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,560
That's why I picked Cuba.

1031
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,560
Because he had like,
psychological problems.

1032
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,320
Poor little Cuba.

1033
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,640
Where is he now?

1034
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,240
Feels I'm wasted.

1035
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,880
I'm really wasted.

1036
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,680
I slept it off.

1037
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,320
Congratulations on becoming
incredibly famous by the way.

1038
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,240
Thanks.

1039
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,640
What's that like?

1040
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,320
Weird.

1041
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,400
It's all happening so fast and it sort
of feels like it has nothing to do with me.

1042
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,120
Kind of like I'm not
really even here.

1043
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,440
You know what would be nice though?

1044
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,720
Some coke.

1045
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,360
It's probably just as well
I don't have any though.

1046
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,000
Coke always makes me so horny.

1047
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,560
I need the wizard dentist.

1048
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,660
I need the wizard...
Not you...

1049
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,960
The dentist wizard.

1050
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,880
The wizard stroke dentist.

1051
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,240
Ok, all right, you got it.

1052
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,160
Thank you, thank you so much.

1053
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:28,800
It's OK.

1054
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,280
I will never, never,
never forget this.

1055
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,680
It's OK, really.

1056
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,360
What are you doing?

1057
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,680
None of your business.

1058
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,040
You can't drive like that OK.

1059
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,560
Just sleep it of.

1060
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,760
Just leave, you, you stupid asshole
I hate you.

1061
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:58,560
And secondly... secondly...
I hate you because you're a stupid asshole.

1062
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,520
If you drive in this condition
you're going to kill yourself OK?

1063
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,120
Who cares if I did?

1064
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,600
I hate my life.

1065
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,840
I gotta go.

1066
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,920
Just come here.

1067
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,760
No, don't touch me.

1068
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,400
I hate my car.

1069
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,000
No give me the keys.

1070
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,720
I gotta go home.

1071
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,120
I thought I had it all figured out.

1072
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,960
A, get the hell out of Port Huron,
come to New York

1073
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,160
B, do the serious journalism to pay
the bills while I write the novel.

1074
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,440
C, win the Pulitzer.

1075
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,400
E,..

1076
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,440
D!

1077
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,640
D, I don't know what D was.

1078
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,000
When I took the internship at Sharp's.

1079
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,680
I met Maddox.

1080
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:55,520
And then before you know it I'm writing
10 tips for the fucking metrosexual.

1081
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,920
And pretending this is what
I wanted.

1082
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,760
And this isn't what I wanted.

1083
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,400
And that's why I hated you.

1084
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,360
You hated me?

1085
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,000
You were right, about me.
I'm a ghoul writing fluff.

1086
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,560
You're not a ghoul, OK,
you're a zombie.

1087
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,720
Am I afraid of a real relationship?

1088
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,960
Do I think an affair is all I deserve?

1089
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,480
I mean... ok, he's handsome
and successful and...

1090
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,280
He's great in bed.

1091
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,720
Oh, God be quiet!

1092
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,320
Fine.

1093
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,840
When I told him I couldn't
see him anymore.

1094
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,240
I don't know if he cared.

1095
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,680
I love him,

1096
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,560
And I don't know if he cares.

1097
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,560
I'm sure he does care.

1098
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,120
Ok. He's probably not very
good at expressing his emotions.

1099
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,480
Ok, let's just calm down, don't
get snot everywhere,

1100
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,840
'cause it's a rental.

1101
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,600
Oh, God!

1102
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,440
What?

1103
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,280
Oh! That's grim!

1104
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,880
Alison, what's your address?

1105
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,920
Alison I need to know your address.

1106
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,400
How?

1107
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,640
Not my stairs no.

1108
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,800
Will you shut up?

1109
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,160
You'll wake the old bitch up.

1110
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,160
Hi.

1111
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,480
Did we wake you?

1112
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,800
God, I'm a whore.

1113
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,800
- I'm a whore
- Hello dad.

1114
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,320
I love this song.

1115
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,520
She's not actually a prostitute.

1116
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,960
Oh, good.

1117
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,760
So Sidney's dad.
It's nice to meet you.

1118
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,600
I'm Alison.

1119
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,520
Delighted to meet you.

1120
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,480
I'm from Port Huron.

1121
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,120
And you must be Sidney's mummy.

1122
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,600
No, I'm not.

1123
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,600
Oh, ok, I mean my dad remarried too,
so that's cool.

1124
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,960
Do you have any cigarettes?

1125
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,320
What is this?

1126
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,760
Oh, hey, is this... ?

1127
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,320
I think it's probably cocaine.

1128
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,840
It wasn't actually for me.

1129
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,160
It was going to give it
to this young actress.

1130
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,240
So Mr. Sidney.
What you doing here?

1131
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,960
Please call me Richard.

1132
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,040
Well I've written a little book.

1133
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,600
And I was doing some talks.

1134
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,640
I'm writing a book.

1135
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,840
What's yours about?

1136
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,640
I write books on...

1137
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,960
philosophy, ideas.

1138
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,360
Oh my god.

1139
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,760
Richard Young.

1140
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,240
You're RC Young.

1141
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,640
You never said your
dad was RC Young.

1142
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,600
I brought you a copy of the book
I left it here.

1143
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,920
What's he know about philosophy?

1144
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,400
Well he does have a
Master's in the subject.

1145
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,640
You're shitting me.

1146
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,520
He likes "Con Air".

1147
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,520
Oh, I don't feel very good.

1148
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,800
Come on.
It's time you were in bed.

1149
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,520
Ok.

1150
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,120
You can sleep on the couch.

1151
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,160
It was a pleasure to meet
you Lord Young.

1152
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,480
You really should have said
you were coming.

1153
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,840
That would have required you
answering one of my calls.

1154
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,240
Well, I've been kind of busy.

1155
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,640
Of course.

1156
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,800
I picked up your magazine
at the airport.

1157
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,240
Most enjoyable.

1158
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,160
I particularly like the
young Hollywood actress,

1159
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,120
Who said she would like to start
her theater career somewhere small.

1160
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:22,620
Like London or England.

1161
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,400
Why must you always do this?

1162
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,640
It's just a little joke.

1163
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,120
It's not a little joke, is it?

1164
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,000
Basically you're saying
what I do is worthless.

1165
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,360
I don't think it's worthless,
I just think you know in your heart that
you could be doing more with your life.

1166
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,600
More?

1167
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,560
Sharp's Magazine is one of the
most respected magazines in the world.

1168
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,960
There's a million hacks that would
give anything to be where I am.

1169
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,920
You know who I hung out
with just today?

1170
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,600
Orlando Bloom.

1171
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,440
I don't know who that is.

1172
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,280
Of course you don't know who that is,
you don't know who anyone is.

1173
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,380
You thought Brad Pitt was
a cave in Yorkshire.

1174
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,520
Most people do know
who that is.

1175
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,480
And most people wouldn't think a journalist
hanging out with celebrities like that

1176
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,680
was a disappointment.

1177
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,000
I don't think you're a disappointment.

1178
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,240
I never thought that.

1179
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,480
I'm sorry.

1180
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,560
I didn't mean to upset you.

1181
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,080
Things haven't been that
great actually, dad.

1182
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,840
I don't know why,
I can't seem to get ahead.

1183
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,640
If you're not happy...

1184
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,840
No, I'm fine.

1185
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,760
Really I can make it, I know it.

1186
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,480
Einstein said...

1187
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,640
try not to become a
man of success.

1188
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,880
Rather become a man of
value.

1189
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,960
The young lady in the bedroom there,
Alison, she wouldn't have anything to

1190
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,600
do with your desire to stay on,
would she?

1191
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,440
No.

1192
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:55,880
We're just friends.

1193
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,400
She says that New York women
don't go for losers.

1194
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,840
I suppose not.

1195
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,040
But Alison is from Port Huron
isn't she.

1196
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,160
Hi.

1197
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,280
Hi.

1198
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,720
That's a good look for you.

1199
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:59,240
I don't remember much from last
night but I'm so, so, sorry.

1200
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,360
Oh my god, your father.

1201
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And that woman.

1202
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,320
Oh, Mrs. Kowalski.

1203
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,080
Don't worry about it.

1204
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,360
The last woman she caught
me with had a penis, so...

1205
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,880
You're a big step up.

1206
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,920
Thanks.

1207
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,680
Who's that?

1208
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,360
That's my mother.

1209
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,560
No way.

1210
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,880
Is she a model?

1211
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,840
Actress.

1212
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,280
In movies?

1213
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,640
Some, you know,
British, small parts.

1214
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,760
And she still...

1215
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,600
No. She died when I was
young.

1216
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,320
Must be pretty cool having
your mum in movies.

1217
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,560
Well I used to stare at
the TV from time to time

1218
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,480
when I was growing up.

1219
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,000
You know, just kind of weird.

1220
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,400
Ok, a full English fry up.

1221
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,680
Perfect hang-over cure.

1222
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,240
Get your gob around that.

1223
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,360
Not again.

1224
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,200
Hi.

1225
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,840
I was just...

1226
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,600
rooting through your
personal possessions.

1227
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,000
I like the opening.

1228
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:39,880
You don't.

1229
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,840
Yeah.

1230
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,200
Got to read the rest of it. Believe it
or not I'm a pretty good editor.

1231
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,800
I don't know, I don't even
know if I'll bother finishing it.

1232
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,440
Keep true to the dreams of thy youth.

1233
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,920
Is that Troy again?

1234
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,600
It's Xilla.

1235
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,280
I'm going to jump in the shower and then
I'm going to get out of your hair.

1236
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,800
Well, wait 'cause I got you a present.

1237
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,320
I was walking past this record
shop in the corner, and I saw it,

1238
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,320
I thought it might...

1239
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
cheer you up.

1240
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,280
You said it was
your favourite film.

1241
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:20,880
That is... I don't even know
what to say.

1242
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,840
I don't have a turn-table.

1243
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,640
Well you can always come
here and listen to it.

1244
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,800
Are you kidding?

1245
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
I can throw up on you again.

1246
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,760
Come on.

1247
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,520
Come on.

1248
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,960
Come let me show you.

1249
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,160
Hey Alice.

1250
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,720
Versace? You like?

1251
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,920
I'm good thanks.

1252
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,120
You know honey, everybody needs to
change their look every now and then.

1253
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,680
Especially when they have
a new man in their lives.

1254
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:50,920
What?

1255
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,040
What are you talking about?

1256
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,000
Well the English guy is always
hanging around you these days right?.

1257
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,720
Tell me it isn't so?

1258
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,840
Of course not.

1259
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,760
Thank god, can you imagine.
He's such a creep.

1260
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,480
This is gorgeous, but
I'm just too fat.

1261
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,800
Don't be crazy.

1262
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,120
Alice.

1263
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,480
Is Anna fat?

1264
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,520
Not at all. Why, she's so thin that
I can take her little spindly body

1265
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,560
and snap her over my knee,
like a dry fucking twig.

1266
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,080
And for your information,
Sidney Young has more going for
him than anyone in this place.

1267
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,120
It works, that's good.

1268
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,800
Hey Alison.

1269
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,000
I was wondering if...

1270
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,200
Hey Alison I was wondering if you
wanted to see a movie or have a meal.

1271
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,880
Wanna go on a date?

1272
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,000
Might work.

1273
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,080
Hello.

1274
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,640
Hello Sidney.

1275
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,320
I like your costume Vincent.

1276
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,480
I'm not wearing a costume.

1277
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,280
- Idiot.
- Wanker.

1278
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,040
Ok, see you.

1279
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,440
George Hamilton.

1280
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,760
George Hamilton's not dead.

1281
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,960
Isn't he? Ok.

1282
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,240
I was looking for you actually.

1283
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:09,880
There was something I
wanted to tell you.

1284
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:10,800
Me first.

1285
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,040
I wanted to ask if maybe
you wanted to go to a movie...

1286
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:16,840
What?

1287
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,480
I can't understand what
you're saying.

1288
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,600
I just wanted to ask you
if, eh...

1289
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,480
Back in a minute.

1290
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,000
I wanted to tell you that...

1291
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,920
Laurence has left his wife and we're
going to be together... officially.

1292
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,840
That... that's just brilliant.

1293
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,400
So maybe he does care after all
right?

1294
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,440
I'm going to...

1295
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,040
So Alison told you that
we were getting together right?

1296
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:17,960
Yeah.

1297
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,840
I should have did it long ago.

1298
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,080
You know me, not very good at
expressing my emotions.

1299
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,320
You should be happy
for her.

1300
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,760
You being friends and all.

1301
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:35,880
Oh, Sidney.

1302
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,920
I thought as much.

1303
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,000
You really think you and Alison...
Things really didn't go all
that well for me did they?

1304
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,880
Ah well, give it your best shot.

1305
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,400
Take the Westside highway please.

1306
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,520
Wait.

1307
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,520
Let me write the
profile on Vincent.

1308
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,600
I don't think so.

1309
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,440
You get complete copy approval,
it will be like you wrote it.

1310
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,480
Vincent, think about it.

1311
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,840
Think of how humiliating
it will be for me.

1312
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,480
Please, I'm begging you.

1313
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,720
You don't look like you're begging.

1314
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,240
Westside Highway please.

1315
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,920
Sit down Sidney.

1316
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,160
Lawrence Maddox is no longer
working for Sharp's magazine.

1317
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,240
Seems Elizabeth got tired of him
screwing around and kicked him out.

1318
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,880
She kicked him out?

1319
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:30,800
Richard Heywood doesn't seem to like
the idea of employing an ex-son-in-law

1320
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,280
So he's gone.

1321
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,280
So is Alison Olsen.
Don't worry about Maddox.

1322
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,240
He's already got something lined
up with Gotham magazine.

1323
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,520
I going to need somebody
to hold the fort.

1324
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,640
At "I Spy".

1325
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,200
Strictly on a temporary basis,
you understand.

1326
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,400
Oh, one more thing.

1327
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,440
I had a call from Eleanor Johnson
this morning.

1328
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:58,800
Wanting to know if you would like
to write a profile on Vincent Lepak.

1329
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,040
I don't know how you did it Sidney,
but somehow you...

1330
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,080
made it to the next room.

1331
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,720
Vincent Lepak
Long live the King

1332
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,800
By Sidney Young

1333
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,520
Nice robe.

1334
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,240
Oh, thanks.

1335
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,920
Ralph Lauren, it was a gift.

1336
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,040
Who from?

1337
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,160
Ralph Lauren, I was
doing a piece and...

1338
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,640
I wanted to say congratulations,
I heard about your promotion.

1339
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,040
I'm really happy for you.

1340
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,400
Thanks.

1341
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,200
How's things going with you?

1342
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,200
Good, fine, everything's...

1343
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,200
I'm working for this
little literary magazine.

1344
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,080
It's in New York.

1345
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,440
So I left you a bunch of messages.

1346
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,720
Yeah, I know, I've been so busy.

1347
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,960
I thought so.

1348
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,160
How's the novel doing.

1349
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,480
I am still working on it.

1350
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,440
You should keep at it.

1351
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,760
I believe in you.

1352
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,880
Actually I never give you these.

1353
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,840
It's just... you know.
You don't have to use them.

1354
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,600
If you don't want to.

1355
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,280
I mean...

1356
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:01,840
You know...

1357
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,320
Oh hey Alice.

1358
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,640
Where did it all go so wrong?

1359
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,040
Bye.

1360
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,560
Sophie is going to get an Apollo Film
Awards nomination for best actress.

1361
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,320
Wow, that's great.

1362
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,760
But the nominations haven't
been announced yet.

1363
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,280
That is correct.

1364
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:40,400
Which is why we have absolutely
no way of knowing whether or not
she will be nominated.

1365
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,440
But when she is nominated,
we would like Sharp's to do a feature.

1366
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,360
Someone to cover the whole lead-up.

1367
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,080
Unrestricted access.

1368
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,320
The trajectory, the building
of this unique brand.

1369
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,240
I'm going to have a logo.

1370
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
So here's the deal.

1371
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,520
Sophie wants you to write the story.

1372
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,880
You can be my bitch.

1373
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,480
Merry Christmas Sidney.

1374
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,040
This is a cover story.

1375
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,720
I think a little celebration
is in order.

1376
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,960
You didn't do it.

1377
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,360
I couldn't do it, it's very high.

1378
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,240
What are you?

1379
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,160
A limpy pig.

1380
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,240
What?

1381
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,200
I'm your little limpy pig.

1382
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,480
Now it's time to pay the forfeit.

1383
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,280
What you got?

1384
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,040
I've got my little limpy pig dance.

1385
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,280
Give me your ring.

1386
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,280
I can't.

1387
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:38,800
Why not?

1388
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,640
I cannot.

1389
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,800
Give me your ring.

1390
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,020
I want it.

1391
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,120
I can't.

1392
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,600
Ok.

1393
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:54,520
If you give me your ring and I win
tomorrow, I'll let you have sex with me.

1394
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,480
Oh thank you Mike.

1395
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,080
I'll buy you a better one,
just as soon as I...

1396
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,320
No you won't.

1397
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,840
I'm always going to keep this one.

1398
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,600
I'll never part with it.

1399
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,800
Never, never, never.

1400
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,360
Let's do it properly.

1401
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,720
Please.

1402
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,120
What people don't realize is that
all saints start out as human beings.

1403
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,400
All human beings
fall in love.

1404
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,880
Well, well.
Look at you.

1405
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,200
Congratulations.

1406
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,080
Your fortune right.

1407
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,680
You go up and I go down.

1408
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:44,960
You're here with Sophie?

1409
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,760
How about doing your old rabbi
a favour. A little interview.

1410
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,600
Is Alison here?

1411
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,440
No.

1412
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,120
We went our separate ways.

1413
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,760
Actually she left me.

1414
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,200
She tells me she's in love
with someone else.

1415
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,120
Nope, not you I'm afraid Sidney.

1416
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,320
Some guy named Clark.

1417
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,440
Can you believe it?

1418
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,120
These are the sacrifices we make.

1419
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,640
I don't need to tell you.

1420
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,680
This is not a vacation, vocation...

1421
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,160
So here I am, at the
center of everything.

1422
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,080
I got the tux, I got
the watch.

1423
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,560
I got the life.

1424
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,560
I am exactly where
I wanted to be.

1425
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,960
I've made it to Shangri La.

1426
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,440
I gonna have to have the ring back.

1427
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,640
What are you doing?

1428
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:04,800
Hey, what are you doing.

1429
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,320
What's he doing?

1430
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:06,840
Give me the ring back.

1431
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,920
My mother gave me this ring,
she told me to give it to the one.
She's not the one!

1432
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,320
I don't want to be on the inside,
I do not want to be at the party.

1433
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,560
I don't want to have sex with you.

1434
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,200
I killed Cuba.

1435
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,080
Fucking fucker!

1436
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,140
Sodom and Gomorrah.

1437
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,600
Sidney Young.

1438
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:14,600
Hey Vincent.

1439
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:15,800
Sidney.

1440
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:20,720
Fuck.

1441
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,600
Have a nice flight.

1442
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,360
I need a ticket to New York
please.

1443
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,800
The next available flight isn't until
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

1444
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,560
It arrives at New York at
6:30 pm local time.

1445
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,280
There's nothing sooner?

1446
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,360
No, I'm afraid not.

1447
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,360
Fine I'll take it.

1448
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,640
Hi, you've reached Alison
please leave a message.

1449
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,280
Oh and Joe if that's you I've got
the tickets for Empire brook tomorrow.

1450
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,120
See you there.
Bye.

1451
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:27,440
Alison's it's me, it's Sidney.

1452
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:31,120
Listen, my battery is very low...

1453
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:31,920
Can I see you?

1454
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,560
I don't think I'm going to be
working for Sharp's any more.

1455
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:35,680
But it's fine.

1456
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,280
I thought I wanted all that stuff.

1457
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,320
I wanted to be special.

1458
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,640
To have the money and be treated
differently to anybody else.

1459
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,480
Can I have an upgrade.

1460
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,080
But I don't, ok?

1461
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,800
Who's Joe?

1462
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,680
Can I get your autograph?

1463
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,520
What, 'cause I'm on the TV?

1464
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,880
'Cause I'm up there close to
the movie stars?

1465
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,920
You think I'm special?

1466
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,720
For your credit card.

1467
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,200
Yes.

1468
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,640
Do you have any baggage?

1469
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,800
Plenty.

1470
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,760
Stop the car, stop the car.

1471
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,240
Hi.

1472
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,120
Hi.

1473
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,680
How's the novel coming on?

1474
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,120
It's finished.

1475
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,520
Thanks for the editing.
