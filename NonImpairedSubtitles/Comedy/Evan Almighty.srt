1
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,625
And that's the news.

2
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:13,695
But before we sign off, we'd like
to congratulate our very own Evan Baxter,

3
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,573
who has just been elected
Buffalo's representative to Congress.

4
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,975
And, now, we have a surprise for Evan.

5
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,603
No, you don't.
We do.

6
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,547
Oh, no. I really didn't expect this.

7
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,846
Here's a look back at his run for office.

8
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,681
What are we gonna do?

9
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,189
Change the world!

10
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,281
That's right!

11
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,591
Baxter! Baxter! Baxter!

12
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,565
Hi.

13
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,007
Baxter! Baxter!

14
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,510
That's right!

15
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,248
I feel like that old Indian
in front of all the garbage.

16
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:07,716
So, for the last time, this is Evan Baxter
for Eyewitness News. Good night.

17
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,541
Huntsville, Virginia.
Prestige Crest, four miles.

18
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,138
What did we do before GPS?

19
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,239
Nothing.

20
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,511
Guys, Dad's very proud of his new car.

21
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:37,215
Hey, I am proud of my new car.
Look, I'm a politician now.

22
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,191
I'm in the public eye, and as you know,
when you are in the public eye,

23
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,921
image is everything, isn't it?

24
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,800
Here it is! Welcome to the good life.

25
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:53,236
Hey, guys, why the long faces?
We're off on a new adventure!

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,401
It's just we're going to miss our friends.

27
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,307
You'll make new friends, better friends.

28
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,572
Yeah, richer friends.

29
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,480
Do not mouth off to me, sir.
I am the boss of you.

30
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,144
And let me tell you something,
you guys are gonna love this place.

31
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,882
And you know what? I think there's
something for our fishermen up there.

32
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,151
Baxter family,
this is what's called a scenic vista.

33
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:18,061
And I don't think the big man himself
could do a better job. Pretty cool, huh?

34
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,961
Hey, Dad, an iguana can stay underwater
for 28 minutes.

35
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,057
What's that?

36
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,931
And a shrimp's heart is in its head.
Really?

37
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,232
Okay, someone's had enough Animal Planet
for one lifetime.

38
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,239
Yeah, let's head out! Come on.
The best is yet to come!

39
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,772
Gentlemen, I have saved
the best for last.

40
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,371
Look over to the right.
That is your new home.

41
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,678
Whoa!

42
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:43,949
That's our house?

43
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,082
Uh-huh.
I don't remember it being
this big in the brochure.

44
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,456
Was it this big in the brochure?

45
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,789
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

46
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,419
There they are!

47
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,091
Is this curb appeal or what?

48
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,691
Here we go!

49
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,292
Honey, I think you're blocking my photo.

50
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,394
Sorry.

51
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,439
All right, everybody! Say "Escrow"!

52
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,371
Escrow!

53
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,204
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Go. Go. Go.

54
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,747
Guys, easy.

55
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,377
This is our house?

56
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,441
Uh-huh.

57
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,514
Careful!

58
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,453
- Honey, be careful!
- Watch it!

59
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,683
Are you kidding me?

60
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,986
- Mom, can we go upstairs?
- Yep.

61
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,458
And I get my own room, right?
Yep.

62
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,556
Mr. Baxter, could you give us some
direction on these kitchen cabinets?

63
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,621
Sure.

64
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,261
Okay, it's between your maple
and your old-growth Brazilian cherry.

65
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,202
That is nice! Which is best?

66
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,333
Well, if you're not sensitive
to that "save the rainforest" stuff,

67
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,899
you can't beat the Brazilian cherry.

68
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,103
It's 200, 300 years old.

69
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,702
Three hundred years.
Three hundred.

70
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,304
Wow. That is old.

71
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,680
And now you are going to hold my dishes.

72
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,480
That's right. You going with the cherry?
Cheery cherry!

73
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,019
Yeah. Definitely.
He's going with the cherry!

74
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,347
Dad, look!

75
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,720
No, no, no!

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,259
Ryan, do not touch him, please!

77
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,885
Oh, no, no, no, no, get him away!

78
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,226
No. He might have lice, fleas,
maggots or something.

79
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,062
You do not play with stray dogs
because they are very...

80
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,466
No, no! Get away, get away! Go!

81
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,627
Okay. Oh, no, no, no.

82
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,138
He's thirsty.
No, no, no.

83
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:10,107
No, you don't! There we go.

84
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,803
Well, Ryan, he's a stray.

85
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,345
If we give him water,
he's just going to come back.

86
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,940
Come on, Dad, why can't we keep him?
I mean, we've got a new house.

87
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,984
Okay, Ryan, this is why we can't keep him.

88
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,646
They are stinky. They are smelly.
They get hair all over the place.

89
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,949
They get a little thing called the mange.

90
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:26,048
In a nutshell, he is disgusting.
Case in point.

91
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,228
Ladies and gentlemen,
this concludes day one

92
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,892
of the Baxters' new and exciting Life.

93
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,266
I have to do the new house dance.

94
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,863
Wow! That dance?

95
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,498
Mmm-hmm.
That's a good new house dance.

96
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,803
Thank you.

97
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,071
You know, those boys were having
so much fun tonight,

98
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,113
I thought I would never get them to bed.

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,845
And then Ryan did the cutest thing.
He asked if we could all pray together.

100
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,913
Really? What did you pray about?

101
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,081
He met a dog. What do you think
he prayed for?

102
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,857
Just a walking petri dish, that dog.

103
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,124
And Jordan was very precise.

104
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,998
He prayed for good visibility, good weather
on the hiking trip tomorrow.

105
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,333
The hiking trip? Oh, right. Yeah.
The hiking trip. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

106
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,305
You wanna know what I prayed for?

107
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,274
Yeah. What did you pray for?

108
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,436
I prayed we would become closer
as a family.

109
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:25,107
Honey, you don't need to pray for that
to happen. I will make that happen.

110
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,314
What would you pray for?

111
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,948
Me? I don't know. Praying just...

112
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,693
Honey, you're the one who said
you wanted to change the world.

113
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,097
It's a pretty big job.

114
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,629
If it were me,
I would take all the help I could get.

115
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,334
Former Buffalo News
anchor, Evan Baxter, takes office tomorrow

116
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,742
to make good on a Lofty campaign promise.

117
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,972
What are we going to do?

118
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,308
Change the world!

119
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,839
Good Luck, Congressman.
Many have tried, many have failed.

120
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,112
Hello!

121
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,086
This is Regina Sparks reporting for...

122
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,336
Hello, there. Hi.

123
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,774
This is Evan Baxter.

124
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,813
Just wanted to say thank you for everything.

125
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,715
Thank you for the new car and for the house.

126
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,720
The house is great. I love it.

127
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,122
I mean, I picked it out,
but you created matter and everything, so...

128
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,130
I just wanted to say that I think
Joan makes a good point,

129
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,729
and that I am now in a position
of great power,

130
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,673
and I know that with great power
comes great responsibility.

131
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,972
So, God,

132
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,251
Please help me change the world.

133
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,021
Okay. That's it. I'm hanging up now.

134
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,427
God bless... Well, you. Okay.

135
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,544
What? That's weird.

136
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,678
What?

137
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,346
I set the alarm for 7:00.

138
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,548
I am successful. I am powerful.
I am handsome.

139
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,287
I am happy, successful,
powerful, handsome, happy.

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:28,698
All right, everyone, wish me luck.
The Congressman has left the building.

141
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:33,569
All right, Baxter brood, I will see you
later on this afternoon for the big hike. Yes?

142
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,833
You psyched? Are you ready?

143
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,931
Yeah.

144
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,270
Bye. See you.
Good luck, honey.

145
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,503
Bye, guys!
See you later.

146
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,567
Later, gator.

147
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,911
Oh, gosh.

148
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,712
Wow. Honey, did you order anything?

149
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,219
"Alpha and Omega Hardware"?

150
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,276
Never heard of them.

151
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,515
Me either.

152
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,952
What do we have?

153
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,883
What is this stuff?

154
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,020
Must have the wrong address.

155
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,796
Yup. The wrong address.

156
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
Congressman Baxter. Good morning.
Good morning.

157
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,062
Good morning, Congressman
Baxter. Hello.

158
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,574
Good morning, Congressman
Baxter. Good morning.

159
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,635
Oh, this is so cool.

160
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,772
Uh-huh.

161
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,646
Yeah. This'll work.

162
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,677
There he is! The head honcho.
The big kahuna.

163
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,689
Rita, I think I have to do the dance.

164
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,917
Do the dance.

165
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,824
That's enough of the dance.

166
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,057
Oh, this is nice! This is really nice!

167
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,760
This is too nice.
There's something crooked going on.

168
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,063
Do you smell anthrax?

169
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,036
Congressman!
Hey, Marty!

170
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,538
Nice sound to that.
I like it.

171
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,595
Here they are!

172
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,832
All right.

173
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,672
You remember Sarah, Allen, Michael.

174
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,441
I don't think you know the new kid
Eugene Tennanbaum. I found him at G.W.

175
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,642
Sort of a walking search engine. Watch this.
How many stars on the flag in 1818?

176
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,706
15.

177
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,719
And Congressman Baxter's coffee habits?

178
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,847
He likes a morning latte with a cruller,
a decaf espresso after lunch,

179
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,550
served sans pastry of any kind.

180
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,287
Very impressive. A little freaky,
but I like this kid.

181
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,960
I love you.

182
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,919
Hmm?

183
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,923
I mean, we should hang out socially.
I just got a ping-pong table.

184
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,526
Not going to happen.

185
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,869
Go find out where his license plates are.
Everybody else, back to your holes.

186
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,964
He was actually right.

187
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,839
I'm doing a background check on that kid.

188
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,606
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office,
to remind you of the mission!

189
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,115
"Change the world!"

190
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,912
Okay, Evan, who do you know?
What do you mean?

191
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,976
Oh, come on.
Yesterday we're in the basement.

192
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,885
Today, look at this place.
It's like the Emerald City!

193
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,220
"Enjoy your office.
Your neighbor, Congressman Long."

194
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,590
Congressman Long did this?
Did you say "neighbor"?

195
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,459
That's right. He lives in Prestige Crest,
right up the street.

196
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,365
Evan, you got to tell me these things.
Think of the publicity angle on this!

197
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,835
You and Congressman Long
having a barbecue.

198
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,838
Congressman Long eating your hot dog.

199
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,567
Hate to break up
your little weenie roast.

200
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,303
Congressman Long's assistant
just dropped this off.

201
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,776
The Congressman would like for you

202
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,075
to junior cosponsor this bill
that he's introducing.

203
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,447
Hold on. Congressman Long asked us to
junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?

204
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,112
The Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act.

205
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,453
Never heard of it. Gene, here, now.
Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?

206
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,616
I just did.

207
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,387
You need to tell me about it
before I need to know about it.

208
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,588
Marty, you are not the vice congressman.
I am the legislative...

209
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,429
Nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot
in the head, you do not automatically...

210
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,400
If Evan got shot in the head,
you're the first suspect.

211
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,527
Play nice. Play nice.

212
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,696
All right, Eugene, Congressman Long's bill.
What is it?

213
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,798
HR7124, better known as CINPLAN.

214
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,537
The bill would open up fringe areas
of the national parks for development.

215
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,976
Long's been sitting on it for ages...

216
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,105
Got it. Pause. Come on, Evan, this is huge.

217
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,614
You hitch your wagon to the right star,

218
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,913
you could ride all the way down
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

219
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,384
This is day one.

220
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,614
You got your name on a major piece
of legislation!

221
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,624
Oh, and another thing,
he wants you to read it today.

222
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,319
Well, I can't do it today.

223
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,553
I promised my kids...
Eugene.

224
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,528
Well, sir, there's a time clock on the bill.

225
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,690
If Congressman Long wants to
pass it this quarter,

226
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,893
he's going to have to introduce it
to the committee immediately.

227
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,562
I'm personally going with whatever
Congressman Baxter decides,

228
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,538
because if I could be like one man,
it'd be him.

229
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,938
Either him or Kareem.

230
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,100
Can I tase him?

231
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,268
Gene! Heel!

232
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,777
It’s probably be you.

233
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,542
Come on, Evan, this is it!
This is why we came here!

234
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,550
It's world-changing time!

235
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,716
Hey, anybody home?

236
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,120
Come on. We're in here!

237
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,919
Hey, guys.

238
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,792
Dad, guess what? I got all your stuff
packed up so that we can...

239
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,256
What's wrong?

240
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,864
We're not going, are we?

241
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:26,803
First things first.
I have been asked to junior cosponsor a bill.

242
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,564
Yeah.

243
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,075
See? I told you. And you owe me five bucks.

244
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,576
Whoa, whoa, guys.

245
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,478
Hey. Hey, we said we would
have to make sacrifices, right?

246
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,880
Yeah. Whatever.
New house, same old dad.

247
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,941
Hey, I'm the one who has to read this thing!

248
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,388
Hey. Did you hear?
Junior cosponsor of a bill.

249
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:50,390
Okay, Ry, let's clean all this stuff up.
Dad's got work to do.

250
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,979
No. It's 6:14.

251
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,917
Of course. Voodoo clock speaks again.

252
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,519
What the...

253
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,896
Hey! Hey! Hey! No. Okay.

254
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,936
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! What's going on?

255
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,301
I got a delivery for Evan Baxter!

256
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,203
Yeah, that's not mine. I didn't order that!

257
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,005
I just deliver, guy, huh?
You got a complaint, call the number!

258
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,071
No! Hey! Listen! We are 416, not 614!

259
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:47,482
You've got the wrong house!
You can't leave that there!

260
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,021
Listen! Listen!

261
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,216
That's going to leave a brown patch!

262
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,117
I am a U.S. Congressman!

263
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,006
Dad, what are you doing? I'm watching this.

264
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,731
Genesis 6:14.

265
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,146
Gen 6:14.

266
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,580
Joan! Do we have a Bible anywhere?

267
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,926
Genesis 6:14.

268
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,485
"Make thee an ark of gopher wood..."

269
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,462
Gopher wood.

270
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,546
"Go-four-wood." Get it?

271
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,012
Well, it's not really gopher wood.
I just like the wordplay.

272
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,453
No, it's pine and maple.

273
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:01,015
It was clear-cut from this valley
to make room for all those houses.

274
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,788
Excuse me. Do I know you?

275
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,385
Not as well as I'd like.

276
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,766
I see you got my housewarming gift.

277
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,359
That was you? You sent those?

278
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,031
What are they for? Hey! Hey.

279
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,700
Genesis, chapter six, verse fourteen.

280
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,770
I want you to build an ark.

281
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,142
You want me to build an ark.

282
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,407
Yes.

283
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:27,578
So that's why the tools.
And you are responsible for the wood?

284
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,647
All right. Well, let's just start over.

285
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,818
Hello, I am Evan...

286
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,453
Evan Baxter. Born June 15, 1962.

287
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,996
Eight pounds, 11 ounces.

288
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,500
Mother's Carroll Ann Parker.
Father, Eugene Evan Baxter.

289
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,466
You have internet access. Very impressive.
Do you also have cable?

290
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,974
You're a clean freak. You care much
too much about your outward appearance.

291
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,636
Your left nipple is a quarter inch higher
than your right nipple.

292
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,737
And when you were a little boy,
you were afraid of Gumby.

293
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,307
Who are you?

294
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,845
I'm God.

295
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,513
You're God?

296
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:07,855
Yes. And I want you, Evan Baxter,
to build an ark.

297
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:13,989
Okay. You know what? This conversation
is a little thing I like to call over!

298
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:18,935
But I got to get going,
because, frankly, I have an ark to build.

299
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,065
Busy, busy, busy, busy. Nice meeting you.
Take care. Oh, and...

300
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,771
All right, see you later!

301
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,583
Shake it off, Evan. It's over.
The nutcase is gone.

302
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,817
I am successful, I'm powerful,
I'm handsome, I'm happy.

303
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,155
Successful, powerful, handsome, happy.

304
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,759
Get it out, son. It's the beginning of wisdom.

305
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,923
How did you get in here?
I'm calling the cops.

306
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,934
Oh, no. No need! Look! Look.
There's one right there. Right there.

307
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:55,469
Officer! Officer! Officer! Carjacker!
Carjacker in the car! Carjacker in the car!

308
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,509
Careful pulling out.
Pedestrian in the crosswalk.

309
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,040
Shake it off, shake it off!
Shake it off, shake it off!

310
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,310
Good morning, chief!

311
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,614
Good morning, Rita.

312
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,283
You almost scared me to death!
What's wrong with you?

313
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,292
Nothing. Just sort of a weird ride in.

314
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,349
Weird how?

315
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,861
It was just a weird ride in.

316
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,993
Okay, well, thanks for clarifying.

317
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,492
Here's your mail and your schedule.
Okay.

318
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,833
And they finally fixed the phones.
My new extension is 614.

319
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,299
614.

320
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,637
Yeah. 614?

321
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,836
Right.

322
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,045
You want me to write that down?

323
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,945
I'd rather you didn't.

324
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,273
Good morning.

325
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,843
Hey, Long came through with that seat
on the House Resource Committee.

326
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,446
You stuck in your thumb
and pulled out a plum, my friend.

327
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,458
Also, the new Congressional plates
just came in.

328
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,984
Gene, plates, now.
And Alex at the Buffalo office had her baby.

329
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,825
Boy or girl?
A little boy. And here he is.

330
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,026
Just as cute as a button. Not bad
for such an ugly woman. Weighed in at...

331
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,864
Six pounds, 14 ounces.

332
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,831
How'd you know that?

333
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,997
Lucky guess.

334
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,009
Hot, hot, hot! Hot off the press!
It's a joke. Here are your plates, sir.

335
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,407
Those are rock-star plates, man.
You can park anywhere.

336
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,540
You can't be sitting in a chair.

337
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,106
You've got a committee meeting
in five minutes.

338
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:51,122
Come on, BMIC, Big Man in Congress.
Evan Baxter, the shark on the move.

339
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,625
House Resources Committee
is now in order.

340
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,894
The Chair recognizes the congresswoman
from Tennessee

341
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,436
to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

342
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,698
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

343
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,069
I pledge allegiance to the flag

344
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,836
of the United States of America

345
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,504
and to the Republic, for which it stands...

346
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,514
...one nation, under me...
One nation, under God...

347
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,780
Indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

348
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,518
How long do you want to do this, son?
I've got all eternity.

349
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,795
Hey. You okay, young man?

350
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,834
What happened?
You fainted.

351
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,738
Dropped like a leaf
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

352
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,369
Chuck Long,
Resources Committee Chairman.

353
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,040
Oh. Oh. Congressman Long. Yes.
Oh, I'm so sorry about...

354
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:54,211
Forget it! Many a man's been humbled
by his first day in Congress.

355
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,685
So, how'd you like that office?

356
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,654
Oh, it was great. Yes. Thank you, sir.

357
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,884
Not bad for a freshman dorm room, huh?

358
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,920
So here's the skinny.

359
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,053
I'm bringing you into my land use bill

360
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,223
because you strike me as the type of guy
who knows how to hit the ground running.

361
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,894
Yes, sir. I read the bill, and it's great.
I just had a few questions.

362
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,096
Hey, I wrote the thing
and I have a few questions.

363
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,368
We'll get to the questions later.
So, you with us?

364
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,965
Yes, sir. I'm in.
Wonderful!

365
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,034
I'll need you to put that into
a letter of intent,

366
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,478
as soon as you're feeling up to it,
of course. You get yourself better.

367
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,014
Enjoy that office.

368
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,481
Thank you, sir.

369
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,112
He's exhausted from reading that bill.
I got woozy from just carrying it.

370
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,553
Evan, sit down.

371
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,612
Evan, what happened to you?

372
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,989
You can't faint during the Pledge
of Allegiance. It's un-American.

373
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,322
Oh, good. The doctor's here.

374
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,419
Say "ah."

375
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,958
Just go home, get some rest
and start on that ark. You hear me?

376
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,315
You're right on time.

377
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,790
Long just called. He's on his way with the
powers that be. Who are they, Gene? Talk.

378
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,918
Congressman Jim Dodd,
head of Ways and Means.

379
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,293
But don't worry, sir,
he's definitely not "way mean."

380
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,956
That's speculation.
I don't know him personally...

381
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,226
That's too much, Gene. Who else?

382
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,291
Congressman Richard Stamp,
head of Commerce,

383
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,802
and Bob Hughes is Transportation.

384
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,132
I have a draft of your support letter.

385
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,105
Sounds like a plan.
Are you all right?

386
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,197
I'm good.

387
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,072
You sure you're good? Okay.

388
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,244
Good morning, chief.
Good morning, Rita.

389
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,541
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

390
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,411
You don't look so good.
That's what I said.

391
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,474
You're all jumpy. Are you on that Fen-Phen?

392
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,577
Guys, I'm fine. I'll be inside.

393
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,963
No, no, no, no.

394
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:15,669
No. Okay. No, no. No. No, no. No.

395
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,500
No, no, no. Oh, my gosh!

396
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:24,975
Guys! No, no! Get out! Get out! Oh, my hair!

397
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,610
Gentlemen, welcome.
What an honor to have you here.

398
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,052
I'm Marty Stringer.
I'm Congressman Baxter's chief of staff.

399
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,248
This is Rita Daniels, his executive assistant.

400
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,253
Are you ready, sir?

401
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:38,422
Just a minute. No, no, no, no.
Dirty, dirty, dirty! Big one!

402
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,960
Baxter's only a freshman, sir, but I think
you'll find he is locked and loaded.

403
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,059
Good. Maybe this young stud can help me
get these old mares on board.

404
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,228
Oh, you'll be impressed.

405
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,966
Gentlemen, good to see you.

406
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:58,748
Do you want to explain yourself,
Congressman? What is going on?

407
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,951
Oh, these

408
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,382
Are birds.

409
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,016
What are they doing here?
How did they get in here?

410
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,890
Well, that is an excellent question.

411
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,226
And my response to said question is,

412
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,198
they are trained

413
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,229
aviaries, sir.

414
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,704
Let me make you see
what I'm talking about.

415
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:29,545
I can make any sort of movement,
and they will not get off!

416
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,946
Do you have a point, Congressman?

417
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,644
Hey, guys, what's the point?

418
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,315
What's my point?

419
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,122
I'll tell you.

420
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,352
The point is

421
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,890
that man

422
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,500
needs to dominate creatures

423
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,834
and, ultimately, man must

424
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:59,266
dictate what happens in this country.

425
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,545
God bless America.

426
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:08,882
I couldn't agree more.

427
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,477
You have got to be kidding me.

428
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,715
No, of course not.

429
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,556
We lost a huge project last year
because of the red-headed woodpecker.

430
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,595
Those environmentalists got so up in arms

431
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,529
over the potential disappearance
of one stupid bird...

432
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:21,997
Yeah, birds are stupid sometimes.

433
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,763
...we lost over $25 million in business.

434
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,930
I see where you're going with this,
Congressman. Good work!

435
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:31,635
Your little display has obviously
hit a chord. Gentlemen.

436
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:40,851
From now on, let's keep the surprises
to a maximum of, say, none. Understood?

437
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,614
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

438
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,925
Evan, that was brilliant. Risky, but brilliant.

439
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,628
What the...

440
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:04,732
I'll tell you one thing, these birds had
a nice big meal before they flew in here.

441
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,276
You want me to get my BB gun?

442
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,505
You know what I want you to do?
I want you to open the door.

443
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,604
Open the door?

444
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,807
Just open the door!

445
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,146
Close the door after I leave! Just do it!

446
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,242
Okay.

447
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,254
One, two, three!

448
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,552
Man, if I get the bird flu,
he is paying for my medical bills!

449
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,740
Sheep!

450
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,416
Oh, no.

451
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,356
Oh, gosh.

452
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,428
Go, go, go! Get out!

453
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,723
Okay. No.

454
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,594
No. No.

455
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,166
I'm not doing this. It's insane!

456
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,398
No!

457
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,035
Enough already!

458
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,598
See, if you had an ark,
you'd have a place to put them all.

459
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,440
Why are you doing this? Why me?

460
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:53,014
It's not time yet. Go on. Go on.

461
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,948
Yeah, go on.

462
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,216
So how about it?
Feel like living on the edge?

463
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,661
Beautiful, isn't it?
I remember creating this valley.

464
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,097
Notice how the mountains line up
east to west.

465
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,505
That's so there'd be lots of sunshine.

466
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,042
Where are we?

467
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,240
Don't recognize it, eh?

468
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,436
No.

469
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,750
This is where you live, son.
This is Prestige Crest.

470
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,586
I wanted you to see the original design.

471
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,765
So, you're really him, aren't you?

472
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,277
You want more proof? I haven't done
the pillar of salt thing in a while.

473
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,939
That's all right. I believe you. I just...
I don't understand why you chose me.

474
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,846
You want to change the world, son.

475
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,484
So do I.

476
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:08,451
What? Well, why an ark?
I mean, that's like flood territory.

477
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:12,860
You wouldn't do that again.
You wouldn't do that. Would you do that?

478
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,661
Let's just say that whatever I do,

479
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,392
I do because I love you.

480
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:23,531
Well, then you have to understand
that this whole building-an-ark thing

481
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,098
is really not part of my plans here.

482
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,077
I need to settle into my house.
I need to make a good impression at work.

483
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,841
What?

484
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,409
Your plans. That's just...

485
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,985
What are you talking...

486
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,523
We're talking about an ark, right?
I mean, an ark?

487
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,082
An ark is huge!
I don't even know where I would begin!

488
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,984
Well, I hear that a lot.

489
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,692
People want to change the world,
don't know how to begin.

490
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,967
You want to know
how to change the world, son?

491
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,834
One act of random kindness at a time.

492
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,948
Build the ark.

493
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,079
I'll tell you what. You build it, I'll fill it.

494
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:16,525
And if anybody asks,
tell them a flood's coming.

495
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,129
Oh, and you might need this.

496
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,997
Well, okay. Okay, so what do I do?
I grab the wood and...

497
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,563
Well, okay.

498
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,974
You know, that's just cruel.

499
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,036
Do you see him?

500
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,649
I don't see him.

501
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,182
"Building an Ark the Old-Fashioned Way."

502
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,751
"God is the creator of
the Heavens and the Earth.

503
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:54,730
"He lives in all things and has over
six billion seven hundred million children."

504
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,451
Honey? You okay?
You need something?

505
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,791
No, nothing. Just dropped something.

506
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,465
Okay. Okay.

507
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,839
Yeah.

508
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,900
There we go. Okay.

509
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,479
Come on. I mean, a beard?
A beard's so dirty.

510
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,348
Gross!

511
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,620
Packing, so it would really help me
out if you would...

512
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,786
Good morning.

513
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:31,920
Hey, hey, hey, good morning.

514
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,323
Wow.

515
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,996
What's with the scruffle, mountain man?

516
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:42,370
Oh, well, you know, I figured it was
a weekend, and I thought...

517
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,566
What?

518
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,377
Honey, did I miss something?
How long have you been growing that?

519
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,675
I'll get the door!

520
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,374
Congratulations!

521
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,714
What are you talking about?

522
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,687
The lots. You bought the lots next door!

523
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,621
Hello!

524
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,615
Oh...

525
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:11,161
And pulling the down payment out of
your home equity? Very gutsy move.

526
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,430
I didn't do that, did I?

527
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,004
You sure did. So what's your plan?
What are you gonna do?

528
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,234
Turn them for a quick profit?
Build them out on spec?

529
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,841
Who wants champagne? Hip, hip hooray!

530
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,450
You bought eight lots?

531
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,953
Yup. I was going to surprise you.

532
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,623
"Surprise, surprise, surprise." Gomer Pyle.

533
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,220
What are you doing?
We can't afford that.

534
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,698
Hey, Mom. John Lennon,
good to see you again.

535
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,359
Good to see you.

536
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,265
And eight lots? What are you going to
do with eight lots?

537
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,942
I don't know.
Maybe I'll build a boat.

538
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,841
Did you say "build a boat"?

539
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,743
It might be something fun for the family.

540
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,011
We could take the boat,
go sailing on the lake.

541
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,043
It'd be great in case it floods or something.

542
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,111
What is going on with you?

543
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:09,353
You bought all those lots
and you're talking about building a boat.

544
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,327
Yeah.
And you grow this crazy beard!

545
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,953
Is this, like, a midlife crisis?

546
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,395
It's not that bad!

547
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,489
It's not?
No.

548
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,397
Why do you think they call it a crisis?

549
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,601
Hey, keep it down, you guys! Okay?

550
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,839
Oh, my God.

551
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,239
Honey?

552
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,640
Oh, my God.

553
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,070
Honey?

554
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,140
I know this sounds crazy.

555
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,652
I really think I need to do this.

556
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,452
Okay.

557
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,853
Build your boat.

558
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,362
Just don't take too long, okay?

559
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:52,664
Because we didn't leave our lives in Buffalo
so you could sail the S.S. Depression.

560
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,384
Here we go.

561
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,049
Gentlemen, I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've assembled you here today.

562
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,926
An Argentine lake duck has
a penis as long as its body.

563
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,988
Wow, that's huge. He must be proud.

564
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:26,264
So, I have come up with a little
construction project for us this weekend.

565
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,463
The whole weekend?

566
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:28,903
The whole weekend. Yes!

567
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,868
And maybe a couple weekends after that.

568
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,102
I can do this. Help!

569
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,347
How do I stand up with a piece of wood?
Here we go.

570
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,578
Oh, man. Okay, that's good.

571
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,885
Mother! Father! Sister! Brother! Wow!

572
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,548
Keep it straight.

573
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,690
Hey, Dad, he's back!

574
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,453
Ryan, no, don't do...

575
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,521
Ow!

576
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,403
Leverage it up! Leverage. Okay.

577
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,062
Just put some leverage.
You got to put some body weight.

578
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,197
Ready? One, two, three. Come on.

579
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,803
Oh, I'm an idiot.

580
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:12,315
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Congressman.
Why do you have raw beef hands?"

581
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,408
"Well, I'm building an ark."

582
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,254
I got a boo-boo! I got a boo-boo!
I got a boo-boo!

583
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:30,932
You ever hear of Home Depot?
Here we go! Here we go! Oh, yeah!

584
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:45,171
All right. So our little Marlboro Man
moment didn't work out so well.

585
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:48,116
It's a disaster. I don't know
how to build something like this.

586
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,812
That's easy. Just don't.

587
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,249
Wow.

588
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,192
Hello.

589
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,356
Yes, Marty. Your fearless leader is right here.

590
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,693
Hey, Marty, what's up?

591
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,704
Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you.

592
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,349
I might need security. Thank you.

593
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,218
Can I help you?

594
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,614
Rita, it's me.

595
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,618
Why do you sound like Evan Baxter,
but look like a Bee Gee?

596
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,161
Okay. All right.

597
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,530
Okay, that's great. It's longer.

598
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,432
Oh, my God. It is you.

599
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,129
Evan, what happened?

600
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,365
Did you fall in a mine shaft?

601
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,464
No.

602
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,599
Did you just come out of a coma?

603
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:45,699
No.

604
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,903
Were you attacked by a werewolf?

605
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,240
No, I wasn't.

606
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,214
Well, if you were going for that rugged look,
you overshot it.

607
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,841
You look like a bum in a suit.

608
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,011
You need Super cuts and a shave.

609
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,682
Right! Yeah. But I can't. It doesn't work.

610
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,384
What do you mean, it doesn't work?

611
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,790
It doesn't work!

612
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,521
What? Are you shooting up Rogaine?

613
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:08,087
Rita, if Evan shows up... I'm sorry, sir.
I'll be with you in just one...

614
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,830
Evan?
Take it in. Take it in.

615
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,698
Okay, yeah, to answer any questions
you may have,

616
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,897
I am going through adult puberty!

617
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,372
This is all temporary.
Why did you bring me down here?

618
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,533
What was so important?

619
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,338
What is so important?

620
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,107
I've got a letter of intent here
about Congressman Long's bill.

621
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,272
You remember that, don't you?

622
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,408
Well, you haven't been here and now
he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!

623
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,749
No, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope.
Not gonna happen.

624
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,687
No. You can't do that.
Not looking like that. You have to go shave!

625
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,054
I can't shave, Marty.
When I shave, it grows back out.

626
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,060
That happens when you shave!
But then you shave again!

627
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,618
You have no idea.

628
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,689
Evan, what is going on?

629
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:43,926
I'm...

630
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,235
Building something.

631
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,471
You're building something?

632
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,239
Well, I hope it's a barber shop.

633
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,213
Guys, I can't let Long see me
this way, okay?

634
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:01,479
You're gonna have to tell him I'm sick.
Just cover for me. Just help me out!

635
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,680
Come on, Evan, be reasonable.
You got to get rid of that beard.

636
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,623
I need your face back. I need you back.

637
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,388
Can you at least tell me
what you're building?

638
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,521
I'm building a boat.
You're building a boat?

639
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,259
Look, you got to cover for me.
I don't want anybody to see...

640
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,563
Congressman! There you are!

641
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,604
Congressman Long, I, I, I, I...

642
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,663
Stop stammering, son.
We all play hooky from time to time.

643
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:27,507
I'm not gonna turn you in to the principal.
Mostly because I am the principal.

644
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,003
Very good.

645
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,514
What's with the veil?
Did you get your new set of braces?

646
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:36,041
No, no. No. That's hilarious, though.

647
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,953
Would you drop that thing, son?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

648
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,130
It's a wife thing, sir.

649
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,997
Just trying to spice up the love life.

650
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,303
She's a big Loggins and Messina fan.

651
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,704
Keeping it fresh. Keeping it real.

652
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,437
Would you excuse us for a moment?

653
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,945
The Congressman and I are going to
have a little chat.

654
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,077
Come on.

655
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,382
Nice, isn't it? Politics is dog-eat-dog,

656
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,048
but if you survive, they give you
a bigger den. Have a seat.

657
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:17,150
So, tell me, Congressman,
are you freaking out on me or what?

658
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,216
No, sir.

659
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,594
Oh, come on, son. I hand you
your first cosponsor ship of a bill,

660
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,963
and when you finally show up
you look like the fifth Beatle.

661
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,366
Now, you expect me to believe
everything is hunky dory?

662
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,235
Well, sir, actually, things have been
a little more dory.

663
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:33,470
Of course they are. I get it.
You know anything about animals, son?

664
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,670
The Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

665
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,618
Although you probably already know that.
Or have heard it. Not experienced it.

666
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,814
You ever heard of the Arctic white wolf?

667
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:46,913
No, sir.

668
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,049
Top of the food chain.

669
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,855
It's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself,
but it chooses not to.

670
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,486
It chooses to run with a pack.

671
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,621
And do you know why?

672
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,686
No.

673
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,256
The Arctic white wolf,
Congressman, realizes

674
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,097
that it is stronger as part of a group.

675
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,104
Do you know what happens when one of
these wolves decides to fend for itself?

676
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,970
The pack kills the loner
for the greater good of the community.

677
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,703
Ouch, that hurts.

678
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:10,076
Are you familiar with Jim Jenkins,
the junior congressman from Tennessee?

679
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,548
When I met Congressman Jenkins,
he was fresh off the turnip truck,

680
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,744
but now he's sitting on his own committee.

681
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,982
Congressman Jenkins, Congressman
Whitehall, Congressman Freeman,

682
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:22,753
they all have committee chairs
because they all run with the pack.

683
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,953
Now, you have to come to a decision.

684
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,259
Are you gonna run with the pack
or are you gonna lone wolf it?

685
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,492
I am a pack man, sir.

686
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:33,696
Good. I'm introducing the CINPLAN bill
in 2 weeks. C-SPAN is covering it live.

687
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,864
I want your full support and nothing else.

688
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,099
Yes, sir.

689
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,270
Those fish are on you like bait on a hook.

690
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,873
Birds follow you.

691
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,409
Fish follow you.

692
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,315
Let's see if we can get
some congressmen to follow you.

693
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,449
Let's get this bill passed,
shall we, Congressman?

694
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,618
Yes, sir.

695
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,456
Hey, fleabag, out of the way.

696
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,522
Hey, Dad, I think there are more
animals than yesterday.

697
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,794
Well, let's not keep
our audience waiting, shall we?

698
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:12,171
Up, up. Push it up. Push it.
We got it. We got it. Oh, yeah, yeah.

699
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,672
Come on. Just let it go, just let it go.

700
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,550
Dad, we can do this,
but we're gonna need some help.

701
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,883
I know. We just need something
to lift those beams.

702
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:28,658
Like that?

703
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,318
Holy moly!

704
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,029
This is so totally awesome!

705
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,622
This is perfect.

706
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,166
Dad, there's a note.

707
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,066
Let me see that.

708
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,271
How does it work?

709
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,720
Dad, this is really weird.

710
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,087
Repeat after me, "We are hamsters!"

711
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,785
We are hamsters!

712
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,487
Leg power!

713
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,028
Leg power!

714
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:07,819
And it's in!

715
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,092
That's it.

716
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,238
Hey, who has opposable thumbs? Anybody?

717
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,037
You want to try this one?
Make sure it's straight.

718
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,705
- This is awesome!
- This is so cool.

719
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,773
- Here we go.
- Oh, my God!

720
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,415
Yeah. Gotta do the dance.
Come on, let's do the dance.

721
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,620
- We're doing the dance.
- Dylan, come on. Do the dance.

722
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,453
- Come on, do the dance.
- I'm not doing the dance.

723
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,017
Ow!

724
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:41,656
Don't scratch!

725
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:42,790
Stop it. Come here.

726
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:46,393
Insult to injury! My!

727
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,459
Good boy.

728
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,527
Okay, guys. A little bit more.

729
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,597
Here we go. I got it. Keep it... That's it!

730
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,837
Beautiful!

731
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,040
You guys all right?

732
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,345
Yup.

733
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:19,994
"G."

734
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,742
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

735
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,281
Well, I hope this isn't our last supper.

736
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,850
There's no sign of our heat wave breaking,

737
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,123
so this dry, hot weather will continue.

738
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,132
Until September 22, midday.

739
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,363
Lf the ark isn't finished by then, you will be.

740
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,037
Is that when it's going to happen?
September 22, midday?

741
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,473
High temperatures tomorrow
back into the 90s everywhere,

742
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,703
right on through Tuesday

743
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:04,269
and the next seven days,
no showers, no storms.

744
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,546
That would be a good day to have chicken.
How about Mom's chicken? Huh?

745
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,019
Hon, could we have some more chicken
September 22, midday?

746
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,357
Boys, will you excuse us, please?
Your father and I need to have a little talk.

747
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,984
Busted.

748
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,221
Dad, you're busted.

749
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,422
Yeah, I know.

750
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,731
What are you doing?

751
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,028
Do we have anything unleavened?

752
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,663
Yeah, we do, it's in the back,
next to the frankincense and myrrh.

753
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,902
We have a fancy name for it in
this century, it's called pita.

754
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,807
Got it.

755
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,811
Evan, what is happening to you?

756
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:40,214
Don't! No! Just put it down! Look at you.

757
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:45,688
The hair. Are you on something?
Is it a mega-growth hormone? What?

758
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,952
Evan, talk to me.

759
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,198
I'm building an ark.

760
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,768
What does that mean?

761
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:08,133
God appeared to me
and told me to build an ark.

762
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:12,147
He said there was going to be a flood
and that I should be prepared.

763
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,706
Whenever I shave,
my beard grows right back out.

764
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,813
My hair grows longer every day.
This robe... God sent me the robe.

765
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,255
He thought it would be funny.

766
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:27,026
I actually think it's really comfortable.
That's why I'm wearing it.

767
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,290
The beard, the robe.

768
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,802
You're Noah?

769
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,999
Yeah, kind of.

770
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,098
Mom!

771
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,472
Not now, Noah!

772
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,202
Dylan.

773
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,337
Okay.

774
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:50,375
We left everything behind to come here.

775
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,185
Maybe that's put too much pressure on you.
I don't know.

776
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:58,751
But this has got to stop.
Please. You're scaring me.

777
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:03,493
The boys need their father back,
and I need my husband back.

778
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:23,686
Yes. Successful. Powerful.
Handsome. Happy.

779
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,587
Successful. Powerful.
Handsome. Happy.

780
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,623
Good morning!

781
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,564
Cold today, huh?

782
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:44,998
Hmm?

783
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:56,813
"Back to work"?

784
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:06,056
Okay. All right. You want me
to wear the robe? I'll wear the robe.

785
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,396
Two can play this game.

786
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,335
Ha, ha, ha!

787
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,035
Pièce de résistance.

788
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,040
The student has become the teacher.

789
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,355
This meeting will come to order.

790
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,685
Rita, any sign of him?

791
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,056
Marty, I told you,
I will let you know as soon as...

792
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,426
You know what? You got me. He's here.
We're in the middle of a yoga class.

793
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,362
Rita, this is no time for jokes.
I'm not kidding.

794
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,798
If he's not in that meeting,
we're all out of a job.

795
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,029
Wait a minute.
Let me finish my sun salutation.

796
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,740
Marty! Sorry I'm late.
Come on, let's go.

797
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,940
What is that?

798
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:01,643
Making lemonade out of lemons.
Pick up your phone! Come on!

799
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,051
At its heart, this bill gives
private citizens access

800
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,147
to lands they technically already own.

801
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,851
Will the Chairman yield?

802
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:09,983
Oh, look, there he is.

803
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,220
Yup, yup, I see him.

804
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,230
Access is just a word you're using
to hide what's really going on here.

805
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,823
This is about development,
short and simple.

806
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:23,066
Evan, what are you doing?
You have a pony tail on your face!

807
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,506
What you gonna do next?
Cornrow your eyebrows?

808
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,237
Development means
the advancement of jobs,

809
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,940
an increase in domestic commerce.
If you happen to like those things,

810
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:36,384
I invite you to join myself and
my cosponsors, Congressman Dodd,

811
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,522
Congressman Hughes

812
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,554
and Congressman Baxter.

813
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,873
Did you just do a wardrobe change?

814
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,976
What do you think this is, the Oscars?
You are not Whoopi.

815
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,554
Ladies and gentlemen! Please!

816
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,751
Please! Congressman Baxter has a tendency
to embrace the theatrical

817
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,524
in his support of this bill.
Congressman, let me warn you,

818
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:25,125
you are approximately 10 seconds away
from committee censure.

819
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,433
Oh, no. Hey, would anyone mind
if I close the window?

820
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,769
Ladies and gentlemen! Please!
These animals are trained!

821
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,002
I've seen this circus act before!

822
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,043
Congressman, I'm sure St. Francis
would be envious.

823
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,705
We, however, are not.
You have five seconds.

824
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,613
You march yourself and your
little animal troupe out of here now

825
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,583
or you will be forcibly removed.

826
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,586
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

827
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,087
Congressman!

828
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,350
These animals are not trained.

829
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,755
Congressman!

830
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,127
I think they want me to save them!

831
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,789
Save them from what, Congressman?

832
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,230
Saving the animals, okay.
I can roll with that. That's a good idea.

833
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:40,033
The flood.

834
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,911
A flood? Rolling out.

835
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,778
The flood.

836
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,975
This has been the hottest,
driest summer on record

837
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,711
and you say we're going
to have a flood?

838
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,047
When might we expect this?

839
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,281
September 22, midday.

840
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,659
That's what I was told.

841
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,752
Might I ask who told you?

842
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,470
Not in front of all those people.
Don't say it. Don't say it.

843
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,876
God.

844
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:24,449
God? You talk to God?

845
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,383
Yes.

846
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,650
And God is talking back?

847
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,454
Yeah. We hung out a little.

848
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,826
Well, time to update the résumé.

849
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,297
Congressman, your name is being
removed from this bill.

850
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:39,802
Obviously, the stresses of this office
have proven too much for you.

851
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,268
Please have the congressman removed.

852
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,169
No. Please! You don't understand!

853
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,037
God commanded me to build an ark!

854
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,703
It's going to rain!
There's going to be a flood!

855
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,636
Remove him now!

856
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,149
We have to prepare ourselves!

857
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,913
I need to finish the ark!

858
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,713
Remove him now!

859
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,630
Does this mean we're moving back home?

860
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,396
Home, Canada. One or the other.

861
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:27,782
Joan? I know you probably saw
what happened, but I can explain.

862
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,615
Take the stuff to the car, guys.
I'll be there in a minute.

863
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,786
Guys?

864
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:47,428
I'm gonna take them to my mother's.
Evan, I think you need help.

865
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:52,805
Joan, please. I'm not doing this.
It's not me. It's him.

866
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:56,209
I went to that meeting in a suit,
and he took it off of me.

867
00:56:56,279 --> 00:57:00,045
Those animals are following me
because of him.

868
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,745
God? Does God know
he's destroying our lives?

869
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,380
Does God know he's going to get you fired?

870
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,219
Yeah! He's trying to get me fired!

871
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:12,153
He is trying to get me fired!

872
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,423
That way I'll have more time
to work on the ark!

873
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,988
Because the rain and the floods are coming.

874
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,502
No, I heard you, Evan.
The whole world heard you.

875
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,232
Joan, please, you gotta believe me.

876
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:30,476
There it is! It's happening!
It's happening! It's raining!

877
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,123
Goodbye, Evan.

878
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,928
Joan!

879
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:07,274
I know! I know. Whatever you do,
you do because you love me!

880
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,891
Do me a favor. Love me less.

881
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,320
Congressman!

882
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:23,365
Are you concerned at all
about Congressman Baxter's tirade

883
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,094
and the adverse effects
it may have on your bill?

884
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,968
The day it rains and floods and
Congressman Baxter takes a ride on his ark,

885
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:31,029
that'll be the day
I'll be concerned. Thank you.

886
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:40,481
His name is Evan Baxter,
but now he goes by "New York's Noah,"

887
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,213
"Heaven's Evan,"
"The Weirdo with a Beardo."

888
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,889
Okay, guys. Watch it. Watch it.
Coming through. Watch your back.

889
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,196
Marty, will you comment on Congressman
Baxter's change of appearance?

890
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,336
Yes, his hair is long.
Yes, his beard is unshaven.

891
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,600
Are you equally stunned
by this man's appearance?

892
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,208
The way things go around here,

893
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,080
if he gets any crazier,
we may end up in the White House.

894
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,087
Hey! No, no, no! That's my cup!

895
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:26,959
Whatever.

896
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,242
He's filling the boat with
two of every kind of animal.

897
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,779
Still to be collected,
two giraffes, two elephants

898
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,386
and one more jackass.

899
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:01,721
What an idiot.

900
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,265
He's a mook.

901
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,527
Jerks.

902
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,129
Don't worry about it, you guys.
Come on, eat up.

903
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,228
Not hungry.

904
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,465
Yeah, me neither.

905
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,838
You guys can't eat. I can't stop.

906
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,843
Can I go to the bathroom?
Me, too?

907
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:17,539
Okay. Dylan, go with them. Please?

908
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,808
Fine.

909
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,508
Excuse me. Can I get a refill, please?

910
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,379
Coming right up.

911
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,246
Thank you.

912
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,052
Excuse me. Are you all right?

913
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:30,983
Yeah.

914
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,061
No. It's a long story.

915
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,291
Well, I like stories.

916
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:40,092
I'm considered a bit of a storyteller myself.

917
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,731
My husband...
Have you heard of "New York's Noah"?

918
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,570
The guy who's building the ark.

919
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,975
That's him.

920
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:52,173
I love that story, Noah and the Ark.

921
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,840
You know, a lot of people miss
the point of that story.

922
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,975
They think it's about God's wrath and anger.

923
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,616
They love it when God gets angry.

924
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,156
What is the story about, then? The ark?

925
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:06,628
Well, I think it's a love story
about believing in each other.

926
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:12,396
You know, the animals showed up in pairs.
They stood by each other, side by side,

927
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:16,768
just like Noah and his family.
Everybody entered the ark side by side.

928
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,741
But my husband says God told him to do it.

929
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,137
What do you do with that?

930
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,044
Sounds like an opportunity.

931
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,349
Let me ask you something.

932
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,550
If someone prays for patience,
you think God gives them patience?

933
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,490
Or does he give them
the opportunity to be patient?

934
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,221
If they pray for courage,
does God give them courage,

935
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,926
or does he give them opportunities
to be courageous?

936
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,503
If someone prayed
for their family to be closer,

937
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,699
you think God zaps them
with warm, fuzzy feelings?

938
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,978
Or does he give them opportunities
to love each other?

939
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:04,245
Well, I got to run.
A lot of people to serve. Enjoy.

940
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,287
Guess this comes as no surprise to
those who remember his campaign promise,

941
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,126
"L will Lower taxes,

942
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,796
"go crazy and build a gigantic ark."

943
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,800
Oh, my gosh.

944
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,474
Evan!

945
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,676
Dad?

946
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,844
Honey!

947
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:37,908
Dad?

948
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,750
You guys, I'm up here.

949
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,931
Rough week?
JORDAN: You look really funny.

950
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,270
You look really old.

951
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:01,867
Yeah, well, he is really old.

952
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,274
Why'd you come back?

953
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,474
It was the kids.

954
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,641
Tell him, guys.

955
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,708
We like you better as the crazy guy.

956
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,152
You spend time with us
and you're home a lot more.

957
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,849
Just, please don't make us do
the dance anymore.

958
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:40,905
I don't know what's going on,
or what you're going through,

959
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,481
but we got into this as a family

960
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,350
and we're gonna get out of it as a family,

961
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,884
side by side.

962
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,734
But, Evan, we have to talk about the ark.
It has to come down.

963
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,134
I can't do that.

964
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:03,695
You don't have a choice.

965
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:07,600
Congressman Long went to the city.
There's a laundry list of code violations.

966
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,111
You have until September 22
to take it down,

967
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,079
or they'll take it down and arrest you.

968
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:14,173
September 22. That's the day of the flood.

969
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,717
Mom! Dad! Come here!

970
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,278
Don't you dare take that ark down.

971
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,747
How are we gonna do this?

972
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,081
There's no way the five
of us can finish on time.

973
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,211
We don't have money to hire anybody else.

974
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,294
Is that a llama with a hammer?

975
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,854
An alpaca. They rarely spit at people
unless frightened or abused.

976
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,598
Let's finish this sucker.

977
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,001
Come on, let's go.

978
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,474
No one knows
where they came from

979
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,374
or how the congressman
is getting them to do it,

980
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:22,384
but, two by two, animals of all kinds
are working with Godspeed to build this ark.

981
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:23,941
Thank you.

982
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,217
If this flood really does happen,
"Evan help us."

983
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,325
Hey! A little help?

984
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,387
Thanks.

985
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,857
Here it is, hon.

986
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,830
Perfect. Thanks.

987
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,331
Hold it right there.

988
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,005
This is Ed Carson coming to you
live from New York Noah's construction site,

989
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:56,177
where we are unable to leave the news van
due to hazardous conditions outside.

990
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,311
High five.
High five.

991
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:01,378
Good job.

992
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,753
Hey, putty tat.

993
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,630
Go, go, go! He tried to eat me!

994
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:13,663
Dylan! Jordan! Check it out!
Your mom's building an ark!

995
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,067
Let's do the dance.

996
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,128
No, please, no.

997
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,776
Well, where did
the animals come from, then?

998
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:22,970
Please. It's a trick.

999
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,444
It's a circus is what it is.

1000
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,607
Wild animals running amok
in suburban Virginia.

1001
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:31,346
With all these species,
what's being done about the feces?

1002
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:42,795
Evan Baxter! You have gone from
newsman to congressman to caveman.

1003
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:45,333
What makes you so sure God chose you?

1004
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,365
He chose all of us.

1005
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,645
Time to wash up, you guys.

1006
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:07,449
Thanks.

1007
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,384
You want some?

1008
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:35,743
Why couldn't the man
just buy a Corvette?

1009
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:40,050
Well, well, well. There they are.
It is good to see you guys.

1010
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:45,185
It's good to see you! Your hair looks great.
It's very regal. Man, I love your hair!

1011
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,694
And you're still sucking up.

1012
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:47,786
So, why are you here?

1013
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:48,955
Long locked us out.

1014
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,055
He can't do that.

1015
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:52,362
I mean, I've been suspended,
but I'm still a congressman.

1016
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,595
Rita, tell him what you know.

1017
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:54,658
Tell me what?

1018
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,535
I smelled a rat the second we got that office.

1019
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,699
You don't get an office
like that for nothing.

1020
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,903
So I had the stalker here do some research.

1021
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,172
Okay, Eugene, talk.

1022
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,343
Prestige Crest used to be federal lands,

1023
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,316
but what's interesting is
how it got into private hands.

1024
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,751
Congressman Long got the approval
to build a dam

1025
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,756
and then passed out the surrounding lands
to a group of private investors.

1026
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,155
Now, the locals fought this thing for years.

1027
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,489
They said Long and his developer buddies
were cutting corners,

1028
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,825
like skipping important
building code checkpoints.

1029
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:23,990
And with the land use bill, he's gonna do
the same thing with the national parks.

1030
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,763
So, you stand by and shake your pom-poms
while Long and his buddies get rich.

1031
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,964
What can we do? I'm suspended.

1032
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:33,475
Go back to the Hill and show them
that you can and will fight this bill.

1033
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:36,511
You guys, I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I have to get back to the ark.

1034
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,274
The ark? All right. Okay.

1035
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,281
God told you to build an ark?
Yes.

1036
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,375
But did he tell you to make your friends
believe in you and follow you here

1037
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,580
so you can make us look stupid?
'Cause I go to church every Sunday.

1038
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,018
Okay, every other Sunday.

1039
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:53,550
I've been to church!
And that does not sound like God to me.

1040
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,029
Rita, I know that this
doesn't make any sense.

1041
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,794
I just want you to trust me.
You just have to have faith.

1042
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:03,498
Evan, faith will not fight this bill.
The CINPLAN vote is today!

1043
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:07,303
If we're going to stop this thing,
you need to get down to Capitol Hill now!

1044
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,741
Otherwise, it's impossible!

1045
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,644
Dad, Dad, I think it's done.

1046
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,471
What in the world?
I can't even get my cat to use the litter box.

1047
01:10:55,884 --> 01:11:00,321
It's September 22, and we're all still here.

1048
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,686
Awkward!

1049
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:05,392
People! The flood is imminent!

1050
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:09,056
Board the ark! Save yourselves!

1051
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,564
Get down, you fool!

1052
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:15,025
Listen to me! The time has come!

1053
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:19,200
No, Captain Ahab! Your time has come!

1054
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:25,242
Yeah, Baxter! The weather's 70 and sunny
with a chance of crazy!

1055
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:34,851
Do you hear that? The rains are upon us!

1056
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:36,686
Dad, I don't think that's the rains.

1057
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,724
Hey, Baxter! Kiss your ark goodbye!

1058
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,202
Where is he?

1059
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,303
On the boat, sir.

1060
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,475
Give me a minute.
Lets see if I can convince "Noah"

1061
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,313
that the world doesn't have to end today.

1062
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,449
I gotta hand it to you,
this is quite the show.

1063
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,552
According to my source,
the show hasn't even started yet.

1064
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,324
Still expecting the big flood.

1065
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,661
You know, voters don't respond
to the gloom and doom stuff.

1066
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,200
They like a more positive message.

1067
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:20,895
Like the one you're sending with your bill?

1068
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,937
How much did you make off of all this land?

1069
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:26,304
You are destroying
our national parks for profit.

1070
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,240
You have a problem with somebody
taking a little profit?

1071
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,868
It's called business, son.

1072
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,436
So if I need to get a message out there,
or get a congressman elected

1073
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:36,575
there are people who pay for it, and yes,
those people want this bill to happen

1074
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:40,110
and, by God, it's gonna happen.
Now you look down there.

1075
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:43,019
Those are the wolves, son.

1076
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:46,220
I'm gonna give you one last chance.
Take down this boat.

1077
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:50,026
I'm giving you one last chance. Repent.

1078
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,236
Such a shame. You had possibilities.

1079
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:59,172
But you want to stop progress
to save the Earth. Go for it.

1080
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:01,471
Good luck getting a tree
to come to the polls.

1081
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,639
Take it down.

1082
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:19,189
This is a court order approving
the demolition of this boat!

1083
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:22,253
Evacuate immediately!
You have three minutes!

1084
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:29,131
Honey. We have to go.
They're going to destroy the boat.

1085
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,065
No.

1086
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,597
It can't end this way.

1087
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:39,370
Is it too much to ask
for a little precipitation?

1088
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:44,280
Honey, maybe God didn't mean
a literal flood.

1089
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:49,689
Maybe he meant a flood of knowledge
or emotion or awareness.

1090
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,316
If that's true,

1091
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,458
I am going to be so pissed.

1092
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:56,828
Two minutes!

1093
01:13:56,899 --> 01:14:00,335
Get off the boat now
or you will be removed by force.

1094
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:03,929
Evan, you did it. You built the ark.

1095
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,405
That's all you were asked to do, right?

1096
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:06,532
No.

1097
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:11,273
There's something else.
Something's going to happen. I can feel it.

1098
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:14,144
Yeah, what's gonna happen is
tear gas and a wrecking ball.

1099
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,207
Evan, think of the kids.

1100
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,718
One minute!

1101
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,015
Dad, whatever you say, I'm with you.

1102
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,558
Yeah, me, too.

1103
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,719
Me, too. But can we keep
some of the animals?

1104
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:29,025
I like the alpaca. He spits.

1105
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:36,868
You're right. We did it. We built the boat.

1106
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,228
Yeah.

1107
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,675
Let's go. Let's go, guys. Come on.

1108
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,485
Well, I guess they don't want to go.

1109
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:57,957
It's their instinct.

1110
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,653
What do you mean, hon?

1111
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:04,495
Some animals know when weather's coming.
When they feel it coming, they sit.

1112
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:13,734
Joan!

1113
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,676
Okay. Time's up! We're coming in!

1114
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,985
Get that ball in position!
We're clearing them out!

1115
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,201
Is that rain?
It's raining.

1116
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,797
Lucky guess, Baxter. Lucky guess.

1117
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:06,592
Looks like the drought's finally over.
Good news, eh, Congressman?

1118
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,823
Yeah. Good news.

1119
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:16,829
Everybody! Please! Get on the ark!

1120
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,364
Go to the car!

1121
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:24,538
Please! Everyone! On the ark!

1122
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,980
Cover me up! Keep me dry!
Cover me up! Keep me dry!

1123
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:32,043
Who's crazy now, huh?
Look at us all squishing!

1124
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,891
It kind of stopped raining.

1125
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,022
Is that it?

1126
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,532
What did I tell you? It's fine. It's over.

1127
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,501
Hey, Ahab! This is it?

1128
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,863
Your God experiencing
a little water shortage?

1129
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,703
It would appear Evan Baxter
was right about the rain,

1130
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:59,269
with a slight miscalculation
as to the quantity.

1131
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:04,910
Something's wrong.

1132
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,579
Honey, the clouds are moving away.

1133
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,647
No, no. No, this isn't right.

1134
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:13,893
Evan, even if it kept raining,
it's not like it could cause a flood in a day.

1135
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:19,195
But today is the day! It has to be.
This just doesn't make any sense!

1136
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,227
Wait a second.

1137
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,396
What is it?

1138
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:27,135
Marty said that Long cut corners,
violated building codes.

1139
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:28,369
What are you talking about?

1140
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:29,876
The lake, Long Lake.

1141
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:33,540
It's named after him.
It's the lake! It's the lake!

1142
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:48,293
Oh, no.

1143
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:54,831
Get on the ark! Everyone, on the ark now!

1144
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:56,768
I think we should get on the ark.

1145
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,671
I agree. I think we should get on the ark also.

1146
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,710
I'm cold. I'm wet. I'm going home.

1147
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:12,479
Ladies first! Move!

1148
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:23,991
Oh, my God. This is happening.
This is really happening.

1149
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:28,400
Holy... Get everyone on the ark now!

1150
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,132
Get on the ark now! Let's go!
Get on the ark! Let's go!

1151
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,107
Go, go, go! Get on the ark!

1152
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:39,874
Go, go, go! On the ark! Go, go, go!

1153
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,416
All right, boys! Let's go! Let's go!

1154
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:46,045
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
Stay here with the kids.

1155
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,028
Come on, Rita!

1156
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:01,297
Everyone, up the ramp! Onto the deck!
Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1157
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:03,098
Dylan, get back inside! It's too dangerous.

1158
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:05,196
No, Dad. I told you, I'm with you.

1159
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:12,376
Careful, everyone.
In the ark! In the ark!

1160
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:14,540
Watch your step! Up the ramp, everybody!

1161
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:23,849
Guys, help me with the door!

1162
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,256
Get the door! Get the door!

1163
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,461
Guys! Guys!

1164
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,199
Everybody hang on!

1165
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,812
You guys all right? You okay?

1166
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,978
There's been a flood at Prestige Crest

1167
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,216
and you're seeing Live images
of New York Noah's ark

1168
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,521
caught in the storm surge
and heading towards Memorial Bridge!

1169
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,392
We're going to crash!

1170
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:15,936
Turn this thing around!

1171
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:17,369
We're not gonna make it!

1172
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,838
Save us, Baxter!

1173
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:35,148
I command thee halt! Stop! Whoa!

1174
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,884
It's not working!

1175
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:40,423
How about a little help here?

1176
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,765
What do you mean there was water damage?
It rained for ten minutes.

1177
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:30,310
That is not possible.

1178
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,188
I love you guys.
All right.

1179
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:43,519
Seriously.
Okay, I got it.

1180
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:44,717
I love you.
Thank you.

1181
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:06,773
All those in favor of the Public Land
Act, please signify by saying, "Aye."

1182
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:15,152
Good God!

1183
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:51,925
I think we can walk from here.

1184
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:14,774
Hello, Congressman.
Mind if I park my boat here for a little while?

1185
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:16,674
But how...

1186
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:17,979
The dam, Congressman.

1187
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,614
Your reservoir ruptured.
Prestige Crest, it's all gone.

1188
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,623
No. They said that couldn't happen.

1189
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,659
I never thought this...

1190
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:32,732
You. You did this to me.
You set me up, you crazy son of a...

1191
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,369
Wow. That is disgusting.

1192
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,273
If that comes out your front,

1193
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,605
I don't even want to know
what's coming out the back.

1194
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,540
Don't look down, Congressman,
but the wolves are here,

1195
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:53,553
although I wouldn't worry so much
about these wolves as those.

1196
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,228
Gesundheit.

1197
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,939
As you can see behind me,
New York Noah's prediction came true.

1198
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:21,538
The vote of the Land Act Bill
has been suspended,

1199
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,483
pending investigation of Congressman Long
for profiteering...

1200
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:27,521
Of course now, the question is,
how will these animals be returned

1201
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,147
to their natural habitats?

1202
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:33,092
Something tells me, if God got them here,
he can probably get them home.

1203
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:36,221
The House will undoubtedly
reinstate Congressman Baxter

1204
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,060
when it reconvenes in the morning.

1205
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:42,001
Until then, there is a Lot to be done
here on Capitol Hill.

1206
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,059
How's Buster doing?

1207
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,162
Come on, Buster.

1208
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,673
No, come on. Come on!
RYAN: Come on!

1209
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,504
These too heavy? It's all right?
JORDAN: No, it's fine.

1210
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:49,634
He can't keep up.

1211
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:51,008
I know, sweetie!

1212
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:54,276
All right. What do you say
we take a little break?

1213
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:55,976
We've only been walking
for, like, five minutes, Dad.

1214
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:59,281
Well, five on, five off.
Life is about balance, right?

1215
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,651
How about some sandwiches?
Okay.

1216
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,349
Who wants sandwiches? Let's do it!

1217
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:03,617
I get first dibs!

1218
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:06,023
Everyone but Buster
is going to get a sandwich.

1219
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:10,463
You do not get a sandwich! You're a dog
and you do not get a sandwich!

1220
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:13,763
Buster is part of the family now.
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

1221
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,666
Poor Buster!

1222
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:19,531
Honey, come here.
Sweetheart, be careful. Come here.

1223
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:21,507
Hey, hon, save me one, okay?
Okay.

1224
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:22,770
I'll be right back.

1225
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,717
Hey.
Hey.

1226
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:36,022
What are you doing here?

1227
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,292
Just hanging out with some old friends.

1228
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,659
You knew all along, didn't you?
You knew the dam was unstable.

1229
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:46,598
If it hadn't been for the ark,
my family, the neighbors...

1230
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:48,863
I fought you every step of the way.

1231
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,427
Yes, but you did it.

1232
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:56,000
So, you had nothing to do with the flood?
Like where the ark landed exactly?

1233
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:59,569
I gave you a little shove at the end. Sue me.

1234
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:05,847
You did good, son. You changed the world.

1235
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,387
No, no, I didn't.

1236
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:08,615
Well, let's see.

1237
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:12,786
Spending time with your family,
making them very happy.

1238
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,157
Gave that dog a home.

1239
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,129
Right. So?

1240
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,526
So?

1241
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:20,677
How do we change the world?

1242
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,058
One act of random kindness at a time.

1243
01:27:22,254 --> 01:27:26,782
One act of random kindness.

1244
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,292
Wow.

1245
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:27,122
It's time.

1246
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,330
Do the dance.

1247
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,122
Care to join me?

1248
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:38,212
I now issue a new commandment,

1249
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,930
"Thou shalt do the dance."

1250
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:44,984
Stop it! This is stupid!

1251
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:52,545
That's awful dancing! You better stop!

1252
01:28:39,965 --> 01:28:42,092
Ladies and gentlemen,
you don't have to go home.

1253
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:42,642
You just have to go. We are wrapped.

1254
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,464
We're wrapped.
We Love you. Thank you.

1255
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:47,030
How do we change the world?

1256
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:48,410
One act of random kindness at a time.

1257
01:29:40,725 --> 01:29:45,253
One act of random kindness.

1258
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:41,764
Wow.

1259
01:29:46,998 --> 01:29:48,329
It's time.

1260
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,538
Do the dance.

1261
01:29:50,202 --> 01:29:51,829
Care to join me?

1262
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:01,989
I now issue a new commandment,

1263
01:30:16,962 --> 01:30:19,055
"Thou shalt do the dance."

1264
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:29,515
Stop it! This is stupid!

1265
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:34,907
That's awful dancing! You better stop!

1266
01:30:36,615 --> 01:30:38,742
Ladies and gentlemen,
you don't have to go home.

1267
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:39,292
You just have to go. We are wrapped.

1268
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:42,848
We're wrapped.
We Love you. Thank you.
