1
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,896
In the 19th Century,

2
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:41,324
Jules Verne wrote some of the
greatest adventure stories of the world.

3
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:44,989
Novels such as 20.000
Feet Under The Sea,

4
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,817
Journey to the center of the earth

5
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:49,905
...and The mysterious island

6
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:53,006
Most considered his works
as science fiction

7
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:56,079
Vernean's known otherwise.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,116
Journey 2

9
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:03,904
Journey 2
The Mysterious Island

10
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:15,176
Not good!

11
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:40,377
Good boy!

12
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,391
Damn thing!

13
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:50,283
OK, here we go!

14
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:19,220
Good evening officers!

15
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:21,628
Anyone up for a late night swim?

16
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:45,317
Hi buddy.
We missed you at poker this week.

17
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:47,379
Thanks for the call, John but
what's going on?

18
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,641
We didn't want this going out
over the radio...

19
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:53,650
...kid broke into a satellite facility...

20
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:56,689
...then he's drove his dirt-bike into
the McGillecuddy's pool.

21
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:58,761
I talked them out of pressing charges.

22
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,786
Anderson, your stepfather is here for you.

23
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,763
I know legal guardian.

24
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:14,228
If it weren't for me you'd be in juvie for
the next six months.

25
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,684
I'd rather do the time.

26
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,382
Do you want to explain to me...

27
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:28,823
...why you were breaking into a satellite
facility out of the middle nowhere?

28
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,773
Don't worry about it, mom. It's nothing. Really

29
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:34,113
The police calling in the middle of the night
is nothing?!

30
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,258
Sean!

31
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,485
Hey, Sean! We've got to talk about this.

32
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,842
- I'm still confused as to who gave him the
speaking part. - Hey!

33
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,607
Without my speaking part, you
would be visiting you in jail right now.

34
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:55,008
I'm already in jail.

35
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:57,006
What's that supposed to mean?

36
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,232
Sean!

37
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:02,401
Look! I didn't ask be taken away
from my old school and friends

38
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:04,011
and be dragged all way to Dayton.

39
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:06,303
- It's OK, Liz.
- No, it's not.

40
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:09,845
Sean!
Sean!

41
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,675
I got you. I'm just gonna figure out
what you mean.

42
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:45,320
I am not here

43
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:47,763
It's me, busy?

44
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,214
Yes

45
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,928
Hey, I'm just looking to talk to you

46
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:58,467
You know, uhm... as a very concerned adult to a
somewhat troubled youth

47
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:00,869
Which one am I in that equation?

48
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,014
Hey, hey, buddy.

49
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,452
- What's all this business?
- Nothing.

50
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:21,653
That's a cryptogram, right?
Looks like Morse Code

51
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:23,522
Taking a look.

52
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,963
Ony-syllable words are dots

53
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:27,429
...while two-syllable words are dashes.
Learned that in the Navy.

54
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,399
OK, then.
What's it say?

55
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:34,850
- What's it for?
- It's complicated.

56
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:39,579
- So, is the code.
- It's complicated.

57
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:42,370
OK. Here's the deal.

58
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:45,966
A few nights ago a radio signal
got sent out from somewhere...

59
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,670
...could have been anywhere. These words
were playing on a loop.

60
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,418
Hip zorn strucks

61
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:53,761
These all characters are taken from
the books of Jules Verne.

62
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:55,627
Clearly the message was sent by
a Vernean.

63
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:58,098
and my equipment wasn't powerful enough
to receive the whole message.

64
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,738
So...

65
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,992
So you broke into that satellite facility to
boost your signal

66
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:06,260
Look, someone out there sent this message
and I'm gonna be the person who solved it.

67
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:07,839
This is really important to me.

68
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,210
Hey, you know what?

69
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,614
Why don't we solve this together?

70
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:17,984
- Fine.
- Good.

71
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:21,721
The first part of the message reads,

72
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:25,858
The isle... island...

73
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,370
...is...

74
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:32,699
The island is... real.

75
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,564
Are you serious?

76
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,753
- You're not messing with me?
- No.

77
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,392
This is what it says.
The island is real.

78
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:39,839
I can't believe it.

79
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,908
I can't believe somebody actually
found the island.

80
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,943
What island?

81
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,180
The Mysterious Island

82
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,915
Verneans have been looking for
this for years.

83
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,883
What's the rest of the code say?

84
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,443
Child of Steve

85
00:06:54,866 --> 00:07:00,005
Born 1883

86
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,792
Child of Steve. Child of Steve...

87
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:04,664
- May be son of Steve?
- Steven son. Stevenson.

88
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,177
- Robert Louis Stevenson
- The author

89
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,933
Yeah, but he was born way before 1883.
It's gotta be somebody else.

90
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:12,898
- May be it's not somebody.
- May be it's something!

91
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,143
What are you looking for?

92
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:23,031
A book.

93
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,513
Treasure Island. Written by Robert Louis
Stevenson in 1883.

94
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,318
What's the next part of the riddle?

95
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:37,745
Alright.

96
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,084
The name that's last is
going fast

97
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:46,053
He hitched his tail to Lemuel's mast.

98
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:49,157
Wait, so his last name is going fast
What is he, is he a runner?

99
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:51,630
What if his last name is Fast?

100
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:53,505
Fleet. Or Quick or Swift?

101
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,346
Swift. Jonathan Swift.

102
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,204
An author?

103
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:00,146
Writing about Mother Island.

104
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,870
Gulliver's Travels

105
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:05,370
So, Leumul must be...

106
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:07,468
...Lemuel Gulliver.

107
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,334
Right, we have three different books.

108
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:12,859
- By three different authors...
- About three different islands...

109
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:19,222
Maybe, maybe all three books are
about the same island.

110
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:21,515
Maybe that's why nobody has ever found
Mysterious Island...

111
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,157
...because they haven't used the
other two books.

112
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:27,065
- Treasure Island's got a map?
- Yes. Swift has one, too.

113
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:30,340
But these are different than Verne's.
I don't get it.

114
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,933
What are you doing?

115
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:45,437
You know what I did at the Navy, Sean?

116
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:46,938
No.

117
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,746
I won the esteemed...

118
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:57,188
Rocheford Award...

119
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:00,245
three years in a row...

120
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,811
...for code-breaking.

121
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:06,933
It's incredible.

122
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:09,765
I think we found the mysterious island

123
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,071
What are those?

124
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:13,076
Coordinates. Latitude and longitude.

125
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:20,708
And that'll put us right about... here.

126
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:25,069
About a hundred miles off the cost of Palau.
Smack dab in the middle of the South Pacific.

127
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,778
What do you think you're doing?

128
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,084
- I gotta go.
- You're going to where?

129
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:33,811
- To the mysterious island
- A-haha. Alright! Cool!

130
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:35,818
- Hey, can you stop by the moon
bring me ice cream? - I will.

131
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,521
You gotta be kidding?
Listen to it.

132
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:39,362
You're not going to Palau, Sean.

133
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,793
Why not?

134
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:44,831
One, you're grounded and on top
of that, you've got school.

135
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,459
I'm a 'Straight A' student, I can afford
to miss a couple days.

136
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:49,155
Besides, this is Mysterious Island.

137
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:50,646
Slow down, slow down. OK?

138
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:53,018
Do you think you can travel
half way around the world and...

139
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:55,781
...meet the someone lunatic
who's messing around on the ham radio?

140
00:09:55,827 --> 00:10:01,362
He's not someone lunatic.
He's Alexander Anderson. My grand father.

141
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:04,399
How would you know he sent that?

142
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:07,390
Look, it makes perfect sense.
He's the original Vernean in the family

143
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:10,232
He's been looking for Mysterious Island
like half of his life and...

144
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,865
...nobody heard from him in 2 years.

145
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,860
I think he's in trouble and
I'm gonna find him.

146
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,980
Sean, stop! Sean. Stop!

147
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,253
I'm not letting you go on a
rescue mission. Certainly not by yourself.

148
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:23,499
And whether you like it or not buddy,
you're still a kid.

149
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:27,983
Look, I understand your situation. OK?
You want to make my mom happy and...

150
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,526
...and I appreciate that. I really do.

151
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:34,191
But, you need to just focus on running your
construction company and...

152
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:36,934
...and paying the mortgage and asking
her how her day was.

153
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:39,381
Because I'm okay.

154
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:43,909
And like it or not this,
this is bigger than you.

155
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:58,055
Apparently the message was sent
by his grandfather

156
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:01,841
Sean said he's been missing for
couple years.

157
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:04,167
Well, he'd hardly be missing if he were
never around in the first place.

158
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:07,893
I wouldn't trust one word from
Alexander Anderson.

159
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:09,704
Sean seems really convinced

160
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,292
It's always convincing for Alexander.

161
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:15,787
I see. So in Sean's mind Alexander
is this glamourous adventurer.

162
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,911
When in reality...

163
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:19,933
he was just a man that wasn't
there when his family needed him the most.

164
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,731
That's exactly why we need to let Sean
go on this trip.

165
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,928
- Why?
- Because, Sean needs a man in his life.

166
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:28,472
Somebody who's gonna be there
for and connect with him.

167
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:31,001
And we were cracking that code upstairs.
That was the first time that

168
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,042
...we were on the same page for more
than 5 minutes.

169
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:36,047
Then bond with him on some none
mysterious island. Like Hawaii.

170
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:43,212
Hawaii, our honeymoon.
Aloha, Hawaii.

171
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:46,062
- I'm serious, babe.
- I'm serious too.

172
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:49,563
Listen, we fly on to Palau and when
Sean realizes the island is not real

173
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:51,740
...and his grandfather's not there
I'll be there to cushion the blow.

174
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:54,054
And done will be done.

175
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,881
Good morning buddy.
It's 0700 hours.

176
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,598
- I'm busy.
- I don't think you're gonna be too busy...

177
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,901
...for this.

178
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,079
I'm going to Palau?

179
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:14,594
Close! We're going to Palau.

180
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,388
What?

181
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,761
Look, I know you want this team
road trip to work...

182
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:23,692
...but I've been on these adventures
before. So, just let me handle this.

183
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,849
Easy, buddy. Just remember who's
financing this whole trip.

184
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,174
Queen Isabella didn't tag along with Colombus.

185
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,430
OK Isabella. I'll let you handle
your thing.

186
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:32,944
We'll see how... Hey, watch the lizard.
Watch the lizard

187
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:34,207
Watch the lizard.

188
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:35,883
Big man's afraid of a little lizard, huh?

189
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,796
Big man's not afraid of anything.
I love lizards.

190
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:39,403
...when they are boots and belts.

191
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,699
Excuse us?

192
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:43,996
Hi.

193
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:48,549
Hey, how is it going?
We're... uhhh... we're Americans.

194
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,234
- You... tour guy?
- Sean.

195
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,204
I... I got this.

196
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:56,009
You... you take us on boat.

197
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,954
- On water.
- You wanna charter the boat?

198
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,009
Official language in Palau
is English.

199
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:08,968
Thank you. Yes, we need someone
to take us to an island...

200
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:11,899
...located... right here.

201
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,300
Absolutely not.

202
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,041
W- Wait. Why?

203
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:20,058
Because there is no island, just bunch of
stories. It's a graveyard for ships.

204
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:23,240
We'll pay you good money,
a thousand dollars

205
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,400
Only a fool trades his life for money

206
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,988
Excuse me, excuse me.

207
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,752
Today is your lucky day.

208
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:33,843
I'm Gabato Dagota. Best captain in Palau.

209
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,614
I understand you need some
transportation.

210
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:39,589
Yeah, that's great. We need someone
to get us here. A thousand bucks if you can.

211
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:42,926
Uhh, baby. Easy peasy.
Easy peasy. Let's go friends.

212
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:45,050
Here we go. Let's go!

213
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,858
Ohh, man. It's gonna be so good.

214
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,950
You know, you won't be disappointed.
I've taken a hundred people out to sea and

215
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:52,162
...brought them back almost
every single time.

216
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:54,696
- Nice!
- Nice ride!

217
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,196
Thank you. Thank you.

218
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:03,083
What the blue heck is that?

219
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,857
It's the finest helicopter in Palau.

220
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,132
I'd hate to see the worst.

221
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:11,967
That's my security system.

222
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,156
I'd rather take the Titanic.

223
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,898
Kailani. We have customers here.

224
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:20,770
You must meet my daughter.
She is the real beauty. Looks just like me.

225
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,704
You don't want this chopper.
It's not gonna work. Let's go.

226
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,966
Should we Hank? You know what?

227
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:45,223
I want to get a better look at this.
This chopper's pretty, freaking gorgeus.

228
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,850
This is the daughter that looks like you?

229
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:50,124
Look, same nostrils.

230
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,364
Who are these guys?

231
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:56,246
I am a scientific explorer.
Hi.

232
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:58,246
And he is... uhh... he is...

233
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,058
- Hank.
- Hank.

234
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,382
Right. So...

235
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,768
We need to get to these coordinates

236
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,130
Not on this helicopter.
That's the deadliest part of the ocean.

237
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:11,959
Time out. Sweetness, come here.

238
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:17,148
Sweetness, look. They agreed to pay
one thousand American dollars. OK?

239
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,766
I could help with college for you then.

240
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:25,341
- Make it two thousands.
- No way.

241
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,609
- We had a deal
- Then make it three thousands.

242
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:30,239
And good luck in finding someone
else take you there.

243
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:33,169
<i>Please.</i>

244
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,082
Do you take Visa?

245
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:43,015
Good afternoon, folks. And welcome
to Gabato Luxury Tours.

246
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,392
Please sit back, relax and get
ready for the ride of a lifetime.

247
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,947
And now a word from our pilot.

248
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:51,947
This your pilot and...

249
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,796
Here we go.

250
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,667
Gotcha!

251
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,917
If you look out your window on the
left side ladies and gentlemen...

252
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:12,084
...you'll see what is known as the
Pacific Ocean.

253
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,430
And on the right side, you will see
the other side of the Pacific Ocean.

254
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:19,360
Are you gonna do that whole trip?

255
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,621
Sir, you did pay for the luxury tour.

256
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:34,022
Beautiful sky, huh?

257
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:40,642
I mean, today just seems
especially... majestic.

258
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:44,199
Majestic?

259
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,411
Really?

260
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,473
I have to finish this off.

261
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,866
You have to go around the storm.

262
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:03,926
According to these coordinates,
that's where the island is.

263
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,495
There is no island there.

264
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:08,069
Looks like we're about the find out.

265
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,345
Papa, we gotta get out of here, now!

266
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,201
I'm thinking the same thing.

267
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:41,808
No, no, no. Wait!

268
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,996
The mysterious island.

269
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,362
Chapter I

270
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:49,563
Passengers are gonna be taken
into the circling movement of a column of air.

271
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:52,161
Sean, we're about to fly into
category 5 hurricane.

272
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,975
Now is not the time to take
the book literally.

273
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,434
- Look, we have to go into the eye
of the hurricane... - Move, move!

274
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,234
- ...to get to the island.
- Are you psychotic?

275
00:17:58,282 --> 00:17:59,361
We'll never survive.

276
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,686
I'm with you.

277
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:03,891
You know what? I trust gravity.
Come on, get us out of here, now!

278
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:06,349
You're right. I agree with you but
here is the deal.

279
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:09,142
I'm not flying the helicopter anymore.

280
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:11,155
Controls are all broken.

281
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,899
What?

282
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,411
We're going down!
Oh, my god!

283
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:29,113
We're going...

284
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:39,758
Not like this!

285
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:07,842
Sean... Sean... Sean! Sean!

286
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:10,698
Come on, buddy. God!

287
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:16,737
It's okay. It's okay.
Try to sit up.

288
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:19,625
That's my boy.

289
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:25,965
- I told you it'd work.
- You're right.

290
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,646
I can't believe we made it.

291
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:32,399
It's Jules Verne man.
You gotta believe.

292
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:35,687
Where are we?

293
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,944
Where is my father?

294
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,925
Somebody help me!

295
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,776
Help me!

296
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,647
My body's been cut in half!

297
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:47,910
Papa, your foot right there.

298
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:50,925
My severed foot!

299
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,394
It's moving!

300
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:57,309
It's moving!

301
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:03,170
Then, then I'm still in one piece.

302
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:08,595
You were right. There is an island.

303
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,691
Not much of one.

304
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:15,139
This is not what I was expecting.

305
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,400
Alright guys, listen up!

306
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:18,476
We have to gather upeverything
that washed ashore

307
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:21,205
...and take stock of our supplies.

308
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,900
We have to find shelter.
Let's go.

309
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,051
There you are baby. I thought I lost you.

310
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,831
Baby girl

311
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:08,508
Hey! I think I found a way off
the beach

312
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:26,756
What was that?

313
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:31,189
It's a scary noise in the dark cave.
Keep moving. Keep moving. Go, go.

314
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,726
If this is Heaven,
I'm checking in.

315
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:07,696
Ladies and gentlemen,

316
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:08,644
I give you-

317
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,861
The Mysterious Island.

318
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:30,769
What is this place?!

319
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:34,974
This island... It shrunk us.

320
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:50,013
Turned us into giants...

321
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:56,103
Sean, what does Verne say about this?

322
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:58,943
One of the first laws of island
bio-geography.

323
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,481
Small animals become large
large animals become small.

324
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:05,274
Lilliputians. Like the little people
in Gulliver's Travels.

325
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:06,644
I can keep one as a pet. I could
make him a little trunk-warmer.

326
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:17,952
Hey, check it out.
You guys see that smoke?

327
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,655
- It gotta be my grandpa's campfire.
- How do you know?

328
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:22,223
What else could it be?

329
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,910
It could be the natives sparking up a barbeque
and getting ready to cook us for dinner.

330
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:27,525
There is one way to find out.

331
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:29,026
Time out.

332
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:32,537
Look, I hope you're grandfather is okay,
but my father and I are going.

333
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:33,943
We head back to the beach.

334
00:23:33,978 --> 00:23:35,474
To do what?

335
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:39,171
Well, S.O.S with seashell and
may be kelp.

336
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:43,145
Kelp! There'a boat-eating, plane-eating hurricane
out there, 24/7

337
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,170
Who's gonna see your kelp?

338
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:46,743
Sean is absolutely right. We need to
stick together.

339
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:49,601
Once we found his grandfather,
then we use his radio to call for help.

340
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,110
Fine.

341
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:56,939
Just know that if we get torn
to bits I'm blaming you.

342
00:23:58,054 --> 00:23:59,811
I'm blaming you too.

343
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:03,031
Nice move.

344
00:24:04,907 --> 00:24:07,196
What did I do?

345
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:10,149
Seriously, what'd I say? What'd I do?

346
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:49,100
That's Sun Protection Factor 100.

347
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,997
Squeeze it and a sweater comes out.

348
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:55,472
That's funy, Navy man. Don't come crying to
me when you're as red as a tomato.

349
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:58,051
Do I look like I burn?

350
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:09,950
Man, that's one gooey rock.

351
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:15,098
No one move.

352
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:20,323
These aren't rocks.

353
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:23,680
They're eggs.

354
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:31,815
Get out of here, man. Why we don't crack
couple of them and mix some omlettes?

355
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:33,137
No, no. It's not a good idea.

356
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:35,046
Come on, man. We haven't had
breakfast yet!

357
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:39,619
Where there are giant eggs there
must be a giant mother.

358
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:47,993
It had to be a lizard.

359
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:49,876
Why couldn't it be snakes?

360
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:55,008
OK. We have to move quickly and carefully.

361
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:58,844
Lizard have incredible hearing and
accute sense of smell.

362
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,948
Let's move. Some smell.

363
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,710
We're literally walking on eggshells

364
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:35,660
Guys!

365
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,776
Don't take another step!

366
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:43,195
Papa, be careful.

367
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,217
Do not worry honey.

368
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,088
I got this. See, no problem.

369
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:53,227
Ohh, man!

370
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,249
Run! Run! Run!

371
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:21,071
- Head to the jungle!
- Faster! Faster!

372
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,234
Let's go! Let's go!

373
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:30,778
Let's go.

374
00:27:31,465 --> 00:27:33,113
This way!

375
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:42,585
Go, go, go!
Right behind you. Hurry!

376
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:45,300
Sean!

377
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:51,014
Hey, you! Godzilla!

378
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:56,089
Oh, crap!

379
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,757
Come on! Come on!

380
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,482
- Come on!
- Keep moving. Come on!

381
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:31,909
Back! Back! Back!

382
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,663
Sean, get behind me!

383
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:36,490
Sean, backpack!

384
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:42,582
- Back! Back! Back!
- Hank!

385
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:44,715
- Hank!
- Not now, Sean. She's scared!

386
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,364
No, she's cold-blooded and attracted to heat!

387
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:52,050
That's emasculating.

388
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:56,284
Now what?

389
00:28:56,838 --> 00:28:59,696
Now, there is only one thing left.

390
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,728
A Thunder Cookie

391
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,200
I think I just made it worse.

392
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,546
I hope she doesn't like Polony sur Fleur.

393
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,042
I hope, she doesn't like fools
pooping in pants.

394
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,881
Everybody, okay?

395
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,058
Yeah.

396
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:05,726
Don't just stand there!

397
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:07,917
Come on!

398
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:12,108
Grandpa!

399
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,026
This was amazing.

400
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:18,360
A pitch-perfect frill-neck lizard mating call!

401
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:20,530
They fall for it. All the time.

402
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:23,048
This is Gabato and Kailani
Their helicopter brought us here.

403
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,812
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

404
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:27,213
I'm Sean's step father.
Hank Parsons.

405
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:29,339
I helped Sean crack your code.

406
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:33,138
You're the step father!
Maybe that's why it took so long.

407
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:36,016
Afterall, how hard can it be
to crack the code...

408
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:39,717
...by converting a string of Vernean
characters into a list of...

409
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:40,824
...dots and dashes?

410
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:43,526
Or you could just send the message
uncoded.

411
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:48,346
There it is. Definitive proof that
you are not an Anderson.

412
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:54,885
You know what? I think it's best
we get out of here.

413
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,195
Besides, after that making calls of yours she may
have an idea about making you her husband.

414
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,371
Witty. Good for you Henry.

415
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,260
The name is Hank.
It's never Henry. Just Hank.

416
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:09,032
I see you're a man of incisive decision.

417
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,741
Why don't you lead the way?

418
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:14,887
Actually, we want to live through
the night. Yes.

419
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:17,987
So, may be you should all
follow me. Come on.

420
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,112
Hank, I'm following you.

421
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:27,354
Come on Gabato, go ahead.

422
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,813
That's awesome!

423
00:31:59,255 --> 00:32:01,343
Here we are, folks!

424
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:06,449
Come on up!
This is my base.

425
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:15,880
Welcome.

426
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:19,656
We got a working elevator, indoor plumbing...

427
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:27,425
I've even got a 75 inches, HD TV.

428
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,236
How did you build this stuff?

429
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,954
I made it out of the sail boat
that brought me here.

430
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:35,795
Old Blue Eyed Lucy.
She gave her life in the hurricane.

431
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,243
So that I could discover
the ever glorious mysterious island.

432
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,392
- Smoothie?
- Thank you.

433
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,320
Is this the radio
you used to send a signal?

434
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:54,907
Yes, I made it myself
out of an alarm clock,

435
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,401
some copper I mined in the hills over there
and a tea spoon.

436
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,734
Do you know how long
it took me to make it, Henry?

437
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:04,154
I don't know, probably little less
than... who cares?

438
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:05,146
Three months.

439
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:07,758
Do you know how long it would
take with someone like you?

440
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:11,644
Forever.

441
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,122
Guys, let's just contact Palau and
get out of this island.

442
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:17,655
It's not that easy, dolly. You have to wait
for the communication satellite...

443
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,528
...to come around in the
proper position.

444
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:23,403
- How long that's gonna take?
- About two weeks.

445
00:33:23,438 --> 00:33:25,049
You mean we're stuck here
for two weeks?

446
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:28,355
Stuck here?
I think it would be fun.

447
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:30,274
We get know each other better.

448
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:33,759
Sean, surviving out of here is not
gonna be fun.

449
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:35,610
Plus, how do you think your mom's
gonna feel...

450
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:36,967
if we're off more than two weeks?

451
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:40,064
By the time you get back, probably
you're gonna be remarried.

452
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:42,733
Will you let him talk to you
like that?

453
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:45,254
It's okay.

454
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:48,325
Okay. So what is the plan,
Colonel Sanders?

455
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:50,786
How about you show some more
your rinky-dink trinkets...

456
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,917
...that are in no way gonna
get us off this island.

457
00:33:52,952 --> 00:33:55,064
And is anyone else thinking
about the lizard eggs hatching?

458
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,332
If you're afraid of a few critters maybe
you shouldn't have come down here, Henry.

459
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,176
Yeah, I mean it's called mysterious island.

460
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:04,249
You should've expected some
mysterious things. It's right in the title.

461
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:05,667
Sean, I know what the book says.

462
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:08,362
Buddy, you wanted to find mysterious island
Mission accomplished.

463
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:11,671
You wanted to find your grandmother...
There she is. Mission's accomplished.

464
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:14,251
At day break we're out of here and
for the last time...

465
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,089
It's... Hank.

466
00:34:16,124 --> 00:34:17,892
What's the hurry?

467
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,674
Tomorrow...

468
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:24,252
I'm gonna show you a place
that will take your breath away

469
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,748
Like forever?

470
00:34:25,781 --> 00:34:30,900
You're gonna find out.
So, let's get some shut-eye.

471
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:34,978
It's big day tomorrow.

472
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:40,419
- Good night, honey
- Good night, papa

473
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,324
Hey, how's it going?

474
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,178
Apart from being stranded on this
stupid island...

475
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:12,738
- ...I'm just fine.
- Good

476
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:15,664
Good. I was thinking you know,
sometime...

477
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,816
I'd like to hang out or something
if you wanted to?

478
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,546
I have a feeling that your idea of fun and...

479
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,650
...my idea of fun are two very different things.

480
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,959
I don't know. What are you doing
on weekends?

481
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:27,616
I collect and label molluscs.

482
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,984
No way! Me too.
I'm way into molluscs.

483
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,662
- Really?
- Yes - Which one is your favourite?

484
00:35:31,752 --> 00:35:33,299
Mine's the Mxyzptlk.

485
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,008
You're not gonna believe me
but that's my favorite too.

486
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:42,260
I've made it up.
Mxyzptlk isn't a snail.

487
00:35:43,096 --> 00:35:44,910
It's one of the Superman's arch enemies.

488
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:53,448
Way to slay the heart.

489
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:58,137
Getting the attention of a woman
is one of the hardest things in the world to do.

490
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:01,836
Alright. So what do I do, Casanova?

491
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:10,816
I've been waited a long time to having
this talk with you, buddy.

492
00:36:10,851 --> 00:36:13,996
There are three things you need to
know about understanding girls.

493
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:17,086
Number one. Don't follow your instincts

494
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:21,580
In any other area in life, instincts will get you
there... not with women.

495
00:36:22,036 --> 00:36:25,203
So whatever you think you should do,
do the opposite.

496
00:36:25,238 --> 00:36:27,195
Number 2. You need to be open, sensitive.

497
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,873
Women don't want a man just because
he's big...

498
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:32,466
...and strong and has abs like mine. No.

499
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:34,035
They want a thinker.

500
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,614
They want a feeler. They want
someone who can understand them

501
00:36:36,649 --> 00:36:41,206
Women want a man who is
in touch with his most inner emotions.

502
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,796
And the third thing is the most important of all.

503
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,078
It's something that women have
responded to for thousands of years.

504
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:50,025
Well, tell me.

505
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:53,159
You've got to do this...

506
00:36:58,197 --> 00:36:59,475
What is that?

507
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,816
That is the pec pop of love...

508
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:03,250
And go on, throw a berry.

509
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:05,704
- No. - Go on and throw a berry.
There is some right behind you.

510
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:08,217
- Grab one and throw. Don't be afraid.
- No. I'm... - They're not gonna bite.

511
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:09,783
Grab a berry!

512
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:19,278
- There, go ahead. Grab a bunch, rapid fire.
Right now. - I'm not doing rapid fire.

513
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,183
They won't stop until you feed them

514
00:37:22,218 --> 00:37:24,750
- Feed them? No!
- Feed them. They're hungry.

515
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,903
- I'll feed them.
- That's a boy! Come get some.

516
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:28,534
OK. You ready? Ready?
Here we go.

517
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:37,942
- OK. Ready, this one's sepcial.
- Just make this one count.

518
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:43,204
No way! That's awesome!

519
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:45,485
Stop encouraging him.

520
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,548
- It is a gift.
- Yes, he has a gift.

521
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:51,723
Sean, it works everytime.

522
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,996
Come on Gabby, get it move on.

523
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,423
Where's he going?

524
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,241
I don't know but if this goes on much
longer he's going to blow a head. Come on.

525
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:02,091
I'm moving. I'm moving.

526
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:06,337
Come on. Come on.
We're almost there.

527
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:12,744
Get ready, Gabby. I'm about to take
your breath away

528
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:24,930
Unbelievable!

529
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,642
How do you like grandma now?

530
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:47,583
Hello?

531
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,878
No one's been home for
thousands of years, Gabby.

532
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:15,001
Can anybody guess what all this is?

533
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:19,794
You know?
Do you know?

534
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:23,275
- Legoland?
- No.

535
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,117
If this is Poseidon...

536
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:34,078
Can you do this?

537
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:46,900
Atlantis.

538
00:39:46,935 --> 00:39:50,043
I can't believe it.
We're standing in the lost city of Atlantis.

539
00:39:50,107 --> 00:39:52,017
The same Atlantis that Verne wrote about.

540
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:53,616
Down to the last detail.

541
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:56,163
But wasn't Atlantis supposed
to be underwater?

542
00:39:56,198 --> 00:39:57,786
When Verne wrote about it,
it was.

543
00:39:57,987 --> 00:40:02,229
But it has a 140 years cycle
and spends half its time above the water.

544
00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:04,173
And what about the other half?

545
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:05,861
This's called tectonic recurrence.

546
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,355
The ocean bed buckles due to volcanic
activity on the shelf...

547
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:10,206
..pushing and pulling land to surface.

548
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:13,056
Then the entire island...

549
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:16,341
...sinks back to bottom of the sea.

550
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:18,676
Nobody's ever seen this before
in this big of a scale

551
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:20,220
This is amazing.

552
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:21,572
Come with me.

553
00:40:25,116 --> 00:40:28,747
I've been looking for this piece
of paradise for 30 years.

554
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,564
I promised your old man that we
would find it together...

555
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,107
But he is not here to enjoy it.

556
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:41,035
So I made sure that his son
would be.

557
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,480
That's why I encoded the message.

558
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:47,553
I wanted an Anderson
to see this place...

559
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,278
...before anyone else.

560
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:54,404
Some of them put their names on the stars...

561
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:56,989
...species, plants.

562
00:40:57,024 --> 00:41:01,306
We can put our
names on this gorgeous island.

563
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:05,763
In two weeks we'll contact
the authorities to pick us up and...

564
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:08,339
...in three weeks we'll be
on the cover of TIME magazine.

565
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:12,794
- Guys, we've got a problem.
- What are you talking about?

566
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:14,791
See this water? It's salt water.

567
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:18,914
The only way salt water can get this far
is if it enters subsoil from below.

568
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:21,161
- So?
- So, this island is about to go under.

569
00:41:21,168 --> 00:41:22,738
The only salt water here
is in your brain.

570
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:27,171
I analyzed the samples and
calculated the numbers.

571
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:31,286
This island isn't due to sink for 14 years.

572
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:32,719
Alexander, your numbers are wrong.

573
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:34,912
And how would you know that?

574
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:37,605
I've come across this when we were
building over run-off areas. It's

575
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,973
...called soil liquefaction.

576
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:42,230
Look. You can see it in the cracks in
the confining beds. All along here

577
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:44,725
...along here...

578
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:47,367
Over there, back here.

579
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,417
OK, you made your point.

580
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,190
So how long do we have?

581
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:53,281
If I had to guess...

582
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:55,496
Based on all this water...

583
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:57,908
Two, three days max.

584
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:01,341
Then what? Because
I ain't no flotation device, man.

585
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,529
Well, you're gonna be if
we don't figure this out

586
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:04,898
There must be some way off this island.

587
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:05,971
We could make a little boat.

588
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,988
The Storm around this island would chew
it up and spit it out.

589
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,960
I forgot something.

590
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:12,303
What about the Nautilus?

591
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:15,090
How is an exercise machine
gonna help us get out of here?

592
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:18,565
No, no, the Nautilus. Captain Nemo's
submarine built in 1870.

593
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,360
Well done, Sean.

594
00:42:20,395 --> 00:42:25,283
Chapter 16, Verne wrote,
"It's hidden on the island."

595
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:27,867
Yes. If we make it there in time
we can ride it under the hurricane...

596
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:29,301
...all the way back to Palau.

597
00:42:29,336 --> 00:42:32,786
OK. One question.
Where is it?

598
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:36,409
There is only one man
that could tell us that.

599
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:40,567
And this is Captain Nemo, himself.

600
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,181
Dakkar Grotto. The final resting
place of Captain Nemo.

601
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,573
Legend has it that his crew buried
him in there.

602
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:58,006
I'll tell you what'd better be
in there.

603
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,766
Nemo's Journal.

604
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:03,506
He could tell us the
location of the Nautilus.

605
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:06,094
I've never been able to
crawl in there on my own.

606
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,196
Too many fried eggs, I'm afraid.

607
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:11,235
I'll go.

608
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm the only one who can fit there.

609
00:43:13,755 --> 00:43:15,340
No way. It's too dangerous.

610
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,637
I's really sweet, but I don't
need your permission.

611
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:26,216
Honey... Papa loves you.

612
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,731
Remember the drill. Careful.
We don't know what's down there.

613
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:35,003
- Honey, honey! You okay?
- Fine.

614
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,203
I'm inside!

615
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:39,223
What was that?

616
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:42,265
That's what a sinking island
sounds like.

617
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:54,583
Help!

618
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,497
Hurry!

619
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,981
Pull her out! Pull her out!
Pull her!

620
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:08,148
Hi

621
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:12,830
Man, he had terrible handwriting.

622
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,611
- Is that Sanskrit?
- Close. It is Hindi.

623
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,017
Captain Nemo was from India.

624
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:18,510
He says here...

625
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:23,375
...that the Nautilus is a basalt cave
on the other side of the island

626
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,509
...just under the cliffs.

627
00:45:26,984 --> 00:45:28,562
I know this place.

628
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:29,752
Ok. That's where we're gonna go.

629
00:45:29,996 --> 00:45:30,973
And what's the best way to get there?

630
00:45:31,967 --> 00:45:32,970
Now that depends.

631
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:35,940
The safest way
is around the shoreline.

632
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:39,071
But the fastest
is to cross the heart of the island.

633
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:40,663
What do you think, Hank?

634
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:42,800
I think we've got no choice.
The quickest way.

635
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,857
- Yeah, he's right. I'm in.
- Yes, but let me warn you

636
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:50,508
The heart of this island is full of
jagged mountains,

637
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:52,906
dark jungles and terrifying creatures

638
00:45:52,941 --> 00:45:55,764
...who will give you nightmares.

639
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:59,567
So...
Who is up for an adventure?

640
00:47:29,715 --> 00:47:31,562
Are we there, yet?

641
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:33,496
We'll get there when we get there, Gabby.

642
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:38,683
What was that?

643
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:50,538
Tectonic plates are starting to pull apart
underneath the island.

644
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,728
We gotta move. Let's go.
Move. Move.

645
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,000
Wait, what is that?

646
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:12,404
Volcanic ashes?

647
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:16,216
- Looks like...
- Gold.

648
00:48:17,707 --> 00:48:19,177
Pure gold.

649
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:22,587
That must be the treasure Robert Louis
Stevenson was talking about in Treasure Island.

650
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:26,413
Volcanoes are made of what they erupt
so if that thing is erupting gold, then it's...

651
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:29,280
A mountain of gold.

652
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:32,127
There must be massive gold deposits everywhere.
Let's go, check it out.

653
00:48:32,683 --> 00:48:34,091
Hold on.

654
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:36,638
That'll take us days out of our way
We don't have the time.

655
00:48:36,673 --> 00:48:38,055
Let's make the time.

656
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,260
Volcanic Gold is a huge scientific
breakthrough.

657
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:42,799
I understand that
but we got to get the Nautilus.

658
00:48:42,865 --> 00:48:44,697
Hank, I'm not just a little kid.

659
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:46,991
- OK? I get a say on this too.
- Sean...

660
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:50,137
- I am responsible for you. I've never take
a chance of risking your life. - Hey, hey!

661
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:52,943
Hey! Hey! You can't tell him what to do.

662
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:54,645
You're not the boy's father.

663
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,734
From what I hear, you haven't been
a much of grandfather.

664
00:48:56,769 --> 00:49:02,184
I have given him something to live up to.
Science, adventure, wonder.

665
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:04,216
What have you ever given him?

666
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,952
I've given him a lot of things, Alexander.

667
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:08,108
Essential responsibility being one of them.

668
00:49:08,143 --> 00:49:10,149
Something clearly you don't have.

669
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:15,081
You're not going for that gold. We're
get out of here, end the discussion!

670
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,032
Sean, please.
We have to get out of this island.

671
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:34,873
Bye bye gold.

672
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,084
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah, fine.

673
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:14,087
Just, you know, I don't need Hank trying
to tell me what to do all the time.

674
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:18,630
My dad's always trying to get involved
too but usually he ends up embarassing me.

675
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:20,282
Yes... how?

676
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,911
Last summer I was trying to get a job.

677
00:50:22,198 --> 00:50:24,197
So, he flew all over Palau dropping...

678
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:26,956
thousands of copies of my CV's
from the helicopter.

679
00:50:28,284 --> 00:50:31,355
It's been so embarassing. It's not the
worst thing to try so hard.

680
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,519
No.

681
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:37,530
I mean, the worst would be
if he didn't try at all.

682
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,568
Alexander, you're sure your compass
readings are correct?

683
00:50:52,603 --> 00:50:53,970
Of course I'm. Why?

684
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:57,294
Why? Because we're down here
and we need to be all the way up there.

685
00:50:57,899 --> 00:51:02,240
For every problem there is a solution
my large friend.

686
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:06,341
And I think this might be a fun one.

687
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:08,638
You think this might be a fun one, eh!

688
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:10,964
Does anybody have an umbrella?
Because apparently Mary Poppins here...

689
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:12,968
...is gonna fly to the top of the cliff.

690
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:16,058
I knew you'd be good for something.

691
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:19,334
Wait here, Henry.

692
00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:25,685
- Where is he going? - I don't know. But
that guy's completely out of his mind.

693
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:30,241
Oh, I most certainly am.

694
00:51:30,276 --> 00:51:34,821
It turns out that mounting the bee is easy
if you don't look into its eyes.

695
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:37,030
This is so sick.

696
00:51:37,168 --> 00:51:41,064
Alright. You, get down. Now!

697
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:41,888
Why would I want to get down?

698
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,470
Because medical care does not cover
old ladies falling off giant bees.

699
00:51:45,505 --> 00:51:47,816
- Please, get down.
- Suit yourself.

700
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,011
But make sure you're wearing swimming trash

701
00:51:50,046 --> 00:51:52,838
...when this place becomes
the Pacific Ocean.

702
00:51:57,308 --> 00:51:58,726
Sean!

703
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:06,112
Can we fly together?

704
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:44,885
This is amazing.
Like riding stallions across the Serengeti

705
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,929
This is beautiful.
Talk about paradise!

706
00:52:58,565 --> 00:53:00,047
Oh man!

707
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:02,199
- Is that...
- ...bird poop?

708
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:06,036
Then, must be a giant...

709
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,889
...bird!

710
00:53:12,668 --> 00:53:14,615
Into the trees.

711
00:53:18,744 --> 00:53:20,811
It looks hungry!

712
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:22,255
This is white fury needle tail.

713
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,736
It feeds on worms, aphids and yes, bees.

714
00:53:27,568 --> 00:53:29,311
There's another one.

715
00:53:41,607 --> 00:53:43,148
Hold on!

716
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:11,288
Oy! Stay in your own lane!

717
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:16,465
- Are you familiar with chicken?
- These are not chickens.

718
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,753
No, the game.
Chicken.

719
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:22,107
I liked the way she thinks.

720
00:54:35,456 --> 00:54:37,251
Not yet.

721
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:39,901
Not yet!

722
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:55,653
- How good was that little buddy?
- I love you man!

723
00:54:55,688 --> 00:54:57,843
I love you so much!

724
00:54:58,621 --> 00:55:02,000
OK. OK. Too much happy.
That's to much happy.

725
00:55:25,324 --> 00:55:27,404
Kailani!

726
00:55:47,925 --> 00:55:52,228
- You saved me.
- Yeah. Yes, I did.

727
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:55,427
Or maybe not!

728
00:55:57,968 --> 00:56:00,476
Go! Go! Get out of here!

729
00:56:05,026 --> 00:56:06,962
Sean, what are you doing?

730
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,679
Come on, bird!

731
00:56:22,664 --> 00:56:25,006
Let's do this!

732
00:56:48,465 --> 00:56:51,365
Sean, talk to me.

733
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,535
My ankle. I can't move it.

734
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,626
I think it's serious.
Let me look at it.

735
00:56:55,654 --> 00:56:59,896
But not, not here. This part of the island
can be even more dangerous after dark.

736
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:05,003
OK. I'll get you up.
On three. One... two... three... up.

737
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:10,380
Give me your arm. OK.

738
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,756
Has the swelling gone down? It's dislocated
pretty badly. We might be here a while.

739
00:57:38,049 --> 00:57:39,926
I'll go and get some water.

740
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:46,567
I'm going to have to pop it back in, buddy.

741
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:48,885
Well, let's do it

742
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,771
Alexander, I'll brace him.
Let's do it on three

743
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:53,436
Got it.

744
00:57:54,866 --> 00:57:56,800
- Ready?
- Yes...

745
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:58,830
One...

746
00:58:00,062 --> 00:58:02,699
- What happened to two and three?
- Yes, what happened to two and three?

747
00:58:02,734 --> 00:58:06,472
Two.. three.
That wasn't so bad.

748
00:58:06,507 --> 00:58:08,112
It wasn't very good.

749
00:58:08,453 --> 00:58:10,358
Do we have anything for the pain?

750
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,593
There is nothing in here.

751
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:21,425
Alright buddy.
Here we go. Good.

752
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:23,743
Don't worry.

753
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:27,285
We have this.

754
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:29,899
No. No, no, no.

755
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:30,985
Don't worry.

756
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,659
I won't sing to dudes underneath
the stars, in front of cozy fires.

757
00:58:33,954 --> 00:58:35,943
Not my style.

758
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:38,100
- You can sing?
- A little bit.

759
00:58:38,135 --> 00:58:40,873
Really? The music is
nature's painkiller.

760
00:58:41,037 --> 00:58:42,953
- Sing a song.
- No.

761
00:58:42,988 --> 00:58:45,010
Hank, come on.

762
00:58:46,578 --> 00:58:51,711
OK. Don't worry.
I've got something special for you.

763
00:59:03,987 --> 00:59:06,143
That going to make me feel better?

764
00:59:06,163 --> 00:59:08,785
Slow down.
It's gotta get in tune.

765
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,765
It takes a big man to play
with a little guitar.

766
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,877
And an even bigger one to listen.

767
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:19,312
<i>#I see trees of green#</i>

768
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:22,305
<i>Red roses too</i>

769
00:59:22,691 --> 00:59:28,091
<i>I see them bloom...
for me and for you...</i>

770
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:31,581
<i>And I think to myself</i>

771
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:38,198
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

772
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:44,528
<i>I see giant bees and...</i>

773
00:59:44,628 --> 00:59:47,141
<i>I could have told you</i>

774
00:59:47,176 --> 00:59:50,518
<i>Don't trust Alexander...</i>

775
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:54,242
<i>He's older than Yoda.</i>

776
00:59:54,277 --> 00:59:57,932
<i>And I think to myself</i>

777
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:04,078
<i>What a wonderful world.</i>

778
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:09,543
<i>The island that we stand on</i>

779
01:00:09,548 --> 01:00:12,211
<i>well it's currently sinking</i>

780
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,101
sending those secret codes

781
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:18,277
<i>what the heck were you drinking?</i>

782
01:00:18,404 --> 01:00:21,267
<i>But it's all in the past</i>

783
01:00:21,302 --> 01:00:24,280
<i>we wiped the slate clean</i>

784
01:00:24,315 --> 01:00:29,051
<i>We're going to find...</i>

785
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:33,753
<i>Nemo's submarine</i>

786
01:00:33,788 --> 01:00:37,679
<i>And you'll think to yourself...</i>

787
01:00:38,374 --> 01:00:44,176
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

788
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:52,664
That was extraordinary

789
01:00:52,695 --> 01:00:53,695
What? My multiple talents?

790
01:00:53,696 --> 01:00:58,251
No. After all these years finding
the elusive singing sasquatch.

791
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:03,452
No, seriously, where did you
learn to play like that?

792
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:06,332
My dad used to sing
when I was a kid.

793
01:01:07,889 --> 01:01:10,355
Remind me to buy him a drink
when we get back.

794
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:13,078
Good luck finding him.

795
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:19,363
- Why? Where is he?
- I don't know.

796
01:01:20,863 --> 01:01:24,647
He left when I was 8
and never seen him since.

797
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:32,995
At least I got a good song out of him, right?

798
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:47,351
- You like him, don't you?
- Who, Sean? No.

799
01:01:50,035 --> 01:01:54,262
He's a little hot headed, you know,
but he's a good kid.

800
01:01:54,297 --> 01:01:56,234
It will never happen between us.

801
01:01:56,352 --> 01:01:59,004
I mean if we get off this island
he'll go back to America...

802
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:01,540
...move on with his life, go to college.

803
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:04,645
And I'll go back to tiny Palau.

804
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,043
You could go to college some day,
if that's something you really want.

805
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:12,187
And who's gonna help you at work?
Plus, we can't afford it.

806
01:02:12,206 --> 01:02:16,023
Don't say that. You wanna go to college
you can go to college. OK?

807
01:02:16,058 --> 01:02:18,702
I can make that happen.

808
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:25,228
- I promise.
- Thanks, Papa.

809
01:02:47,522 --> 01:02:51,233
- Hank! Hank, get up.
- Something's wrong.

810
01:02:51,763 --> 01:02:54,408
- Everybody, up.
- Where all this water come from?

811
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,945
It looks like the soil-liquefaction rate
tripled overnight.

812
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,950
What's that mean?

813
01:02:57,985 --> 01:03:00,102
It means this island is sinking
faster than we thought.

814
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:02,077
I thought you said
a couple of days?

815
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:03,499
Now, more like a couple of hours.

816
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:05,000
A couple of hours?

817
01:03:05,027 --> 01:03:08,200
We need to get that sub now or we're
gonna be 20.000 leagues under the sea.

818
01:03:09,564 --> 01:03:11,214
Papa?

819
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:17,657
Papa?
Papa?

820
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,503
- He's gone.
- Stay calm.

821
01:03:20,568 --> 01:03:22,858
Probably he's gone for a pee.

822
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:26,186
Oh, no. No!

823
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:27,743
What?

824
01:03:27,816 --> 01:03:30,458
Last night he promised me he'll
send me to the college.

825
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:34,034
Now, I know what he meant.
He's going out to the mountain of gold.

826
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:38,236
Look, I got to go and get him.You guys
head to the sub.

827
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:38,969
If we're not there in time leave without us.

828
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:42,266
No way! You're not going alone.
I'll go with you.

829
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:44,708
Sean, you have dislocated ankle
and that's at least 6 km.

830
01:03:44,743 --> 01:03:46,940
No, I'm fine. I can do it
It'll be okay.

831
01:03:46,975 --> 01:03:50,767
No, Sean. He's right.
You're not in condition to make that trip.

832
01:03:50,846 --> 01:03:54,552
- She can't go alone.
- Then I'll go with her.

833
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:57,986
I'm the one who called you to this island.

834
01:03:58,021 --> 01:04:00,750
It's my fault you're in this quagmire.

835
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:03,596
If this map of ours is right...

836
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:08,790
then the Trident Cliffs should be about
a mile and a half in that direction.

837
01:04:09,988 --> 01:04:14,097
You get that Nautilus as soon as you can
and then meet us on the shoreline.

838
01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:16,201
We have only one map.

839
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:17,422
Give me the phone.

840
01:04:24,743 --> 01:04:26,340
Now we have two.

841
01:04:26,536 --> 01:04:29,798
Hank, well done.

842
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:34,779
- Thank you... you called me Hank.
- Anytime.

843
01:04:37,145 --> 01:04:38,752
Be careful.

844
01:04:39,281 --> 01:04:41,056
Come on, darling.

845
01:04:42,696 --> 01:04:46,242
I'll see you soon.
I promise.

846
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:58,079
- Ready, Sean?
- Yeah.

847
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,743
Come on.

848
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:30,041
Gold!

849
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:33,102
My prayers have been answered.

850
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:55,514
This is Posedion's trident.
Right where it's supposed to be.

851
01:05:56,113 --> 01:05:58,083
We need the cliff.
This is just shoreline.

852
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:02,007
But Nautilus is supposed to be
inside the cave right here.

853
01:06:02,243 --> 01:06:03,845
Then the map is wrong.

854
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,665
Let me see it.

855
01:06:09,471 --> 01:06:11,609
Sean, we're in the right place.

856
01:06:11,644 --> 01:06:14,201
Then where is this cave?
Where is the Nautilus?

857
01:06:14,712 --> 01:06:16,196
Down there.

858
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:19,415
The sea level rose over 100 feet
in the last 24 hours

859
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:22,989
I can't believe this is happening.
We're too late. It is over.

860
01:06:23,268 --> 01:06:26,535
No, it's not. It's OK.
It's okay. We just got to think.

861
01:06:27,142 --> 01:06:28,852
I got to think of a way to get in.

862
01:06:29,684 --> 01:06:31,014
I got it.

863
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:33,180
- What?
- Scuba tanks.

864
01:06:33,277 --> 01:06:35,189
Now we're listing the
things we don't have?

865
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:38,426
OK. A jet pack, girl friend, calligraphy paper...

866
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:39,504
No, no. Listen to me.
We just...

867
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:42,851
- Calligraphy paper?
- Yeah. It just popped into my head.

868
01:06:42,886 --> 01:06:44,979
- We still have a couple of bags, right?
- Yes

869
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:46,652
So, we'll take what we salvaged from the beach...

870
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:48,823
and we'll make makeshift scuba tanks.

871
01:06:49,851 --> 01:06:52,389
No short breaths, no wasted movements.

872
01:06:52,444 --> 01:06:54,753
Make sure you equailize your pressure
as you go down.

873
01:06:56,408 --> 01:07:01,106
You know, if we die down there
mom's gonna kill us.

874
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,596
Let's do this.

875
01:07:20,617 --> 01:07:23,808
Papa?
Papa.

876
01:07:29,065 --> 01:07:32,858
What're you doing here?
You supposed to be back in the Nautilus.

877
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:35,422
- I'll meet you back there.
- Papa, stop.

878
01:07:36,622 --> 01:07:42,013
- Stop! Papa, stop!
- Baby, this is our only chance.

879
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:44,057
One chance to send you to college.

880
01:07:44,092 --> 01:07:47,614
To give you a decent life. A better life!

881
01:07:48,987 --> 01:07:51,277
Papa...

882
01:07:51,691 --> 01:07:54,317
We have all we want.
No other needs.

883
01:07:56,308 --> 01:07:58,791
Just as long as we're together.

884
01:08:00,507 --> 01:08:05,025
- Let's go home.
- Alright. Alright. -Okay.

885
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:08,509
Double time, Gabby.

886
01:08:17,592 --> 01:08:21,326
OK. It's only a 100 feet down and
we've got two minutes of air with us.

887
01:08:21,409 --> 01:08:23,856
- OK
- Are you ready?

888
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:27,256
- I'm ready. You ready?
- I'm totally ready.

889
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:30,290
- And I'm totally ready.
- Well, I'm probably more ready than you.

890
01:08:30,421 --> 01:08:32,470
No way. I'm twice ready as you are

891
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,524
We're procrastinating out of fear, aren't we?

892
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:38,273
Absolutely

893
01:09:32,595 --> 01:09:34,254
Wait, which way you're going?

894
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:37,606
Frankly, I'm not sure.

895
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,018
You're not sure?
We're running out of time.

896
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,962
Which way is North?

897
01:09:43,264 --> 01:09:44,808
This way.

898
01:09:48,248 --> 01:09:50,231
No, no. It's not. It's... this way.

899
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:56,025
We get in too much magnetic friction.

900
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,007
- What does that mean?
- Means we are lost.

901
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:30,085
We made it!

902
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,167
The Nautilus!

903
01:11:42,634 --> 01:11:44,437
Sean, give me the flashlight.

904
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:13,220
OK. Let's power this thing up
and get to the others.

905
01:12:16,842 --> 01:12:19,129
How do we find the north
without a compass?

906
01:12:19,485 --> 01:12:21,870
Spiders.

907
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,955
I already rode giant bees.
I can't get on a spider.

908
01:12:27,487 --> 01:12:32,405
Spiders weave their nets facing to the south.

909
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,951
Guys, I think
I found our spider.

910
01:12:41,786 --> 01:12:44,362
And we go to other way.

911
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:56,391
The ballast control panel
is got to be around somewhere

912
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,345
Where is the power switch?

913
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:10,697
I think this is it.

914
01:13:11,044 --> 01:13:13,983
- How do you know?
- It was right there in chapter 17

915
01:13:14,003 --> 01:13:16,291
Looks like someone still reads Jules Verne.

916
01:13:16,728 --> 01:13:18,915
Let's fire this baby up

917
01:13:26,658 --> 01:13:30,851
Come on, come on! Wake up!

918
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:36,015
The engine is dead.
We gotta get under the hood.

919
01:13:50,386 --> 01:13:52,300
These batteries are 140 years old.

920
01:13:54,136 --> 01:13:56,223
It's gonna need a jump start.

921
01:13:56,325 --> 01:13:58,904
But that's gonna take thousands of
kilowatts of electricity.

922
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:10,036
- Do you think what I'm thinking?
- That's completely insane.

923
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,766
Exactly.

924
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:27,497
- Cable's attached to the harpoon?
- Yeah. - Great.

925
01:14:27,651 --> 01:14:30,391
When we're done charging that thing
out there we're gonna be on our way.

926
01:14:30,426 --> 01:14:31,859
OK.

927
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:33,845
I need you to come back.

928
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,497
Of course I'm gonna come back.
Somebody's gonna help you pilot this thing.

929
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:39,472
No.
I mean... Look...

930
01:14:40,784 --> 01:14:45,302
If anybody ever asks,
I'm gonna deny that I ever said this.

931
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:47,936
I need you to come back!

932
01:14:48,737 --> 01:14:51,703
I had a lot of people take off on me
in my life.

933
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:53,781
And I don't want you
to be one of them.

934
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:59,616
Before we left I told your mom that
I was gonna take care of her son.

935
01:14:59,909 --> 01:15:02,824
OK? You're not just her son,
you're my family too now.

936
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:06,912
I promise you I'll come back for you.
OK?

937
01:15:08,174 --> 01:15:11,793
- OK?
- OK.

938
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,405
Now...

939
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:19,475
Who's up for an adventure?

940
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:34,754
- Where are they?
- They left us here.

941
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:07,510
They'd better get here quick.
We're running out of real estate.

942
01:16:19,335 --> 01:16:23,011
Hank, over here!

943
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,271
Where are you?
Where are you?

944
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,753
Come on, Hank.
Come on!

945
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:15,472
Where are you?

946
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:23,456
Come on, show me that
1000-watt smile.

947
01:17:26,706 --> 01:17:28,043
Do it now!

948
01:17:32,299 --> 01:17:33,821
Yes!

949
01:17:55,339 --> 01:17:59,820
- I love you Papa.
- I love you baby.

950
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:14,266
Down we go!

951
01:18:55,095 --> 01:18:57,592
- We made it.
- Not yet, we haven't.

952
01:19:22,681 --> 01:19:24,723
Up, ahead!
We're gonna be blocked!

953
01:19:27,318 --> 01:19:29,888
Gabato, I need you to captain us out of here.

954
01:19:29,923 --> 01:19:31,203
Me?

955
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:33,588
You brought us to the island.
You can take us back. You got this.

956
01:19:35,735 --> 01:19:39,355
Sean, on my signal, hit that button.

957
01:19:39,468 --> 01:19:41,978
Yeah, you're right.
It's like flying my helicopter.

958
01:19:42,308 --> 01:19:44,182
OK.

959
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:07,889
Hank.
Hank!

960
01:20:08,489 --> 01:20:10,703
Hank!

961
01:20:12,803 --> 01:20:14,590
Fire!

962
01:20:43,115 --> 01:20:45,097
We made it!
We did it!

963
01:20:45,611 --> 01:20:48,863
We did it!

964
01:21:08,244 --> 01:21:10,924
And we're at cruise control.

965
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:18,123
- Nice work.
- You too.

966
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:24,176
Hey. I can't believe we actually
made it off the island.

967
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:26,778
Yeah.

968
01:21:29,007 --> 01:21:31,123
Pop your pecs.

969
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:37,237
- I'm not gonna pop my pecs.
- Now's the perfect time. She will love it. Believe me.

970
01:21:37,244 --> 01:21:40,241
- Pulp it. - I'm not...
- Pulp it. - I'm not gonna pop my pecs.

971
01:21:40,444 --> 01:21:41,970
- I'm sure she will love it.
- Hey, gentlemen.

972
01:21:43,112 --> 01:21:45,116
Are you two done yet?

973
01:21:45,799 --> 01:21:48,856
Pop your pecs.

974
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:55,502
Thank you... for everything!

975
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,427
That works too.

976
01:22:02,587 --> 01:22:07,014
I'm so happy right now. I don't know how this
moment could get any better.

977
01:22:07,312 --> 01:22:12,470
Well, one way it could get better is if you steer us
away from this coral reef.

978
01:22:18,283 --> 01:22:22,158
Good afternoon folks, and
welcome to the Gabato Luxury Tour.

979
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:26,631
If you look out the window on your left side
you will see what's known as the Pacific Ocean.

980
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:28,576
Here we go again.

981
01:22:49,346 --> 01:22:51,799
That's the third times today Papa.
I'm fine.

982
01:22:51,937 --> 01:22:55,576
Baby, I heard there was a 2.3 magnitude
earthquake in Ohio.

983
01:22:55,611 --> 01:22:56,966
Are you anywhere near Ohio?

984
01:22:57,467 --> 01:22:58,969
It is 2000 miles away.

985
01:22:59,004 --> 01:23:01,318
Look, you don't need to worry
about any earthquakes here.

986
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:03,134
- What about volcanoes?
- No.

987
01:23:03,569 --> 01:23:06,194
- Giant Birds?
- Bye Papa. I love you.

988
01:23:06,229 --> 01:23:09,653
I love you too. Hey, can you wish
Sean happy birthday for me?

989
01:23:09,688 --> 01:23:12,181
And, I may be call you later, say,
about five minutes.

990
01:23:12,232 --> 01:23:14,688
- Goodbye Papa.
- I love you baby. Goodbye.

991
01:23:15,674 --> 01:23:19,350
OK. Are we ready for the journey?

992
01:23:25,698 --> 01:23:27,353
Hello.

993
01:23:27,388 --> 01:23:29,649
Hello guys. Sorry, I'm late.

994
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:32,914
- Hi, darling.
- Good to see you.

995
01:23:32,949 --> 01:23:34,764
Glad to see you.

996
01:23:34,795 --> 01:23:36,422
- Come here a second.
- OK.

997
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:41,889
You raised a great man.

998
01:23:41,924 --> 01:23:45,802
No. We are raising a great man.

999
01:23:51,184 --> 01:23:53,679
Open this one first.

1000
01:23:53,988 --> 01:23:55,925
Post mark is Cameroon?

1001
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:03,054
It's from Grandpa.

1002
01:24:04,395 --> 01:24:07,293
He wants to give me his present
next time he sees me.

1003
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:22,804
- Don't just sit there. Applaud!
- Grandpa!

1004
01:24:27,436 --> 01:24:29,092
I can't believe you're here.

1005
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:32,248
I wouldn't have missed your birthday
for the world.

1006
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:36,367
I wanted to give you this.

1007
01:24:36,953 --> 01:24:39,448
- Book?
- It's not just a book.

1008
01:24:39,483 --> 01:24:41,903
It is a trip I want us to go on.

1009
01:24:41,938 --> 01:24:44,672
All of us as a family.

1010
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:53,816
From the Earth to the Moon

1011
01:24:53,854 --> 01:24:55,869
What do you say?

1012
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,883
I think there is only one thing
to say.

1013
01:24:58,976 --> 01:25:01,267
Who is up for an adventure?

1014
01:25:01,302 --> 01:25:02,715
No. No. No!

1015
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,981
Oh, honey. What could possible go
wrong? It's only the moon.

1016
01:25:05,982 --> 01:25:11,919
