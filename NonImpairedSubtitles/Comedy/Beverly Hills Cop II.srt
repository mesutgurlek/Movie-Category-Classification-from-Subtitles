1
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,469
Do exactly as l say. Stand up slowly,
walk ahead of me and open the door.

2
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,878
Freeze!
Everybody freeze! Nobody move!

3
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,398
You, lock the doors.
All of you, eat the floor! Now! Now!

4
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,558
- Get your ass down here now.
- Lock it. Right now, lock it.

5
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,989
Eat the floor. Move!

6
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,558
Let's go!

7
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,669
- Come on, move it. Go.
- Two minutes.

8
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,436
1:45.

9
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,476
Stay down.

10
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,436
One minute.

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,836
30 seconds.

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,951
Now!

13
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,357
- Time!
- Move out.

14
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,434
- Hey, Ace, over here.
- Hey, Vinnie.

15
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,750
l'd very much like you to meet Judy.

16
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,991
She can suck a golf ball
through 20 feet of garden hose.

17
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,916
- lmpressive. Can you excuse us?
- Go over there! Go over there!

18
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,958
Thank you, Judy.
Where'd you find that bitch?

19
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,315
- She's my girl.
- The bitch ain't happy.

20
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,234
- l need help. More credit cards.
- How many?

21
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,198
American Express blank credit cards.
l need 2,000.

22
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,397
- Get the fuck out of here!
- lf you can't handle it,

23
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,074
l'll take my money
to somebody who can.

24
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,312
- OK. You got the money?
- l got a bag of money.

25
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,236
This big, this wide,
full to the brim with money.

26
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,880
- When do you need them?
- Three hours.

27
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,633
- Get out. Give me time.
- l'm a businessman.

28
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,473
- l got to make moves.
- Three hours!

29
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,111
lf you can't help me, l'll go
somewhere else. l got to move.

30
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,510
- You got the money?
- l got the money. You got the cards?

31
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,310
Listen, you meet me at this address.
Three hours.

32
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,598
Don't have me standing around while
you're messing with the titty woman.

33
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,389
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

34
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,633
Foley, only real cops
can come in here.

35
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,271
- l thought you were dead, Granby.
- l hate to bother you. One question.

36
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,630
- l got to go.
- l'll ask you later.

37
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,676
You act like you never saw a suit!

38
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,916
Detective Axel Foley, please.

39
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,714
You've reached the home
of George Kingfish Stephens.

40
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,598
Sorry l'm not in
but l've gone to the Lodge Hall.

41
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,514
Leave a message and l'll get back
at my earliest inconvenience.

42
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,398
- Axel, it's Bogomil.
- How you doing?

43
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,074
l have to cancel on the fishing trip.

44
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,628
l was going to teach you how to fish.

45
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,872
lt's OK, l'm up to my ass on this
credit card fake, and l'm close.

46
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,757
How's Jan?

47
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,469
lf she didn't have a father with
a gun, something would've happened!

48
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,031
She's great, isn't she?
l'm into something important here.

49
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,998
l'll fill you in
when l know more myself.

50
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,517
l'm late, Axel.
Look, you take care of yourself.

51
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,991
Punch Rosewood in his eye
and slap Taggart's bald head for me.

52
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,913
Bye, Axel. l'll call you in a week.

53
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,437
Marcy doesn't want to meet you.

54
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,833
lnspector Todd wants to see you now.
What do you mean she doesn't want to?

55
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,798
- She doesn't like you.
- She doesn't know me.

56
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,678
- l described you to her.
- Why?! l help you.

57
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,470
l tell Todd you're working 24 hours
a day. Look at that watch.

58
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,869
Jeffrey, please, leave me alone!

59
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,599
l got to work undercover with you.
Why not?

60
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,231
lf Marcy won't give me her number,
l'll give you mine, you pass it on.

61
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,356
l'm very close to shooting you.

62
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,671
As far as undercover goes,
l want to be involved.

63
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,639
You want to work undercover?
When Todd asks where l am,

64
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,678
tell him l'm pursuing my credit card
bust. Now you're undercover.

65
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,039
LA Times got a letter like that
a few hours ago.

66
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,872
He knows that, Billy.

67
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,117
ls this guy serious?

68
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,033
He's serious about
the way he pulled the job.

69
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,669
He knew exactly how long
to stay inside and what to take.

70
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,038
- Captain, l have this friend...
- Why are you involved in this case?

71
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,829
l assigned you and Taggart
to the Peterson extortion case.

72
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,832
Bogomil, get your men in here.
Come on.

73
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,555
You can't keep God waiting.

74
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,949
l don't want to hear
that kind of talk.

75
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,873
He's fired every cop
who worked for the old chief.

76
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,953
- There's only us three left.
- He's still head of this department.

77
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,756
Yes, sir.

78
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,392
Very smart, Billy.

79
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,516
l have a relationship with this dude.

80
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,559
Dude? Dude? We're not even
supposed to be working on this case.

81
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,677
Come on, Sarge.
l know you have domestic troubles,

82
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,312
but you got to cool out, relax.
Things like this work out. Trust me.

83
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,516
You moron. You called the
Supervising Agent of the goddamn FBl

84
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,750
to help break this Alphabet code?

85
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,715
This is a local crime. My men
will solve it locally, Roseweed.

86
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,110
- Sir, my name's not Roseweed...
- Shut up, please.

87
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,916
And you, Captain Bogomil, this
Alphabet investigation was your baby.

88
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,198
Did you call the FBl? Did you order
Rosewood to do that? Did you?

89
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,398
- The Captain didn't know about it.
- l said shut up!

90
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,199
Captain Bogomil didn't
call the FBl. l did.

91
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,840
l said shut up.

92
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,639
l'm waiting on you, Andrew.

93
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,918
Did you order him to call
the goddamn FBl or what?

94
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,309
No, sir, but that's beside the point.

95
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,871
No, that is exactly the point.
Thank you. You're history, kiddo.

96
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,634
You know very well
that half of police work

97
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,872
are cops following their hunches.
They go with their gut reaction.

98
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,033
l've encouraged this in my men
and l'm standing behind Rosewood.

99
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,156
Good! Tell me something, Andrew,

100
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,550
how do you consider yourself
a commanding officer?

101
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,792
You can't maintain a supervisory
relationship with your own personnel.

102
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,633
And now you superseded
the chain of command.

103
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,871
- As of now, you are suspended.
- What?

104
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,394
- Shut up!
- On what grounds?

105
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,870
You have no control
over your troop's activities.

106
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,871
You can't do this!

107
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,351
l can't do it? l will not have
this investigation pissed away.

108
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,797
This crime, this robbery, could be
a political disaster for the mayor.

109
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,518
What about due process?

110
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,559
Policy requires we give you
a board of review within two days.

111
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,198
You got two days.

112
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,717
- l am fighting you on this, Harold.
- Chief Lutz to you.

113
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,393
Where are you going?
l'm not through with you two guys.

114
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,632
Would you two like to hold onto
your jobs a little while longer?

115
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,076
You report to traffic duty,
effective immediately.

116
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,672
Yes, sir.

117
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,718
- Hi. Trouble?
- Yeah.

118
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,588
- Maybe l can help.
- lt just stopped.

119
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,797
- ls it getting gas?
- l don't know.

120
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,391
- What do you make of this, Andrew?
- Who the hell are you?

121
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,712
Vinnie!

122
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,837
..country club prison
in Allenwood, Pennsylvania,

123
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,480
entered the third day
of a hunger strike

124
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,393
protesting the suspension
of privileges.

125
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,199
The Warden said
the measures were taken

126
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,636
to enforce discipline
and to teach prisoners...

127
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,472
l hate crooks that are late.

128
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,358
Now the top story
from the LA News desk.

129
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,672
Police Captain Andrew Bogomil
was gunned down in broad daylight.

130
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,513
He is alive
but in critical condition.

131
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,593
He was leading the investigation
into the Alphabet crimes.

132
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,671
And now, Jim, back to you...

133
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,109
Beverly Hills Police Department.

134
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,749
This is Detective Axel Foley.
l just heard what happened.

135
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,752
Can somebody patch me
to Bogomil's hospital?

136
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,990
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

137
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,077
- Who's this?
- lt's Jan.

138
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,516
l just found out.
l'm sorry. What happened?

139
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,789
They operated on him, Axel.
He's going to be OK.

140
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,633
l mean...
l think he's going to be OK.

141
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,912
Here's Billy.

142
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,708
This guy really nailed him.
He set him up. Cold blood.

143
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,190
- Who?
- This Alphabet Bandit.

144
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,116
- Who's on the case? You?
- lt's all politics here now, Axel.

145
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,159
l don't think they'll let
me and Taggart on it.

146
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,959
- Hold on a minute.
- Hey, Ace!

147
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,998
Out in a minute!
Take care of Jan, all right?

148
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,559
Ace, l'm sorry l'm late,
but l run into this broad.

149
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,996
You're the fucking guy
with the truckload of cigarettes!

150
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,355
He told the cops he was from Buffalo.

151
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,510
Take off your glasses.

152
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,836
l thought that was you, man.

153
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,832
l did get busted
and l lost my whole investment!

154
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,151
What's wrong with you?
You know l'm a businessman.

155
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,596
You come a half hour late
and you bring a cop!

156
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,830
What cop? He ain't no cop.

157
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,798
lt's Dirty Harry himself.
What's wrong with you?

158
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,713
- You callin' me a cop?
- He's my nephew.

159
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,758
The dude is definitely
bad luck to me!

160
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,039
l'll tell you what's bad luck.
My friend's in a prison body shop.

161
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,069
- He's a fucking clown.
- l'm checking you for a wire.

162
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,675
lf he ain't a cop,
why can't l frisk him?

163
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,639
- Stop this bullshit.
- Why won't he let me frisk him?

164
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,474
Cut the bullshit. l got 2,000
blank American Express cards.

165
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,154
Right now. You wanna do business?

166
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,028
With you, but not in front of him
because this dude's a cop.

167
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,638
l can smell a pig. l used to
be a Muslim. l know pork. Yes, pork!

168
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,951
Definitely pork.
l ain't doing shit around this dude.

169
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,874
- Fuck you, man. Allahu Akhbar.
- You calling me a cop?

170
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,914
Jeff.

171
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,797
Where have you been? Todd's looking
for you. l hope you made the bust.

172
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,314
- Can l count on you, trust you?
- Yes.

173
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,437
We working undercover together?
And you'll be quiet?

174
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,671
- Who are you talking to?
- Listen. Wait.

175
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,432
- Drive the Ferrari for a few days.
- The Ferrari?

176
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,988
l'm leaving town
for a few days and...

177
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,438
- l need you to drive the Ferrari.
- Where?

178
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,272
Around. But you have to be me.

179
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,670
- How do l do that?
- Duck down. Drive like this.

180
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,596
No one can know it's you. Don't have
people hanging around the car.

181
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,310
lt draws attention to yourself.
One person... Drive Marcy in it!

182
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,675
- We're supposed to meet...
- What?

183
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,115
For the car.
She wants to be in the car.

184
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,668
- She likes the car?
- She loves it.

185
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,675
Drive with Marcy, scootch down.
Don't tell anybody about this.

186
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,117
And l know you don't understand,
but this'll make me cop of the month.

187
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,988
We'll be there smiling together.
l can trust you?

188
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,594
You're my friend?
You understand this?

189
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,716
- No.
- Good.

190
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,712
- lnspector T, how you doing?
- Where the fuck you been, Foley?

191
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,632
- And what the fuck is this?
- lt's a blue slip.

192
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,154
Why the hell you need $1 ,000?

193
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,789
- A little flash money...
- Flash money? Let's see...

194
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,235
$2,000 for a suit. $200 for a tie.

195
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,880
A requisition order for a Ferrari.

196
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,669
l've seen enough blue slips.
How about some arrest slips?

197
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,629
l know you're getting upset. You have
reason to be, but l am close.

198
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,793
l am so close now
and it's making me crazy.

199
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,829
l could smell it. lt's in the air.
Do you smell it? l smell it.

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,312
All l smell is bullshit. l'm
pouring money down a bottomless hole.

201
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,755
Where are the bad guys
at the end of this?

202
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,153
- l thought if there was a problem...
- Don't think! lt makes my dick itch.

203
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,630
Truth is, this department's
furnished you a fortune.

204
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,032
My ass is on the line.
l OK'd all this shit.

205
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,912
l must have been
out of my fucking mind.

206
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,390
But l can't pull out
without a bust or l'm finished.

207
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,634
l promise you, l won't go down alone.
l'm gonna give you three days.

208
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,076
lf l don't see some results,
l'll cover my own ass.

209
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,435
How do you like that arrangement?

210
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,479
lf l only have three days,
l have to go deep undercover.

211
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,758
l'm deep now. This is deep.
But l'm going deeper. No more money.

212
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,274
l'm going deep,
deep, deep undercover.

213
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,275
Sign that, and l'm going so deep,
you won't know. People will page me.

214
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,955
Axel? No answer
cos l'll be deep undercover.

215
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,749
l'm tired of your bullshit, Foley.
You got three days.

216
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,992
lf l don't see results,
l'll grind your ass into dog meat.

217
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,915
Deal. l'll have a dog-meat ass.
Now please sign for my flash money.

218
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,549
Flash money! Make sure
nothing happens to that Ferrari.

219
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,551
That's a $50,000 automobile.

220
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,237
No, no. lt's $67,000. And fast.
lt goes from 100 to 150 in...

221
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,272
You better make sure
nothing happens to it.

222
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,072
Don't worry about a thing. lt's safe.
No one else will be driving but me.

223
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,551
l will sleep, eat, drink, shit...
No, l ain't going to shit.

224
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,598
You thought l was going to...
l ain't gonna shit.

225
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,636
Don't worry about it. l'm on the job.

226
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,472
That's what l'm afraid of.

227
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,036
He's OK.

228
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,077
- What are you doing here?
- How's he doing?

229
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,153
lf he's strong enough to live
through that, he's got a chance.

230
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,516
- l got to see those letters.
- They're at the station.

231
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,116
We can't take you there. We're not
supposed to be on that case.

232
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,998
lt's a new ball game
and we're not invited.

233
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,197
Neither am l,
but l got to see those letters.

234
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,593
- lt won't hurt to let him see them.
- But we got to be careful.

235
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,355
Lutz is just looking for a reason
to bust our asses.

236
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,954
Meet me back at the station
in an hour.

237
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,750
l'm going to say hi to Jan
and take a peek. All right?

238
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,835
- How you doing?
- OK, Axel.

239
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,673
Come on, stop that.

240
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,469
l get shot like this all the time
in Detroit. He'll be fine.

241
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,350
He was talking about going fishing
until yesterday.

242
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,069
Then he seemed preoccupied.

243
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,037
l'm gonna come by the house
after l get settled and look around.

244
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,196
Thanks, Axel.

245
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,112
- Where are the owners of this house?
- They haven't taken possession yet.

246
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,876
- They're in Hawaii.
- ls there a foreman? Thank you.

247
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,036
Everybody, stop what
you're doing, please. Stop it!

248
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,955
Stop what you're doing!
Beverly Hills building inspector.

249
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,397
Everybody, stop what you're doing.
l'd like to speak with your foreman.

250
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,519
Put the bucket down!
Somebody get me the foreman.

251
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,195
- l'm the foreman here.
- You? Where are the plans?

252
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,238
You're making
a very big fucking mistake.

253
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,357
- Who are you?
- l'm the building investigator.

254
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,000
- Nobody told you l was coming?
- No.

255
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,709
Get me the goddamn plans.
Can you guys stop working?

256
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,156
Stop it! Stop working!
Get me the plans.

257
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,233
- Wait a second. This is wrong.
- What do you mean?

258
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,199
These are the old plans!
Weren't you at the meeting?

259
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,236
- No.
- Before they went to Hawaii?

260
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,753
- No.
- No meeting?

261
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,833
l was there to change these plans.
The Andersons changed the plans.

262
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,993
There's not supposed
to be any right angles.

263
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,038
- You! You! Stop working!
- Stop working!

264
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,997
You're destroying the house.

265
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,152
Wait! No right angles?
lt's like a doughnut.

266
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,119
What are you, a fucking art critic?
Let them live inside a doughnut.

267
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,318
Some people want to live
in a round house. Fuck it.

268
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,472
Guys, stop it.
l'll have to straighten this out.

269
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,031
l'll talk to my people, they'll talk
to your people and nobody gets fired.

270
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,076
l did what they said.

271
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,232
You were right,
but whoever told you's an asshole.

272
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,949
Everybody come down, go home.
Relax. You got the week off.

273
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,397
We'll straighten this thing out.
Give your boys a round of applause.

274
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,713
You've done a good job. The house
is square, but it's beautiful.

275
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,314
Go home and relax
for the rest of the week.

276
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,473
l'll straighten this out.
lt's Miller time. Right, thank you.

277
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,114
So you'll straighten all this out?

278
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,193
Will you stop worrying
and go home? Trust me.

279
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,596
Could somebody clean this shit up
before you leave?

280
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,634
Lutz's guys are working
on the codes.

281
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,951
Lutz thinks he's a serial robber.
l think he's a nut case.

282
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,352
- Lutz is a nut case.
- Not Lutz. The Alphabet Bandit.

283
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,352
l don't think so.
He's too smart. What else you got?

284
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,797
These shell casings are from
the first robbery at Adriano's.

285
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,112
These are .44 auto mags. They don't
make these any more - too expensive.

286
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,751
This is a casing from a .308 rifle.
They cut it down to fit a .44.

287
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,913
- They knew what they were doing.
- Shit. Put this stuff away.

288
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,956
- Who's this?
- Lutz.

289
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,032
All right. Show time!
What's going on? Who are you?

290
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,953
- This is...
- Shut up, Rosewood.

291
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,953
My name is Johnny... Johnny Wishbone.

292
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,717
l'm a psychic from the island of St
Croix. l read in the St Croix Gazette

293
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,429
that the Beverly Hills Police
had some trouble solving crime.

294
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,436
So l came to Beverly Hills. They say
they don't want my help. l'm psychic!

295
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,796
l'm a psychic phenomenon.
Watch. l don't know you.

296
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,758
Your name is, um...Lutz! Right?

297
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,628
Chief Lutz, that's your name.
The name pop inside my head.

298
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,996
- And your name is...
- Biddle.

299
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,594
Two more seconds
and l'd say it myself.

300
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,719
l don't need no help. l'm Johnny
Wishbone, psychic extraordinaire.

301
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,315
lf you need me, just think
Johnny Wishbone and l come.

302
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,119
Lutz and Biddle,
it's like Kibbles and Bits!

303
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,830
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.
Your name is Johnson, right?

304
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,673
What the hell is going on?
ls this a magic show?

305
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,991
l'll have your badges unless
you go to traffic duty. Get out!

306
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,593
l got angina the minute l saw Foley.
Axel's got nine lives. l don't.

307
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,069
You boys ready?

308
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,516
You both know Lutz
is a shit tinhorn politician.

309
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,957
His boy Biddle couldn't catch the
Alphabet killer if he nuked the city.

310
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,838
We got to do this.
All for one, one for all.

311
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,390
Lutz is about to fire our asses.
l'll lose my pension.

312
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,516
l got a wife and two kids to feed.

313
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,513
- You got two kids, not a wife.
- Shut up. She might come back.

314
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,478
Maureen's divorcing him again.
She's with her mother.

315
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,199
Two years ago, l almost lost my job.

316
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,238
The man put his neck
on the line for me.

317
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,551
l'm not going back to
Detroit without helping him.

318
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,871
And his boys don't even
have any loyalty for him!

319
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,954
Don't give me this loyalty crap.
Andy and l joined the force together.

320
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,513
lf we do this, it's got to be
low-profile. Covert.

321
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,479
Billy and l have traffic duty,
for Christ's sake.

322
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,391
Give me a break.

323
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,311
- Where'd you get that?
- You stole evidence!

324
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,470
- l only took one.
- Why?

325
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,236
This is known as a clue. Few people
know how to do this quality work.

326
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,596
- We'll see who recognises it.
- Who are these guys?

327
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,194
This is your town.
You should know that.

328
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,272
There's a guy
at the Beverly Hills Shooting Club.

329
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,828
Russ Fielding.
Supposed to be the best.

330
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,195
Let's go see Russ Fielding then.

331
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,150
- What's in the bag?
- My vitamins.

332
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,028
- Give them to me.
- You want my vitamins? All of them?

333
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,510
- An hour.
- Enjoy good health.

334
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,078
Excuse me. One second.
What year is this?

335
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,593
'73.

336
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,511
- Yes. lt is '73.
- l know.

337
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,196
May l help you?

338
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,397
l'm from
Medalux Explosive Research Company.

339
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,155
- Does Russell Fielding work here?
- Yes.

340
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,390
He ordered these plutonium-nitrate,

341
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,438
multi-explosive,
sound-seeking projectiles.

342
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,431
Here they go. Have a nice day.

343
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,159
Wait a minute.
What did you say? Medalux?

344
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,549
Medalux Explosive Research Company.

345
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,234
l don't show any record
of that delivery.

346
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,915
l think there must be a mistake.
Your company made a mistake.

347
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,675
- Y'all made a mistake.
- No. You don't understand.

348
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,197
l know about every delivery here.
They put it in this little log.

349
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,953
We'll straighten this out
with research.

350
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,273
This is a sound-seeking projectile.
l suggest no telephones. Don't cough.

351
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,828
lf you break wind,
make it a quiet one.

352
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,549
The slightest peep and your
designer jeans won't fit no more.

353
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,631
Y'all handle this after l go.

354
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,390
Excuse me. l just realised,
you could do me a favour

355
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,233
and drop this off
at Mr Fielding's office.

356
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,757
Let me explain something. My friend
Bootsie got killed doing this.

357
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,992
l ain't carrying this cos you made
a mistake. l carry from A to B.

358
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,119
l have a wife and two kids.
l'd like to see my daughters again.

359
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,953
lt's on your way out.
lt's no problem.

360
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,838
lf you just drop it off
at Mr Fielding's.

361
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,629
What about my daughters?
What's in it for my family?

362
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,439
What do you want?

363
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,876
What's in it for me?
l have beautiful daughters.

364
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,316
You're asking me to risk my life.
What will l get?

365
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,079
$10? l have twin daughters...
with pigtails.

366
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,994
Would you take that off my desk
and drop it off at Mr Fielding's?

367
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,312
That's all l have.
Please take it. l'm sorry, that's it.

368
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,949
- Where's his office?
- Along the corridor, down the steps.

369
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,238
On your way out. The name's
on the office. Just over there.

370
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,472
l'm just doing this for my kids.
This is how Bootsie got killed.

371
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,711
All they found was $20
and a pair of Adidas.

372
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,758
Along the corridor. Down the stairs.

373
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,951
- We almost got fucked up.
- Thank you.

374
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,676
Shoe money for my daughters.
$5 a shoe. That's four shoes.

375
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,069
She knew you were hard to live with
when she married you.

376
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,993
lt's her fault
for thinking you'd change.

377
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,071
Thanks.

378
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,477
l admire her for having courage to
leave you in search of a better life.

379
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,477
l'm sorry. l was trying
to make you feel better.

380
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,028
- Do me a favour?
- Sure.

381
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,156
Take a break from cheering me up.

382
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,269
Keep the grip tight. There you go.

383
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,030
Fire when you're ready.

384
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,833
Grip down here. There you go.
All right.

385
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,438
Keep it up and to the left.
All right?

386
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,632
Excuse me.

387
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,518
- Are you Russ Fielding, gunsmith?
- Yeah.

388
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,909
Have you ever seen this before?

389
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,390
lt's a .308 rifle shell
cut to fit the .44.

390
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,835
- Where'd you get it?
- Christmas gift.

391
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,912
Charles Bronson
is a friend of the family.

392
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,074
- He gave me this for Christmas.
- l'm Karla Fry, assistant manager.

393
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,277
How are you?
Beautiful place you have here.

394
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,352
My name's Richard James.
Very nice to meet you.

395
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,636
Russ, could l see you for a minute?

396
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,678
- Be right back.
- Take your time, Russ.

397
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,550
Goddamn, that's a big bitch.

398
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,956
- Who is that man?
- l don't know.

399
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,793
He's got a .44 auto mag casing
from here.

400
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,791
l saw. You sure it's ours?

401
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,034
- l made a whole bunch for Mr Cain.
- Did you tell him that?

402
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,917
- No.
- Don't.

403
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,594
Keep him there while l check him out.

404
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,479
l think we have a problem.
Fielding made that casing for Cain.

405
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,236
You wanted to see me?

406
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,994
l'd like to go over plan C and D.

407
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,915
We've promised to deliver Thomopolis
$10 million, Friday at 6pm.

408
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,791
lf we fail, l'll be put to some
inconvenience, to say the least.

409
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,477
So l'd like to go over it and avoid
the mistakes made on the Adriano job.

410
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,632
What mistakes? Adriano's was perfect.

411
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,757
Adriano's was not perfect.

412
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,354
lt was perfectly planned, but
it was executed with incompetence.

413
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,756
lt was partly my fault.

414
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,709
l assumed if my instructions were
clear, even you could follow them.

415
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,633
- Obviously, l was wrong.
- l don't understand.

416
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,237
You supplied your thugs
with guns from my club?

417
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,869
Yes. But they were totally clean.
Nobody could trace them.

418
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,317
Nobody knows you planned the jobs.
Nobody knows you wrote the notes,

419
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,358
Karla did the job and left the notes.

420
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,238
Then why is there a man in my club

421
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,233
with shell casings
from one of my guns asking questions?

422
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,276
l don't know.

423
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,238
- Who is he?
- l'd say he's a cop. Wouldn't you?

424
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,436
l don't know. l haven't seen him.

425
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,479
Here he is, on television.

426
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,395
Take a good look at him
cos you're going to kill him.

427
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,678
- What?
- Kill him, burn him, blow him away.

428
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,474
How long would it take
to shave those legs?

429
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,757
l suppose you're trying
to be charming.

430
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,797
- Just offering my grooming services.
- l don't think so.

431
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,670
- Chip, perfect timing for once.
- Chip Cain. l'm the manager here.

432
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,753
How are you, Chip? Beautiful place
here, very comfortable.

433
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,630
We do our best. Maybe you'd like
to have a guest membership.

434
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,110
That'd be nice, kinda like
shooting guns in the house.

435
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,668
Where can l send you an application?

436
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,991
1603 Hillcrest.
A big white house. Beautiful place.

437
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,152
We'll send it along
with the .44 shells.

438
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,837
- l'll be sure to duck.
- Goodbye, Mr James.

439
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,390
l guess that's my cue. Excuse me.

440
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,235
You got a match? Damn.

441
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,512
- Richard James. 1603 Hillcrest Road.
- Right. Hey, Cain...you got a match?

442
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,432
Here you go. Keep it.
And, Jack, don't screw this up.

443
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,679
- What about the cop in hospital?
- He's guarded 24 hours a day.

444
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,598
- Here's the impending Alphabet note.
- Will they break this one?

445
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,750
They'll crack it
when we want them to.

446
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,631
How'd it go?

447
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,753
What would you guys say if l said
a six-foot blonde works here?

448
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,718
Witnesses reported
a six-foot blonde at Adriano's.

449
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,597
This isn't Detroit.

450
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,592
Six-foot blonde women
grow on trees in California.

451
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,750
He's right. They're everywhere.

452
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,152
You really need me! You can't
tell there's something weird here?

453
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,915
Meet me at my house
at 1603 Hillcrest in about an hour.

454
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,358
- Where are my vitamins?
- Here's $20. Get some more.

455
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,989
- My house in an hour.
- What did he do, sell them?

456
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,636
Freeze.

457
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,076
Damn it, Axel.
You scared the hell out of me.

458
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,477
Sorry. l let myself in.
How you doing?

459
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,836
l'm tired.
l had some work to do at the office.

460
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,152
- You still at the insurance company?
- Find anything?

461
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,312
A lot of newspaper cut-outs
about oil prices dropping.

462
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,076
- Did you invest in oil stocks?
- On a cop's pay? No way.

463
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,357
And there's an ad
for a club called 385 North.

464
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,716
ls that one
of your father's hangouts?

465
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,679
Your father got shot
cos he was on to something. But what?

466
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,236
Do me a favour,
use your connections at your company

467
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,118
to find out about
a guy named Maxwell Dent.

468
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,718
l'll try. You can let yourself out.
l'm gonna take a shower.

469
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,835
Don't shoot nobody.

470
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,159
- This has got to be a mistake.
- There's his car.

471
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,679
lf he's here,
he must be robbing the place.

472
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,111
l don't like this, Billy.

473
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,431
What would he be doing here?

474
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,988
Maybe the Pointer Sisters live here.

475
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,153
- What?!
- Out back.

476
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,358
Welcome to Wheel of Fortune.
l thought l just heard Jack say...

477
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,430
Watch out. The deck's very slippery.

478
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,479
There's beer in the refrigerator
or you can make yourself martinis.

479
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,473
Wait. You're on duty. No martinis.
Perrier water is what you want.

480
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,836
Swimming trunks in the bedroom.
Dive in the pool.

481
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,277
- Why are you in a place like this?
- A place like what?

482
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,717
- Like this. Swimming pool, jacuzzi.
- What? l'm spoiling myself rotten.

483
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,758
The construction?
l am embarrassed about that.

484
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,118
l'm just using the other five
bedrooms, compromising my lifestyle.

485
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,918
You've stolen it.

486
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,072
How can you steal a house?
lt's my uncle's house.

487
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,948
- ls he in rock 'n' roll?
- No! Look at the big titties.

488
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,396
Look at this,
titties, orange juice, beer...

489
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,552
Will you put your trunks on
and get in this pool?

490
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,076
l want you out of this pool
and house in seven minutes.

491
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,630
You're still a police officer.
You'll get us all in deep shit.

492
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,917
l love when you talk dirty.
Get in this pool.

493
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,437
- Get out of the goddamn pool!
- l told you the deck was slippery.

494
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,156
Taggart! What's taking you so long?

495
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,831
What do you think? Sharp?

496
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,273
Go right in, Mr President. Have fun.

497
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,069
Excuse me. Who are you?
And who are those people?

498
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,711
l'm his representative. That's former
president Gerald Ford there.

499
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,876
lt doesn't look like Gerald Ford.

500
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,191
Have you seen him without make-up?
Probably not.

501
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,078
This is what he looks like now,
the ex-president.

502
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,118
He couldn't get out
when he was running the country.

503
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,909
Now he's a civilian,
it's his right to shake his ass.

504
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,436
He says, ''l wanna go 385 North,''
and l said, ''Let's go.''

505
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,956
We came to party.
You should be proud to have him here.

506
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,669
- lt's our pleasure.
- Thank you very much. Excuse me.

507
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,353
- Can l have a coke with no ice?
- One coke, no ice, coming up.

508
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,910
- There you go.
- Who's the popular blond?

509
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,078
That's Nik Thomopolis.
He owns this place.

510
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:04,992
- That's seven bucks, buddy.
- For a coke? l can get blown for $7.

511
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,600
- Things are getting pretty crazy.
- We're in deep with Axel again.

512
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,195
We'll be directing traffic
the rest of our lives anyway.

513
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,153
- The hell with it. To Bogomil.
- To Bogomil.

514
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,918
Drinks are on the house,
President Ford.

515
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,833
What? My name's John Taggart.

516
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,549
That's the name he's using now.
His marriage is breaking up.

517
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,031
The judge awarded her the name
for the Betty Ford clinic and stuff.

518
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,793
You're much better looking in person.

519
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,354
Does the name Thomopolis
mean anything to you?

520
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,716
He's the biggest arms dealer
on the West coast.

521
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,475
- Do l look like Gerald Ford?
- Y'all both look like Gerald Ford.

522
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,551
Come on. Let's go.

523
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,596
Gun!

524
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,957
Go!

525
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,030
Move it. Get out of here!

526
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,711
Jesus, Billy! Come on, Axel.

527
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,152
Watch yourself.
Anybody in there?

528
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,990
What the fuck is going on here?

529
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,548
- Everybody back.
- Whoever it was got away clean.

530
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,952
What are you doing here?

531
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,918
l ran a check.
There is no Johnny Wishbone.

532
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,152
You're illegal. Who the hell
are you and why are you here? Now!

533
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,710
l'm a cop. l didn't say before
cos l knew you'd be upset.

534
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,872
lt's a Detroit badge.
Why are you in Beverly Hills?

535
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,794
l'm attached
to a multi-jurisdictional,

536
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,319
Federal task force on organised
crime, and my code name is Wishbone.

537
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,356
l'm the Chief of Police here,

538
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,512
if there's a Federal task force,
l want to know!

539
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,037
You can call back to Detroit tomorrow
and ask for an lnspector Todd.

540
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,113
He'll tell you all about it.
My real name is Axel Foley.

541
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,433
Call there between nine and ten,
Detroit time, he'll tell you.

542
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,479
Right now, l have the rest of my case
to finish, so excuse me.

543
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,117
And you two,
what the hell were you doing here?

544
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,395
Checking parking meters in the area?

545
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,950
- Well, sir...
- We're off duty, sir. l live nearby.

546
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,113
Listen, if you do
anything except traffic duty,

547
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,272
l'll have you both
investigated and suspended!

548
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,148
Technically, this is traffic duty.

549
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,199
Technically, you're a goddamn idiot.
Get out of here, Taggart!

550
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,516
- Yes, sir.
- Jesus Christ...

551
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,874
- Are you sure you got super glue?
- Yeah.

552
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,754
This is Wild Kingdom.

553
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,513
l tried to create
a stress-free environment.

554
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,079
You have.

555
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,995
These are my friends. That's Sidney.
He's a wandering jew.

556
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,518
This is Mona. Hi, baby. They actually
like different kinds of music.

557
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,239
lf l play the Beatles,
the begonias perk up.

558
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,440
lf l play Beethoven, they wither.
The ferns like the Boston Pops.

559
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,116
- But everybody loves Mozart.
- Who's this?

560
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,914
Big Al. Had him about six years.
lsn't he great?

561
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,877
What music does he like?

562
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,875
- James Brown. Drives him nuts.
- ls that turtle shit in there?

563
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,679
- Turtles are amazing to me.
- What are you doing?

564
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,469
l'm curious to know
where his dick is at.

565
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,155
Give me him. You know where it is,
don't you, Big Al?

566
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,437
- Do turtles have dicks?
- How's it hanging, Big Al?

567
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,670
Give me that super glue.

568
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:32,117
- Billy's really out there, isn't he?
- Billy's pretty fucked up.

569
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,076
- l heard that.
- l know. l was joking!

570
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,355
Give me the super glue.

571
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,309
- What's that music from?
- The Dating Game.

572
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,358
Let's give Billy a big Dating
Game kiss. Where's your phone?

573
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,557
- ln the bedroom.
- Where, in the alligator pit?

574
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,276
Jesus, Billy.

575
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,829
- Jeff? Axel.
- Axel, it's one in the morning.

576
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,718
Jeffrey, stop talking.
How's the Ferrari?

577
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,997
Great. What a great car!
Do those seats go back?

578
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,913
l was with Marcy trying
to get the seats back...

579
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,515
You can't do freaky shit in that car.
You have to do something for me.

580
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,990
- Something you don't want to do.
- Am l going to get in trouble?

581
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,152
- You see that?
- Weird.

582
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,992
lt's not weird. lt's simple.

583
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,358
The fumes from the super glue attach
to the acid from the fingerprints.

584
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,910
lt's a street cop trick.
Hasn't filtered down to you boys yet.

585
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,551
- Now we have to match it.
- We could use the computer downtown.

586
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,996
There won't be anybody
there this time of night, Sarge.

587
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,913
Shit.
There goes my medical insurance.

588
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,709
- You can be such a pussy sometimes.
- Really.

589
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,552
Let's go. Come on.

590
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,592
You boys definitely
get an A in High-tech.

591
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,831
lt takes 60 cops
to do this shit in Detroit.

592
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,556
Charles Cain.
Used to be Charles Campos.

593
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,475
l just met this guy. He works
in the Beverly Hills Gun Club.

594
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,792
- He does?
- This ain't the guy, he's a weasel.

595
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,429
- This isn't a master criminal.
- That's his print.

596
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,876
This guy had nothing to do
with Bogomil getting shot.

597
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,758
lf he suspected him,
he would've picked him up.

598
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,035
Let's put an APB out on Cain.

599
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,318
We can't. All we got is fingerprints.
We need something else.

600
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,279
- What do we do now?
- Let's go to the Gun Club.

601
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,670
Wait. lt's 1 1 :00.
The Gun Club's closed.

602
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,796
- So?
- So?

603
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,198
This is a big mistake. A big mistake.

604
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,116
lt's against the law. Once we cross
the line, there's no way back.

605
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,159
l'll go. l'll go.

606
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,710
See? Would you lighten up
and take some risks?

607
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,552
Fuck it. Let's go.

608
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,513
- Shit. Alarm tape.
- There are ways around alarm tape.

609
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,156
lf we open this door, the connection
will break between the magnets.

610
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,951
lf we use this foil, and you squeeze
it between the two magnets,

611
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,679
then take your gum
to hold it in place...

612
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,231
Now the magnets have the illusion
that the connection's not broken.

613
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,276
Then we take our knife...

614
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,919
Open the door without...

615
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,674
We walk in
without the alarm going off.

616
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,113
You've done that before.

617
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,716
l wasn't always a police officer,
l fractured a law or two as a kid.

618
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,634
- Can l have a piece?
- lt's my last one.

619
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,756
Split it.

620
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,276
None for you.

621
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,636
- What are we looking for?
- A needle in a haystack.

622
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,471
Give me some light over here.

623
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,670
Shit.

624
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,636
Here you go.

625
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,433
What the hell is that? That knife.

626
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,638
- lt's mine. Home protection.
- Billy, we got to talk.

627
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,071
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

628
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,912
- What is that?
- A needle in a haystack.

629
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,752
Map coordinates?

630
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,153
ls this lnspector Todd
of the Detroit Police?

631
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,958
lt is.

632
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,715
l'm sorry to be bothering you,
my name is Lionel Hand,

633
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,439
l'm with
the FBl Enforcement Bulletin.

634
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,830
- l read it all the time.
- Thanks. We're proud of it.

635
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,833
Don't touch the leather.
My director has asked me to interview

636
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,040
an exceptional police officer,
and your name was on our computer.

637
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,714
- ls that right?
- This is short notice,

638
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,759
but could you meet me this morning
for breakfast at my office?

639
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,753
- How's nine o'clock?
- Yeah. l'll be there.

640
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,796
Thank you. My pleasure.

641
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,312
Ring.

642
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,116
Here's your coffee, sir.

643
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,556
Just once a week, l'd like tea.
Do you know what l mean?

644
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,756
- Yes, sir.
- That too much to ask?

645
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,430
Come on, come on...

646
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,756
Damn it, who tricked my ass?

647
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,193
- 440...
- Don't confuse me when l'm dialling.

648
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,389
This is Todd.

649
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,948
- lnspector Todd?
- That's what l said.

650
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,431
This is Harold Lutz. l'm chief of
the Beverly Hills Police Department.

651
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,829
Do you have an officer
Axel Foley...

652
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,356
Yes, he's under my command,
but he's assigned to some

653
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,716
multi-jurisdictional,
Federal task force.

654
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,190
l never know where the hell he is.
lt's a real pain.

655
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,479
l can't control him. He reports
directly to the Feds. l have to go.

656
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,279
What the hell are you doing in here?

657
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,430
- This is not my office.
- You damn right it isn't.

658
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,358
l want to see if these
coordinates intercept.

659
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,113
What makes you think
they mean anything?

660
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,394
9752 Gregory Way.

661
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,552
- City Deposit.
- What's City Deposit?

662
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,438
lt's where banks take their money.

663
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,114
l bet that's the next place
that gets hit.

664
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,630
Unit 21 , handle. Unit 22, assist.
City Deposit, 341 Gregory.

665
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,154
Lines are down. Unable to verify.

666
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,117
Can't this car go any faster?

667
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,355
Come on, guys. Come on.

668
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,671
Looks good. l got it.

669
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,270
Out of the hole. Move it.
Come on. Let's do it.

670
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,351
Here we go.

671
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,998
Two, one...

672
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,992
Three minutes!

673
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,911
Sarge, relax and trust me.

674
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,675
- You drive worse than Maureen.
- No way!

675
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,033
Where's the seat belt?

676
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,795
- lt's a red light!
- lt's green!

677
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,355
- lt was red!
- lt was yellow!

678
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,752
2:30.

679
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,469
Some kind of construction.

680
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,231
Shit!

681
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,359
- Taggart, you coming?
- l'm coming! Don't wait for me.

682
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,912
Two minutes.

683
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,676
What's that for?

684
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,594
After the club shootout,
l figured l needed more firepower.

685
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,549
We got to talk. Who do you think you
are? Clint Eastwood? Dirty Rosewood?

686
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,432
1 :30.

687
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,759
Sound the alarm.
You got a break-in.

688
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,478
l need authorisation.

689
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,559
- Authorised!
- Fuck! Get out of here!

690
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,751
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

691
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,996
Get out! Get out! Go!

692
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,511
Rosewood, get some wheels.

693
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,439
- This is pretty sporty!
- lt's all l could find.

694
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,273
Police business! l need your car!
l'm a police officer!

695
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,677
God. Here l go again.

696
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,716
Come on, let's go!

697
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,715
- You hit a squad car!
- l know the guy. He's a jerk!

698
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,758
- Does the steering wheel work?
- l'm steering!

699
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,830
- Do the brakes work?
- l haven't tried them.

700
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,239
l'm sure we should have went left.

701
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,349
Fuck!

702
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,677
Are you driving with your eyes open,
or are you using the Force?

703
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,115
Stop! There's the truck.

704
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,158
Now what?

705
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:29,828
- This was the pick-up vehicle.
- Let's follow it.

706
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,400
Sarge? You old bloodhound!

707
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,755
- Billy, isn't this...
- Yeah.

708
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,474
What the fuck is up? Check this out.

709
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:10,793
l get $10 for cars, l get $20
for limos. What the hell is this?

710
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,313
My truck.
Here's $50. Put it next to a limo.

711
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,355
Let me call you back.

712
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,754
- l'm here to clean the pool.
- Your name?

713
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,435
- l'm the pool cleaner.
- The pool was cleaned yesterday.

714
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,991
lt was clean. Today it's dirty.
Somebody made a mistake in the pool.

715
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,752
What do you mean by ''mistake''?

716
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:39,674
Someone had a little accident
in the pool.

717
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,036
- Accident?
- There's something floating in it.

718
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,350
- What?
- During some wild party,

719
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,557
somebody shit in the pool.
l'm here to clean it up.

720
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,315
- l see...
- l ain't happy, but it's my job.

721
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,790
You write names down, l clean pools.
Where's the pool at?

722
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,757
Who are these gentlemen with you?

723
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,595
The Board of Health. They're making
sure l do the job thoroughly.

724
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,832
lf you like, l can bring it by
and you can verify it afterwards.

725
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,388
- No, that's fine.
- Excuse me.

726
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,311
Jesus Christ!

727
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:29,589
Wake up! This is what
we always talked about. Look alive.

728
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,797
You may never see it again. l don't
want to step on your tongues.

729
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,871
Why aren't my parties like this?

730
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,599
You got to die sometime.
Might as well be here.

731
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,630
- What are we doing?
- Whoever took that truck is here.

732
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,475
- How are we supposed to find them?
- Follow your dick.

733
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,230
That's the girl from the Gun Club.

734
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,517
- With Dent and Thomopolis?
- The big bitch.

735
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,789
Max! How'd you get in here?

736
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,431
Forget l asked. l see how,
it's the suit. Nice suit, Max.

737
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,718
- This person is annoying us.
- May l see your invitation?

738
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,758
- l haven't begun to annoy you.
- What's going on?

739
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,799
lt's Max. Check your guest list
cos Max ain't supposed to be here.

740
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,635
- Are we having a problem?
- Hef! Hugh Hefner! Axel Foley!

741
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:38,589
l feel like l know you already cos
l put your magazine up... Forget it.

742
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,194
Here's some background
on your guests.

743
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,953
This is Thomopolis,
he's into guns and drugs.

744
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:49,068
And this is Max,
and Max kills cops for a living.

745
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,720
l don't know him or you.

746
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,510
- l think it's time all of you left.
- l happen to be a major contributor.

747
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,318
We appreciate it. Goodbye.

748
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,437
He appreciates it, Max,
but take your ass home.

749
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,636
You outdone your welcome.

750
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,918
But it's been real, it's been nice.
Everybody, party's over!

751
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,709
Max fucked it up for everybody,
so let's just go home.

752
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,231
We'll go ahead as planned.
Get Cain to prepare E.

753
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:31,276
- You picked Dent's pocket?
- l told y'all l wasn't always a cop.

754
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,517
Yeah, you fractured
an occasional law as a kid.

755
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,558
This is not good. This is not good.

756
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,755
See? Every now and then,
an occasional long shot pays off.

757
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,149
Dent's accountant, Sidney Bernstein.

758
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,199
Anything Dent's into, he'll have
a record. We'll visit him tomorrow.

759
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,111
lt's all we got to go on.

760
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,759
There's no B and D,
l'm looking for something.

761
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,956
And what about that cement truck?

762
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,508
What about that, Rosewood?
Talk to me!

763
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,957
l have a theory on that. The cement
truck was a tactical decoy.

764
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,357
A decoy?

765
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,671
A diversion to protect
the criminals' getaway.

766
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,751
That's why it rammed the police car.

767
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,434
Have you submitted yourself
for drug testing yet?

768
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,114
l want you in by Thursday.
Understand?

769
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,998
Are you aware that
whoever was in that truck

770
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,116
foiled the goddamn crime?

771
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,270
- Do you?
- Putz.

772
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,598
- Did you say something?
- He called you Putz.

773
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,671
No, l called you a putz.

774
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,875
He's right. Putz.

775
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,791
And you. You, Mr Scribbler... What
the hell were you doing there, Foley?

776
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,714
- Aren't l a police officer, too?
- Remains to be seen.

777
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,510
- Did you call lnspector Todd for me?
- Yes. He doesn't like you very much.

778
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,955
Do you hear this insubordination?

779
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:58,033
Yes, and l've never heard such abuse.
Whatever's happened, the fact remains

780
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,829
that the robbery was foiled
and the money was saved.

781
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,356
lf l were you, l'd concentrate
on cracking this code

782
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,908
and determining where
the E crime will be.

783
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,629
There's not many targets
beginning with E, so find them.

784
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,631
- l will, Ted.
- Mayor!

785
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,472
Yes, Mayor.

786
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,396
And you! l want you out of here!
Get out of here, you degenerate!

787
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,479
You're not even
part of this department!

788
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,956
- ls this a black thing?
- Out.

789
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:40,798
- Aren't you leaving for Detroit?
- Today at noon.

790
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,032
You're not going to make it.
You're going to get fired.

791
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,157
We started this together,
we'll finish together.

792
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,276
Check if Bernstein owns a car.

793
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,917
Give me a pen. Give me a pen!

794
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,232
'86 Mercedes. License number CRL 507.

795
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,636
Naturally, l can see... l mean,
l understand. Somebody... Wait...

796
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,156
Come right in! Don't let the fact
that my door's closed

797
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,629
dissuade you from entering my office.

798
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,792
Beverly Hills Police.
Are you Mr Sidney Bernstein?

799
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,270
- Lucky guess.
- You have 25 unpaid tickets.

800
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,989
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- 25? What 25?

801
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:32,232
- You have 25 unpaid parking tickets.
- l pay all my tickets.

802
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,518
Do you own a black Mercedes-Benz,
license plate number CRL 507?

803
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,991
- 507? That's my wife's car.
- You have 25 tickets.

804
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,959
lt's under my name, but it's
my wife's car! No, no, no! Bitch!

805
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,272
These tickets haven't been paid.
Can you cuff Mr Bernstein?

806
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,749
There are people out
there with chainsaws!

807
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,515
You have unpaid tickets and
it's your car. We're taking you in.

808
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,232
Wait. l've got an idea. ls there
something that l have in this office

809
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,677
that l could hand to you and
that would make you kind of forget

810
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,355
that you're holding those
little pink tickets there?

811
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,873
What are you saying?

812
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,112
You'd have something in that hand
and this hand you'd forget about.

813
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,159
That hand you'd go, ''What did
l have there? l don't remember.''

814
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,117
You mean if l had...

815
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,632
- ..$200 in this hand?
- Ouch! Let go of my arm.

816
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,589
$200? Ouch! Please, l'm robbing you.
That's what l'm doing.

817
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,592
Here's one, here's two.
They're real crisp.

818
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:41,312
l have to use your computer to wipe
all evidence of this transaction out.

819
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,315
- No problem. No problem at all.
- Thank you, Sidney, so much.

820
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,197
Certainly. Certainly.

821
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,239
Also, one other thing.
l'm sure you understand

822
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,949
my contact at headquarters
wouldn't want his name to be known.

823
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,669
- Don't l know it.
- Could you excuse me while l...

824
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,231
Yeah, it's secretive. lt's like
a James Bond thing! Yes, yes.

825
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,197
- Thank you.
- No problem!

826
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,113
No problem at all.
Anything you want to use.

827
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,749
- l can't believe...
- l don't want to hear it, Billy.

828
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,353
Jan, Axel. How you doing?
What do you got?

829
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,796
Strange. Before 1978,
everything's blank.

830
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,919
lt's classified,
but its policy date is 1974.

831
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,516
l found something interesting
in our foreign office in London.

832
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:44,957
Dent was the cultural attach to
the East German embassy in Honduras.

833
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,589
He's got a racetrack, shooting club,

834
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,592
drilling rig companies,
an oil company.

835
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,797
- Oil company?
- That's his biggest business.

836
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,350
But from these records,
seems like Dent's in trouble.

837
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:02,718
He's let his insurance lapse on
everything in the last six months.

838
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:08,079
Dent Petroleum, even the shooting
club. All his businesses except one.

839
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,948
- Which one is that?
- The racetrack. Empyrean Fields.

840
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,149
He's got a huge policy on that one.

841
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,630
Good, good, good, good, good.
OK. Great.

842
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,350
- When your father wakes up...
- He's better. He's up and around.

843
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,749
Tell him you found his man.

844
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,628
Bye-bye. Empyrean Fields.

845
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,996
- Rip off his own racetrack?
- Yes, if it's insured.

846
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,390
- What was in the files?
- We won't find oil field equipment

847
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,436
- if we find Dent.
- lf we find him?

848
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,557
Dent's visa application
had today's date on it.

849
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,915
lf we don't step on it, he's gone.

850
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,557
l don't know what happened
on the City Deposit, Max.

851
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,519
- And the Foley hit?
- l don't know.

852
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,356
That's why l need you
to go along personally

853
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,715
to make certain nothing goes wrong.

854
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,189
l'm on the team, of course.

855
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,832
l broke it.

856
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,798
You son of a bitch.
You beat the computer?

857
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:38,237
- What's it say?
- ''Chinguen sus puercos, Carlos.''

858
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,629
Screw you cops. Signed, Carlos.

859
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,871
- ''Puercos'' ain't cops.
- Pigs. Another word for cops.

860
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,157
Wait a minute, Carlos?
lt is Cain. Charles Cain.

861
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,196
Carlos is Spanish for Charles.

862
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,955
Cain changed his name.
He didn't want to grow up to be poor.

863
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,589
- Cain is the Alphabet robber?
- l ain't said that.

864
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,433
The first code was very hard.
This is easy.

865
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,988
Whoever did this
wanted the cops to get it.

866
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,798
You ran numbers?

867
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,714
- l wasn't always a cop.
- He fractured an occasional law.

868
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:58,079
The horses have now
reached the starting gate.

869
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:07,472
Freeze! Hit the floor!
Freeze, goddamn it!

870
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,994
1 :30.

871
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,079
1 :15.

872
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,588
30 seconds.

873
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,355
Time!

874
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,470
Goodbye, Mr Cain.

875
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,757
..winning it by a nose.

876
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,594
General was second
and Marshall's Madness came third.

877
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:09,151
- Our horse didn't come in.
- Cain's did.

878
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:19,350
The result is now official.
The winner, Johnny's Dilemma...

879
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,593
- Police officers!
- Police!

880
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,356
We're a little late.

881
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,192
All l can tell you now
is that we are confident

882
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,431
that we have identified
the Alphabet Bandit.

883
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,637
The man was shot dead
at the scene this morning

884
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,790
by security guard Jack Stiles.

885
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,759
ln his latest robbery attempt,
the man was fatally wounded.

886
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,231
So l give you my oath right here
there will be no F crime.

887
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:13,111
My computer team cracked the Alphabet
Bandit's code this afternoon.

888
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,552
All of the notes, mind you,
were signed ''Carlos'', right?

889
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:22,350
Carlos, which, as you all know,
is Spanish for Charles.

890
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,510
Do you hear what l'm saying?

891
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,513
- lf it's Cain, where's the money?
- Where's Dent?

892
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,910
- You said shipping oil equipment.
- But how? Where?

893
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,231
- Let's put an APB out on Dent.
- For what reason?

894
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,515
- Where'd you get that?
- What?

895
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,070
lt's coming from there.

896
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,672
Excuse me.
How did the mud get on the horse?

897
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,876
He was grazing in the pasture.

898
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,556
- Where's the pasture at?
- There. Dent's oil field.

899
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,031
Bogomil had that red mud
on his sneakers.

900
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,715
Maybe he got a tip, he came here
and they tried to waste him.

901
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,793
- Who pulled the Alphabet jobs?
- Dent's going broke, OK?

902
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,872
So he heists some bank,
heists some jewellery,

903
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,872
then throws this easy code
with Cain's name on it.

904
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,633
Simple. You frame Cain, kill Cain,

905
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,030
Cain's the Alphabet killer,
Dent gets away scot-free.

906
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,908
Why would an oil man risk this,
even if he was broke?

907
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,913
Dent's not buying oil equipment,
he's buying guns from Thomopolis.

908
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,551
- Selling them in Central America.
- Why not split with the cash?

909
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:46,189
Dent buys guns here for a million
and sells them there for 10 million.

910
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,353
- Look at all that oil.
- l don't see oil.

911
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,912
l see trucks.

912
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,034
Come on, Billy.
Billy, what are you doing?

913
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,955
l've been wanting to wear this
for a while.

914
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,271
Are you nuts?
Billy, we have got to talk.

915
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,157
What the hell is this?

916
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,390
You can never have
too much firepower.

917
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,313
- Come on!
- Shit.

918
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,316
Bogomil was here.

919
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,353
- You like rap music?
- Yeah.

920
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,718
l'm from the Rap Coalition of
America. Throw that gun over there.

921
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,633
lf you like rap music,
why ain't you smiling?

922
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,598
- l'm smiling.
- Smile. Let's rap together.

923
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,556
- Those look like oil pumps to you?
- lt looks like World War lll.

924
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,956
Here, Billy.
You don't have one of these, do you?

925
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,115
You guys hang around the back,
l'll check out the front.

926
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,273
- What are you doing?
- Element of surprise.

927
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,397
What? Are you nuts?

928
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,593
Fool the connecting wire
into thinking it's still intact.

929
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,269
These documents will make your life
much easier. You need to sign them.

930
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,390
You still got that thing?

931
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,270
lt's a bad idea. Of all the ideas
you had, this is the worst.

932
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,637
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- Trust me.

933
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,997
Come on, Axel!

934
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,077
Get him!

935
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,555
Get your head down!

936
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,116
''Pull pin.''

937
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,230
- What are you doing?
- ''Extend.''

938
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,994
''Pull open and...'' Wow!
''Release safety.''

939
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,231
Aim through there, push this.

940
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,190
Fuck Rambo.

941
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,195
Get me the fuck out of here.

942
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,273
- Cover me.
- Go, Axel!

943
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,949
- Let's get the hell out of here!
- Hold it!

944
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,589
- Stay right there!
- Freeze!

945
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,755
All right! Lay your weapons down!

946
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,517
Mr Foley.

947
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,479
You involved yourself in business
that doesn't concern you.

948
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,670
That was a mistake.

949
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,235
Goodbye, Mr Foley.

950
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,152
Women.

951
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:05,075
Come on, let's go.

952
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,796
- Police! You're under arrest!
- l think they know that, Billy.

953
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,917
Drop your weapons!
Put your hands on your heads!

954
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,152
- They got their hands up.
- What took you guys so long?

955
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,032
Shit. We're in trouble now.
God damn it! Axel's AWOL.

956
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:36,511
We can get out of this if
we keep quiet. Don't say anything.

957
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,750
What the hell have you done here?

958
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:42,276
Looks like a goddamn war zone.
What have you done, Taggart?

959
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,237
We solved the Alphabet crimes.

960
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,754
Shut up.
Who the hell is talking to you?

961
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,276
l solved the Alphabet
case over an hour ago.

962
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:56,037
And you! l don't give a damn who
you're working for. You're in jail.

963
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,712
- Chief...
- Shut up.

964
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,837
What are you doing,
bringing a fire fight to my city?

965
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:04,913
- You're out of the cop business!
- Will you just listen a minute?

966
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,231
- You shut your mouth!
- No goddamn! You shut up!

967
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:12,711
This is what the Alphabet crimes
are about...guns! That guy sold them,

968
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,271
then bought them with stolen money
from Adriano's at his own racetrack.

969
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,316
He was going to Central America.

970
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,914
lf you'd take your head
out of your ass,

971
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,309
you'd see we solved the whole thing!

972
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,039
Lutz, why didn't l know about this?

973
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,192
Chief Lutz doesn't have
the guts to hear the truth.

974
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,636
We had to go undercover
with Foley to solve this case.

975
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,233
You're fired, Taggart!

976
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:39,359
- Yeah? Kiss my ass!
- Kiss mine! You're fired, too!

977
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,115
Lutz, l've had it
with your abusive attitude.

978
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,111
l'm sorry. l get carried away.

979
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,988
- You're fired. Do you understand?
- Don't overreact, Ted.

980
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:53,710
l want you out of here now.
Get out of here! Fired!

981
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,509
- You'll regret this, Ted.
- l've regretted it for two months.

982
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,478
You too. You're out of here.
Will you get out?

983
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,357
- Are they civilians?
- You bet.

984
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:07,070
- l'll kick your ass later!
- Axel, thank you so much, really.

985
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:10,436
l've got a charity meeting
for the homeless for Beverly Hills.

986
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:14,638
l'd like to make a donation.
Here's $200 from Sidney Bernstein.

987
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,280
That's my alias.
l don't like publicity.

988
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,352
Thank you, Axel...
l mean, Sidney Bernstein.

989
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,716
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

990
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,437
''lf you get your head
out of your ass''? ''Kiss my ass''?

991
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,954
You're getting more
like me every day.

992
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:36,033
Next thing you know, you'll have
afros... Big dicks and all.

993
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,308
- You make police chief yet?
- Right.

994
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,958
You are the new chief?

995
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,838
lnspector Todd?
Ted Egan, mayor of Beverly Hills.

996
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:55,756
l told your mayor we're very thankful
you allowed Foley to help us.

997
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,391
He says he's acquired all his skills
under your expert tutelage.

998
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,436
Certainly. He's just arrived.

999
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,358
Expert tutelage?
What the fuck have you been saying?

1000
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,998
Let me talk to him.

1001
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,389
Now that you're done
being a California hero,

1002
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,755
get your ass home to your real job.

1003
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,470
l'm leaving now. My ass left already.
l got to catch up with it.

1004
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,509
One other thing, your secret partner
Mario Andretti Friedman

1005
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,513
wrecked the goddamn Ferrari.
Here, you talk to Jeffrey.

1006
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,752
Axel, it wasn't my fault.
There was a bus coming...

1007
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,832
Hello? He hung up. Hello?

1008
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,595
You don't have to go home now.

1009
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:46,834
- Let's catch a marlin in Mexico.
- Fishing's too tiring.

1010
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,832
lt's back to Detroit for some
old-fashioned street violence.

1011
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:55,199
Come with me. Your wife left you.
Come hang out. l know a lot of girls.

1012
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,556
- Maureen came back.
- Did she? Congratulations.

1013
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,473
The people you least expected,
they're studs.

1014
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,154
The man's a stud
and we ain't even know it.

1015
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,438
- Couldn't live without you?
- Her mother didn't have cable TV.

1016
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:12,035
lt wasn't no mother's cable TV.
Your cable brought her back.

1017
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,956
- l'm off.
- Thanks a lot, Axel.

1018
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,996
Don't thank me. l love you guys.

1019
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,437
- See you around.
- Be cool, man.

1020
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,875
Anything we can do for you?

1021
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,396
Yeah. Take care of my uncle's house
till he gets back.

1022
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,950
Axel, that's not really
your uncle's house, is it?

1023
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,156
Yeah. Trust me.

1024
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,634
What the hell's going on?
Who are you? Who's that black guy?
