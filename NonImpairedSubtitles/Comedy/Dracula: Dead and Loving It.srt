1
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:45,344
In such close quarters,
I feel compelled to introduce myself.

2
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:49,009
I'm Thomas Renfield, Esquire.
Solicitor from London.

3
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,484
English.

4
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:54,011
My wife and I, we love the English.
Don't we, dear?

5
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,421
I confess I'm not accustomed
to these Transylvanian roads.

6
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,097
Feeling a bit queasy.

7
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:05,362
Queasy? I tell driver to go slow.

8
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,268
Driver...

9
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,998
The sun is setting.

10
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:16,568
We must make the village
before dark. Quick!

11
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,407
Faster! Faster!

12
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,985
Hold on, English!

13
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,106
Yes, I quite understand.

14
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,748
I say, driver, can you slow up a bit?

15
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,410
Yes!

16
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,487
Thank you.

17
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,041
Thank you.

18
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,039
Driver, don't take my luggage down.

19
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:27,912
- I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
- Yes.

20
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,684
- What are you doing?
- Too dark.

21
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,682
I go no further.

22
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,151
From here on, you walk.

23
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,263
You are going on tonight?

24
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,927
- Yes, I'm going to the castle.
- Castle?

25
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:50,301
Yes, I'm scheduled to meet Count Dracula.

26
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:51,834
Dracula?

27
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,042
Scheduled?

28
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,206
Yes, I have business with the Count.

29
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,942
No.

30
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:05,777
- You must not go.
- Why not?

31
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:08,923
Because we people
of the mountains believe...

32
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,823
vampires live at the castle.

33
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:14,892
- Vampires?
- Yes.

34
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,932
They are the undead.

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,128
They rise from the coffins...

36
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,060
at night.

37
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,430
Yes.

38
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,372
They take the form of wolves or bats...

39
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:33,209
and puncture the throats of their victims
with their teeth...

40
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:38,252
and drink their blood.

41
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,255
Surely that's just superstition.

42
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:47,423
No. Madame Ouspenskaya is right.

43
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,391
Please, my son...

44
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,397
take this cross.

45
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,128
No, thank you.

46
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,965
Take the cross.

47
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,270
Its holy love and spirit of goodness...

48
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:03,938
will shield you from the lurking danger.

49
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,809
No, really. No, thank you.

50
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,585
- Damn it, take the cross.
- Of course.

51
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:19,027
- That'll be 15 kopeks.
- Okay.

52
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,255
Thank you.

53
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:44,285
If I have to walk, I have to walk.

54
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:51,620
No. Don't go. Please. I beg of you.

55
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:56,159
But you don't understand. I'm expected.

56
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,358
Well, ta.

57
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:12,866
What?

58
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,509
How do you do?

59
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:29,057
I'm Thomas Renfield,
solicitor from London...

60
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,093
to see Count Dracula.

61
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,760
Oh, my. Oh, dear. Oh, no.

62
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,611
Children of the night.

63
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,347
What a mess they make.

64
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,917
I am Count...

65
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:02,688
Dracula.

66
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,688
- Are you hurt?
- I am perfectly fine.

67
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,663
It would take much more than that
to hurt me.

68
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,525
Come.

69
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,545
Come, Renfield.

70
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,391
- Oh, dear.
- Renfield...

71
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,293
don't dawdle.

72
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,537
Be there in half a tick.

73
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,199
Yes.

74
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,568
Sorry, I was detained.

75
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:59,604
Embarrassing, really. I thought
I saw you walk through the web...

76
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:00,943
so I assumed I could.

77
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,145
Then I thought to myself,
"Perhaps I can go around the other way."

78
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,414
But, no.

79
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,854
It was attached on all sides.

80
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:12,621
- So I thought to myself...
- Renfield, I don't care.

81
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,969
And now, if you are not too fatigued
from your journey...

82
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,769
I'd like to discuss the purchase
of Carfax Abbey.

83
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:29,106
Yes, of course.
I have the papers right here.

84
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,777
Very good.

85
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,449
There we are.

86
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:43,720
- A bit dusty, isn't it?
- Yes, I like it.

87
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,793
Sign here.

88
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,061
And here.

89
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,635
There we are.

90
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,138
Yes, congratulations.
You're now the owner of Carfax Abbey.

91
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,936
One copy for you...

92
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,471
and one copy for me.

93
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:07,180
- Are you all right?
- Yes, just a paper cut.

94
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,347
Oh, dear.

95
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:17,185
Don't worry,
I have hanky here somewhere.

96
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,193
Let's see, where are we?

97
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,922
How stupid of me.

98
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:25,959
It's worse than I thought.
I must have nipped the vessel.

99
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,087
My God.

100
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,890
What are you doing to the furniture?

101
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,571
What are you on about?

102
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,507
What's all this, then?

103
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,706
Who are you people?

104
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:47,576
I'll have you know
that's my knee you're straddling.

105
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,481
No, stop it at once.

106
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,380
No, this is wrong.

107
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,518
This is wrong, do you hear me? Wrong.

108
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:04,899
Wrong me. Wrong me.
Wrong my brains out.

109
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,068
Oh, yes!

110
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,943
What is going on here?

111
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,614
You think this makes me proud of you?

112
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,688
Now go, whilst I make him my slave.

113
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,502
And stop that.

114
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:50,040
So, Renfield...

115
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,648
do you feel better now?
You were having a nightmare.

116
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,013
A nightmare?

117
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,109
But it was so real, so vivid.

118
00:13:57,186 --> 00:14:00,121
Two voluptuous women grinding, heaving.

119
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,285
How to describe it?

120
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,327
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- Yes.

121
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:12,223
Let me show you an old Transylvanian
method for relaxation.

122
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,669
Look into my eyes.

123
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,075
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

124
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,103
You feel that...

125
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:26,008
Renfield, you fell asleep too soon.

126
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,984
I have more to tell you.

127
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,280
Wake up.

128
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:37,957
Now, you are feeling drowsy.

129
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,560
What a simpleton.

130
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,926
Renfield, forget about sleeping.

131
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,470
Listen to me.

132
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:55,032
You hear only my voice.
From this moment on, you are my slave.

133
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:59,041
You will sacrifice everything for my safety.

134
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,782
In return...

135
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,177
I will give you lives.

136
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:06,312
Not big lives.

137
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:11,052
Insects, flies, spiders.

138
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:14,123
I have chartered a ship
to take us to England.

139
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,391
We'll leave tomorrow evening.

140
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,730
I command you.

141
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,932
Watch over the safety of my coffin.

142
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,696
Yes, master.

143
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:57,436
Renfield!

144
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,648
I'm coming, master.

145
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:13,143
Master, don't worry. I'll help you.

146
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:28,460
I have you now, master.

147
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,912
You look poorly, master.
You're all dried out.

148
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,789
Here, you should have fluids.

149
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:52,486
Yes, I agree.

150
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:56,991
I think I will start with the first mate.

151
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,329
It makes me so happy to be at the opera.

152
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,703
I love this palace of art and beauty.

153
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes, my dear.

154
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:40,337
The opera is astonishing.

155
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,045
The music is fraught with love, hate...

156
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,770
sensuality, and unbridled passion.

157
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:50,814
All the things in my life
I've managed to suppress.

158
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,680
Sorry I'm late, my dear.

159
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:58,318
- We were worried, Father.
- Sorry. Sit.

160
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,386
I was detained at my asylum.

161
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,091
The most extraordinary lunatic
was brought in today.

162
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,795
The only man found alive on that schooner
that drifted into Whitby Harbor.

163
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,394
Absolutely bizarre.

164
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:12,065
Hello. Can I help you, sir?

165
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,769
Yes, you may help me.

166
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,405
Dr. Seward is in the next box.

167
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,915
It is imperative that I meet with him alone.

168
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:27,081
You will tell him
there is a message for him in the lobby.

169
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:31,787
A message for Dr. Seward in the lobby.

170
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,127
Good. Now go.

171
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:38,026
Message in the lobby for Dr. Seward.

172
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:42,160
And you will remember nothing...

173
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,296
of what I tell you.

174
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,907
Extraordinary.

175
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,747
Hello. Can I help you, sir?

176
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,489
"Can I help you, sir?"
What is the matter with you?

177
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,427
- Why did you not tell him?
- About what?

178
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,855
About the message.

179
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,989
For whom?

180
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:15,429
Never mind. I will tell him myself.

181
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,700
And for your miserable performance...

182
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,765
you will receive no tip.

183
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,802
No tip?

184
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:25,439
That you remember.

185
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:29,443
Look what's in here.

186
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,320
Excuse me...

187
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:38,826
are you the Dr. Seward
whose sanitarium is in Whitby?

188
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:42,597
- Why, yes.
- I have just purchased Carfax Abbey...

189
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:45,895
and I understand it adjoins your grounds.

190
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,025
Quite so. And you are?

191
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,101
Forgive me.

192
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,572
I am so renowned in my own country...

193
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:56,042
I sometimes forget to introduce myself.

194
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,304
- I am Count...
- Dr. Seward...

195
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:03,314
there is a message for you in the lobby.

196
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:05,182
Dear God. What is...

197
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,448
Oh, bother. Excuse me.

198
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,720
Dracula.

199
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,885
How do you do, Count Dracula?

200
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,590
I'm Jonathan Harker,
Dr. Seward's assistant.

201
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:19,031
This is Lucy Westenra...

202
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:22,537
and this is my fiancée,
Dr. Seward's daughter, Mina.

203
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:25,974
Count Dracula, it will be a relief
to see lights burning...

204
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,067
through those dismal windows
of Carfax Abbey once again.

205
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:33,540
Oh, yes. The Abbey always reminds me
of that old toast, you know:

206
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:37,151
"Lofty timbers,
the walls around are bare...

207
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,387
"echoing to our laughter...

208
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:41,787
"as though the dead were there."

209
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:44,758
I like the way you think, my dear.

210
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:48,195
That is one of my favorite subjects.

211
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:51,494
We must get together
and have a long discussion.

212
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,432
Very long.

213
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,035
Now I take my leave.
I have a pressing appointment.

214
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,969
Count Dracula?

215
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,106
I'm sorry, my dear...

216
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,348
but you have
such a lovely ucipital mapilary.

217
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,888
What's that?

218
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,386
This.

219
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:24,663
Thank you.

220
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,062
And now I take my leave.

221
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:38,773
There's something otherworldly
about that man.

222
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:42,549
- He gives me the shivers.
- Oh, yes.

223
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:44,612
Me, too.

224
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,493
Count Dracula...

225
00:22:02,871 --> 00:22:07,331
wish we could have that long talk
right now.

226
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,371
Excuse us, my dear.

227
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,432
Dr. Seward, Jonathan.

228
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:50,935
I was sleeping.

229
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:54,473
We're sorry, but we heard a noise
in the bushes below your window.

230
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,110
- We thought it might be a prowler.
- Would you mind if we had a look about?

231
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,086
No. Please do.

232
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,928
- Nothing out here.
- Nothing amiss here, either.

233
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:10,593
What a relief.

234
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:13,998
I'm very confident
there's no danger here whatsoever.

235
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:22,071
Sorry to disturb you, dear.

236
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:25,807
We've searched every inch of the room,
and there's no sign of forcible entry.

237
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,849
- Good night.
- Good night.

238
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:30,784
Something wrong with this latch.

239
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:34,379
Not to worry. I'll give it a jolly good slam.

240
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,079
Renfield.

241
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,383
- Yes?
- I can't take it. Can you take it?

242
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:44,783
The lights, the screaming,
the crazy faces staring at me.

243
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:47,517
I tell you, the walls are closing in on me.

244
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:50,997
- I've got to get out of here.
- Guard, get back to work.

245
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:52,761
Yes, sir.

246
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:11,013
Come along then, Renfield.
You're going to have tea with the guvnor.

247
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:12,314
At last.

248
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,148
Now you'll see, Martin.

249
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:16,918
Dr. Seward will believe I'm not insane.

250
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:20,552
I wouldn't bet me last shilling on it.
Let's go.

251
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,933
Stay.

252
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,675
- Dr. Seward.
- Yes?

253
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:43,275
- Mr. Renfield is here.
- Good. Send him out, Martin.

254
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:47,078
McManus, the patient in the west wing?

255
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:49,646
- Yes.
- He's having a conniption fit.

256
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,853
Give him an enema.

257
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:55,987
- An enema?
- Yes.

258
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:59,160
It will give him a feeling
of accomplishment.

259
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:00,496
Yes, sir.

260
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,034
Renfield, good of you to come.

261
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,438
Good to see you, old chap.
How are you feeling?

262
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:09,636
Normal. Perfectly normal.

263
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,338
- Excellent.
- Yes.

264
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:16,145
Dr. Seward, may I ask
why I've been brought to the sanitarium?

265
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,516
We would like to perform a few tests,
that's all, if you don't mind.

266
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:23,079
No, not at all.
As you can see, I'm quite all right now.

267
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:25,625
Quite so. Hungry?

268
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:27,491
- Famished.
- Help yourself.

269
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,189
- Such a bounty.
- Yes.

270
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,731
I was just telling...

271
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:35,859
What was that?

272
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:39,065
- You grabbed something from the table.
- I did not.

273
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,802
You did. I saw you.
You put it in your mouth.

274
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,468
I think it was an insect.

275
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,473
That was a raspberry.

276
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:48,345
Raspberry? We're not serving raspberries.

277
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,076
Then it must have been a raisin.
It fell off a muffin.

278
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:54,314
- There seems to be one missing.
- It's missing?

279
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:57,256
- Really? Of course.
- Only a raisin.

280
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,384
How extraordinary.

281
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:03,454
Silly me, it must have been
my imagination...

282
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,529
There, you did it again.

283
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,366
You just put a bug in your mouth.
I think it was a spider.

284
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,428
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

285
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:19,075
I tell you, I saw you snatch a spider
right out of the air and eat it.

286
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:22,683
A spider? How absurd.

287
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:28,948
What?

288
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,818
- Dropped my fork.
- Dropped it? You flung it.

289
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,690
What's the matter with you?

290
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:37,323
Mr. Renfield, I'll ask you
what are you doing down there?

291
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,964
Fork found.

292
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:43,236
- This is most unseemly. I don't think...
- Sorry for the delay.

293
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,239
My God, man.

294
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:50,275
You're eating insects
right from the ground.

295
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:51,607
What makes you say that?

296
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,115
Because I can see one
trying to get out of your mouth.

297
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,549
- Out of my mouth?
- Yes, your very own mouth.

298
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,884
- It's wriggling about.
- Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,253
It's wriggling all over the place.

300
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,020
Poor thing, it's fighting for its life.

301
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:11,796
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you keep ranting, I'm going to leave.

302
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:13,857
Me ranting? You're the ranter!

303
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:16,995
Hello, little darling. Don't be afraid.

304
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,068
- He's cracking.
- I won't hurt you.

305
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:25,635
- Don't hurt me.
- All I want is your life!

306
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,876
Martin!

307
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:34,380
Put him in a straitjacket
and give him an enema.

308
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,981
Wait. Give him an enema first...

309
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,319
then put him in a straitjacket.

310
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,288
- Yes, sir.
- Lives!

311
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,827
Lucy, you lazy girl.

312
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:53,737
It's past 10:00.
The horses are saddled and waiting.

313
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,482
Mina, I don't think
I could put a foot out of bed today.

314
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:05,843
I had such horrid dreams.

315
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:10,818
I feel completely drained.

316
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,484
Darling, you're dreadfully pale.

317
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,755
You look absolutely peaked.

318
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:18,390
- Perhaps Father should have a look at you.
- Yes, perhaps.

319
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:29,936
- Father.
- Yeah.

320
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,138
- It's Lucy.
- What's the matter with her?

321
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:35,182
I don't know.
She's frightfully pale and wan.

322
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,684
Pale? Wan? I best have a look.

323
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,190
I've given you some laudanum, dear.
It will help you sleep.

324
00:30:48,496 --> 00:30:50,589
I see no sign of infection.

325
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,797
Are you sure you don't remember
where these marks came from?

326
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:55,995
An insect? Perhaps a spider.

327
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,405
Do you recall being bitten?

328
00:30:58,473 --> 00:31:01,738
No. But I had a dream.

329
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:03,337
Yes?

330
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,743
What about that dream?

331
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:07,978
I remember nothing.

332
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,589
She's asleep.

333
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,418
I must confess I'm completely confounded.

334
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:22,088
I'm going to take the liberty
of contacting Prof. Abraham Van Helsing.

335
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:23,460
Van Helsing?

336
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,999
I thought he was
a metaphysician and philosopher.

337
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:30,128
He's also a medical doctor. Knows more
about obscure diseases than anyone else.

338
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:32,263
He may be the only man who can help us.

339
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,205
Yes. Contact him, Father.

340
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,607
- Contact him straight away.
- Yes.

341
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,457
Gentlemen, you are about to observe
your first autopsy.

342
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:57,760
It's not unusual
for some members of the freshman class...

343
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:01,097
to feel a bit faint during this procedure.

344
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:06,406
So this is where we begin to separate
our future physicians...

345
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:10,037
from those who just want to play doctor.

346
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:13,046
Now, first things first.

347
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:16,342
We uncover the corpse.

348
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,517
We make an incision from the groin...

349
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,321
to the upper chest cavity, there.

350
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:32,964
Now, as I open...

351
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:36,793
the abdominal wall, you will observe...

352
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,466
that the organs
have gone from a nice healthy pink...

353
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:43,242
to a disgusting green.

354
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,841
We must check the intestines...

355
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:50,281
for pathological clues.

356
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:51,777
So...

357
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,617
Here, pass it along.

358
00:32:57,692 --> 00:33:00,991
Don't worry, there's plenty to go around.

359
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,405
No one seems to be standing.

360
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:17,244
Hello. I am still standing,
Professor Van Helsing.

361
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,308
Woodbridge, right?

362
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:23,974
Come closer, Woodbridge.

363
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,882
Good for you. Staunch fellow.

364
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:31,291
Why don't we have a look at the brain?

365
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:38,257
First, we crack open the skull.

366
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,193
So...

367
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:46,300
behold the naked human brain.

368
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,440
Examine it.

369
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:56,775
A good morning's work.

370
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,446
Come.

371
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,387
Professor, 10 out of 10.

372
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:11,257
Yeah. I still got it.

373
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:15,233
I have a message for you from Dr. Seward.

374
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,295
A message from Dr. Seward?
What does he say?

375
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:21,298
He wants you to come
to Whitby immediately.

376
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,036
It's an emergency.

377
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:25,537
An emergency?

378
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:30,040
Yes, sir. An emergency.

379
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,760
I am awake.

380
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:49,927
I'm awake during the daytime?

381
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,734
What is happening?
I cannot be up during the daylight.

382
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,503
It must be the young blood
from Miss Lucy.

383
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,602
Her blood is still in my system.

384
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,839
Is it possible she has cured me?

385
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:09,949
Yes. I am cured.

386
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,786
Now I can be up night and day.

387
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,357
It is so bright...

388
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:22,861
so many colors...

389
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,403
and the sun is so warm.

390
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:29,773
Hello, young lovers.

391
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,679
I could not help but smell
your lovely picnic.

392
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:36,046
Could I presume to ask you
for a piece of your chicken?

393
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,744
Surely, sir.

394
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:42,520
- Some wine, sir?
- I never drink wine.

395
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,127
What the hell. Let me try it.

396
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,031
It's good.

397
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:56,092
Master!

398
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,539
Renfield, look at me.
I'm drinking wine and eating chicken.

399
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,667
What are you doing out in the daytime?

400
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,008
Relax, Renfield. I am cured.

401
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,480
No, you're not. Look.

402
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:14,453
I made a mistake.
I've got to get back to my coffin.

403
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:30,697
It's nighttime. Then it wasn't real.

404
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:36,137
I was having a daymare.

405
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:46,916
Three tiny puncture marks on her throat.

406
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,049
Three?

407
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,685
Two.

408
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:58,097
Two tiny puncture marks on her throat.

409
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,495
What does it mean, Professor?

410
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:05,598
Gentlemen, what I am about to say...

411
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,501
will shake the very foundation...

412
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:11,572
of every medical precept you hold dear.

413
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,873
We have entered
the realm of the supernatural.

414
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:21,487
Supernatural?

415
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:23,887
- Realm of the supernatural?
<i>- Ja.</i>

416
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,483
Lucy has been attacked...

417
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:29,857
by a creature that rises from its grave...

418
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:32,158
and sucks the blood of the living...

419
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:35,862
in order to prolong
its own unholy existence.

420
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:40,401
What we are dealing with here is...

421
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,509
a vampire.

422
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,971
- Vampire?
- Vampire?

423
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,515
What are you saying?

424
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:50,345
I'm saying, "vampire."

425
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:54,814
Professor, modern science
does not admit to such a fanciful creature.

426
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:57,556
Modern science, pish posh.

427
00:37:57,892 --> 00:38:00,360
She has lost a great deal of blood, <i>ja?</i>

428
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:02,020
<i>- Ja.</i>
- Yet, look.

429
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:06,925
Where did all the blood go?

430
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,895
Look at the sheet, the pillowcase,
her nightgown.

431
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,632
Do you see anything?

432
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,872
How does your modern science
explain "zat?"

433
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:18,045
Can you explain "zat?"

434
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,842
I can't explain "zat."

435
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,815
No one can explain "zat!"

436
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,780
Are you asking us to believe...

437
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:28,617
that some creature
just flew in through that window...

438
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:31,624
bit Lucy on the neck,
and drank of her blood?

439
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,088
Exactly.

440
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:36,486
And tonight...

441
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:40,465
the foul thing will return.

442
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,800
It will suck on her life's fluid...

443
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:49,270
until it has drained her of every last drop.

444
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,674
And if she dies...

445
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:57,212
a victim of this unspeakable creature...

446
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:01,681
she will become one herself.

447
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,850
What?

448
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:08,021
She will become one herself.

449
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,423
What can we do
to protect her from this fiend?

450
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:16,292
- Seward.
- Yes?

451
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,996
Do you have any books on the occult?

452
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:22,775
They're right here.

453
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:25,869
- Do you have <i>Transylvanian Folklore?</i>
- No.

454
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,543
Do you have <i>The Theory</i>
<i>and the Theology of the Evil Undead?</i>

455
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,641
No.

456
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:34,213
- Do you have <i>The Vampires of Prague?</i>
- No.

457
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,323
Do you have <i>Nosferatu?</i>

458
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:42,094
Yes, we have <i>Nosferatu.</i>
We have <i>Nosferatu</i> today.

459
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:45,496
- It just came in the post.
- Here, give it to me, quick.

460
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:50,929
Here.

461
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:53,665
- There is a way to protect her.
- How?

462
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:57,206
"The creature is repelled by garlic.

463
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:00,774
"Lts purifying effect is anathema...

464
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,816
"to the tainted soul of the vampire."

465
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:24,337
I must move the coffin or the chandelier.

466
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:31,534
We brought you down here
so you'll be closer to us, my dear.

467
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:33,739
We'll be just down the hall in the study.

468
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:37,773
You must get a good night's rest
to regain your strength, my dear.

469
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:40,614
It's the only way to improve your health.

470
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,178
Would an enema help?

471
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:47,883
Come, we must go.

472
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:56,033
Sleep well, Miss Lucy.

473
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,530
The garlic will protect you.

474
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:38,038
Garlic.

475
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,431
- Renfield.
- Master?

476
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:08,100
It is time for you to serve your master.

477
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:11,036
- Come.
- Yes, master.

478
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,807
Those meddling idiots.

479
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,650
They want to prevent me
from entering Miss Lucy's bedroom.

480
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,945
- I want to take...
- Wait, master.

481
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,328
All right, I'm listening.

482
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:38,531
They have placed garlands of garlic
around her room.

483
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,202
What can I do, master?
I can't leave this cell.

484
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:45,740
Do you imagine I could not
take you out of here if I wish?

485
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:49,076
That these pathetic bars could stop me?

486
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:52,317
Wait, master. I'm getting such a headache.

487
00:42:52,386 --> 00:42:56,345
How dare they try to match wits with me?

488
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,784
Me, who has commanded
the forces of darkness.

489
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:03,488
Me, who has called forth
the demons of the night to do my bidding.

490
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:08,258
Me, who has destroyed every enemy
down through the centuries.

491
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:14,700
Renfield? I'm talking to you.

492
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,509
- Sorry, master.
- Come.

493
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:24,082
We have much to do,
and less time to do it in.

494
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,119
Renfield, hurry.

495
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:51,040
Renfield, I meant for you
to use the drain pipe.

496
00:43:51,612 --> 00:43:53,637
I fly, you don't.

497
00:43:54,114 --> 00:43:55,775
Yes, of course.

498
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:57,974
- Come.
- He flies, I don't.

499
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,449
Renfield, you idiot.

500
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:10,516
Grab him, Harker.

501
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:14,353
I'm weak. I strayed.

502
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:15,792
What did he do?

503
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:19,092
I caught him lifting up the sheets
and looking at me.

504
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:22,635
Nothing but a filthy pervert. Martin.

505
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,569
Here you are.

506
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,732
Take him back to his cell
and give him a you-know-what.

507
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,209
No, not another enema.

508
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:35,838
Yes, another and another
until you come to your senses.

509
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,718
- I'll close the window.
- Yes.

510
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,188
Good lad.

511
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:50,958
- Are you all right, dear?
- Yes. I'm fine, Dr. Seward...

512
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:53,693
apart from this ghastly garlic.

513
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:56,201
I'm sorry, dear, but Van Helsing insists.

514
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,704
Oh, Lord!

515
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,701
Lucy...

516
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,742
I command you...

517
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,910
open the window.

518
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:12,544
Come.

519
00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:17,451
Get in there, you filthy degenerate!

520
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,890
I didn't see anything!

521
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,989
I saw everything.

522
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:51,257
- It's Lucy. Someone was attacking her.
- Wait here.

523
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,164
How is she?

524
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:02,902
- She's dead.
- Dead?

525
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:06,400
The vampire has taken all of her blood.

526
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:10,270
I told her not to leave
the safety of the garlic.

527
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:24,290
No. It's absolutely absurd.

528
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:28,226
I tell you, we must drive
a wooden stake through her heart.

529
00:47:28,629 --> 00:47:32,429
Or else she will rise from her grave
to seek the blood of the living.

530
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:34,399
Lucy was my ward.

531
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:37,732
I won't permit you to desecrate her body
in such a vile manner.

532
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:39,135
It's sacrilegious.

533
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:43,336
But, Dr. Seward, shouldn't we at least
stand guard over Lucy's grave...

534
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,344
- just to make sure?
- No.

535
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,006
I'm having serious doubts
about this whole vampire theory.

536
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:51,346
For heaven's sake, who in all of England...

537
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:53,886
by the very furthest stretch
of the imagination...

538
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,615
could possibly be a vampire?

539
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:58,419
- Count Dracula.
- Well, maybe him.

540
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:04,128
What? What are you... about?

541
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:08,695
Count Dracula! Just talking about you,
favorably of course.

542
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,368
Forgive my interruption...

543
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:14,373
but I was just made aware
of the unfortunate passing of Miss Lucy.

544
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,441
I wish to offer my condolences.

545
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:21,005
- Thank you. We're all very distraught.
- Yes.

546
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,173
Count Dracula, allow me to introduce...

547
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,946
Prof. Abraham Van Helsing
of London University.

548
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,646
He's a doctor of rare diseases,
as well as theology and philosophy.

549
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:31,520
<i>Und</i> gynecology.

550
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:35,126
I didn't know
you had your hand in that, too.

551
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:40,693
Van Helsing, a name we know
even in the wilds of Transylvania.

552
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:44,203
Count Dracula. Curious.

553
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:49,504
Are you descended from Vlad Tepes,
the first Dracula?

554
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:50,735
Tepes?

555
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:55,578
It means "The lmpaler."
He was a bloodthirsty butcher...

556
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:59,047
who inflicted unspeakable tortures
on the peasants.

557
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:02,755
Cutting off their hands and feet,
gouging out their eyes...

558
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:06,849
and then impaling them on iron spikes.

559
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:10,154
They had it coming.

560
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:14,290
What could they possibly have done...

561
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,928
to deserve such barbaric
and inhuman treatment?

562
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:18,028
Yes.

563
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:20,039
We have a saying in the old country:

564
00:49:24,177 --> 00:49:25,576
They also said:

565
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:35,151
I'm very impressed, Van Helsing.
You speak the ancient Moldavian.

566
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,954
Well, gentlemen, I will take my...

567
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:45,992
leave.

568
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:51,730
I say, Van Helsing, you are a man
who likes to have the last word.

569
00:49:52,673 --> 00:49:56,507
I will not be drawn into
such a childish exercise.

570
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:03,477
It is immaterial to me
who has the last word.

571
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:08,545
It is getting late.

572
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:11,591
We will carry on this conversation
at another time.

573
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:14,152
Good night.

574
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:21,934
Such arrogance.

575
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,632
It is easy to see...

576
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:28,304
why the decadent aristocracy
is dying out...

577
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,342
in that part of the world.

578
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:36,340
Gentlemen, our work is not done.

579
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:38,651
The vampire is still among us.

580
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,744
You must remember, he is cunning.

581
00:50:40,854 --> 00:50:43,152
He has the wisdom of centuries.

582
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:46,317
And above all, he will never give up.

583
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:53,063
That man! He never gives up.

584
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,062
Never gives up.

585
00:50:58,872 --> 00:51:00,965
What are you thinking, Professor?

586
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:04,635
- When did Count Dracula move in?
- About a month ago.

587
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:07,945
And when did Miss Lucy's symptoms
first appear?

588
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:09,242
About the same time.

589
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,308
Are you saying
that Count Dracula is our vampire?

590
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:15,047
Yes! And no.

591
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:17,283
- Then what are you saying?
- I'm saying no.

592
00:51:17,357 --> 00:51:19,291
But I'm leaning towards yes.

593
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,883
- Then you're saying yes.
- No.

594
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:22,826
- Then it's no.
- Not necessarily.

595
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:24,864
- You sound dubious.
- No, I'm positive.

596
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,330
- Of what?
- My theory.

597
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:30,301
- And that would be?
- The theory of yes or no.

598
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:43,342
Good night, sweet lady.

599
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,482
May angels' voices sing thee to thy rest.

600
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:49,883
Help me.

601
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,857
What's that?

602
00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:57,793
Help me, it's so dark in here.

603
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:01,791
Who's in there?

604
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:06,232
I'm alive. They've buried me alive.

605
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:09,605
Saints preserve us.

606
00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:12,871
Don't worry, miss. I'm coming.

607
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,282
Oh, my God!

608
00:52:18,985 --> 00:52:21,920
They made a mistake, a terrible mistake.

609
00:52:22,422 --> 00:52:26,188
Please help me. I'm so very cold.

610
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:30,621
You'll be all right. You're alive.

611
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:50,539
I say, Jonathan. What are you doing?

612
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:53,210
Just for tonight...

613
00:52:53,286 --> 00:52:57,086
I'm going to stand guard at Lucy's grave,
as the Professor suggested.

614
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,986
Surely you don't believe
this vampire business?

615
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,487
I don't know what I believe.

616
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:05,861
But on the odd chance
that Van Helsing's right...

617
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,492
I should never forgive myself
if I didn't make sure.

618
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:11,867
All right, go ahead.
But I think you're wasting your time.

619
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:14,870
Poppycock.

620
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:03,789
Jonathan.

621
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,102
Lucy?

622
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:28,778
Come away with me, Jonathan.

623
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:35,585
I know you've always wanted me...

624
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:38,119
and I have always wanted you.

625
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:40,351
Finally we can be together.

626
00:54:41,594 --> 00:54:45,030
But, Lucy, I'm engaged to Mina...

627
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:47,297
and you're dead.

628
00:54:47,968 --> 00:54:49,959
I'm not dead.

629
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,334
I'm undead.

630
00:54:53,173 --> 00:54:56,631
Yes, well, I'm not unengaged...

631
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,242
thank you.

632
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:02,271
Jonathan, let me kiss you.

633
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:07,247
Let me show you the deep, raw passion...

634
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,983
of unbridled, sexual frenzy.

635
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:14,385
But, Lucy, I'm British.

636
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:16,455
But so are these.

637
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:26,197
Now we can be together forever.

638
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:27,662
Back.

639
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:34,738
Back, unholy demon of the night.

640
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:43,948
- After her! This is our chance.
- For what?

641
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:48,051
To destroy her, my boy.
She's retreated to her crypt. Come!

642
00:55:58,138 --> 00:55:59,332
My God.

643
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:02,206
- Now she's dead.
- No, she's not.

644
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:05,537
- She's alive?
- She's Nosferatu.

645
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:07,770
She's Italian?

646
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:10,276
No, it means the undead.

647
00:56:10,383 --> 00:56:13,113
She's cursed to spend eternity in misery...

648
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:15,915
hunting the living like a wild animal.

649
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,950
What should we do?

650
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:21,460
For the sake of her eternal soul,
we must destroy her.

651
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,595
The only way...

652
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:26,598
is to drive a wooden stake...

653
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,228
through her heart.

654
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,169
That's horrible. Is there no other way?

655
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:36,240
One other. We could cut off her head...

656
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:38,601
stuff her mouth with garlic...

657
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,677
and tear off her ears.

658
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:43,943
Give me the stake.

659
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:48,912
Oh, no. No, I can't do it. You do it.

660
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:52,858
It must be done
by one who loved her in life.

661
00:56:52,926 --> 00:56:55,326
- I only liked her.
- Close enough. Here.

662
00:56:56,096 --> 00:56:59,896
Good boy. You can do it. Here.

663
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:03,697
Now place the point of the stake
directly over her heart...

664
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:07,464
and hit as hard as you can.

665
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,434
Wait!

666
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,071
Now!

667
00:57:20,553 --> 00:57:24,045
Oh, my God!

668
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:27,492
There's so much blood.

669
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:29,595
She just ate.

670
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:34,122
She's still alive.

671
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:37,701
- Hit her again.
- No, I can't.

672
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,068
How much blood can she have left?

673
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:42,498
Go.

674
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:56,879
She's almost dead.

675
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,553
She's dead enough.

676
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,766
- This is ghastly.
- Yes. You're right.

677
00:58:10,136 --> 00:58:12,468
We should have put newspapers down.

678
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,170
What have I done?

679
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:19,040
What have I done to poor Lucy?

680
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:21,780
You have released her, my boy.

681
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,513
Now she sleeps in peace forever.

682
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:28,988
- Here. Clean yourself up.
- Thank you.

683
00:58:29,656 --> 00:58:31,021
Poor Lucy.

684
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:39,623
Here.

685
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:42,629
Keep it.

686
00:58:58,551 --> 00:58:59,882
Essie...

687
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:05,919
your eyelids are growing heavy...

688
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,051
with sleep.

689
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:10,724
Sleep.

690
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:20,972
Mina, open your eyes.

691
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:25,677
Arise, Mina.

692
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:32,981
Walk to the door.

693
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,627
Mina, you are in the closet.

694
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:49,963
Open the door and come out.

695
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,342
Now walk to the terrace door.

696
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:04,016
Watch out for the foot...

697
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:07,612
stool.

698
01:00:09,756 --> 01:00:11,018
Stand up.

699
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,348
Not you. Sit.

700
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,091
No, not you. You sit.

701
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:19,254
You stand. No, sit.

702
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,523
No, you stand.

703
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:25,960
You walk to the terrace door,
and you go back to sleep.

704
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:27,603
Watch out!

705
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,013
Wait. I'm coming.

706
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:38,974
Turn out the lights, so no one will see me.

707
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,724
You will be my bride throughout eternity.

708
01:00:50,863 --> 01:00:54,162
We'll share the endless passion
of immortal love.

709
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:57,327
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Not you.

710
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,540
You will be my bride throughout eternity.

711
01:01:05,611 --> 01:01:08,375
We'll share the endless passion
of immortal love.

712
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:12,211
Oh, my boy. Such a night.

713
01:01:17,156 --> 01:01:20,751
- My God, man. What's happened to you?
- Everything.

714
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,093
Professor Van Helsing
was absolutely right.

715
01:01:24,297 --> 01:01:27,460
Lucy rose from her grave and attacked me.

716
01:01:28,234 --> 01:01:30,725
And now, at last...

717
01:01:31,471 --> 01:01:33,371
she sleeps in peace.

718
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:36,734
You mean Lucy
actually became a vampire?

719
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:38,503
Yes.

720
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,808
- Where's Mina?
- She's all right. Fast asleep.

721
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:44,179
- Essie's sitting watch over her.
- Good.

722
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,083
I'll just sit watch myself
in front of her door.

723
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:50,518
Don't you think
you ought to get cleaned up first?

724
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:52,558
Oh, yes. Quite right.

725
01:01:52,759 --> 01:01:55,557
Do you mind using the service entrance?

726
01:01:56,429 --> 01:01:58,158
There's a good chap.

727
01:01:58,731 --> 01:02:02,667
He's covered with blood
and there's not a drop on you. Why?

728
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,395
I have been to many, many stakings.

729
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:08,436
You have to know where to stand.

730
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:12,272
You know, everything in life is location.

731
01:02:44,076 --> 01:02:48,137
And now we shall do the dance of love.

732
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,979
You're good.

733
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:35,520
No hickies.

734
01:05:03,516 --> 01:05:07,145
- Shouldn't we rouse her?
- Yes, perhaps you're right.

735
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,478
Essie.

736
01:05:08,554 --> 01:05:11,148
Hello. I must have dropped off.

737
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:14,151
Good gracious, it's morning.

738
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,454
One moment I was on guard,
wide awake...

739
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,723
and the next I felt like...

740
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:23,257
a dark cloud came over me.

741
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,163
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

742
01:05:26,606 --> 01:05:28,836
Here we are, then, safe and sound.

743
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:31,536
It's getting on. I better see to breakfast.

744
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:35,045
Where'd that come from?

745
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:41,812
I had the most extraordinary dreams
last night.

746
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:44,979
I feel so different.

747
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,919
You look different, Mina.

748
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,758
Come.

749
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,634
Sit with me.

750
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,030
Closer.

751
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:06,275
Closer, you silly boy.

752
01:06:07,813 --> 01:06:10,304
Darling, we know each other so well...

753
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:14,911
and yet we've never really
explored each other.

754
01:06:15,955 --> 01:06:17,354
Thank God.

755
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:20,818
Jonathan, I've changed.
I'm not the Mina you knew.

756
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,218
What do you mean, dearest?

757
01:06:23,462 --> 01:06:25,020
I want you to do something for me...

758
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:27,258
something that
I've never asked you before.

759
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:30,302
- Of course, my dear. Anything.
- Good.

760
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:33,396
- Touch this.
- Don't mind if I do.

761
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,732
What are you saying?

762
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:40,706
All right, you don't have to touch anything.

763
01:06:41,547 --> 01:06:43,412
- I'll touch you.
- No!

764
01:06:46,218 --> 01:06:47,879
Stop this immediately.

765
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:49,982
What's come over you?

766
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:53,224
- I'm leaving.
- No, please, don't go.

767
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,688
You're right.

768
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,457
Something is wrong with me
and it's taking over my mind...

769
01:06:58,531 --> 01:07:00,829
and forcing me to say things
I would never say...

770
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,300
and do things I would never do.

771
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:05,632
Jonathan, please help me.

772
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,264
Mina, yes. Anything. What can I do?

773
01:07:10,643 --> 01:07:11,905
Touch this.

774
01:07:12,678 --> 01:07:15,010
Good morning, Mina. How did you...

775
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:20,784
Jonathan, take your hands off me.

776
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:23,146
Yes, take your hands off her.

777
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:26,183
Sorry, sir.

778
01:07:26,258 --> 01:07:28,192
You should be ashamed of yourself.

779
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,727
But she made me do it.

780
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,889
- Is that right, Mina?
- No, Father.

781
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:36,865
Suddenly, without any reason at all,
he laid his hands on me.

782
01:07:37,002 --> 01:07:40,062
- She told me to touch it.
- Harker!

783
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:44,007
You're a degenerate.
I take you into my home.

784
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:48,039
You eat my food, drink my wine,
but that's not enough for you. Oh, no.

785
01:07:48,114 --> 01:07:50,844
After being engaged to my daughter
for only five years...

786
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:53,680
you have the audacity to touch her.

787
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:55,679
Get out.

788
01:07:55,955 --> 01:07:57,946
- But, sir...
- Out, I said!

789
01:07:59,558 --> 01:08:02,891
- What is happening here?
- Terrible doings.

790
01:08:02,962 --> 01:08:05,260
I found Harker
with his hands all over my daughter.

791
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:09,131
But she forced me to, sir.
She's been behaving rather strangely.

792
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:12,170
It's as though
she's been under some sort of a spell.

793
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:14,769
Spell?

794
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:19,200
That's a very lovely scarf
you're wearing, Miss Mina.

795
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,947
Yes, I felt chilly this morning.

796
01:08:24,116 --> 01:08:25,447
Excuse me.

797
01:08:26,485 --> 01:08:29,147
May I have a look?

798
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,115
Just as I thought.

799
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:34,619
Like Lucy.

800
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:37,185
No, it's nothing.

801
01:08:37,263 --> 01:08:39,959
I accidentally did it
while I was pinning a shawl.

802
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,260
Really?

803
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,767
I have something for you, Miss Mina.

804
01:08:44,103 --> 01:08:45,434
A present?

805
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:48,597
Sort of. Hold out your hand.

806
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:50,097
Here.

807
01:08:55,347 --> 01:08:56,439
Here.

808
01:08:56,982 --> 01:08:58,040
Look.

809
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,678
What is that?

810
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:02,945
It is proof, my unfortunate friend...

811
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,983
that your daughter has been corrupted...

812
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,388
by the evil of a vampire.

813
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:12,656
We must find this vampire
before Mina meets the same fate as Lucy.

814
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,358
But who is the vampire?

815
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,832
Van Helsing suspects Count Dracula.
But it can also be Renfield.

816
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,700
The man drinks the blood of insects...

817
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:22,639
and bent the bars of his cell
like they were cheese.

818
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:24,436
It could be anyone.

819
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:28,375
There is a way, an indisputable way...

820
01:09:29,148 --> 01:09:31,981
to reveal the vampire.

821
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:52,729
I'm going along with you on this,
Van Helsing...

822
01:09:52,805 --> 01:09:55,171
but I think this ball
is in extremely bad taste.

823
01:09:55,241 --> 01:09:58,642
Lucy dead less than a fortnight,
Mina's health hanging in the balance.

824
01:09:58,711 --> 01:10:01,043
The ball's been in progress
for over an hour.

825
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:03,604
It appears as if Count Dracula
isn't coming.

826
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:05,979
I hope you're wrong, my boy.

827
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:09,248
I especially wanted to see
Count Dracula tonight.

828
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:11,380
I wonder if he suspects something.

829
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,947
Good evening.

830
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:16,394
- Did I startle you?
- No!

831
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:22,898
- May I take your cape, sir?
- No, not my cape.

832
01:10:23,035 --> 01:10:24,900
You may take my hat.

833
01:10:27,773 --> 01:10:29,138
Thank you.

834
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:34,509
We were afraid you wouldn't show up.

835
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,948
I would not miss your gala.

836
01:10:38,017 --> 01:10:41,748
I always keep my nights open
for new experiences.

837
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,989
Miss Mina.

838
01:10:47,059 --> 01:10:49,584
She looks especially lovely tonight.

839
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:53,664
Would you be insanely jealous
if I should ask her to dance?

840
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,269
Well, to be perfectly frank... Not at all.

841
01:10:57,736 --> 01:10:59,101
Thank you.

842
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:04,803
Master!

843
01:11:05,144 --> 01:11:06,270
You're here.

844
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:10,181
Do not call me master.

845
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:15,212
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know. They invited me.

846
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:16,979
I smell a rat.

847
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:19,921
- Where?
- Renfield.

848
01:11:21,727 --> 01:11:24,628
If I am discovered, we must flee.

849
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,097
Yes. I'll escape. I'll meet you at Carfax.

850
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:31,125
No. That would be too dangerous.
They will search there first.

851
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:35,331
I have moved my coffin
to the abandoned chapel...

852
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,204
at the top of the cliffs.

853
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,008
When you come,
make sure you're not being followed.

854
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:41,740
- Do you understand?
- Yes, master.

855
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:43,805
- Do not call me master.
- Yes...

856
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:00,758
Good evening, Miss Mina.

857
01:12:00,933 --> 01:12:04,892
- May I have the next dance?
- I beg your pardon, sir.

858
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,063
Can't you see
I'm having a drink with Miss Mina?

859
01:12:07,139 --> 01:12:09,369
You have finished your drink.

860
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:14,069
So I have.

861
01:12:14,646 --> 01:12:16,238
Come, Miss Mina.

862
01:12:31,797 --> 01:12:33,628
- Martin.
- Right.

863
01:12:43,008 --> 01:12:44,066
Now!

864
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:54,884
I can't see him. How can this be?

865
01:12:55,421 --> 01:12:57,013
The vampire...

866
01:12:57,089 --> 01:13:00,217
casts no reflection in a mirror.

867
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:13,761
She's doing quite well
without him, isn't she?

868
01:13:19,378 --> 01:13:21,505
Hey, we must be good.

869
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:24,710
Let's really give them something to watch.

870
01:13:24,783 --> 01:13:26,842
Play the czardas.

871
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,014
Czardas.

872
01:13:56,915 --> 01:13:58,576
They're loving it.

873
01:14:06,225 --> 01:14:07,419
Come on!

874
01:14:07,826 --> 01:14:09,589
Big finish.

875
01:14:53,038 --> 01:14:57,099
You are a very wise man, Van Helsing...

876
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,770
for someone who has yet to live
a single lifetime.

877
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:22,127
Get him!

878
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:29,430
Master!

879
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:32,373
I mean, mister!

880
01:15:34,046 --> 01:15:35,104
You!

881
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:37,410
Where do you think you're going?

882
01:15:37,482 --> 01:15:38,779
Professor!

883
01:15:39,985 --> 01:15:43,716
- We must find him before sunrise.
- Why before sunrise?

884
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,257
Because the rays of the sun
will destroy him.

885
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:48,555
He must hide during the daylight hours.

886
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:51,322
Come, or Miss Mina
will be lost to us forever.

887
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:54,291
Come along, old fly-eater.

888
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:59,359
We've searched Carfax Abbey from top
to bottom. There's no trace of them.

889
01:15:59,438 --> 01:16:01,531
What can we do, Professor?
Where could he be?

890
01:16:01,607 --> 01:16:03,074
I don't know.

891
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:08,968
We must release Renfield.
He is our only hope.

892
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:11,374
He called Dracula "master."

893
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,710
I thought he said, "mister."

894
01:16:14,386 --> 01:16:17,913
That was only a ruse
to fool the feebleminded.

895
01:16:18,223 --> 01:16:19,918
- No offense.
- I understand.

896
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,256
Renfield will go straight to Dracula.

897
01:16:23,061 --> 01:16:25,256
And we will follow. This way.

898
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:33,003
You'll stay here till you rot.

899
01:16:37,976 --> 01:16:39,671
Well, you're free to go.

900
01:16:39,878 --> 01:16:43,541
- Free to go? Why? How?
- Good behavior.

901
01:16:43,749 --> 01:16:46,013
But I've only been in here for a moment.

902
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:49,713
Well, for that moment,
your behavior was very good.

903
01:16:50,789 --> 01:16:52,017
Let's go.

904
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:56,620
Watch your step.

905
01:16:57,963 --> 01:16:59,726
I'm coming, master.

906
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,666
I know what they are up to.
They think I'll lead them to the master.

907
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:07,534
I must outsmart them.

908
01:17:20,352 --> 01:17:21,649
Lost them.

909
01:17:25,257 --> 01:17:27,248
Gentlemen, we are fortunate.

910
01:17:27,326 --> 01:17:29,726
- Why?
- He's an imbecile. Come.

911
01:17:56,621 --> 01:17:58,384
Master, I'm here.

912
01:18:01,993 --> 01:18:03,654
Are you sure you were not followed?

913
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:05,720
No, I led them in the wrong direction.

914
01:18:05,797 --> 01:18:07,662
They have no idea where I am.

915
01:18:07,733 --> 01:18:09,598
He went into the chapel. Hurry!

916
01:18:09,668 --> 01:18:12,728
You have led them right to me,
you stupid nuncompoop.

917
01:18:12,804 --> 01:18:16,262
I didn't know.
I'm sorry, master. Punish me.

918
01:18:16,408 --> 01:18:19,138
No. Go. Lead them away.
I don't have any time.

919
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:21,679
No, you must punish me.
Hurt me. I deserve it.

920
01:18:21,747 --> 01:18:25,274
- Not now!
- But I've failed you, master!

921
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:29,150
I'm a useless, pitiful fool
who has betrayed you.

922
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:30,882
You must hurt me.

923
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,981
All right!

924
01:18:34,993 --> 01:18:37,826
Good, master. Good.

925
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,165
Okay, that's enough.

926
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:51,835
Why?

927
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:56,337
Up there!

928
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:08,458
It's locked.

929
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:10,721
Break it open.

930
01:19:10,796 --> 01:19:12,855
- Put your weight into it.
- Doctor.

931
01:19:12,931 --> 01:19:14,228
Okay.

932
01:19:23,475 --> 01:19:25,136
They are too late.

933
01:19:25,811 --> 01:19:29,804
Soon you will be my bride for eternity.

934
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,274
Don't stop.

935
01:19:33,118 --> 01:19:34,642
Good, keep it up.

936
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:35,947
Harder.

937
01:19:39,758 --> 01:19:41,692
The hinges are giving way.

938
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,077
Jonathan, duck.

939
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,219
Back.

940
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:17,124
Jonathan, get that stake.

941
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,754
A sharp wooden stick, anything.

942
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:21,494
Back.

943
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:23,628
Good.

944
01:20:24,669 --> 01:20:27,365
Now drive it through his heart.

945
01:20:31,142 --> 01:20:32,439
Look out!

946
01:20:50,462 --> 01:20:53,124
Arrogant mortal.

947
01:20:53,665 --> 01:20:56,657
You are in my world now...

948
01:20:56,735 --> 01:20:59,966
and you will never leave this attic alive.

949
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:03,402
I will destroy you...

950
01:21:03,808 --> 01:21:07,437
and then I will possess she
whom you love the most...

951
01:21:07,512 --> 01:21:12,142
and there is not a single thing
in the world you can do to stop me.

952
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:22,284
For that you'll watch...

953
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,888
while with your beloved Mina
I consummate our marriage.

954
01:22:04,869 --> 01:22:06,928
Grab him. He's getting away.

955
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,165
Grab him.

956
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,648
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- He's up there.

957
01:22:18,316 --> 01:22:21,774
We must catch him, or else all is lost.

958
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:27,588
Master.

959
01:22:27,759 --> 01:22:29,021
This way.

960
01:22:31,997 --> 01:22:34,465
Renfield, you asshole!

961
01:22:44,976 --> 01:22:46,500
Where am I?

962
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:48,805
- What's happened to Dracula?
- He's dead.

963
01:22:49,114 --> 01:22:50,843
And you're free.

964
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,850
Thank God.

965
01:22:52,951 --> 01:22:56,352
You're my own sweet,
innocent Mina again.

966
01:22:58,323 --> 01:23:02,760
And I have you, my darling Jonathan,
to thank for it.

967
01:23:05,263 --> 01:23:07,060
And now, my dearest...

968
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:10,296
let me take you home.

969
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:24,475
Master!

970
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:29,380
I'm sorry.

971
01:23:30,622 --> 01:23:32,112
Forgive me.

972
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,060
There.

973
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:46,902
You're starting to look like
your old self again.

974
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:56,042
Your master is gone forever, Mr. Renfield.

975
01:23:56,314 --> 01:23:58,305
You are your own man now.

976
01:23:59,317 --> 01:24:00,682
- I am?
- Yes.

977
01:24:00,919 --> 01:24:03,251
No one will ever control you again.

978
01:24:03,321 --> 01:24:05,221
- You're right.
