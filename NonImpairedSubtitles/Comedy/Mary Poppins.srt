comical poems suitable
for the occasion...

10
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:33,015
extemporized and thought up
before your very eyes.

11
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,225
All right, here we go.

00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:44,151
Now, how does that sound?

15
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,576
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you

16
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,497
Miss Lark likes to walk
in the park with Andrew.

17
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,835
Hello, Andrew.

18
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:08,425
AH, Mrs Cory
a story for you

19
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,761
Your daughters
were shorter than you...

20
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:13,805
but they grew.

21
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:23,065
Dear Miss Persimmon--

22
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:27,778
Yes?

23
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,280
Wind´s in tHe east

24
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:33,283
Mist comin´ in.

25
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:37,704
Like sometHing is brewin´
About to begin

26
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:45,462
Can´t put me finger
on wHat lies in store

27
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:48,215
But I feel what´s to happen...

28
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:51,426
all happened before.

29
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:55,931
I´m sorry. Where was I?

30
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:24,168
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

31
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:31,425
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

32
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:36,597
Crikey. Bless you, guv.

33
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:39,308
Generosity itself,
that´s what you are.

34
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,518
No charge.

35
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:46,565
Oh, it´s you! Hello.

36
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:52,154
Number 1 7 Cherry Tree Lane,
you say?

37
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,323
All right.
Come along with me.

38
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,784
This here´s Cherry Tree Lane.

39
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:02,789
Nice little spot,
you might say.

40
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:05,501
Number 1 7´s just down a bit.

41
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:12,174
Now, this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye...

42
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:14,843
is the home
of Admiral Boom...

43
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,012
late of His Majesty´s Navy.

44
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:19,014
Likes his house
shipshape, he does...

45
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:22,559
shipshape and bristol fashion
at all times.

46
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:31,985
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

47
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,072
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

48
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:39,243
What he´s famous for
is punctuality.

49
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:41,703
The whole world takes
its time from Greenwich.

50
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:45,749
But Greenwich, they say, takes
its time from Admiral Boom.

51
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,459
What cheer, Admiral?

52
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:50,838
Good afternoon to you,
young man. Where are you bound?

53
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:54,383
Number 1 7. Got some parties here
in tow what wants to see it.

54
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,302
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

55
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,513
A word of advice, young man:

56
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:02,558
Storm signals are up
at Number 1 7.

57
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:05,018
Bit of heavy weather
brewing there.

58
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,521
Thank you, sir.
Keep an eye skinned.

59
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:13,235
Here we are.
Number 1 7 Cherry Tree Lane.

60
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:16,071
Residence of
George Banks, Esquire.

61
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:20,742
Hello, hello, hello.
The Admiral´s right.

62
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:25,080
Heavy weather brewin´
at Number 1 7, and no mistake.

63
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,915
- Leave her alone!
- Shut up!

64
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:29,626
I´ll show you. Don´t you be trying
to stop the wretched creature!

65
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,004
Let her go, that´s what I say,
and good riddance!

66
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,173
I never liked her from the
moment she set foot in the door.

67
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:39,094
But who gets stuck with
the children with no nanny
in the house? Me, that´s who!

68
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,430
Her and her high
and mighty ways!

69
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,432
And that face of her that would
stop a coal barge, it would.

70
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,852
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn´t
stay in this house another minute...

71
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:49,605
not if you heap me with
all the jewels in Christendom.

72
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:52,274
No, no, Katie Nanna, don´t go!

73
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:53,692
Stand away from that door,
my girl!

74
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,361
But what am I gonna tell
the master about the children?

75
00:07:56,445 --> 00:08:01,450
It´s no concern of mine.
Those little beasts have run
away from me for the last time.

76
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:04,620
They must be somewhere. Did you
look around the zoo in the park?

77
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:06,538
You know how Jane
and Michael is.

78
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,625
Coo! You don´t think the lion
could´ve got at them, do ya?

79
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,252
You know how fond they was
of hangin´ around the cage.

80
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,463
I said my say,
and that´s all I´ll say.

81
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:17,216
I´ve done with this house forever.

82
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,967
Well, hip, hip, hooray!

83
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:22,012
And don´t stumble
on the way out, dearie.

84
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:24,723
Now, now, Katie Nanna!

85
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:29,978
Mrs Banks! She´s home!

86
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,440
Our daugHter´s daugHters will adore us
and we´ll sing in grateful cHorus

87
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,484
´´Well done,
Sister Suffragette´´

88
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,736
Good evening,
Katie Nanna, Ellen.

89
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,988
We had the most
glorious meeting!

90
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:44,409
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained
herself to the wheel of
the Prime Minister´s carriage.

91
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:46,870
- You should´ve been there.
- Mrs Banks, I would like
a word with you.

92
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,498
And Mrs Ainslie, she was
carried off to prison...

93
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,667
singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

94
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,753
I´m glad you´re home, madam. I´ve
always given the best that´s in me--

95
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,421
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

96
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,966
I always knew you were one of us.

97
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:03,846
We´re clearly soldiers
in petticoats

98
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:07,850
And dauntless crusaders
for women´s votes

99
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,937
THougH we adore men
individually

100
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,692
We agree tHat as a group
tHey´re ratHer stupid

101
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:21,321
- Mrs Banks.
- Cast off tHe sHackles of yesterday

102
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:24,908
SHoulder to sHoulder
into tHe fray

103
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:28,662
Our daugHter´s daugHters
will adore us

104
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:32,958
And tHey´ll sing
in grateful cHorus

105
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,086
´´Well done
Sister Suffragette´´

106
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,339
Being that as it may, I do not
wish to offend, but I--

107
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:43,260
From Kensington to Billingsgate
one Hears tHe restless cries

108
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:47,181
From every corner of tHe land
womankind arise

109
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:51,143
Political equality
and equal rigHts witH men

110
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:55,731
Take Heart for Mrs PankHurst
Has been clapped in irons again

111
00:09:55,772 --> 00:10:01,778
No more tHe meek and mild
subservients we

112
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,450
We´re figHting for our rigHts
militantly

113
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,118
Never you fear

114
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,955
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

115
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:16,168
- So cast off tHe sHackles of yesterday
- Mrs Banks!

116
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:19,796
And sHoulder to sHoulder
into tHe fray

117
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,301
Our daugHter´s daugHters
will adore us

118
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:28,972
And tHey´ll sing
in grateful cHorus

119
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:31,141
- ´´Well done´´
- Mrs Banks.

120
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,018
- ´´Well done´´
- Mrs Banks.

121
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,479
- ´´Well done, Sister Suf--´´
- Mrs Banks!

122
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:40,859
- What is it, Katie Nanna?
- Mrs Banks, I have something
to say to you.

123
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:44,363
- Where are the children?
- The children, madam...

124
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:46,448
to be precise,
are not here.

125
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,450
They´ve disappeared again.

126
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:50,786
Katie Nanna, this is really
too careless of you.

127
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,829
Doesn´t it make
the third time this week?

128
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:56,792
The fourth, madam. And I for one
have had my fill of it.

129
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,252
I´m not one to speak ill
of the children, but--

130
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:00,712
Oh, please, when do you
expect them home?

131
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:04,716
I really couldn´t say.
And now if you´d be good enough
to compute my wages, I´ll--

132
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,137
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You´re not
leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

133
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,683
He´s going to be cross enough
as it is to come home and find
the children missing.

134
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:16,186
Ellen, put these things away. You know
how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

135
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,146
Yes, ma´am.

136
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:21,275
Katie Nanna, I beseech you.
Please reconsider.

137
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,944
Think of the children.
Think of Mr Banks.

138
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:26,697
He was just beginning
to get used to you.

139
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,410
Posts, everyone!

140
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:43,338
Four, three, two, one. Fire!

141
00:11:56,351 --> 00:12:00,355
-Katie Nanna, I do beseech you--
-My wages, if you please.

142
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,153
Bit early tonight,
aren´t you, Admiral?

143
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:09,489
Nonsense.
Bang on the dot, as usual.

144
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,867
How are things in
the world of finance?

145
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,371
Never better. Money´s sound.
Credit rates are moving up, up, up.

146
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:19,374
And the British pound is
the admiration of the world.

147
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,752
- Good man.
- How do things look
from where you stand?

148
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:24,379
Bit chancy, I´d say.

149
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:27,049
The wind´s coming up
and the glass is falling.

150
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,927
- Don´t like the look of it.
- Good, good, good.

151
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,806
Banks, shouldn´t wonder if you weren´t
steering into a nasty piece of weather.

152
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,684
Banks! Do you hear me?

153
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,564
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy.

154
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:44,733
Allow me.

155
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,320
Hmph!

156
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,364
What a very pretty hat.

157
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,542
I feel a surge
of deep satisfaction

158
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,462
MucH as a king astride His noble steed
Thank you.

159
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:09,925
WHen I return from daily strife
to HeartH and wife

160
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,845
How pleasant is
tHe life I lead

161
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,222
- Dear, it´s about the children.
- Yes, yes, yes.

162
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:19,101
I run my Home
precisely on scHedule

163
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:23,063
At 6::0 1 I marcH
tHrougH my door

164
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:27,025
My slippers, sHerry and pipe
are due at 6::02

165
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:29,945
Consistent is
tHe life I lead

166
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:33,115
- George, they´re missing.
- Splendid. Splendid.

167
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:36,952
It´s grand to be
an EnglisHman in 1 9 1 0

168
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:40,455
King Edward´s on tHe tHrone
It´s tHe Age of Men

169
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:44,459
I´m tHe lord of my castle
THe sovereign, tHe liege

170
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:48,046
I treat my subjects, servants
cHildren, wife

171
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,549
WitH a firm but gentle Hand
Noblesse oblige

172
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:54,428
It´s 6::03 and tHe Heirs
to my dominion

173
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:58,223
Are scrubbed and tubbed
and adequately fed

174
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:02,311
And so I´ll pat tHem on tHe Head
and send tHem off to bed

175
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:07,524
AH, lordly is
tHe life I lead

176
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:13,280
- Winifred, where are the children?
- They´re not here, dear.

177
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:16,825
What? Well, of course they´re here!
Where else would they be?

178
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:20,287
- I don´t know, George.
- You don´t know?

179
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:24,166
Well, they´re missing. Katie
Nanna has looked everywhere.

180
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,502
Very well. I´ll deal
with this at once.

181
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,966
Give me the police station,
quickly, please.

182
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:36,678
I don´t think we need bother the police,
dear. The facts of the matter--

183
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:38,722
Kindly do not attempt to
cloud the issue with facts.

184
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:42,935
One fact, and one fact alone
is crystal clear! Katie Nanna´s
faltered at her post.

185
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:46,230
She´s let the family down.
And I shall bring her to bo--

186
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:50,901
Oh. She´s left us,
hasn´t she?

187
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:53,278
Yes, dear, only just.

188
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:55,572
What, uh-- Yes.
George Banks here.

189
00:14:55,656 --> 00:15:00,035
Yes. 1 7 Cherry Tree Lane.
It´s a matter of some urgency.

190
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:03,497
I should like you to send
a policeman around immediately.

191
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,207
The policeman´s here, George!

192
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:09,378
What? Oh, how very prompt.
What wonderful service.

193
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,256
Thank you so much. Good night.

194
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,383
- Come in, Constable. Come in.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:17,135
While going about my duties
on the other side of the park...

196
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,221
I noted some valuables
that had gone astray.

197
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:21,723
- I believe they´re yours, sir.
- Valuables?

198
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:24,059
Come along, now. Come along.

199
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:29,606
Jane! Michael!

200
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,400
Winifred, please don´t
be emotional.

201
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:35,779
Oh, I wouldn´t be too hard on ´em, sir.
They´ve had a long, weary walk today.

202
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:38,282
Children, come here at once.

203
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:46,582
- Well?
- I´m sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

204
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:50,669
- You see, it was windy.
- And the kite was too strong for us.

205
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:54,673
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the
kite that ran away, not the children.

206
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:57,217
Thank you, Constable.
I think I can manage this.

207
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:02,097
Actually it wasn´t a very good kite.
We made it ourselves.

208
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,974
Perhaps if you helped us
to make one--

209
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:08,020
Ah, that´s the ticket, sir.
Kites are skittish things.

210
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:09,813
Why, only last week with
me own youngsters--

211
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:12,482
I´m very grateful to you,
Constable, for returning the children.

212
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:16,862
And I´m sure that
if you go to the kitchen,
Cook´ll find you a plate of something.

213
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:20,282
Thank you, sir.
I shall now return to my duties.

214
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,576
Thank you, Constable.

215
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:26,830
Good night, miss. Good night, ma´am.
Good night, sir.

216
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:29,208
Cook´ll find me something.
I never--

217
00:16:32,294 --> 00:16:35,464
I´m awfully sorry
about this, George.

218
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:37,716
I´ll expect you´ll want
to discuss it.

219
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,968
I would indeed!

220
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:42,429
Ellen, take Jane and Michael
upstairs straightaway.

221
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:45,807
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:50,854
I knew it. When all´s
said and done, who bears
the brunt of everything around here?

223
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,523
Me, that´s who!

224
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:56,235
They don´t want an honest,
hard-workin´ girl around here.

225
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:58,529
They need a ruddy zookeeper.

226
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:03,033
I´m sorry, dear, but when
I chose Katie Nanna...

227
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:05,118
I thought she would be
firm with the children.

228
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:07,204
She looked
so solemn and cross.

229
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:10,791
Winifred, never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

230
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:12,793
I´ll try to do better next time.

231
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:15,879
Next time? My dear, you´ve engaged
six nannies in the last four months!

232
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:19,716
- And they´ve all been
unqualified disasters.
- I quite agree.

233
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:22,803
Choosing a nanny for the children
is an important and delicate task.

234
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:28,308
It requires insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.

235
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:32,855
Under the circumstances,
I think it might be apropos
to take it upon myself to, uh...

236
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:34,940
select the next person.

237
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:37,568
- Oh, would you, George?
- Obviously the way to find
a proper nanny...

238
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:39,611
is to go about it
in a proper fashion.

239
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:42,573
I shall put an advertisement in
the Times: Take this down please.

240
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:44,575
- Yes, of course, dear.
- Wanted.

241
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,869
Uh, no. Uh, required.

242
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,082
Nanny: firm, respectable,
no nonsense.

243
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:55,961
A BritisH nanny
must be a general

244
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:59,590
THe future empire
lies witHin Her Hands

245
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:03,760
And so tHe person tHat we need
to mould tHe breed

246
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,930
Is a nanny
wHo can give commands

247
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:09,266
- You getting this, Winifred?
- Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

248
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:13,103
A BritisH bank
is run witH precision

249
00:18:13,187 --> 00:18:16,857
A BritisH Home
requires notHing less

250
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:21,778
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be tHe tools

251
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:26,366
WitHout tHem, disorder
catastropHe, anarcHy

252
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,827
In sHort you Have
a gHastly mess

253
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,539
Splendid, George! Inspirational.

254
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,583
The Times will be so pleased.

255
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,127
- Father?
- Yes?

256
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:39,671
We´ve discussed everything...

257
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:42,132
and we´re very sorry
about what we did today.

258
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:44,426
I should certainly think so.

259
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,179
- It was wrong to run away
from Katie Nanna.
- It was indeed.

260
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:49,515
And we do so want to get on
with the new nanny.

261
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:52,684
Very sensible. I shall be glad
to have your help in the matter.

262
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:55,812
We thought you would. That´s why
we wrote this advertisement.

263
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,273
- Advertisement for what?
- For the new nanny.

264
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:01,109
- You wrote an advert--
- George, I think we should listen.

265
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:05,405
- You said you wanted our help.
- But, I-- Oh, very well.

266
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,909
"Wanted: a nanny
for two adorable children.´´

267
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:11,620
"Adorable.´´ Well, that´s
debatable, I must say.

268
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:16,041
If you want tHis cHoice position

269
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:20,379
Have a cHeery disposition

270
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:24,967
-Jane, I don´t--
- Rosy cHeeks, no warts

271
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,847
- That´s the part I put in.
- Play games, all sorts

272
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,810
You must be kind
You must be witty

273
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:38,814
Very sweet
and fairly pretty

274
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,148
- Well, of all the ridic--
- George, please!

275
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,486
Take us on outings
Give us treats

276
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:48,282
Sing songs
Bring sweets

277
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:51,368
Never be cross or cruel

278
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:57,332
Never give us
castor oil or gruel

279
00:19:57,374 --> 00:20:01,211
Love us as a son and daugHter

280
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:06,216
And never smell of barley water

281
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:09,678
I put that in too.

282
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,266
If you won´t scold
and dominate us

283
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:20,105
We will never you give you
cause to Hate us

284
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:25,152
We won´t Hide your spectacles
so you can´t see

285
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:30,824
Put toads in your bed
or pepper in your tea

286
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:34,244
Hurry, Nanny

287
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:39,166
Many tHanks
Sincerely

288
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:43,212
Jane and MicHael Banks

289
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:46,256
Thank you. Most interesting.

290
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:48,050
And now I think we´ve had
quite enough of this nonsense.

291
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:51,136
Please return
to the nursery.

292
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,442
They were only trying to help.
They´re just children.

293
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:07,528
I´m well aware they´re
just children, Winifred.

294
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:10,405
I only congratulate myself that
I decided to step in and take a hand.

295
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:13,951
"Play games, sing songs,
give treats.´´

296
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:17,579
Ridiculous. There´s no question
in my mind whatsoever.

297
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,873
Now is the time for action.

298
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:25,587
Give me the Times, please.
No, I do not know the number.

299
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:28,298
Oh, George, you´re always
so forceful.

300
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,467
The Times?
George Banks here.

301
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:34,763
1 7 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place
an advertisement in your column.

302
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:55,409
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

303
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:58,036
I´ll take the report,
Mr Binnacle.

304
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,082
The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin´ in from a new quarter.

305
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:04,877
- So it is.
- Sir?
- What is it?

306
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,046
Bit of somethin´ or other
taking place off the port bow.

307
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:14,052
Ghastly looking crew,
I must say!

308
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:25,272
Coo! There´s a fair queue of nannies
outside, sir. Shall I show ´em in?

309
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:28,734
Ellen, I said 8:00, and
8:00 it shall jolly well be.

310
00:22:28,817 --> 00:22:30,777
You see?
Twelve seconds to go.

311
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:33,822
- Ten, nine, eight--
- Posts!

312
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:37,409
Seven, six, five, four...

313
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:39,870
three, two, one!

314
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:43,332
Ellen, it is now 8:00.

315
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:47,586
Yes, sir.

316
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,506
But I have told you
time and time again, Ellen...

317
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:53,300
I dislike being hurried
into things.

318
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:57,888
I don´t understand. They´re not
what we advertised for at all.

319
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,481
Michael, look!

320
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:57,698
Perhaps it´s a witch.

321
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:00,158
Of course not.
Witches have brooms.

322
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:20,470
It´s her. It´s the person. She´s
answered our advertisement.

323
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:23,891
Rosy cheeks and everything.

324
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,064
Ellen, you may now show them in,
one at a time.

325
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:33,066
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:39,615
- You may come in one at a time.
- Thank you.

327
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:41,617
Oh.

328
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,956
You are the father of Jane
and Michael Banks, are you not?

329
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:52,961
I said, you are the father
of Jane and Michael Banks.

330
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,589
Well, well ye--
Yes, of course, I mean. Uh--

331
00:24:55,631 --> 00:24:57,716
You brought your references,
I presume. May I see them?

332
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,927
Oh, I make it a point
never to give references.

333
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,054
A very old-fashioned idea
to my mind.

334
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:05,015
Is that so? We´ll have to see
about that then, won´t we?

335
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:08,560
Now then, the qualifications.

336
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:11,355
"Item one:
a cheery disposition.´´

337
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:13,357
I am never cross.

338
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:16,401
"Item two: rosy cheeks.´´

339
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:18,028
Obviously.

340
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,907
"Item three:
Play games, all sorts.´´

341
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,576
Well, I´m sure the children will find
my games extremely diverting.

342
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,163
May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you
get it from? I thought I tore it up.

343
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:32,209
Excuse me. "Item four:
You must be kind.´´

344
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:35,504
I am kind,
but extremely firm.

345
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:37,798
- Have you lost something?
- Ah! Yeah.

346
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,801
That paper, you see.
I thought that I--

347
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:43,428
- You are George Banks, are you not?
- What?

348
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:46,557
And you did advertise
for a nanny, did you not?

349
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,351
- George Banks.
- Very well then.

350
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,397
I tore it up,
turned it over.

351
00:25:53,438 --> 00:25:55,691
Tore it up again
and threw it in there. Yes.

352
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:57,776
I beg your pardon.
Are you ill?

353
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,572
I hope not.

354
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:04,908
Now, about my wages.
The reference here is very obscure.

355
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,578
- Very obscure.
- We must be very clear on
that point, mustn´t we?

356
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:10,330
- Yes, we must indeed.
- I shall require
every second Tuesday off.

357
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:12,624
Every Tuesday.

358
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,214
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

359
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:29,975
Hmm. I´ll give you one week.
I´ll know by then.

360
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:35,189
I´ll see the children now.
Thank you.

361
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:53,415
Close your mouth please,
Michael. We are not a codfish.

362
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:58,962
Well, don´t stand there staring.
Best foot forward.

363
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:01,048
Spit spot!

364
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,219
- George?
- Aah!

365
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,262
George, what on earth
are you doing?

366
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:10,516
- I thought you were
interviewing nannies.
- I was! I was!

367
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,392
You mean you´ve
selected one already?

368
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,229
- Yes, it´s done. It´s, it´s all done.
- Well, where is she?

369
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:17,940
What? Well, eh, she´s in
the nursery of course, I mean.

370
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:20,567
-I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
-How clever of you!

371
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:23,654
I would have muddled
the whole thing.

372
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:27,991
Tell me, is she everything
that we´d hoped she´d be?

373
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:31,912
Well, i-it all happened rather
quickly. I mean, I-- I, uh--

374
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:34,373
Will she be firm?
Will she give commands?

375
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:37,960
Will she mould our young breed?

376
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:40,587
You know, Winifred,
I think she will.

377
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:43,924
- I think she will.
- In that case...

378
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:47,177
perhaps you´d better tell Ellen
to dismiss the others.

379
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:51,849
- The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
- Y-Yes, sir?

380
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:55,060
Tell the other applicants they may go.
The position has been filled.

381
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:58,397
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

382
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,360
How many nannies does she
think we need in this house?

383
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:09,241
The position
has been filled.

384
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:18,250
I´m afraid the nursery
isn´t very tidy.

385
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,544
It is rather like
a bear pit, isn´t it?

386
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:23,172
- That´s a funny sort of bag.
- Carpet.

387
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:25,340
- You mean to carry carpets in?
- No. Made of.

388
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:29,761
This is your room, and there´s
a lovely view of the park.

389
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:32,598
Hmm.

390
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:35,142
Well, it´s not exactly
Buckingham Palace.

391
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:41,064
Still, it´s clean.

392
00:28:41,148 --> 00:28:43,734
Yes, I think it will be
quite suitable.

393
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:45,736
Just needs a touch
here and there.

394
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:49,740
Well, first things first.

395
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:53,660
I always say, the place
to hang a hat is on a hat stand.

396
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,261
Ah! This will never do!

397
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:20,312
I much prefer seeing
all of my face at the same time.

398
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:24,358
There-- But there was
nothing in it.

399
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,528
Never judge things
by their appearance.

400
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:30,155
Even carpetbags.
I´m sure I never do.

401
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:39,414
A thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

402
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:47,339
Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

403
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,186
We better keep an eye
on this one.

404
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,981
- She´s tricky.
- She´s wonderful.

405
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:06,650
Much better!

406
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:09,778
Now, let me see.

407
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,788
That´s funny. I always carry it with me.
It must be here somewhere.

408
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:21,790
- What?
- My tape measure.

409
00:30:21,832 --> 00:30:25,002
- What do you want it for?
- I want to see how you two measure up.

410
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,136
Well, that´s the funniest thing I ever
saw. I know it´s down here somewhere.

411
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:37,097
Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha!
Here it is.

412
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:40,517
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

413
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,395
Head up, Michael. Don´t slouch.

414
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:49,860
Just as I thought.
Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

415
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:52,863
- I am not!
- See for yourself.

416
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:57,659
"Extremely stubborn
and sus--´´

417
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,204
Suspicious.

418
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:02,414
Now you,Jane.

419
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:08,504
Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn´t put things away.´´

420
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:12,049
How ´bout you?

421
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:14,760
Very well. Hold this for me.

422
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:22,017
As I expected. "Mary Poppins.

423
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,187
Practically perfect
in every way.´´

424
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:29,191
Mary Poppins! Is that your name?
It´s lovely.

425
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,652
Thank you.
I´ve always liked it.

426
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:34,154
- Now, shall we get on with it?
- Get on with what?

427
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:37,533
In your advertisement, did you
not specifically request to play games?

428
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,117
- Oh, yes!
- Very well, then.

429
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,955
Our first game is called
"Well Begun Is Half Done.´´

430
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:44,456
I don´t like
the sound of that.

431
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,709
Otherwise entitled,
"Let´s Tidy Up the Nursery.´´

432
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:50,045
I told you
she was tricky.

433
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:56,009
- Shall we begin?
- It is a game, isn´t it, Mary Poppins?

434
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:58,804
Well, it depends on
your point of view.

435
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,598
You see, in every job
that must be done...

436
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,809
there is an element of fun.

437
00:32:03,892 --> 00:32:07,229
You find the fun, and snap!

438
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:09,565
The job´s a game.

439
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:14,403
And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake

440
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:16,738
A lark, a spree

441
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:20,659
It´s very clear to see

442
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:25,372
THat a spoonful of sugar

443
00:32:25,455 --> 00:32:28,041
Helps tHe medicine go down

444
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:32,171
THe medicine go down
Medicine go down

445
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:37,176
Just a spoonful of sugar
Helps tHe medicine go down

446
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,513
In a most deligHtful way

447
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:50,189
A robin featHering His nest
Has very little time to rest

448
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:54,359
WHile gatHering His bits
of twine and twig

449
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:58,989
THougH quite intent in His pursuit
He Has a merry tune to toot

450
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:04,453
He knows a song
will move tHejob along

451
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:19,218
For a spoonful of sugar
Helps tHe medicine go down

452
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:23,597
THe medicine go down
Medicine go down

453
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,310
Just a spoonful of sugar
Helps tHe medicine go down

454
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:32,731
In a most deligHtful way

455
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:38,172
THe Honeybees tHat fetcH tHe nectar
from tHe flowers to tHe comb

456
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:41,967
Never tire of ever buzzing
to and fro

457
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:46,847
Because tHey take a little nip
from every flower tHat tHey sip

458
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,433
-And Hence
-And Hence

459

- THey find

460
00:34:51,935 --> 00:34:56,773
THeir task is not a grind

461
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,326
Cheeky.

462
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:12,456
Don´t be all day
about it, please.

463
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:42,861
Let me out!
Let me out!

464
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:57,167
Let me out!

465
00:35:57,209 --> 00:35:59,169
Well, that was very--

466
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:01,880
Thank you now--

467
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,342
When you´ve quite finished!

468
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:09,179
Thank you.

469
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,561
That will be quite sufficient.
Hats and coats, please.

470
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,396
It´s time for our outing
in the park.

471
00:36:17,437 --> 00:36:20,983
I don´t want an outing. I want
to tidy up the nursery again.

472
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:23,402
Enough is as good as a feast.
Come along, please.

473
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,738
Let me look at you. Well, you´re not
as well turned out as I´d like.

474
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,283
Still, there´s time.
There´s time.

475
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:33,370
Spit spot! And off we go.

476
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:37,583
For a spoonful of sugar

00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:48,760
In tHe most

CHim cHiminy, CHim cHiminy
CHim cHim cHeroo

481
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,673
I does wHat I likes
And I likes

482
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:30,469
WHat I do

483
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,472
Hello, art lovers.

484
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:36,975
Today I´m a screever
and as you can see

485
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:39,895
A screever´s an artist

486
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:43,440
Of HigHest degree

487
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:47,694
And it´s all me own work
from me own memory

488
00:37:49,238 --> 00:37:51,740
Well, not Royal Academy,
I suppose.

489
00:37:51,823 --> 00:37:53,450
Still they´re better than
a finger in your eye, ain´t they?

490
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:57,538
CHim cHiminy, CHim cHiminy
CHim cHim cHeroo

491
00:37:57,621 --> 00:38:01,667
I draws wHat I likes
and I likes wHat I drew

492
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,340
No remuneration
do I ask of you

493
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:12,219
But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

494
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:16,431
Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

495
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:27,442
Wait! Don´t move.

496
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:30,696
Don´t move a muscle.

497
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:34,157
Stay right where you are.

498
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:40,038
I´d know that silhouette
anywhere! Mary Poppins!

499
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:44,251
It´s nice to see you again, Bert.
I expect you know Jane and Michael.

500
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:48,046
Well, I´ve seen ´em here and about.
Chasin´ a kite last time, weren´t it?

501
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:51,300
Mary Poppins is
taking us to the park.

502
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:55,762
To the park?
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

503
00:38:55,846 --> 00:38:57,890
Other nannies take children
to the park.

504
00:38:57,973 --> 00:39:02,394
When you´re with Mary Poppins,
suddenly you´re in places
you´ve never dreamed of.

505
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:04,438
And quick as you can say
"Bob´s your uncle´´...

506
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:07,274
the most unusual things
begin to happen.

507
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:09,818
I´m sure I haven´t the faintest
idea what you´re talking about.

508
00:39:09,902 --> 00:39:13,572
Well mind, it´s not my place to say,
but what she´s probably got in mind...

509
00:39:13,614 --> 00:39:16,533
is a jolly holiday
somewheres or other.

510
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:19,995
Something along these lines,
I shouldn´t be surprised.

511
00:39:20,078 --> 00:39:23,457
"Punting on the Thames.´´ That´s
always good if you like an outing.

512
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:25,501
Here we go.

513
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:39,723
The circus. How about a lovely
circus? Lions and tigers.

514
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:42,935
World-famous artistes performing
death-defyin´ feats...

515
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:45,687
of dexterity and skill
before your very eyes.

516
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:48,315
Ta-da!

517
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,044
Ta-da!

518
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:16,510
Oh, that´s lovely. If you please,
I´d much rather go there.

519
00:40:16,593 --> 00:40:19,596
Beautiful, ain´t it?
A typical English countryside...

520
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,182
as done by a true
and lovin´ hand.

521
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:25,102
Though you can´t see it,
there´s a little country fair...

522
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:28,522
down that road and
uh, over the hill.

523
00:40:28,564 --> 00:40:30,941
I don´t see any road.

524
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:32,985
What? No road?

525
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:39,032
Just wants a bit
of somethin´ here...

526
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:45,289
and a bit of somethin´ there.

527
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:50,210
There. A country road suitable
for travel and high adventure.

528
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,796
Please may we go,
Mary Poppins? Please?

529
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:56,592
Such a lovely place. Don´t you
think it´s lovely, Mary Poppins?

530
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:59,303
Now´s the time, Mary Poppins.
No one´s lookin´.

531
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,513
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

532
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:05,392
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself, thank you.

533
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:08,478
All right, I´ll do it myself.

534
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:11,690
- Do what?
- Bit of magic.

535
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:13,817
- A bit of magic?
- It´s easy.

536
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,445
Let´s see. You think.

537
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,907
You wink.

538
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,034
You do a double blink.

539
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:26,371
You close your eyes and jump.

540
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:33,754
Is something
´sposed to happen?

541
00:41:33,837 --> 00:41:37,132
Bert, what utter nonsense!

542
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:42,054
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

543
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:44,389
Give my your hand, please,
Michael. Don´t slouch.

544
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:46,558
One, two.

545
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:06,495
Mary Poppins,
you look beautiful.

546
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:10,624
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart you do.
Like the day I met ya.

547
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:13,043
You look fine too, Bert.

548
00:42:13,168 --> 00:42:15,420
I thought you said
there was a fair.

549
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:18,799
So I did. Down the road
behind the hill, remember?

550
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:22,135
Come on! I hear
the merry-go-round.

551
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:25,264
- Tell ´em Bert sent ya.
- Don´t fall and smudge the drawing.

552
00:42:30,143 --> 00:42:32,187
Ain´t it a glorious day

553
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:34,314
RigHt as a mornin´ in May

554
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:37,568
I feel like I could fly

555
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:40,946
Now, Bert.
None of your larking about.

556
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:45,409
Have you ever seen
tHe grass so green

557
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:49,329
Or a bluer sky

558
00:42:51,248 --> 00:42:56,170
OH, it´s a jolly Holiday witH Mary

559
00:42:56,253 --> 00:43:00,632
- Mary makes your Heart so ligHt
- You haven´t changed a bit, have you?

560
00:43:00,716 --> 00:43:04,928
WHen tHe day is grey
and ordinary

561
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,932
- Mary makes tHe sun sHine brigHt
- Oh, honestly!

562
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:13,729
OH, Happiness is bloomin´
all around Her

563
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:17,941
THe daffodils are

564
00:43:17,983 --> 00:43:22,279
WHen Mary Holds your Hand

00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:26,700

- You are lightheaded.

OH, it´s a jolly Holiday

569
00:43:57,606 --> 00:44:01,693

00:44:14,998 --> 00:44:18,794
THe daffodils are smiling at tHe dove
Oink, oink.

- Thank you.

579
00:46:24,753 --> 00:46:29,466
OH, it´s a jolly Holiday
witH you, Bert

580
00:46:29,508 --> 00:46:33,804
- Gentlemen like you are few
- A vanishing breed, that´s me.

581
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:38,267
THougH you´rejust
a diamond in tHe rougH, Bert

582
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:42,437
- UnderneatH your blood is blue
- Common knowledge.

583
00:46:42,521 --> 00:46:46,775
You´ d never tHink of pressing
your advantage

584
00:46:46,817 --> 00:46:51,154
- Forbearance is
tHe Hallmark of your creed
- True.

585
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:55,450
A lady needn´t fear
wHen you are near

586
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:59,830
Your sweet gentility
is crystal clear

Now then, what´d be nice?

You´re very kind.

597
00:48:01,183 --> 00:48:04,186
Anything for you,

Mavis and Sybil

Very nice.
Very nice, indeed...

621
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:57,628
if you don´t wanna go nowhere.

622
00:51:57,711 --> 00:52:01,340
Who says we´re not
going anywhere?

623
00:52:01,423 --> 00:52:02,841
Oh, guard!

624
00:52:03,675 --> 00:52:06,845
Righto, Mary Poppins.

00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:08,722
Thank you.

626
00:52:21,443 --> 00:52:24,238
They´re off! It´s Mary Poppins
leadin´ by two lengths.

627
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:26,365
Jane is second by a length.
Michael third.

628
00:52:49,972 --> 00:52:52,266
My horse is the fastest.

629
00:52:52,307 --> 00:52:55,894
Do you hear that, mate?
Do you wanna put up with that?

630
00:52:55,978 --> 00:53:00,274
That´s the ticket! Come on, my lad.
Is that the best you can do?

631
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:01,692
Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

632
00:53:01,775 --> 00:53:05,863
Not so fast, please. Michael!

633
00:53:05,946 --> 00:53:08,490
Now really, Bert.
You´re as bad as the children.

634
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,577
Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!

00:53:17,624 --> 00:53:20,961
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.

637
00:53:21,003 --> 00:53:25,132
Please control yourself.
We are not on a racecourse.

638
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:33,182
Follow me, please.

Poor lit´l bloke.
Let´s give him a hand.

651
00:54:37,663 --> 00:54:40,165
Saints preserve us!

652
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:42,167
Yikes!

653
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:46,380
Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!

654
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,808
Up you go. Now hang on.

655
00:55:01,103 --> 00:55:05,190
Would you look at that now?
´Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

656
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:09,653
Come on and fight,
you dirty omadhauns.

657
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:12,281
I can lick
the lot of ya´s.

658
00:55:12,364 --> 00:55:15,617
Faster, me beauty! Faster!

659
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:08,962
Oh, riders, would you be
so kind as to let me pass?

660
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:11,840
Certainly, ma´am.

661
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:14,343
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma´am.

662
00:56:29,525 --> 00:56:31,485
Excellent time, gentlemen.

663
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:34,363
- Oh, yes, quite.
- Perfect day for it, of course.

664
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,326
Oh. Oh, how nice.

665
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:44,498
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

666
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,085
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

667
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:50,712
Hold still, now.
Watch for the dickie bird.

668
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:54,967
Uh, how does it feel,
Mary Poppins, winning the race?

669
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:57,261
- Oh, well I--
- Gaining fame and fortune.

670
00:56:57,344 --> 00:57:00,013
- Uh, Yes.
- Having your picture taken
for the newspaper.

671
00:57:00,055 --> 00:57:01,515
Uh, oh, actually,
I´m delighted.

672
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:04,101
Besides having your extreme
good looks, if I may say so.

673
00:57:04,184 --> 00:57:07,521
- Oh, well, I wouldn´t go--
- There probably aren´t words
to describe your emotions.

674
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:10,148
Now, now, now, now,
gentlemen, please.

675
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,651
On the contrary,
there´s a very good word.

676
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:15,195
- Am I right, Bert?
- Tell ´em what it is.

677
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:17,197
Right!

678
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:21,827
It´s supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

679
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:24,997
Even tHougH tHe sound of it

680
00:57:25,038 --> 00:57:28,208
If you say it loud enougH

dociousaliexpiistic-fragilcalirupus.

705
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:41,698
- But that´s going a bit too far,
don´t you think?
- Indubitably.

706
00:58:41,782 --> 00:58:44,076
So wHen tHe cat Has got your tongue

But better use it carefully
or it could cHange your life

709
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:51,917
- For example.
- Yes?

710
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:55,462
One night I said it to me girl,

711
00:58:55,546 --> 00:59:00,008
Ow! And a lovely thing

Stay close now.

718
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:36,837
Oh, Bert,

719
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:40,132
Well, there´s more
where they came from.

720
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:44,178
Meantime, I´m changing businesses. This

No, no, I won´t take
your nasty medicine!

727
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:23,759
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

728
01:00:23,842 --> 01:00:27,221
People who get their feet wet
must learn to take their medicine.

729
01:00:31,183 --> 01:00:34,478
- I don´t want it. I´m not gonna--
- Oh!

730
01:00:45,197 --> 01:00:47,449
Lime cordial! Delicious!

731
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:50,285
Strawberry! Mmm!

732
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:57,376
R-R-Rum punch.

733
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:59,461
Quite satisfactory.

734
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:04,758
Mary Poppins, you won´t
ever leave us, will you?

735
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,053
- Do you have a handkerchief
under your pillow?
- Mm-hmm.

736
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:09,888
Will you stay
if we promise to be good?

737
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:13,851
Och! That´s a piecrust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.

738
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:16,603
Whatever would
we do without you?

739
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:19,565
I shall stay
until the wind changes.

740
01:01:19,606 --> 01:01:21,900
But, Mary Poppins,
how long will that be?

741
01:01:21,942 --> 01:01:24,111
Silence, please.
It´s time to go to sleep.

742
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:28,448
Oh, we couldn´t possibly go to sleep! So
many lovely things have happened today.

743
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,368
- Did they?
- Yes! When we jumped into
Bert´s chalk picture.

744
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:34,204
And we rode the merry-go-round,
and all the horses jumped off, and--

745
01:01:34,288 --> 01:01:36,456
And we all went riding
in the countryside!

746
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:40,419
- Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
- Really?

747
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,797
Mary Poppins, don´t you remember?
You won the horse race!

748
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:47,968
A respectable person like me in a horse
race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

749
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,470
But I saw you do it!

750
01:01:50,554 --> 01:01:54,141
Now, not another word or I shall have
to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

751
01:01:54,183 --> 01:01:56,226
It did happen! I saw it!

752
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:59,479
- Go to sleep.
- No, I don´t want to go to sleep.

753
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:02,149
Mary Poppins,
we´re much too excited!

754
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:03,609
Very well, suit yourselves.

755
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:08,488
Stay awake

756
01:02:08,572 --> 01:02:13,410
Don´t rest your Head

757
01:02:13,493 --> 01:02:16,872
Don´t lie down

758
01:02:16,955 --> 01:02:22,127
Upon your bed

759
01:02:22,169 --> 01:02:26,757
WHile tHe moon drifts

760
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,637
In tHe skies

761
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:36,350
Stay awake

762
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:45,234
Don´t close your eyes

763
01:02:45,317 --> 01:02:48,237
THougH tHe world

764
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:53,033
Is fast asleep

765
01:02:53,075 --> 01:02:57,371
THougH your pillow´s

766
01:02:57,412 --> 01:03:01,625
Soft and deep

767
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:05,546
You´re not sleepy

768
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:09,967
As you seem

769
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:15,222
Stay awake

770
01:03:15,264 --> 01:03:18,058
Don´t nod

771
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:23,730
And dream

772
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:28,610
Stay awake

773
01:03:29,903 --> 01:03:34,199
Don´t nod

774
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:39,204
And

775
01:03:39,246 --> 01:03:43,542
Dream

776
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,349
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle.
Glorious!

777
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:03,312
No one sleeps this morning.
Put in a double charge of powder.

778
01:04:03,395 --> 01:04:05,772
A double charge?
Aye, aye, sir.

779
01:04:05,856 --> 01:04:08,901
Shake things up a bit, what?

780
01:04:10,444 --> 01:04:13,614
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma´am.

781
01:04:13,697 --> 01:04:16,825
- Have you put the spoiled eggs
in my carryall?
- Yes, ma´am.

782
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:19,995
After our meeting at the Albert Hall,
we´re all going to Downing Street...

783
01:04:20,078 --> 01:04:23,457
to throw things
at the Prime Minister.

784
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,793
Oh, how distinguished
you look this morning, George.

785
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:29,087
What´s all that fearful
caterwauling in the kitchen?

786
01:04:29,129 --> 01:04:32,841
- It´s Cook singing.
- Cook singing? What´s wrong with her?

787
01:04:32,925 --> 01:04:36,303
She´s happy as a cricket.
As a matter of fact...

788
01:04:36,345 --> 01:04:39,306
since you hired Mary Poppins,
the most extraordinary thing...

789
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,558
- seems to have come over the household.
- Is that so?

790
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:44,811
Take Ellen for instance.
She hasn´t broken a dish all morning.

791
01:04:44,895 --> 01:04:47,439
- Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
- And another thing.

792
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:51,485
She and Cook usually fight like
cats and dogs, but today--

793
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:55,197
- Let me hold the door
for you, Ellen dear.
- Thanks ever so, ducks.

794
01:05:03,038 --> 01:05:05,707
Ellen, stop making
that offensive noise!

795
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:10,045
And shut the window!
That bird´s giving me a headache.

796
01:05:10,128 --> 01:05:12,673
Yes, sir.

797
01:05:17,344 --> 01:05:20,347
Quiet! You´re giving
the master an headache.

798
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:25,853
I´m so sorry you´re not feeling
well this morning, George.

799
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:28,438
Who said I´m not feeling well?
I´m fit as a fiddle.

800
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:31,358
I just don´t understand why everyone´s
so confoundedly cheerful!

801
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,486
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

802
01:05:34,528 --> 01:05:38,323
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

803
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:42,119
- Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
- How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

804
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:45,747
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

805
01:05:45,831 --> 01:05:48,041
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

806
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,627
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Good morning, Father.

807
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:53,547
- Good morning.
- Mary Poppins taught us
the most wonderful words.

808
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:56,758
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

809
01:05:56,842 --> 01:05:59,636
What on earth are you
talking about? Supercali--

810
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,555
Super-- Or whatever
the infernal thing is.

811
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:03,849
It´s something to say
when you don´t know what to say.

812
01:06:03,891 --> 01:06:06,602
Yes, well, I always know what to say.
Go on, hurry along, please.

813
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:11,440
Yes, Father.
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

814
01:06:11,523 --> 01:06:16,153
Winifred, will you be good enough
to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

815
01:06:16,236 --> 01:06:18,947
I don´t think there´s anything
to explain. Do you?

816
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:21,491
It´s obvious that you´re
out of sorts this morning.

817
01:06:21,575 --> 01:06:23,493
The children just came in
to make you feel better.

818
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:26,163
I should like to make one thing
quite clear, once and for all.

819
01:06:26,246 --> 01:06:29,499
I am not out of sorts.
I am in a perfectly equable mood.

820
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:32,377
I do not require
being made to feel better!

821
01:06:32,419 --> 01:06:36,006
But you´re always saying that you wanted
a cheerful and pleasant household.

822
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:38,884
Winifred, I should like to make
a slight differentiation...

823
01:06:38,926 --> 01:06:41,512
between the word cheerful and
just plain giddy irresponsibility.

824
01:06:41,595 --> 01:06:45,766
Excuse me, dear.
Posts, everyone, please!

825
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:48,435
I have no objection to anyone
being cheerful or pleasant.

826
01:06:48,477 --> 01:06:50,437
But I do expect
a certain decorum.

827
01:06:50,479 --> 01:06:53,398
I can tell you one thing, Winifred.
I don´t propose standing idly by...

828
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,902
and letting that woman, Mary Poppins,
undermine the discipline and--

829
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,406
There´s something odd,
I may say extremely odd...

830
01:07:01,448 --> 01:07:04,034
about the behaviour of this household
since that woman arrived.

831
01:07:04,117 --> 01:07:07,621
- And I want you to know
that I´ve noticed it!
- Yes, dear.

832
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:13,126
- One thing more.
- Yes, dear?

833
01:07:13,168 --> 01:07:15,128
I suggest you have
this piano repaired.

834
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:18,298
When I sit down to an instrument,
I like to have it in tune.

835
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:21,343
But, George, you don´t play.

836
01:07:21,426 --> 01:07:25,138
Madam, that is entirely
beside the point!

837
01:07:38,443 --> 01:07:42,614
Now, let me see. First of all,
we must go to the piano tuners.

838
01:07:42,656 --> 01:07:45,325
And then we go to Mrs Cory´s sh--

839
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:48,996
Mrs Cory´s shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!

840
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,582
And then we go to the fishmonger´s,
I think, for a nice dover sole...

841
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:53,083
and a pint of prawns.

842
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:56,086
Uh, Michael,
stop stravaging along behind.

843
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,839
Ahoy, there! Ahoy!

844
01:08:00,465 --> 01:08:03,343
- Good day to you!
- Good morning, Admiral.

845
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:08,682
Michael, what fine adventure
are we off upon today?

846
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:12,519
Going to fight the Hottentots?
Dig for buried treasure?

847
01:08:12,561 --> 01:08:14,771
We´re going to buy some fish.

848
01:08:14,855 --> 01:08:18,192
Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

849
01:08:18,275 --> 01:08:20,277
Aye, aye, sir.

850
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,404
Let´s put our backs
into it, lad.

851
01:08:22,487 --> 01:08:26,200
More spit and polish.
That´s what´s wanted around here.

852
01:08:28,243 --> 01:08:30,370
It´s Andrew!

853
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:36,043
Uh, not so fast, please. I can´t
understand a word you´re saying.

854
01:08:38,754 --> 01:08:42,758
Again? Och!
Oh, the poor man!

855
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:53,185
Bless you.

856
01:08:55,896 --> 01:08:59,316
Well, yes, of course. There´s not
a moment to lose. I´ll go straightaway.

857
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,236
And thank you very much.

858
01:09:02,277 --> 01:09:04,571
- What did he say?
- He said, "You´re welcome.´´

859
01:09:04,655 --> 01:09:07,908
-What else did he say?
-I don´t think he said anything.

860
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:10,118
You know best, as usual.

861
01:09:10,202 --> 01:09:15,082
- I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
- There´s been a change of plans.

862
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:19,962
Come along, please.
Don´t straggle.

2
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,390
Andrew, worrying
won´t help anyone.

3
01:09:31,485 --> 01:09:33,359
Why don´t you go home
and put your feet up?

4
01:09:45,373 --> 01:09:48,540
- Oh, Bert, I´m glad you´re here.
- I came over the moment I heard.

5
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:50,619
Well, how is he?

6
01:09:50,712 --> 01:09:53,547
- I´ve never seen him as bad
as this, and that´s the truth.
- Oh!

7
01:09:53,631 --> 01:09:55,838
How about them?
It´s contagious, you know.

8
01:09:55,884 --> 01:09:58,588
- Shall we get spots?
- Oh, highly unlikely.

9
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:04,635
- Oh, Uncle Albert!
- Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.

10
01:10:04,725 --> 01:10:08,177
It´s Mary Poppins!
I´m delight--

11
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:11,598
- I´m delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!

12
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,477
Oh, I kn-- I know, I--

13
01:10:14,568 --> 01:10:18,269
But I tried.
Really, I did, my dear. I--

14
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:22,147
But I so enjoy laughing,
you know? And, well--

15
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:25,860
And when I start,
it´s all up with the--

16
01:10:25,912 --> 01:10:28,700
That´s what happens to me.

17
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:31,868
I love to laugh!
Oh, my goodness!

18
01:10:31,918 --> 01:10:35,453
I can´t help it. You can see that.

19
01:10:35,547 --> 01:10:39,247
I just like laughing,
that´s all.

20
01:10:39,342 --> 01:10:43,256
Jane, don´t you dare!
You´ll only make him worse.

21
01:10:43,346 --> 01:10:47,924
- It´s really quite serious!
- Yes, whatever you do,
keep a straight face.

22
01:10:48,017 --> 01:10:51,267
Last time, it took us
three days to get him down.

23
01:10:53,689 --> 01:10:55,729
I love to laugH

24
01:10:57,568 --> 01:11:01,233
Loud and long and clear

25
01:11:01,322 --> 01:11:03,398
I love to laugH

26
01:11:05,409 --> 01:11:07,485
It´s getting worse every year

27
01:11:08,954 --> 01:11:12,204
THe more I laugH

28
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:15,327
THe more I fill witH glee

29
01:11:15,377 --> 01:11:17,832
- You´re no help at all.
- THe more tHe glee

30
01:11:19,798 --> 01:11:22,086
THe more I´m a merrier me

31
01:11:23,343 --> 01:11:25,335
It´s embarrassing.

32
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:28,678
THe more I´m a merrier me

33
01:11:34,812 --> 01:11:38,430
Some people laugH
tHrougH tHeir noses

34
01:11:38,524 --> 01:11:40,849
Sounding sometHing like tHis

35
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:45,353
Dreadful!

36
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:49,611
Some people laugH tHrougH
tHeir teetH, goodness sakes

37
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:52,193
Hissing and fizzing like snakes

38
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:56,742
Not at all attractive
to my way of thinking.

39
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,577
Some laugH too fast

40
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:04,462

41
01:12:06,259 --> 01:12:08,964
OtHers, tHey twitter like birds

42
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:13,799
You know, you´re as bad as he is.

strike me as funny

45
01:12:28,364 --> 01:12:31,281
I can´t Hide it inside and squeak

46
01:12:32,785 --> 01:12:36,284
As tHe squeakelers do

47
01:12:36,372 --> 01:12:42,244
I´ve got to let go

How nice!

51
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:53,635
I was hoping you´d turn up.

52
01:12:53,722 --> 01:12:56,213
- Turn up!
- We always have such a jolly time.

53
01:12:58,226 --> 01:13:01,227
We love to laugH

54
01:13:03,314 --> 01:13:06,766
Loud and long and clear

55
01:13:06,818 --> 01:13:10,602
We love to laugH

56
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:14,112
So everybody can Hear

57
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:16,827
THe more you laugH

58
01:13:16,911 --> 01:13:19,449
Whoops, don´t you two start.
Come back down here.

59
01:13:19,538 --> 01:13:21,827
THe more you fill witH glee

60
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:25,664
THe more tHe glee

THe more we´re a merrier we

62
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:38,263
Oh, welcome, children! Welcome!
Make yourselves comfortable.

63
01:13:38,306 --> 01:13:41,260
That´s right.
Pull up a chair.

64
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:43,101
Oh, pull up--

65
01:13:43,144 --> 01:13:46,311
I must say, you´re a sight,
the lot of you!

66
01:13:46,397 --> 01:13:50,181
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

67
01:13:50,276 --> 01:13:52,648
He´s got a nice cushy job
in a watch factory.

68
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:54,818
In a watch factory?
What does he do?

69
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:58,156
He stands about all day
and makes faces!

70
01:14:01,245 --> 01:14:04,412
He makes faces
in a watch fact--

71
01:14:05,624 --> 01:14:08,329
You made that up. I know.

72
01:14:11,755 --> 01:14:14,246
That´s so good!

73
01:14:14,341 --> 01:14:17,295
Such behaviour!

74
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:25,846
Well, it´s the most
disgraceful sight I´ve ever seen,
or my name isn´t Mary Poppins.

75
01:14:25,936 --> 01:14:29,269
Speaking of names, I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

76
01:14:29,356 --> 01:14:32,807
What´s the name
of his other leg?

77
01:14:32,859 --> 01:14:36,109
Wasn´t that funny?
What´s the name of his other--

78
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:38,603
Now, then, children,
it´s time for tea.

79
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:41,070
I will not have
my schedule interrupted.

80
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:45,026
Oh, please stay. Look, I have
a splendid tea all ready for you.

81
01:14:45,121 --> 01:14:47,279
And it´s getting cold!

82
01:14:47,373 --> 01:14:51,205
Well, I had hoped that maybe,
that you would just, that--

83
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,835
Splendid! Thank you very much!

84
01:14:56,882 --> 01:15:00,298
Keep your feet back. Mind the bread
and butter. Now, watch it, children.

85
01:15:00,386 --> 01:15:04,383
I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.

86
01:15:04,473 --> 01:15:07,889
Next thing, I suppose,
you´ll be wanting me to pour out.

87
01:15:07,934 --> 01:15:10,888
Oh, well. If I must, I must.

88
01:15:12,397 --> 01:15:16,477
If you´ll just stop behaving
like a pack of laughing hyenas!

89
01:15:16,568 --> 01:15:18,441
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

90
01:15:18,528 --> 01:15:21,778
-Uh, Bert?
-Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

91
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:25,483
I´m so glad you came.
It wouldn´t be any fun without you.

92
01:15:25,576 --> 01:15:28,780
Here, and you may pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

93
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,947
Nice weather we´re having this
time of year, don´t you think?

94
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,412
Oh, yeah.
Uh, speaking of weather...

95
01:15:33,501 --> 01:15:35,624
the other day
when it was so cold...

96
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:39,329
a friend of mine went to buy
some long underwear, you know.

97
01:15:39,423 --> 01:15:42,626
The shopkeeper said to him,
""How long do you want it?´´

98
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:46,253
And my friend said,
""Well, from about September to March.´´

99
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:53,437
Jane! Control yourself!

100
01:15:55,188 --> 01:15:59,684
Children, will you please
sit up properly at the table?

101
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:02,860
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Oh, thank you, my dear.

102
01:16:02,946 --> 01:16:08,402
I´m having such a good time. I wish that
you could all stay up here all the time.

103
01:16:08,451 --> 01:16:11,286
We´ll jolly well have to.
There´s no way to get down.

104
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:13,944
Oh, no, there is a way.

105
01:16:13,998 --> 01:16:16,536
Frankly I,
I don´t like to mention it...

106
01:16:16,626 --> 01:16:18,784
because you have to think
of something sad.

107
01:16:18,878 --> 01:16:21,084
Then do get on with it, please!

108
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:24,047
Let me see.

109
01:16:24,133 --> 01:16:26,540
I´ve got the very thing.

110
01:16:26,635 --> 01:16:31,297
Yesterday when the lady
next door answered the bell,
there was a man there.

111
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:36,467
And the man said to the lady,
""I´m terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat.´´

112
01:16:36,562 --> 01:16:40,262
- Oh, that´s sad.
- The poor cat.

113
01:16:40,357 --> 01:16:43,607
And then the man said,
""I´d like to replace your cat.´´

114
01:16:43,652 --> 01:16:46,985
And the lady said,
""That´s all right with me, but
how are you at catching mice?´´

115
01:16:51,576 --> 01:16:55,075
Well, you know I started out sad.
I, I try, really I do.

116
01:16:55,163 --> 01:16:59,706
But, but everything ends up
so hilarious, I can´t--

117
01:16:59,792 --> 01:17:01,584
I can´t help--

118
01:17:04,088 --> 01:17:07,837
That will be quite enough of that!

119
01:17:07,883 --> 01:17:10,256
It´s time to go home.

120
01:17:10,344 --> 01:17:12,088
- Oh, that is sad.
- Oh, no!

121
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:15,762
Oh, that´s sad. That´s
the saddest thing I ever heard.

122
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:19,135
Come along, children. Spit spot!

123
01:17:19,186 --> 01:17:21,855
Must you really go?

124
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:24,726
You know, people come to see me
all the time, you know.

125
01:17:24,816 --> 01:17:29,028
And, and we have such a lovely time,
and then they have to go home.

126
01:17:29,071 --> 01:17:33,199
And, and I´m very, very sad
about the whole thing.

127
01:17:33,283 --> 01:17:35,904
Don´t worry.
We´ll come back soon.

128
01:17:35,994 --> 01:17:37,986
We had a lovely time.

129
01:17:38,038 --> 01:17:40,575
Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert,
will you, Bert?

130
01:17:40,665 --> 01:17:45,706
- I´ll sit with him a while.
- Thank you. Come on.

131
01:17:45,753 --> 01:17:50,545
Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke
I saved for just such an occasion.

132
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:54,002
- Would you like to hear it?
- I´d be so grateful.

133
01:17:54,053 --> 01:17:57,588
Righto. Well,
it´s about me granddad, see?

134
01:17:57,682 --> 01:18:00,089
And one night,
he had a nightmare, he did.

135
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:03,101
- So scared that he chewed
his pillow to bits.
- Yes.

136
01:18:03,187 --> 01:18:05,263
- To bits.
- Yes.
- Next morning I says...

137
01:18:05,356 --> 01:18:06,814
- ""How do you feel, Granddad?´´
- Yes.

138
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:10,943
He says, ""Oh, not bad.
A little down in the mouth!´´

139
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:18,407
Yeah, I always say there´s
nothing like a good joke.

140
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:22,657
No. And that was nothing
like a good joke! That--

141
01:18:38,763 --> 01:18:40,839
Bit late tonight,
aren´t you, Banks?

142
01:18:42,725 --> 01:18:46,723
I say, Banks!
Is anything the matter, Banks?

143
01:18:46,771 --> 01:18:49,226
Banks!

144
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:58,071
- Oh, Father, we´re so glad you´re home!
- Want to hear a joke?

145
01:18:58,156 --> 01:19:00,778
We had the most wonderful
afternoon with Mary Poppins.

146
01:19:00,867 --> 01:19:03,405
Speaking of afternoons,
the joke goes like this.

147
01:19:03,453 --> 01:19:05,660
I know a man with a wooden leg
named Smith.

148
01:19:05,747 --> 01:19:08,748
Smith? We don´t know anyone
called Smith.

149
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:13,537
And there was a second chap,
and the second chap says,
""What´s the name of his other leg?´´

150
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:16,589
And we had a lovely tea party
on the ceiling!

151
01:19:16,633 --> 01:19:18,424
Oh, children,
please be quiet.

152
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:21,380
Mary Poppins says if we´re good,
she´ll take us there again.

153
01:19:21,429 --> 01:19:25,925
Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins
said that, did she?

154
01:19:25,975 --> 01:19:28,762
Will you please return
to your room.

155
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:32,429
Mary Poppins, will you
be kind enough to come with me?

156
01:19:32,523 --> 01:19:34,480
As you wish.

157
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:40,775
Mary Poppins, I very much regret
what I must say to you.

158
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:48,486
- Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?
- I´m afraid there is.

159
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:52,031
I, I´d love to stay, but I have
to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

160
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,248
Winifred, it is my wish
that you be present!

161
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:56,251
Oh, yes, George,
of course.

162
01:19:56,296 --> 01:20:00,376
Mary Poppins, I must confess I am
extremely disappointed in you.

163
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:04,132
She´s for it now. I´ve heard
the master do this speech before.

164
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:07,263
I don´t deny that I am partially
responsible for allowing the children...

165
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:11,256
to spend their days on worthless
frivolity to the exclusion of all else!

166
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:14,145
But it is high time they learned
the seriousness of life!

167
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:16,306
But, George,
they´re only children.

168
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,475
Precisely. And in the light
of what has happened--

169
01:20:18,526 --> 01:20:20,898
George, are you certain
you know what you´re doing?

170
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:23,026
I believe I do, Winifred.

171
01:20:23,113 --> 01:20:26,862
A BritisH bank
is run witH precision

172
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:30,734
A BritisH Home
requires notHing less

173
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:35,041
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be tHe tools

174
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,328
WitHout tHem disorder, cHaos

175
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,496
Moral disintegration

176
01:20:40,547 --> 01:20:44,212
- In sHort you Have a gHastly mess
- I quite agree.

177
01:20:44,301 --> 01:20:48,132
THe cHildren must be moulded
sHaped and taugHt

178
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:51,631
THat life´s a looming battle
to be faced and fougHt

179
01:20:51,683 --> 01:20:54,434
In short, I am disturbed to hear
my children talking about...

180
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:56,345
popping in and out
of chalk pavement pictures...

181
01:20:56,396 --> 01:20:59,729
consorting with racehorse
persons, fox hunting.

182
01:20:59,815 --> 01:21:02,022
Yes, well I don´t mind
that quite so much.

183
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:03,687
At any rate,
it´s traditional.

184
01:21:03,778 --> 01:21:06,269
But tea parties on the ceiling?
I ask you.

185
01:21:06,363 --> 01:21:11,274
Having tea parties on the
ceiling and highly-questionable
outings of every other kind!

186
01:21:11,327 --> 01:21:15,656
If tHey must go on outings
THese outings ougHt to be

187
01:21:15,706 --> 01:21:18,660
FraugHt witH purpose
Yes, and practicality

188
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:20,500
THese silly words like

Superca-- Super--

190

- Superca--
- Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

191
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:29,127
Yes, well done. You said it.

192
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:31,544
And popping tHrougH pictures

193
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:35,505
Have little use
Fulfil no basic need

194
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,930
THey´ve got to learn
tHe Honest trutH

195
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:40,308
Despite tHeir youtH
THey must learn

196
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:44,228
- About tHe life you lead
- Exactly.

197
01:21:44,317 --> 01:21:49,559
THey must feel tHe tHrill
of totting up a balanced book

198
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:53,777
- A tHousand cipHers neatly in a row
- Quite right.

199
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:57,610
WHen gazing at a grapH
tHat sHows tHe profits up

200
01:21:57,705 --> 01:22:01,998
-THeir little cup ofjoy sHould overflow
-Precisely!

201
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:06,580
- It´s time tHey learned
to walk in your footsteps
- My footsteps.

202
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:10,462
- To tread your straigHt
and narrow patH witH pride
- With pride.

203
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:14,500
Tomorrow just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed

204
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,131
Jane and MicHael
will be at your side

205
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:20,976
Splendid!
You hit the nail right on the--

206
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,551
At my side?
Where are we going?

207
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:25,520
To the bank, of course,
exactly as you proposed.

208
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,729
- I proposed?
- Of course.

209
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:30,438
Now, if you´ll excuse me. Tomorrow´s
an important day for the children.

210
01:22:30,486 --> 01:22:34,151
I shall see they have a proper
night´s sleep. Good night.

211
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:48,415
Winifred, did I say that I was going
to take the children to the bank?

212
01:22:48,504 --> 01:22:51,458
- It certainly sounded that way, dear.
- Oh.

213
01:22:51,507 --> 01:22:53,795
And why not?
A capital idea!

214
01:22:53,842 --> 01:22:57,009
Just the medicine they need
for all this slipshod, sugary...

215
01:22:57,095 --> 01:22:59,420
female thinking they get
around here all day long.

216
01:22:59,514 --> 01:23:01,174
Quite right. Good idea.
Quite right.

217
01:23:01,266 --> 01:23:03,673
Good idea. Quite right.

218
01:23:05,478 --> 01:23:08,349
Mary Poppins,
we won´t let you go!

219
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,432
Go? What on earth
are you talking about?

220
01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:14,854
- Didn´t you get sacked?
- Sacked? Certainly not!
I am never sacked!

221
01:23:14,946 --> 01:23:17,781
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hurrah, hurray, hurray,

222
01:23:17,824 --> 01:23:20,361
- hurray, hurray, hurray--
- Neither am I a maypole.
Kindly stop spinning about me.

223
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:23,535
- But?
- Goats butt, birds fly...

224
01:23:23,621 --> 01:23:26,741
and children who are going on an outing
with their father must get some sleep.

225
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:28,867
- Come along, please.
- An outing with Father?

226
01:23:28,959 --> 01:23:30,952
- Yes.
- I don´t believe it.

227
01:23:31,003 --> 01:23:36,128
- He´s never taken us
on an outing before.
- He´s never taken us anywhere.

228
01:23:36,216 --> 01:23:38,008
- However did you manage it?
- Manage what?

229
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:40,762
You must´ve put the idea
in his head somehow.

230
01:23:40,846 --> 01:23:43,171
What an impertinent thing to say!

231
01:23:43,265 --> 01:23:45,969
Me putting ideas into
people´s heads? Really!

232
01:23:46,017 --> 01:23:48,508
- Where´s he taking us?
- To the bank.

233
01:23:48,562 --> 01:23:53,354
Oh, Michael, the city!
And we´ll see all the sights,
and Father can point them out to us.

234
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,357
Well, most things he can.

235
01:23:56,736 --> 01:24:00,187
But sometimes a person we love
through no fault of his own...

236
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:04,493
- can´t see past the end of his nose.
- Past the end of his nose?

237
01:24:04,535 --> 01:24:08,580
Yes. Sometimes a little thing
can be quite important.

238
01:24:08,664 --> 01:24:10,704
Oh, look! The cathedral.

239
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:14,035
Father passes that every day.
He sees that.

240
01:24:14,086 --> 01:24:20,124
Early eacH day
to tHe steps of St Paul´s

241
01:24:20,217 --> 01:24:25,804
THe little old
bird woman comes

242
01:24:26,765 --> 01:24:30,051
In Her own special way

243
01:24:30,102 --> 01:24:34,431
To tHe people sHe calls

244
01:24:34,523 --> 01:24:37,523
Come buy my bags

245
01:24:37,567 --> 01:24:41,565
Full of crumbs

246
01:24:41,654 --> 01:24:44,858
Come feed tHe little birds

247
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:48,241
SHow tHem you care

248
01:24:48,286 --> 01:24:54,905
And you´ll be glad
if you do

249
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:58,292
THeir young ones are Hungry

250
01:24:58,379 --> 01:25:01,582
THeir nests are so bare

251
01:25:01,632 --> 01:25:11,098
All it takes is tuppence from you

252
01:25:12,184 --> 01:25:15,767
Feed tHe birds

253
01:25:15,854 --> 01:25:19,140
Tuppence a bag

254
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:22,482
Tuppence, tuppence

255
01:25:22,569 --> 01:25:26,234
Tuppence a bag

256
01:25:26,281 --> 01:25:29,566
Feed tHe birds

257
01:25:29,617 --> 01:25:33,117

Her birds fill tHe skies

All around tHe catHedral
tHe saints and apostles

261
01:25:45,633 --> 01:25:51,801
Look down as sHe sells Her wares

262
01:25:51,889 --> 01:25:55,139
AltHougH you can´t see it

263
01:25:55,225 --> 01:25:58,760
You know tHey are smiling

264
01:25:58,812 --> 01:26:02,228
EacH time someone sHows

265
01:26:02,316 --> 01:26:08,484
THat He cares

THougH Her words

267
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:15,782
Are simple and few

268
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:19,073
Listen, listen

269
01:26:19,165 --> 01:26:24,076
SHe´s calling to you

270
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:27,254
Feed tHe birds

271
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:31,124
Tuppence a bag

272
01:26:31,177 --> 01:26:35,554
Tuppence, tuppence

273
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:39,554
Tuppence a bag

274
01:27:09,714 --> 01:27:12,549
THougH Her words

275
01:27:12,592 --> 01:27:16,423
Are simple and few

276
01:27:16,512 --> 01:27:19,928
Listen, listen

277
01:27:20,015 --> 01:27:25,057

278
01:27:25,145 --> 01:27:28,597
Feed tHe birds

279

Tuppence a bag

280
01:27:33,362 --> 01:27:39,234
Tuppence, tuppence

281
01:27:39,326 --> 01:27:41,318
Tuppence

282
01:27:41,411 --> 01:27:48,208
A bag

283
01:28:08,604 --> 01:28:12,732
Now remember that a bank is
a quiet and decorous place,
so we must be on our best behaviour.

284
01:28:12,775 --> 01:28:15,811
- But I thought it was your bank.
- Yes, well, I´m one
of the younger officers...

285
01:28:15,903 --> 01:28:18,310
so in a sense it is, sort of.

286
01:28:18,405 --> 01:28:21,110
Michael, look!

287
01:28:22,534 --> 01:28:24,527
- It´s her!
- Who?

288
01:28:24,619 --> 01:28:28,913
- It´s who?
- The bird woman.Just where
Mary Poppins said she would be.

289
01:28:28,957 --> 01:28:31,744
- You do see her, don´t you, Father?
- Well, of course I can see her.

290
01:28:31,793 --> 01:28:33,869
Do you think I can´t see
past the end of my nose?

291
01:28:33,962 --> 01:28:36,120
Listen, Father,
she´s saying it.

292
01:28:37,257 --> 01:28:40,756
Feed the birds.
Tuppence a bag.

293
01:28:40,802 --> 01:28:44,135
Well, of course she´s saying it.
What else would she be saying?

294
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:46,469
- Please may we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

295
01:28:46,516 --> 01:28:49,635
- I have tuppence from my money box.
-Just this once, please?

296
01:28:49,727 --> 01:28:53,143
Waste your money on a lot of
ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

297
01:28:53,189 --> 01:28:57,056
- But Mary Poppins--
- I am not interested
in what Mary Poppins says.

298
01:28:57,151 --> 01:29:00,068
Nor do I wish to keep hearing
her name for the remainder
of the day. Now come along!

299
01:29:00,154 --> 01:29:02,146
But it´s my tuppence!

300
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:05,738
Michael, I will not permit you
to throw your money away!

301
01:29:05,826 --> 01:29:09,823
When we get to the bank,
I shall show you what may be
done with your tuppence.

302
01:29:09,913 --> 01:29:12,997
And I think you´ll find it
extremely interesting.

303
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:50,534
Hello, Banks.
What´s all this about?

304
01:29:50,577 --> 01:29:53,068
- These are my children, Mr Dawes.
- Well, so I assumed.

305
01:29:53,163 --> 01:29:56,449
- But why are they here?
- They wish to open an account, sir.

306
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:58,036
- Oh, indeed?
- Yes.

307
01:29:58,085 --> 01:30:00,706
And just how much money
do you have, young man?

308
01:30:00,754 --> 01:30:04,004
- Tuppence. But I want it
to feed the birds.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

309
01:30:04,049 --> 01:30:06,718
Tuppence?

310
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:10,378
Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

311
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:18,810
That´s the chairman of the bank,
the elder Mr Dawes.

312
01:30:18,896 --> 01:30:20,688
A giant in the world of finance.

313
01:30:20,731 --> 01:30:22,226
- A giant?
- Shh, shh, shh.

314
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:25,650
Uh, Father, these
are Banks´s children.

315
01:30:25,736 --> 01:30:29,485
- They want to open an account.
- Oh, they do, do they, boy?

316
01:30:29,573 --> 01:30:32,278
Excellent. Excellent.

317
01:30:32,368 --> 01:30:34,906
We can al-always use...

318
01:30:34,954 --> 01:30:39,864
al-always use more money to, to put
to work for the bank, can´t we, boy?

319
01:30:41,752 --> 01:30:44,421
So, you have tuppence?

320
01:30:44,463 --> 01:30:46,539
May I be permitted to see it?

321
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,915
No. I want it to feed the birds!

322
01:30:49,009 --> 01:30:53,587
Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds
and what have you got? Fat birds!

323
01:30:55,056 --> 01:31:00,216
But if you invest your tuppence

324
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:02,642
Wisely in tHe bank

325
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:05,897
Safe and sound

326
01:31:07,401 --> 01:31:13,025
Soon tHat tuppence
safely invested in tHe bank

327
01:31:13,115 --> 01:31:15,986
Will compound

328
01:31:17,953 --> 01:31:24,205
And you´ll acHieve
tHat sense of conquest

329
01:31:24,293 --> 01:31:29,168
As your affluence expands

330
01:31:30,882 --> 01:31:33,255
In tHe Hands

331
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:38,129
Of tHe directors

332
01:31:38,181 --> 01:31:40,802
WHo invest

333
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:46,723
As propriety demands

334
01:31:47,815 --> 01:31:51,019
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.

335
01:31:52,487 --> 01:31:54,775
You see, Michael,
you´ll be part of...

336
01:31:54,822 --> 01:31:58,654
- Railways tHrougH Africa
- Exactly!

337
01:31:58,701 --> 01:32:02,485
- Dams across tHe Nile
- The ships. Tell them about the ships.

338
01:32:02,538 --> 01:32:06,156
- Fleets of ocean greyHounds
- More, tell them more!

339
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:08,497
Majestic self-amortizing canals

340
01:32:08,544 --> 01:32:10,832
How it fires the imagination!

Think of the foreclosures!

Bonds, chattels,

There´s something wrong. The bank
won´t give someone their money!

384
01:35:01,377 --> 01:35:04,663
Well, I´m going to get mine! Come along,
young man! I want every penny!

01:35:04,714 --> 01:35:07,039

Stop those children!

392
01:36:10,861 --> 01:36:13,352
Stop those children!

393
01:36:32,048 --> 01:36:34,420
Come with me, my dears.
Granny´ll hide you!

394
01:36:53,485 --> 01:36:57,317
-Here, here, half a mo.
-Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!

395
01:36:57,406 --> 01:36:59,813
Easy, now. Your old friend
ain´t gonna hurt ya.

396
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,825
Bert, it´s you!

397
01:37:03,912 --> 01:37:07,530
In the flesh,
and at your service.

398
01:37:07,582 --> 01:37:11,496
- You´re filthy!
- Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.

399
01:37:11,586 --> 01:37:13,911
It so happens that today
I´m a chimney sweep.

400
01:37:14,005 --> 01:37:16,413
Oh, Bert, we´re so frightened.

401
01:37:16,466 --> 01:37:18,754
Now, now, don´t take on so.

402
01:37:18,843 --> 01:37:21,797
Bert´ll take care of you
like I was your own father.

403
01:37:21,888 --> 01:37:24,129
- Now, who´s after you?
- Father is.

404
01:37:24,223 --> 01:37:27,307
- What?
- He brought us to see his bank.

405
01:37:27,393 --> 01:37:30,643
I don´t know what we did,
but it must´ve been something dreadful.

406
01:37:30,729 --> 01:37:34,015
He sent the police after us,
and the Army and everything.

407
01:37:34,108 --> 01:37:36,065
Michael, don´t exaggerate.

408
01:37:36,151 --> 01:37:39,069
Well, now, there must be
some mistake.

409
01:37:39,154 --> 01:37:41,396
Your dad´s a fine gentleman
and he loves ya!

410
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:45,487
I don´t think so. You should´ve
seen the look on his face.

411
01:37:45,535 --> 01:37:47,445
He doesn´t like us at all.

412
01:37:47,496 --> 01:37:50,580
Well, now that
don´t seem likely, does it?

413
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:53,868
It´s true.

414
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:55,953
Let´s sit down.

415
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:58,673
You know, begging your pardon...

416
01:37:58,757 --> 01:38:02,007
but the one my heart
goes out to is your father.

417
01:38:02,051 --> 01:38:06,049
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank day after day...

418
01:38:06,139 --> 01:38:09,887
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.

419
01:38:09,976 --> 01:38:11,849
I don´t like to see
any living thing caged up.

420
01:38:11,894 --> 01:38:14,563
Father in a cage?

421
01:38:14,647 --> 01:38:17,683
They makes cages in all
sizes and shapes, you know.

422
01:38:17,775 --> 01:38:19,814
Bank-shaped some of ´em,
carpets and all.

423
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:23,027
Father´s not in trouble. We are.

424
01:38:23,072 --> 01:38:26,238
Oh, sure about that, are you?

425
01:38:26,325 --> 01:38:29,907
Look at it this way. You´ve got
your mother to look after you.

426
01:38:29,995 --> 01:38:33,862
And Mary Poppins,
and Constable Jones and me.

427
01:38:33,957 --> 01:38:36,875
Who looks after your father?
Tell me that.

428
01:38:36,918 --> 01:38:39,836
When something terrible happens,
what does he do?

429
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,038
Fends for himself, he does.

430
01:38:42,132 --> 01:38:45,216
Who does he tell about it? No one!

431
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,383
Don´t blab his troubles at home.

432
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:52,049
He just pushes on at his job,
uncomplaining and alone and silent.

433
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:56,269
- He´s not very silent!
- Michael, be quiet.

434
01:38:56,354 --> 01:38:59,271
Bert, do you think Father
really needs our help?

435
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,353
Well, not my place to say.

436
01:39:03,402 --> 01:39:07,151
I only observe that a father can
always do with a bit of help.

437
01:39:07,239 --> 01:39:09,611
Come on, I´ll take you home.

Oh, Ellen, see who that is,
and send them away.

457
01:40:26,983 --> 01:40:29,818
- I´m dreadfully late!
- Yes, ma´am.

458
01:40:29,861 --> 01:40:33,064
-Well, I´ll be gettin´ along now.
-Oh, please stay till Father comes home.

459
01:40:33,155 --> 01:40:37,782
He´ll feel much better
if you shake hands with him.

460
01:40:37,827 --> 01:40:41,361
- It´s the children, ma´am.
- Oh, I thought they were
with their father.

461
01:40:41,455 --> 01:40:44,622
You haven´t been running off again, have
you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

462
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:46,789
Oh, they haven´t exactly
been running away, ma´am.

463
01:40:46,835 --> 01:40:49,326
They have had bit of a fright, though.
Need someone to look after ´em.

464
01:40:49,379 --> 01:40:53,329
Oh, of course!
Mary Poppins will.

465
01:40:53,425 --> 01:40:55,880
Oh, no, it´s her day off!

466
01:40:55,969 --> 01:41:00,346
- Ellen, I wonder if you would--
- No, ma´am. I haven´t done
me brasses yet.

467
01:41:00,432 --> 01:41:03,468
- Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
- Not for a hundred quid, ma´am.

468
01:41:03,518 --> 01:41:07,302
This here is baking day,
and you know how Cook is!

469
01:41:08,898 --> 01:41:10,606
What about you, sir?

470
01:41:10,692 --> 01:41:13,313
You´ve been so kind
in looking after the children.

471
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:15,852
Wh-- Uh, me, ma´am? W-Well, well,
I-I-I have to be moving along.

472
01:41:15,905 --> 01:41:17,862
The Lord Mayor´s got
a stopped-up chimney.

473
01:41:17,907 --> 01:41:20,612
Chimney. How clever of you to know.

474
01:41:20,701 --> 01:41:26,206
Our drawing room chimney´s in the most
ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

475
01:41:26,248 --> 01:41:27,992
- W-W--
- Thank you so much!

476
01:41:28,042 --> 01:41:32,703
- But--
- Besides, it´ll amuse the children.

477
01:41:32,755 --> 01:41:34,712
The Lord Mayor´s gonna be
terrible put out.

478
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:37,716
Oh, thank you so much.
I do appreciate it.

479
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:43,844
I must hurry. Our gallant ladies
in prison are waiting for me
to lead them in song!

480
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:46,642
Goodbye, my darlings.
See you soon.

481
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:56,940

483
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:05,825
Oh, it´s awfully dark
and gloomy up there.

484
01:42:05,912 --> 01:42:08,865
There now. You see
how wrong people can be?

485
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:13,909
That there is what you might call
a doorway to a place of enchantment.

486
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:18,830
Up wHere tHe smoke

01:42:28,517 --> 01:42:31,517
Nor Hardly no nigHt

491
01:42:31,603 --> 01:42:35,766
THere´s tHings Half in sHadow

492
01:42:35,857 --> 01:42:38,099
And Halfway in ligHt

493
01:42:39,152 --> 01:42:43,695
On tHe rooftops of London

494
01:42:44,782 --> 01:42:48,032
Coo, what a sight.

495
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:50,610
I do wish we could go up there.

496
01:42:50,663 --> 01:42:52,905
So do I! I like chimneys.

497
01:42:52,957 --> 01:42:57,951
Oh, rightly so!
A chimney is a wondrous thing.

498
01:42:58,003 --> 01:43:00,459
She´s built tall
right up there on the roof.

499
01:43:00,506 --> 01:43:03,957
When the wind is just right,
it blows across her top...

500
01:43:04,009 --> 01:43:06,678
then draws the smoke
right up the flue.

501
01:43:06,762 --> 01:43:10,546
Here. Feel the pull
on the end of that brush.

502
01:43:10,641 --> 01:43:13,310
It´s like I got a whale on
the end of the line, ain´t it?

503
01:43:13,352 --> 01:43:17,135
Michael, be careful. You never know
what may happen around a fireplace.

504
01:43:19,357 --> 01:43:21,314
Oh, bother!

505
01:43:23,987 --> 01:43:28,483
Michael! Michael,
come back down here.

506
01:43:28,533 --> 01:43:30,940
Michael! Michael, where are you?

507
01:43:30,994 --> 01:43:32,452
Well, that´s a bit awkward.
I must say!

508
01:43:32,495 --> 01:43:35,247
Bert, I´ll thank you to stop
putting ideas in their heads!

509
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:39,456
- There goes the other one.
- Shall I go after ´em?

510
01:43:39,502 --> 01:43:43,546
Well, we can´t have them gallivanting
up there like kangaroos, can we?

511
01:43:43,631 --> 01:43:46,335
Michael, don´t be frightened.
Everything´s going--

512
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,347
Will you put your things on at once?

513
01:43:58,854 --> 01:44:00,977
Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

514
01:44:01,023 --> 01:44:04,438
- Here you are! I thought you´d left us.
- We didn´t mean to.

515
01:44:04,526 --> 01:44:07,231
Well, no harm done.
The truth is...

516
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:10,938
this is what you might call
a fortuitous circumstance.

517
01:44:11,032 --> 01:44:12,824
Look there.

518
01:44:12,867 --> 01:44:18,206
A trackless jungle
just waiting to be explored.

519
01:44:18,289 --> 01:44:21,041
- Why not, Mary Poppins?
- Oh, please, Mary Poppins?
- Please!

520
01:44:22,543 --> 01:44:26,126
Oh, well. If we must, we must.

521
01:44:30,885 --> 01:44:31,750
Fall in.

522
01:44:32,219 --> 01:44:35,422
Look lively, look lively.
Jump to it!Jump to it!

It´s just good, clean soot, Michael.

529
01:45:38,867 --> 01:45:41,821
- As far as we go, right?
- Not at all.

530
01:46:31,501 --> 01:46:35,084
What did I tell ya?
There´s the whole world at your feet.

531
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:41,252
And who gets to see it, but the birds,
the stars and the chimney sweeps?

532
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:55,016
Quite nice, but we should
all get in out of the night air.

533
01:46:55,065 --> 01:46:57,437
Follow me, please.

01:55:40,322 --> 01:55:42,813
Good luck, guv´nor.

610
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:23,739
Oh, Father, every one
of those sweeps shook your hand.

611
01:56:23,822 --> 01:56:26,278
You´re going to be the
luckiest person in the world!

612
01:56:26,366 --> 01:56:29,284
- Come along, children. Spit spot.
-Just a moment, Mary Poppins.

613
01:56:29,369 --> 01:56:32,406
What is the meaning of this outrage?

614
01:56:32,497 --> 01:56:36,874
- I beg your pardon?
- Will you be good enough
to explain all this?

615
01:56:36,918 --> 01:56:39,374
First of all, I would like
to make one thing quite clear.

616
01:56:39,462 --> 01:56:42,084
Yes?

617
01:56:42,173 --> 01:56:44,332
I never explain anything.

618
01:56:51,099 --> 01:56:53,768
Yes. Banks here.

619
01:56:53,851 --> 01:56:57,765
Mr Dawes! I´m most dreadfully
sorry, sir, about what happened
at the bank today.

620
01:56:57,855 --> 01:57:02,232
I can assure you that--
Tonight, sir?

621
01:57:02,276 --> 01:57:05,941
Yes, Banks. We´ll expect you
at 9:00 precisely.

622
01:57:05,988 --> 01:57:08,858
- Without fail.
- Without fail.

623
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,442
Why, yes, Banks.

624
01:57:12,494 --> 01:57:14,154
It´s extremely serious.

625
01:57:14,246 --> 01:57:16,369
We regret this course of action.

626
01:57:16,456 --> 01:57:17,951
We regret this course of action.

627
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,917
After all, you have been with us
a good many years.

628
01:57:20,961 --> 01:57:24,460
- After all, you have been
with us a good many years.
- As was your father before you.

629
01:57:24,506 --> 01:57:27,507
As was your father before you.

630
01:57:27,592 --> 01:57:31,293
Yes, Mr Dawes.
I shall be there at 9:00.

631
01:57:53,242 --> 01:57:57,654
A man has dreams
of walking with giants.

632
01:57:59,456 --> 01:58:04,996
To carve his niche
in the edifice of time.

633
01:58:05,087 --> 01:58:10,128
Before tHe mortar of His zeal

634
01:58:10,175 --> 01:58:14,007
Has a cHance to congeal

635
01:58:14,054 --> 01:58:16,509
The cup is dashed from his lips!

636
01:58:16,598 --> 01:58:18,886
The flame is snuffed a-borning.

637
01:58:18,975 --> 01:58:21,217
He´s brought to wrack
and ruin in his prime.

638
01:58:23,938 --> 01:58:27,354
Life is a rum go, guv´nor.
And that´s the truth.

639
01:58:27,441 --> 01:58:30,395
You know what I think?
It´s that woman Mary Poppins.

640
01:58:30,486 --> 01:58:33,985
From the moment she stepped into this
house, things began to happen to me!

641
01:58:34,031 --> 01:58:37,317
- Mary Poppins?
- Yes, yes, of course.

642
01:58:37,368 --> 01:58:41,496
My world was calm

643
01:58:41,538 --> 01:58:44,954
Well-ordered
Exemplary.

644
01:58:46,251 --> 01:58:49,371
THen came tHis person

645
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:52,706
WitH cHaos in Her wake

646
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:59,925
And now my life´s ambitions go

647
01:59:00,015 --> 01:59:04,890
WitH one fell blow

648
01:59:04,936 --> 01:59:10,689
It´s quite a bitter pill

649
01:59:12,568 --> 01:59:14,027
To take.

650
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:16,228
It´s that Poppins woman!
She did it!

651
01:59:16,322 --> 01:59:18,777
I know the very person you mean.

652
01:59:18,866 --> 01:59:21,072
Mary Poppins.
She´s the one what sings...

653
01:59:21,118 --> 01:59:24,119
A spoonful of sugar

654
01:59:24,205 --> 01:59:27,704
THat is all it takes

655
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:30,241
It cHanges bread and water

656
01:59:30,335 --> 01:59:33,253
Into tea and cakes

657
01:59:33,297 --> 01:59:34,921
You see? That´s exactly what I mean!

658
01:59:35,007 --> 01:59:37,961
Changing bread and water
into tea and cakes! Indeed!

659
01:59:38,051 --> 01:59:41,088
No wonder everything´s
higgledy-piggledy here.

660
01:59:41,138 --> 01:59:43,759
A spoonful of sugar

661
01:59:43,849 --> 01:59:47,182
Goes a long, long way

662
01:59:47,268 --> 01:59:50,269
Have yourself a HealtHy Helpin´

663
01:59:50,313 --> 01:59:53,100
Every day

664
01:59:53,149 --> 01:59:54,774
An healthy helpin´ of trouble,
if you ask me.

665
01:59:54,859 --> 01:59:57,065
Do you know what she did?
I realize it now.

666
01:59:57,111 --> 01:59:59,781
She tricked me into taking
Jane and Michael to the bank.

667
01:59:59,822 --> 02:00:02,194
That´s how all the trouble started.

668
02:00:02,283 --> 02:00:04,774
- Tricked you into taking
the children on an outing?
- Yes.

669
02:00:04,827 --> 02:00:06,618
Outrageous!

670
02:00:06,704 --> 02:00:10,784
A man with all the important
things you have to do. Shameful!

671
02:00:12,376 --> 02:00:16,124
You´re a man
of high position.

672
02:00:16,213 --> 02:00:19,167
Esteemed by your peers.

673
02:00:19,258 --> 02:00:22,757
And wHen your little
tykes are cryin´

674
02:00:22,844 --> 02:00:26,924
You Haven´t time
to dry tHeir tears

675
02:00:26,973 --> 02:00:30,923
And see tHem
grateful little faces

676
02:00:30,977 --> 02:00:34,560
Smilin´up at you

677
02:00:34,606 --> 02:00:36,812
Because tHeir dad

678
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:41,526
He always knows just wHat to do

679
02:00:41,613 --> 02:00:44,530
- Well, I mean, look, I,
I don´t think I ca--
- Like you say, guv´nor.

680
02:00:45,867 --> 02:00:50,363
You´ve got
to grind, grind, grind

681
02:00:50,454 --> 02:00:53,906
At tHat grindstone

682
02:00:53,958 --> 02:00:56,627
THougH cHildHood slips

683
02:00:56,669 --> 02:01:00,251
Like sand tHrougH a sieve

684
02:01:02,132 --> 02:01:07,008
And all too soon
tHey´ve up and grown

685
02:01:07,095 --> 02:01:11,722
And tHen tHey´ve flown

686
02:01:11,808 --> 02:01:14,430
And it´s too late

687
02:01:14,519 --> 02:01:18,896
For you to give

688
02:01:21,860 --> 02:01:27,198
Just tHat spoonful of sugar

689
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:31,451
To Help tHe medicine go down

690
02:01:31,536 --> 02:01:35,829
THe medicine go down

691
02:01:35,873 --> 02:01:38,957
Medicine go down

692
02:01:39,043 --> 02:01:42,293
Well, goodbye, guv´nor.
Sorry to have troubled you.

693
02:01:55,559 --> 02:01:57,966
Father?

694
02:01:58,061 --> 02:02:00,848
We´re sorry about the tuppence.

695
02:02:00,897 --> 02:02:04,231
We didn´t know it would
cause you so much trouble.

696
02:02:10,865 --> 02:02:14,032
Here, Father,
you can have the tuppence.

697
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:30,507
Will that make everything all right?

698
02:02:32,261 --> 02:02:34,752
Thank you.

699
02:05:26,179 --> 02:05:28,420
Come in!

700
02:05:37,314 --> 02:05:38,939
Take your hat off, Banks.

701
02:05:53,455 --> 02:05:55,780
Good evening, gentlemen.

702
02:05:58,793 --> 02:06:00,786
Well, get on with it. Go on.

703
02:06:00,837 --> 02:06:03,079
Uh, yes, Father.

704
02:06:06,509 --> 02:06:10,554
In 1 773, an official
of this bank...

705
02:06:10,638 --> 02:06:13,129
unwisely loaned
a large sum of money...

706
02:06:13,182 --> 02:06:17,476
to finance a shipment of tea
to the American colonies.

707
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:21,387
- Do you know what happened?
- Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.

708
02:06:21,482 --> 02:06:23,521
Uh, uh, as the ship lay
in Boston Harbor...

709
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:26,314
uh, a party of the colonists
dressed as red Indians...

710
02:06:26,362 --> 02:06:31,438
uh, boarded the vessel,
behaved very rudely, and,
and threw all the tea overboard.

711
02:06:31,492 --> 02:06:34,409
This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking...

712
02:06:34,495 --> 02:06:37,199
even for Americans.

713
02:06:42,044 --> 02:06:45,958
Precisely.
The loan was defaulted.

714
02:06:46,006 --> 02:06:48,710
Panic ensued within these walls.

715
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:51,920
There was a run on the bank!

716
02:06:52,011 --> 02:06:54,051
From that time to this, sir...

717
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:57,638
there has not been
a run on this bank...

718
02:07:00,186 --> 02:07:02,309
until today!

719
02:07:02,355 --> 02:07:07,432
A run, sir, caused by the
disgraceful conduct of your son.

720
02:07:07,485 --> 02:07:11,103
- Do you deny it?
- I do not deny it, sir.

721
02:07:11,155 --> 02:07:15,318
And I shall be only too glad
to assume responsibility for my son.

722
02:07:19,038 --> 02:07:23,165
- What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!
- Uh, y-yes, Father.

723
02:07:42,518 --> 02:07:44,844
- No, not that!
- Steady on.

724
02:08:05,374 --> 02:08:08,161
Well, do you have
anything to say, Banks?

725
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:12,208
Well, sir,
they do say that...

726
02:08:12,297 --> 02:08:16,793
when there´s nothing to say,
all you can say i--

727
02:08:20,347 --> 02:08:23,383
Confound it, Banks! I said,
do you have anything to say?

728
02:08:26,561 --> 02:08:29,431
-Just one word, sir.
- Yes?

729
02:08:29,522 --> 02:08:31,930
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

730
02:08:33,985 --> 02:08:35,099
What?

731
02:08:35,194 --> 02:08:38,195
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

732
02:08:38,281 --> 02:08:41,566
Mary Poppins was right.
It´s extraordinary.
It does make you feel better!

733
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:45,277
What are you talking about, man?
There´s no such word.

734
02:08:45,371 --> 02:08:48,787
Oh, yes. It is a word.
A perfectly good word, actually.

735
02:08:48,874 --> 02:08:50,452
Do you know what there´s
no such thing as?

736
02:08:50,542 --> 02:08:53,911
It turns out, with due respect,
when all is said and done...

737
02:08:53,962 --> 02:08:56,963
that there´s
no such thing as you!

738
02:08:57,049 --> 02:08:58,922
- Impertinence, sir!
- Speaking of impertinence...

739
02:08:58,967 --> 02:09:01,458
would you like to hear
a perfectly marvellous joke?

740
02:09:01,553 --> 02:09:04,258
- A real snapper!
-Joke? Snapper?

741
02:09:04,306 --> 02:09:07,591
Yes. There are these two wonderful
young people,Jane and Michael.

742
02:09:07,642 --> 02:09:11,141
And they meet one day on the street,
and Jane says to Michael...

743
02:09:11,187 --> 02:09:13,974
""I know a man with
a wooden leg named Smith.´´

744
02:09:14,023 --> 02:09:18,270
And Michael says, ""Really?
What´s the name of his other leg?´´

745
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:23,235
The man´s gone mad.
Call the guard!

746
02:09:23,324 --> 02:09:26,859
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.
I´m feeling better all the time!

747
02:09:26,953 --> 02:09:29,075
Banks, don´t you dare
strike my father!

748
02:09:29,163 --> 02:09:31,654
There´s the tuppence.
The wonderful, fateful...

749
02:09:31,707 --> 02:09:34,743
supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
tuppence.

750
02:09:34,835 --> 02:09:37,955
- Guard it well. Goodbye!
- Banks, where are you going?

751
02:09:38,005 --> 02:09:40,922
I don´t know. I might pop
through a chalk pavement picture,

752
02:09:41,008 --> 02:09:42,550
and go for an outing
in the country.

753
02:09:42,634 --> 02:09:46,086
Or I might seize a horse off
a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!

754
02:09:46,138 --> 02:09:50,301
Or I might just fly a kite!
Only Poppins would know!

755
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:54,478
- Poppins?
- My nanny. She´s the one who
sings that ridiculous song.

756
02:09:54,521 --> 02:09:58,981
A spoonful of sugar
makes tHe medicine go down

757
02:09:59,025 --> 02:10:00,982
THe medicine go down

758
02:10:01,027 --> 02:10:03,518
THe medicine go down
THe medicine--

759
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:09,069
Mad as a March hare.

760
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:12,196
A wooden leg named Smith.

761
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:18,157
A wooden leg named Smith.

762
02:10:20,171 --> 02:10:22,543
A wooden le--

763
02:10:36,019 --> 02:10:39,353
Father? Father!

764
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:41,432
Father, come down!

765
02:10:41,524 --> 02:10:45,604
Daddy! Daddy, come back!

766
02:10:54,579 --> 02:10:58,707
Wind´s come around,
blowing dead on from the west!

767
02:11:01,085 --> 02:11:03,327
She doesn´t care
what happens to us.

768
02:11:03,379 --> 02:11:08,669
She only promised to stay till the wind
changed. Isn´t that right, Mary Poppins?

769
02:11:08,717 --> 02:11:11,718
Will you bring me
my hat stand, please?

770
02:11:13,889 --> 02:11:17,803
Mary Poppins,
don´t you love us?

771
02:11:19,978 --> 02:11:22,765
And what would happen to me,
may I ask...

772
02:11:22,856 --> 02:11:26,391
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?

773
02:11:29,321 --> 02:11:32,357
Yes, sir, that´s right.
George W. Banks.

774
02:11:32,407 --> 02:11:34,814
1 7 Cherry Tree Lane.

775
02:11:34,909 --> 02:11:37,281
About six foot one,
I´d say, sir.

776
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:40,821
Oh, yes, we rang up his bank
first thing this morning.

777
02:11:40,915 --> 02:11:44,865
The only thing we discovered was,
he´d been discharged last night.

778
02:11:44,919 --> 02:11:48,086
No telling what he might do
in a fit of despondency.

779
02:11:48,172 --> 02:11:50,212
Wouldn´t hurt to have them
drag the river.

780
02:11:50,257 --> 02:11:54,302
There´s a nice spot there by
Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.

781
02:11:54,386 --> 02:11:57,138
Really, Ellen!

782
02:11:57,222 --> 02:12:00,389
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman, sir.

783
02:12:00,476 --> 02:12:03,595
No hanky-panky,
if you know what I mean.

784
02:12:03,645 --> 02:12:07,097
- Oh, regular habits, sir.
Well, far as anyone knows.
- THe medicine go down

785
02:12:07,149 --> 02:12:09,307
THe medicine go down

786
02:12:09,401 --> 02:12:11,974
-Just a spoonful of sugar
- It´s him!

787
02:12:12,070 --> 02:12:14,312
- Helps tHe medicine
- Or something that sounds like him.

788
02:12:14,364 --> 02:12:16,403
- Go down
- Mrs Banks, could we have
a little less noise...

789
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:21,485
- on the premises? I can´t make
out what the inspector´s sayin´.
- In tHe most deligHtful way

790
02:12:21,579 --> 02:12:24,070
Just a spoonful of sugar

791
02:12:24,165 --> 02:12:27,664
- Makes tHe medicine go down
- George!

792
02:12:27,752 --> 02:12:30,207
Oh, George, you didn´t jump
in the river.

793
02:12:30,296 --> 02:12:32,502
How sensible of you.

794
02:12:32,548 --> 02:12:35,964
It´s all right, sir.
He´s been found!

795
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:38,133
No, alive!

796
02:12:38,179 --> 02:12:42,223
Or so I presume.
He´s a-kissin´ a-Mrs. Banks.

797
02:12:42,308 --> 02:12:44,596
I´ve been so worried.
What happened at the bank?

798
02:12:44,685 --> 02:12:47,602
I´ve been sacked, discharged,
flung into the street.

799
02:12:47,688 --> 02:12:52,148
A spoonful of sugar
makes tHe medicine go down

800
02:12:52,192 --> 02:12:55,775
Gone off his crumpet.
That´s what he´s done.

801
02:12:55,862 --> 02:12:59,029
- THe medicine go down
- Dotty as you please.

802
02:12:59,115 --> 02:13:02,484
George, what on earth
were you doing in the cellar?

803
02:13:02,535 --> 02:13:06,403
You´ll see in a moment.
Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

804
02:13:06,498 --> 02:13:09,866
- Your father´s calling you.
- It doesn´t sound like Father.

805
02:13:09,918 --> 02:13:13,666
-Jane? Michael?
- Run along. Spit spot!

806
02:13:18,801 --> 02:13:21,921
You won´t go, Mary Poppins,
will you?

807
02:13:22,013 --> 02:13:24,717
Spit spot.

808
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,688
He mended it!

809
02:13:41,531 --> 02:13:45,149
- It´s wonderful!
- However did you manage it?

810
02:13:45,243 --> 02:13:48,410
WitH tuppence for paper and strings

811
02:13:48,455 --> 02:13:51,705
You can Have
your own set of wings

OH, let´s go fly a kite

823
02:14:33,081 --> 02:14:35,537
A proper kite needs a proper tail,
don´t you think?

824
02:14:35,584 --> 02:14:40,625
That´s what I said, sir.
Go fly a kite!

825
02:14:40,713 --> 02:14:44,793
Oh, no, sir. No,
I, I don´t mean you personally.

826
02:14:44,884 --> 02:14:48,419

I want to congratulate you.

845
02:15:51,865 --> 02:15:55,863
Capital bit of humour.
Wooden leg named Smith.

846
02:15:55,911 --> 02:15:58,236
Or Jones or whatever it was.

847
02:15:58,330 --> 02:16:01,414
Father died laughing.

848
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:06,292
- Oh, I´m so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense.
Nothing to be sorry about.

849
02:16:06,379 --> 02:16:08,752
Never seen him happier
in his life.

850
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:11,129
He left an opening
for a new partner.

851
02:16:11,217 --> 02:16:13,543
Congratulations.

852
02:16:13,595 --> 02:16:17,129
Thank you, sir.

Fly a kite

857
02:16:33,447 --> 02:16:35,523
That´s gratitude for you.

858
02:16:35,574 --> 02:16:39,109
- Didn´t even say goodbye.
- No, they didn´t.

859
02:16:39,203 --> 02:16:45,075
Look at them. You know, they think more
of their father than they do of you.

860
02:16:45,125 --> 02:16:49,668
- That´s as it should be.
- Well, don´t you care?

861
02:16:49,755 --> 02:16:53,704
Practically perfect people never permit
sentiment to muddle their thinking.

862
02:16:53,758 --> 02:16:59,345
Is that so? Well, I´ll tell you
one thing, Mary Poppins,
you don´t fool me a bit.

863
02:16:59,431 --> 02:17:03,927
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really. I know exactly how
you feel about these children.

864
02:17:03,977 --> 02:17:08,555
And if you think I´m gonna keep
my mouth shut any longer, I--

865
02:17:08,606 --> 02:17:11,441
That will be quite enough
of that, thank you.

866
02:17:34,298 --> 02:17:37,548
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.
Don´t stay away too long.

867
02:18:24,471 --> 02:18:26,962
OH, oH, oH

868
02:18:27,015 --> 02:18:30,348
Let´s go fly a kite

869
02:18:30,393 --> 02:18:33,976

870
02:18:34,022 --> 02:18:37,188
Let´s go fly a kite

871
02:18:37,275 --> 02:18:41,107
And send it soaring

872

Up tHrougH tHe atmospHere

873
02:18:44,657 --> 02:18:48,073

874
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:53,036
OH, let´s go

875
02:18:53,124 --> 02:18:56,623
