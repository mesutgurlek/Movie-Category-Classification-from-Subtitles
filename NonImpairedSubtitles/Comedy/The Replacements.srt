1
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:24,737
Hike!

2
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:29,700
Martel!

3
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,744
Martel, you're a wimp!

4
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:36,288
I can't believe that Martel
goes for a give-up slide

5
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,499
-It did look cautious
-I could have scored on that!

6
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,583
It may be the lastplay
of the season.

7
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:44,670
The player's strike became official...

8
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,838
...at 4 p.m. Eastern Time.

9
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:50,340
I'm sad that the players ' demands,
which center around...

10
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,302
...a rise in the current salary cap,
were rejected by the owners.

11
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:57,346
I have told my union brothers to walk.

12
00:02:57,346 --> 00:03:00,348
Get me Jimmy McGinty!
Have him here tonight

13
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,308
Yes, sir

14
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,809
I'm here with Eddie Martel.

15
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,813
A lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy.

16
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,522
Any comments?

17
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:13,775
Dwight, I know $5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money...

18
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:17,278
...but I have to pay 10% to my agent,
5% to my lawyer--

19
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:20,530
Do you know what insurance costs
on a Ferrari, mother--

20
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:22,823
Pat, back to you.

21
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,785
That was Washington running back
Malcolm Lamont

22
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:29,370
It's all about money, folks,
but isn't it always?

23
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:32,831
Yes. This is Pat Summerall
for John Madden saying...

24
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:35,333
...so long from Nextel Stadium.

25
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,419
-you look like shit
-I'm dying, Jimmy

26
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:43,339
Come on

27
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:45,966
You've been dying for 20 years

28
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,349
-Give me a cigarette
-I quit

29
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,893
Nobody likes a quitter

30
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,355
-See the game today?
-No

31
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:05,690
Why, you liar

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,734
Could you believe that slide
by Martel?

33
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:12,695
What a pussy

34
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:18,366
-What's up?
-Take a ride with me

35
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:22,411
How's the wife?

36
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,371
She had her lips done

37
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:27,331
I never even knew you could
have your lips done

38
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,293
Looks like a largemouth bass

39
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,547
I'm too old to screw around
Let me give it to you straight

40
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:38,715
I want you back

41
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:42,593
-you already have a coach
-I'll take care of it

42
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:45,887
-Like you took care of me
-Now, Jimmy

43
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,598
Your players all flew home
to their castles

44
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,390
In their private jets

45
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,434
We're gonna finish
the season anyway

46
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,894
I'm gonna use replacement players

47
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:58,980
-Jeez, what a business
-We got 4 games left

48
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:01,441
We win three, we're in the playoffs

49
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:05,402
Really? Win three out of four
with replacement players?

50
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,778
That's not too much to ask

51
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,822
You won for me once,
you can do it again

52
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,408
What's the matter, Jimmy?

53
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:16,619
Nobody's gonna give you
a better chance than this

54
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,787
After that Dallas mess

55
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:23,791
-I was right about that
-It had nothing to do with being right!

56
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,584
Went head-to-head with
an $8 million quarterback

57
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:30,421
Who did you think was gonna win?
That's not gonna happen here!

58
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,966
I'm talking about a team of poor
nobodies who play to win

59
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:37,343
Not a bunch of bitchy millionaires

60
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,387
Come on, Jimmy!

61
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,972
I'm thinking

62
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:48,852
Hello!

63
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:51,436
Hello!

64
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,699
I want total control of my team

65
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,661
I want to be able to recruit anybody
that I want, no interference

66
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:16,039
My word is my bond

67
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:19,625
I want it in writing

68
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,753
Okay, Jimmy

69
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:24,462
Okay

70
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,882
We thought we'd skip special teams
for now

71
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:32,469
It'll be tough enough to put
together a team in a week

72
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,012
-We're gonna go a different way
-A different way?

73
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:38,473
Here's a list of people I've
been watching over the years

74
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:41,767
They've all played football,
not all of them in the pros

75
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,603
But they all have something
unique to bring

76
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,813
We'll take them and try to
put together a winning team

77
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:51,483
If nothing else, they should
be fun to watch

78
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:53,901
Daniel Bateman, SWAT team officer

79
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:58,488
Awarded a Purple Heart for losing
a kidney during the Gulf War.

80
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,701
A walk-on at Michigan State
before he gave up football

81
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,996
...to sneak back into the service
for one more tour of duty.

82
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:10,539
Clifford Franklin

83
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:16,585
Great attitude, great desire, and the
fastest son of a bitch I've ever seen

84
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:20,839
Clifford! Twinkie!

85
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:29,512
What's up, man? Got any Twinkies?

86
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:30,595
Can he catch?

87
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:42,896
That's why I have you

88
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,066
Andre and Jamal Jackson

89
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:50,069
Together, these guys are the best
tandem team of guards in the game

90
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:56,532
-you're kidding me!
-Andre got traded and they fell apart

91
00:07:56,616 --> 00:08:00,535
He ain't our problem no more
We gonna play football

92
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,537
-Football?
-Football

93
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,582
Nigel Gruff

94
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:10,960
Striker out of Cardiff,
now residing in Hell's Kitchen.

95
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:15,714
He's "The Leg" because he can kick
a soccer ball the length of the field

96
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,590
Gentlemen

97
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,592
The drinks are on the house!

98
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:23,845
Bollocks!

99
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,764
Pissing away our money again?

100
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:30,600
-No, the money's on the way
-Where? To the OTB?

101
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,143
I got a winning horse!
I swear on my mum's grave!

102
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:36,604
Your mother's grave?
He's swearing on his mother's grave!

103
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,606
Nigel, listen I want my money!

104
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:41,566
-Has he kept in shape?
-By Welsh standards

105
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,194
Shane Falco

106
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:49,572
Shane Falco? "Footsteps" Falco,
from Ohio State?

107
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,657
The same.

108
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:55,619
-He hasn't played in years.
-Should be well rested then.

109
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,124
You look like a swordfish
I caught once

110
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,584
He hit the deck just like that

111
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:08,671
-you know who I am?
-yeah

112
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:10,922
You're Jimmy McGinty

113
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:13,757
That old coach from the '80s

114
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,761
We met just before the Sugar Bowl

115
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,554
I remember

116
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,140
Hell of a game, that Sugar Bowl

117
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:27,560
-What'd you lose that by? 40 points?
-That would be 45

118
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:32,981
A game like that sticks with you
you never shake it off

119
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:36,775
-Got 3 concussions to prove it
-That's why girls don't play

120
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:40,570
Why are you here, coach?

121
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,572
Back with the Sentinels
I want you as quarterback

122
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,658
I found the best guards
and a wide receiver

123
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,034
Even you couldn't overthrow

124
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,621
-I'm retired
-Retired?

125
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:56,791
It looks like things have gone
real well for you since

126
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:00,085
I got no complaints

127
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,170
It's quiet here

128
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:04,630
Nobody bothers me

129
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:08,633
The great thing about plankton is,
it pretty much keeps to itself

130
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,763
You know what separates the winners
from the losers?

131
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,138
The score

132
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:21,768
Getting back up after being
kicked in the teeth

133
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:24,687
I watched films of your games
since the Sugar Bowl

134
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:28,064
You shouldn't have been trying to
carry the whole team that first year

135
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,608
Your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled

136
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:37,196
-Is that how you want to be remembered?
-I don't want to be remembered at all

137
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:41,700
If you do well, who knows what'll
happen after the strike

138
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,619
I'm not making you any promises,
but why don't you take a chance?

139
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:49,664
Rather than scraping crap off
the bottom of somebody else's toys?

140
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:04,968
Think it over

141
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,637
You could be part of something

142
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:17,227
Football fans, what the owners are
doing is absolutely unconscionable

143
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,979
They have blatantly hired scabs

144
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,816
Which goes against our Constitution,
the Declaration of Independence...

145
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,694
...and the Emancipation Proclamation.
Here come the scabs now!

146
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,656
That's Eddie Martel!

147
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,285
I love you, man! What's happening?

148
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:41,996
I love you, man!

149
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:47,041
I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass!
And your ass!

150
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,668
Piss off!

151
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,710
Piss off!

152
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,108
Get that bible out of here!

153
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,320
Sorry about this

154
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,741
Put God in your heart!

155
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:38,748
I'm very sorry

156
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,297
Get a job, you wankers!

157
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:12,774
Looking good out there! you've got
the goods, you've got the goods!

158
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:15,275
Where did you learn
to catch like that?

159
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:36,834
Roberts, make that D-back commit
before you cut, all right?

160
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:38,793
Jimmy

161
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:42,796
-My tight end is deaf
-yeah, I know

162
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:45,841
Jimmy, how am I gonna
coach a deaf man?

163
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,049
You won't need to

164
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,844
Brian Murphy would've gone in
the first round if he wasn't deaf

165
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,930
Played college ball here
in DC at Gallaudet

166
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,016
But I got to be able to communicate
with him and how

167
00:13:57,808 --> 00:13:59,058
Learn to sign

168
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:00,268
Oh, horseshit!

169
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,396
Look at it this way, he'll never
be called offsides on an audible

170
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:07,815
-Good to see you
-you too

171
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,817
-How are you?
-Good, good

172
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,902
This is "The Leg"?

173
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,823
I thought you told me
he was solid muscle

174
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:19,824
He's much stronger than he looks

175
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,826
I'm wiry

176
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,077
Go get some kicks in

177
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,834
He's "wiry"

178
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,170
"Wiry"

179
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,182
You've been briefed
as to your situation

180
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,351
Coach McGinty wanted you
with us for 5 weeks

181
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:56,186
And the governor's complied

182
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:57,853
Nice watch

183
00:14:57,978 --> 00:14:58,896
What?

184
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,189
Oh, this?

185
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,023
It's a fake

186
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,942
Damn thing's always broken

187
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:06,360
It's only right twice a day

188
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,362
Why don't we join the others?

189
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:11,864
No sense standing here by ourselves

190
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:13,865
Out of screaming distance

191
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,910
-Come on, let's fire out of there!
-Jimmy

192
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,287
-Falco, when's he coming?
-Relax, he'll be here

193
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:21,871
Come on, quick feet!

194
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:25,499
I am relaxed, but that's not the point
It's nervous energy

195
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,210
Case in point, we don't have
a quarterback, do we?

196
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,462
-Fire out of there!
-We don't have a game plan for Sunday

197
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,882
And the only good thing I can say
about our offensive weapon is

198
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:38,301
It's wiry
What the shit is that?

199
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:39,885
No, no, it's "wiry"

200
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,971
-However the hell you say it!
-Say it: "Wiry"

201
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:48,058
Wiry

202
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:51,144
Holy! Look at this mamma-jamma!

203
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:05,113
Have you lost weight?

204
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:07,114
Coach, don't say that

205
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:10,409
You look great
Why don't you work out on this OD?

206
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,910
OD

207
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:16,413
-So he's lost weight?
-Sumo wrestler

208
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:20,917
Expert at pushing people around
That's what pass blocking is, remember?

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,001
That's right

210
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,211
Next one, 74 Come on!

211
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,338
Set, hut!

212
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:28,964
All right! Way to go!

213
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:34,344
It's all about pushing people around!
Set! Hut!

214
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:40,515
Come on, sumo boy
Let's see what you can do

215
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:41,933
Set Hut!

216
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:49,522
Yes! Good hit, sumo boy!
Now get this off of me!

217
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,399
"That'll do, pig, that'll do"

218
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:55,527
-Screw you, cockroach
-you'll have to find your dick first

219
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:57,945
Get this off of me!

220
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,501
Hey, scab!

221
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,254
-I don't want any trouble
-you hear that?

222
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,131
He's taking away my job, but
he doesn't want any trouble

223
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:27,050
Not only is he taking your job,
he's taking your parking space too

224
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:28,385
What's up?

225
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:30,887
Is that right, Falco?

226
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,264
I didn't know it was yours
I'll move it

227
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:35,974
No, let us do that

228
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:38,976
Guys, move the new boy's ride for him

229
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,270
Coming right up, Mr Falco

230
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,232
Ready?

231
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,985
One Two Three

232
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,911
Thanks, guys

233
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:04,454
Asshole

234
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,998
Jesus! "Footsteps" Falco
They must be getting desperate

235
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:09,625
Hey, Falco!

236
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,001
You're not even a has-been!

237
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:14,587
You're a never-was!

238
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:19,966
Go!

239
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,012
Come on, pick it up!

240
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:35,395
Form a line here!
Let's go seven on seven

241
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,022
Check it out, our new quarterback

242
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:50,072
We're in business now

243
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,160
You're late

244
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,618
Car trouble

245
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:59,038
You still got an arm?

246
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,168
Hey, Falco

247
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,296
Go!

248
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:30,061
That's gonna leave a mark

249
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,481
-Leo, Franklin's down again
-I'm okay

250
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:37,234
I'm okay I'm okay

251
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,026
Let's play some football!

252
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:07,005
Danny Bateman

253
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,049
Shane Falco

254
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,217
Nice pop, Danny

255
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,343
Thanks, coach

256
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:15,220
In practice, we don't hit the fellows
with the red shirts on

257
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:19,598
I know, but I see that red and I just
want to go after it like a bull

258
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:22,685
Okay, Danny

259
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:24,561
Huddle up!

260
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:33,151
Get used to setting up on the run
Move fast, think even faster

261
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:36,236
-you'll live longer
-I'm very interested in that

262
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,446
Huddle up!

263
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,121
Hey! Shane Falco

264
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:52,123
I lost a ton of money on
that Sugar Bowl of yours

265
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,292
What a bloody shambles that was

266
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:57,336
You could smell the stink
all the way back in Wales

267
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,297
Nice meeting you

268
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:43,496
Ready!

269
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:47,332
Ready!

270
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,262
Hut!

271
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:17,272
Shit! I forgot about the whole red
shirt thing! This game's confusing

272
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,693
Remember

273
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:25,445
Red means stop

274
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:27,446
Like a streetlight, right?

275
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,199
-yeah
-Get on up

276
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:34,368
Go ahead I'm gonna lie here
a moment and collect my thoughts

277
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:36,203
Work shit out, right?

278
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:46,169
-you should be glad he's on your side
-yeah

279
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:59,554
-So you have a cheer or something?
-Are you ready?

280
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:03,224
Let's hear it for the quarterback
Hey-hey, ho-ho

281
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:06,643
Could anyone play better?
Say-say, no-no

282
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,478
Tackle, tackle, tackle, tackle
Tack, tack, tack

283
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:12,397
Show those others boys what they
Lack, lack, lack

284
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:15,358
If I gave you a dollar
you could keep most of the change

285
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:18,819
'Cause all I really want
is a "quarterback!"

286
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:23,364
California oranges, Texas cactus

287
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,575
We think your team
Needs a little practice

288
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,244
Sit 'em in a highchair
Feed 'em with a spoon

289
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:33,246
Roll 'em up in toilet paper
Kick 'em to the moon!

290
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,249
-That was great, thank you
-Thank you

291
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,332
Can you dance?

292
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:49,592
Let me have some of that duck

293
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,262
-What the hell is this?
-Chinese spareribs

294
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:57,265
If you don't want it,
get the fuck out of here

295
00:23:57,515 --> 00:24:00,559
I'm trying to figure out how
the Chinaman over here

296
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,519
Gets 700 pounds off
of eating this shit

297
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:05,605
I'm Japanese, not Chinese

298
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:07,773
-Same difference
-What?

299
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:09,274
It's the same difference!

300
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,317
All that big--

301
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:16,613
Nigger, please

302
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:20,282
You do know Japan and China are
two different countries, right?

303
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,284
-you do know I got a atlas, bitch
-Really, gangster?

304
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:24,410
Yeah

305
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,459
We're on the same team! We're on
the same team! Now chill out!

306
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:37,295
-The mick's right
-I'm not a mick! I'm bloody Welsh!

307
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:40,297
Whatever

308
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:43,299
-I'm going to sit with the deaf kid!
-Jesus Christ!

309
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:46,636
Praise His glory, Nigel!
you praise His glory!

310
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:53,766
Smear their blood all over town

311
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:56,726
Punch 'em, hit 'em
Make it last

312
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,813
Come on, boys, let's kick some ass!

313
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:08,318
I played one game in the pros,
I blew out my knee and that was it

314
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,695
Shit

315
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,615
All I want to do is score one touchdown
before I hang up my pads That's it

316
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:16,575
You'll get it

317
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:30,461
Hey, man

318
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,838
Wilkinson! Earl Wilkinson!

319
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:38,342
I knew I recognized you, man!
I knew it!

320
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:40,510
You played for Minnesota, baby!

321
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:44,388
Oh, shit! Earl Wilkinson, man!
Oh, my God!

322
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:48,433
You'd have been All-Pro if
you hadn't beat up them cops!

323
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:53,354
What I had meant to say
was "allegedly"

324
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:57,440
Allegedly beat up them cops
and because

325
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:02,360
A good Christian boy like you
would never do nothing like that!

326
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:03,819
That's right

327
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,364
The way I heard it, my man didn't
even do nothing anyway!

328
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,658
Them cops were just jealous of
the black man

329
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:12,493
Hear what I'm saying?
My boy been living large!

330
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:15,954
I can't stand the cops!
I better not see a cop!

331
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:20,374
-I'll whup a cop's ass! Believe it!
-I'm a cop

332
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,380
Look!

333
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,382
Bundt cake!

334
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:36,553
-Look at these yummy little monkeys!
-Hello!

335
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,929
Oh, hey

336
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:41,724
You-- yeah

337
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:46,936
-Are you Heather and Dawn?
-yep, we sure are

338
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:48,937
You don't know how excited I am

339
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:52,481
That I actually have some girls
with dance experience!

340
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:55,984
-I'm excited too!
-I know! Me too, too

341
00:26:56,526 --> 00:27:00,404
So Heather, you were in Cats,
which is so terrific--

342
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,407
No, Pussycats

343
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:06,659
You know, the club next to the airport?
Pussycats?

344
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:13,748
-That style of dancing would be--
-Is lap-dancing a style?

345
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:15,708
No I mean

346
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,919
Oh, my God, I forgot
to tell you something

347
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:20,419
What?

348
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,005
Oh, she always does that

349
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,510
I've seen all I need to see

350
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,428
No way! I'm so excited!

351
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:32,513
Go suit up

352
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:35,765
- Go down the tunnel and to the left
-Okay

353
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:41,977
If you guys have any friends down at
the club, would you send them over?

354
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:45,438
-Sure
-yeah, absolutely

355
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,565
Where are you going, number 48?

356
00:27:57,906 --> 00:27:59,408
I was watching you today

357
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,909
You looked good

358
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:05,287
Good release, strong arm
you're gonna do fine

359
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:06,913
Thanks

360
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:08,456
I'm Annabelle Farrell

361
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:10,332
-Shane Falco
-I know

362
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,877
I remember you from the
'96 Sugar Bowl game

363
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:16,838
Didn't anybody have anything
better to do that day?

364
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:21,008
You should get some help
to turn this back over

365
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,177
Yeah, I was thinking I'd call AAA
later or something

366
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:30,848
-Do you want a lift?
-yeah

367
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:33,851
Yeah, that would be great Thanks

368
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:40,939
Why'd you stay in the pocket
at practice?

369
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,858
I don't comment to quarterbacks
about style but

370
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:47,360
You need to keep scrambling
against Detroit, with Prescott back

371
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:50,363
-Prescott hasn't crossed
-Sunday

372
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:53,324
-It's a secret so you can't prepare
-How do you know?

373
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,159
My friend's a cheerleader for Detroit
She tipped me

374
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:58,953
He's left-sided, shotgun
formation, roll right

375
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,913
Van Gundy's on the right

376
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:03,873
He's been All-Pro 2 years,
but one of my cheerleaders

377
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,417
Is friends with a girl
who broke up with him

378
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,086
He's been drinking ever
since she left him

379
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:13,339
He's hung over! He's a good second
slower off the snap than usual

380
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,132
I'll stick to the right side

381
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:17,926
Unless what they say
about Martinez is true

382
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:23,889
-That was fun
-This is great! you live out here?

383
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,974
Which one's yours?

384
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,184
Here you see that white yacht
with the satellite dish?

385
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,896
I'm the old boat next to it,
covered in seagull shit

386
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,982
What did you name her?

387
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,233
Phyxsius.

388
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:42,194
-Phyxsius, what does that mean?
-"Putting to flight"

389
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:47,156
You want to come onboard for a beer?

390
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:51,910
Nothing personal, but I don't
date football players

391
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:53,911
I don't blame you

392
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,538
Not even quarterbacks?

393
00:29:55,997 --> 00:30:00,333
Especially not quarterbacks you guys
are the biggest babies of all

394
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,251
The biggest babies?

395
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:03,919
Yeah

396
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:07,464
-Thanks for the ride
-Good luck on Sunday

397
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,049
-Be careful out there
-I will

398
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,933
Shane

399
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:25,019
What's up?

400
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,145
Just

401
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,356
Watching the game

402
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:33,484
Nervous?

403
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:35,943
No

404
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm good

405
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:40,948
Like a duck on a pond

406
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:43,950
On the surface everything
looks calm but

407
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:47,494
Beneath the water, those feet
are churning a mile a minute

408
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:50,205
You'll be fine

409
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:53,958
Find a way to lead your team
Earn their respect

410
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:55,959
Yeah

411
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,962
How are you doing?

412
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:01,964
Me?

413
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:06,133
I'm just another duck on the pond

414
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:10,971
Coach, can I ask you a question?

415
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,974
-yeah, shoot
-Why me?

416
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:21,103
I look at you and I see two men

417
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:24,313
The man you are,
and the man you ought to be

418
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:26,983
Someday, those two will meet

419
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:29,985
Make for a hell of a football player

420
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:36,449
Get some sleep, kiddo

421
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:39,451
You play professional
football tomorrow

422
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:59,174
Welcome to Nextel Stadium,
in our nation's capital.

423
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:02,009
I'm Pat Summerall and
with me is John Madden

424
00:32:02,176 --> 00:32:06,471
Detroit bought an entire semi-pro
team once the strike happened.

425
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:09,307
Washington is going with
a bunch of unknowns.

426
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:12,100
But we'll see a few guys
we know today.

427
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,645
Like Shane Falco, that talented
quarterback who fell out of sight...

428
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,355
...after a disastrous showing
in the Sugar Bowl.

429
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,070
Having a little snacky-poo
before the game?

430
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:31,031
-It does a body good
-you are one crazy son of a bitch

431
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,033
-you know how I know that?
-How?

432
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,119
Because only you'd eat eggs
before a game!

433
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,662
I need to bulk up

434
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:39,162
-you want one?
-No!

435
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:41,039
It's good for you

436
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:53,048
Sentinels, listen up

437
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:58,052
Welcome to professional football

438
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:03,223
Some will say that your
accomplishments

439
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:08,059
Will soon be forgotten, you're not
real players, this isn't a real team

440
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:10,353
And I say that is bullshit!

441
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:15,149
Because as of today, you're all
professional football players

442
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:19,319
You're being paid to play
I want you to remember that because

443
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:23,113
The men whose places you've taken
forgot that a long time ago

444
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:25,448
Bring it in here

445
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:27,408
Bring it in, guys

446
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,160
Let's play some football!

447
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,078
-DC!
-All right!

448
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:34,580
For some of these players,
this is another shot.

449
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:37,165
And a last shot for a guy like Falco.

450
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:39,417
Remember that beating he took
from Florida?

451
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:45,087
That's nothing compared to those
beatings he took in Seattle.

452
00:33:45,338 --> 00:33:48,549
One thing we do know is that
Falco can take a hit

453
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:52,344
Well, I'll tell you, he's sure
had a lot of practice at it.

454
00:33:59,182 --> 00:34:03,227
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington Sentinels!

455
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:12,109
-Did you see that?
-That's a pretty good hit

456
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:17,571
Will the medical trainers please
report to the east tunnel?

457
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,410
Maybe he was a little
overanxious, huh?

458
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:31,081
And now, the rest of
the Washington Sentinels.

459
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:53,765
Kick-off!

460
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:03,314
Let's go, let's go!

461
00:35:05,357 --> 00:35:09,152
There can only be one leader out
there, all right? you be it

462
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,203
-That's where I stand
-No, it's not

463
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,746
-That's my spot in the huddle
-It's not

464
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:26,624
-Get to your spot
-Let's go, chopstick!

465
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,292
Let's play football! What do you say?

466
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:38,424
-It's my spot now!
-Not for long, you tub of rice shit!

467
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,634
What's the problem?

468
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:42,177
You can't do jack shit!

469
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:45,596
-Pork rice!
-I'm Japanese, not Chinese!

470
00:35:45,805 --> 00:35:47,306
Don't mess with my brother

471
00:35:47,556 --> 00:35:49,182
What's going on?

472
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:52,185
Something seems to be going on
in the huddle.

473
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:56,188
Falco's on his back.
-Come on

474
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:59,274
They haven't had a play yet
and Falco's down.

475
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:03,193
He got hit by his own guy! He was
looking out his earhole for a minute!

476
00:36:03,402 --> 00:36:05,111
This isn't a good sign.

477
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:09,614
-Am I hurt already?
-Near knocked your head off

478
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:11,199
Let's go

479
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:15,202
Come on, get it together!

480
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:20,498
I'm the quarterback I'm the only one
who talks in the huddle

481
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:22,666
-But he was in my spot
-I don't care!

482
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:24,209
Now huddle up

483
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:33,467
If you've got something to say,
raise your hand

484
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,176
Is that understood?

485
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:39,679
Suppose you don't feel good
Or you're hurt

486
00:36:40,263 --> 00:36:42,223
Tell me before the huddle starts
Okay?

487
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:44,224
Okay, here we go

488
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:47,477
DC Right, Switch 25 Blast--

489
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:50,229
What?

490
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,230
-To the left?
-The right

491
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:53,357
The left!

492
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:59,235
Be quiet or they'll hear us,
and then what?

493
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:04,281
Play game!

494
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:07,158
Number 16 on the offense! 5 yards!

495
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,744
Pat, so far the Sentinels

496
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:13,247
Have minus 10 yards offensively

497
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,707
I've seen monkey-shit fights
at the zoo more organized!

498
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:22,379
DC Right pro 424 Tomahawk,
on one, on one Ready?

499
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:32,594
Ready?

500
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:36,597
I'm coming for you, Footsteps!

501
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:40,851
Green 22!

502
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:42,769
Hut, hut! Hut!

503
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:46,772
Come on, Shane!

504
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,361
You could hear Falco's fillings
drop all the way up here!

505
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:58,281
Detroit takes over the football
with excellent field position.

506
00:37:58,406 --> 00:37:59,907
-Give me an S!
-S!

507
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:01,575
-Give me an E!
-E!

508
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:03,285
-Give me an N!
-N!

509
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:04,910
-Give me a T!
-T!

510
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:06,329
Give me a

511
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:07,830
-I!
-I!

512
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,249
We'll get them next time

513
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,755
Eagle over cover four!

514
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,298
On three, get ready!

515
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:25,344
All day, blue eyes!
It's Christmas morning

516
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:28,304
And Santa's coming down
the chimney!

517
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:32,307
I'm gonna bury your family!
I'm gonna bury your dog!

518
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,516
Champ, champ!

519
00:38:39,604 --> 00:38:40,605
Now that's football!

520
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:42,564
You get it? you like it?

521
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:49,320
The Sentinels set a record for
penalties in the first 3 minutes!

522
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:53,323
We 're waiting for the stats on that.
-Personal foul!

523
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:58,369
Number 56 on the defense!
Half the distance to the goal!

524
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,787
Bateman on that one
Just a cheap shot

525
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:05,332
-That should be worse than a penalty.
-They're walking right through us!

526
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:11,253
Touchdown, Detroit!

527
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:17,842
Don't worry about it

528
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,355
Let's go!

529
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,444
Double slot zag, okay?

530
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:44,778
-What?
-I don't feel too good

531
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:46,947
-Suck it up
-Come on!

532
00:39:47,698 --> 00:39:48,990
Jesus Christ!

533
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:55,370
-Eggs!
-That's ripe!

534
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:58,998
What'd you eat, man?

535
00:39:59,415 --> 00:40:02,417
If we don't move,
I'm going to blow chow, too

536
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:06,378
We're in a huddle!
Double slot zag, 88--

537
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:09,631
Jesus!

538
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:11,424
Goddamn!

539
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:15,636
I tried to tell you, I can't be around
somebody puking or I start puking

540
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:17,386
Shit

541
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:20,431
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

542
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:21,723
On three

543
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:26,519
Everyone move left Ready
Hut, hut, hut

544
00:40:30,814 --> 00:40:32,399
What the hell is that?

545
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:34,483
What?

546
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,737
John, how many years we been
calling games together?

547
00:40:40,029 --> 00:40:40,780
19, I think.

548
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:42,364
Ever seen that?

549
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,659
Not on a football field

550
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:50,453
-What are they doing?
-Beats me

551
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:54,707
Look at it this way It's the first
thing we've done together as a team

552
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,418
-Hey!
-Clean it up! Let's go!

553
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,543
Break!

554
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,556
Ready? Blue 42!

555
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,392
Blue 42!

556
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:21,728
Hut!

557
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:41,451
First down, Washington.

558
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,412
-Was it out of bounds?
-yes, on 23

559
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:50,458
-Blue Right 60 X Post
-Blue Right 60 X Post!

560
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:52,751
Let's go, let's go!

561
00:42:09,514 --> 00:42:11,474
Now we rolling!

562
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:14,518
Signs of life from Washington here.

563
00:42:14,518 --> 00:42:18,688
That last completion by Falco puts
them back in field goal range

564
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,815
-Field goal, let's go!
-Field goal

565
00:42:21,064 --> 00:42:21,898
Nigel

566
00:42:24,526 --> 00:42:28,863
It's over the bar, not under
Okay? Go get 'em

567
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:32,115
-Hold that
-Here comes the field goal team.

568
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:35,784
A 40-yard attempt for kicker
Nigel Gruff, against the wind.

569
00:42:35,993 --> 00:42:40,705
Here's the guy from Wales, and he's
kicking his first field goal ever.

570
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:42,747
This is a tough distance.

571
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:01,721
Yeah, she's there! She's there!

572
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:05,849
-Boom! Boom!
Nigel Gruffkicks and scores!

573
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:10,561
Halftime score:
Washington 3, Detroit 14.

574
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:25,822
That's the second time
a Washington player has been...

575
00:43:26,114 --> 00:43:29,533
-knocked out by his own teammate
-There's a rule in sports:

576
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:32,911
Don't do anything great if you
can't handle the congratulations

577
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:34,913
-There is?
-yep

578
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,540
-Give me an S!
-S!

579
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:39,582
-Give me an E!
-E!

580
00:43:39,582 --> 00:43:40,875
-Give me an N!
-N!

581
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:42,669
-Give me a T!
-T!

582
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:44,670
Give me a

583
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,934
All right, let's go!

584
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,610
Touchdown, Smith! That one gets
the Sentinels back into the game.

585
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,571
This guy is a heck of a player,
but I don't know him.

586
00:44:18,696 --> 00:44:21,614
And according to the Sentinels,
it says Ray Smith is--

587
00:44:21,865 --> 00:44:24,492
That's weird! No college given,
no high school.

588
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:27,536
He 's been a resident
of the state of Maryland...

589
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:30,705
The last 2 years,
and he likes to embroider!

590
00:44:30,997 --> 00:44:33,749
-He does fancy work with the ball
-Weird

591
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,005
Ready!

592
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:46,717
Green 11 !

593
00:44:47,635 --> 00:44:49,053
Green 11 !

594
00:44:55,098 --> 00:44:57,684
Falco's sacked and the ball
comes loose.

595
00:44:57,893 --> 00:45:00,895
It's Detroit's ball with
only a minute remaining.

596
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,107
Danny, Danny, Danny

597
00:45:06,649 --> 00:45:08,609
I need that ball Get me the ball

598
00:45:08,734 --> 00:45:09,652
You need the ball

599
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:11,653
-Get me the ball
-The ball

600
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:13,154
Are you gonna get me the ball?

601
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,992
I hope he doesn't kill somebody

602
00:45:22,078 --> 00:45:23,954
I'm back! I'm back!

603
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:25,664
Get the ball!

604
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:43,635
I got it!

605
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:46,638
Now that is all-Madden team!

606
00:45:46,722 --> 00:45:48,097
-you're the man
-I'm the man!

607
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:51,058
-you got me the ball
-I got you the ball!

608
00:45:57,646 --> 00:45:59,607
-Go sit down now, Danny
-Okay

609
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:05,110
Number 56 recovers the ball.
-Falco!

610
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:08,654
We gotta pass
It's gotta be in the end zone

611
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:12,200
DC Right, Zig, 90 Eagle
you can do this

612
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:14,784
All right? Let's do it! Come on!

613
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:31,714
-Blue, 25!
-Here comes the pain, baby!

614
00:46:31,714 --> 00:46:33,965
Blue, 25!

615
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:38,677
-Check!
-What are you doing?

616
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:39,804
Check!

617
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:43,681
Black 32!

618
00:46:43,807 --> 00:46:45,682
-What?
-He's changing the play

619
00:46:45,808 --> 00:46:47,768
He's checking off the run
It's a pass!

620
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:53,980
Shit!

621
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,836
Falco calls an audible
at the line of scrimmage...

622
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:26,839
...and Cochran almost has a touchdown!
Heartbreaker for Washington.

623
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:38,849
Final score:
Washington 10, Detroit 14.

624
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:42,018
I didn't want Cochran
to have that ball

625
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:44,144
-I read blitz
-Bullshit

626
00:47:44,352 --> 00:47:47,314
I put the game in your hands
you got scared

627
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:48,731
I read blitz

628
00:47:52,984 --> 00:47:55,903
Winners always want the ball
when the game's on the line

629
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:35,892
WFAN, the Sports Fan's Show.
How do you feel about the strike?

630
00:48:35,934 --> 00:48:40,479
The fans are getting screwed. I got
season tickets I can't give away!

631
00:48:40,938 --> 00:48:44,399
-What about the replacement players?
-They're nobodies.

632
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:55,407
At first I was afraid
I was petrified

633
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:59,952
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side

634
00:48:59,952 --> 00:49:03,913
But then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong

635
00:49:04,164 --> 00:49:05,206
And I grew strong

636
00:49:05,415 --> 00:49:07,916
Why'd you play that dumb-ass song?

637
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,960
I put on The Commodores
That shit just came on

638
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,379
Can somebody please cut
that bullshit off?

639
00:49:14,337 --> 00:49:18,175
-We did the best we could do
-you don't get points for trying

640
00:49:18,424 --> 00:49:20,926
Let's face it, boys,
we screwed the pooch today

641
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,930
Hey, there they are!

642
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:27,973
Ladies and gentlemen

643
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:30,933
Your Washington Sentinels!

644
00:49:33,978 --> 00:49:38,106
He's the luckiest guy here At least
he couldn't hear the booing today!

645
00:49:39,982 --> 00:49:42,443
Hello! Anyone home?
Did I hear an echo?

646
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,946
Where'd McGinty get Rain Man?
Special Olympics?

647
00:49:46,196 --> 00:49:49,949
No wonder they couldn't win
He can't even order a drink!

648
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:56,578
-Lay off
-Lighten up

649
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,247
It's not like he can hear

650
00:49:58,539 --> 00:49:59,331
I can

651
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:05,961
What's that say?

652
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:11,006
"One good thing about being deaf,
you can ignore the assholes"

653
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:15,260
You asshole

654
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,011
That's funny

655
00:50:24,183 --> 00:50:25,976
It's cool, it's cool!

656
00:50:28,562 --> 00:50:29,979
You had enough?

657
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,357
You got shit for brains,
but you've got balls

658
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:35,525
Thank you

659
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:41,195
Danny, remember what I told you
about red shirts in practice?

660
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,990
-Forget about it
-Okay

661
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:45,198
Martel

662
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:55,999
Who's the man? Who's the man?

663
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,000
Come on! Come on!

664
00:51:03,046 --> 00:51:05,006
Come on, come on! Stop!

665
00:51:06,506 --> 00:51:08,425
Let's play football, bitch!

666
00:51:13,596 --> 00:51:15,597
We are all God's children here!

667
00:51:28,524 --> 00:51:32,360
"And deliver thee into the hands
of brutish men!"

668
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,533
Ezekiel 21 :31

669
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,496
This is some old bullshit!

670
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,082
It's more of a homecoming for you.

671
00:51:50,082 --> 00:51:52,083
You gonna be a funny man?

672
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:55,044
Bateman! Wilkinson! Come on,
guys, what are you doing?

673
00:51:56,294 --> 00:51:58,046
Can't we all just get along?

674
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:02,216
Come on

675
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:06,094
Why are we the only ones in this jail?

676
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:09,221
-Simple They're winners
-Hell, no Not tonight

677
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:13,057
That was pretty sweet, you
sitting on Wilson's head, Jumbo

678
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:16,059
Thanks, Jamal

679
00:52:22,398 --> 00:52:24,399
He wasn't the only one
who kicked ass

680
00:52:24,649 --> 00:52:27,068
You the man tonight,
Clifford Franklin!

681
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:29,653
What?

682
00:52:30,112 --> 00:52:32,323
You were hiding behind the jukebox
Wasn't he?

683
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:39,494
At first, I admit, I was afraid

684
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:43,414
-Shit, I was petrified
-you were petrified?

685
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:46,291
Thinking I could never live
without you by my side

686
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:50,252
-The Lord is by your side
-Have mercy

687
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:55,089
Then I spent so many nights,
thinking how you did me wrong

688
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:59,134
And I grew strong

689
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,261
You know I hate this damn song

690
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,305
I learned how to get along
And so you're back

691
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:06,306
From outer space

692
00:53:06,598 --> 00:53:10,476
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face

693
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:14,604
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key

694
00:53:15,105 --> 00:53:19,108
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

695
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:20,109
Go on, now go

696
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,402
Walk out the door

697
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:27,114
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

698
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:28,115
Remember this?

699
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:31,117
Weren't you the one who tried to
Hurt me with goodbye

700
00:53:31,284 --> 00:53:35,662
Did you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die

701
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:38,706
Oh no, not I
I will survive

702
00:53:40,124 --> 00:53:43,501
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

703
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:47,421
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

704
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,381
And I'll survive

705
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:51,132
I will survive

706
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:53,593
Hey, hey

707
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:12,190
It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart

708
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:16,485
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart

709
00:54:16,735 --> 00:54:20,696
But I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself

710
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:25,158
I used to cry
And now I hold my head up high

711
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:27,702
And you see me
-Four, five!

712
00:54:30,162 --> 00:54:31,163
Okay, all right

713
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,501
Frankie

714
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:45,507
If anything like this bar fight
happens again

715
00:54:45,757 --> 00:54:48,468
There'll be no place
on the team for any of you

716
00:54:50,177 --> 00:54:53,179
-Do I make myself perfectly clear?
-yes, sir

717
00:54:53,471 --> 00:54:55,181
And just for the record

718
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:59,685
I would love to have seen
Martel get his ass kicked

719
00:55:00,185 --> 00:55:01,186
Let's get out of here!

720
00:55:09,192 --> 00:55:10,317
Hey, Shane

721
00:55:12,403 --> 00:55:14,195
What are you doing?

722
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,446
My job

723
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:20,242
-you're a professional football player
-Sure, this week

724
00:55:20,576 --> 00:55:23,202
When that's all over, you know

725
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:26,830
I'll be back here
I don't want to lose my customers

726
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:31,417
I was on my way to work
Do you need a ride?

727
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:33,210
I'm good

728
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:37,213
-I got my truck back
-How is it?

729
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,216
Flatter But it runs

730
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:46,471
And you? How are you running
after last night?

731
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:49,765
You hear about that?

732
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:52,224
I think the whole town heard
about that

733
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,644
Is that from the game or the fight?

734
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,229
I'm not sure It's all blurred
into one big beating

735
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:02,775
The good news is,
you guys got into a rhythm

736
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:06,486
Apart from that vomiting thing,
which was on Sports Center.

737
00:56:07,236 --> 00:56:08,236
Oh, God

738
00:56:09,237 --> 00:56:11,240
After that,
the team was really clicking

739
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:15,284
Yeah, it was starting
to come together

740
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:16,534
Yeah

741
00:56:18,828 --> 00:56:21,288
-you want to sit down?
-No, I should go

742
00:56:22,873 --> 00:56:24,332
Thanks for coming by

743
00:56:26,251 --> 00:56:28,252
-Wow Ow
-What? What?

744
00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:30,254
Oh Ow!

745
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:31,797
Jesus!

746
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,799
-It looks worse than it feels
-It looks like hell

747
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:38,760
-Then it looks exactly like it feels
-Here

748
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:43,264
"Wild yam"?

749
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:44,265
Yeah

750
00:56:45,265 --> 00:56:49,852
Don't laugh, it works It's great
for sore muscles and bruises

751
00:56:50,602 --> 00:56:53,604
-I use it all the time
-you don't have to do that

752
00:56:53,896 --> 00:56:57,691
You'll put it on? you can't move
This will be a little bit

753
00:56:57,941 --> 00:57:00,444
-Cold!
-Sorry, sorry

754
00:57:02,278 --> 00:57:03,738
Here, your shoulders

755
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:08,408
Better?

756
00:57:08,783 --> 00:57:10,284
Better

757
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,460
You're the first player
I can remember

758
00:57:22,668 --> 00:57:25,338
Who cares more about his teammates
than himself

759
00:57:27,297 --> 00:57:30,674
That's something this team's been
missing for a really long time

760
00:57:32,301 --> 00:57:34,344
It's a good thing you did last night

761
00:57:35,303 --> 00:57:36,387
It was just stupid

762
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,308
Thanks

763
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:47,813
-I'm gonna be late for work
-Practice?

764
00:57:48,313 --> 00:57:49,397
No, actually, I have work

765
00:57:49,856 --> 00:57:53,776
We only make 50 bucks a game
Gotta pay the bills, right?

766
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,445
Mac's, down on A Street
Come in, I'll buy you a beer

767
00:57:58,321 --> 00:57:59,530
All right, I'll do that

768
00:58:03,324 --> 00:58:04,826
Keep putting that yam on

769
00:58:22,715 --> 00:58:23,840
Guys!

770
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,348
You gotta be kidding

771
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:36,349
I didn't park in your space

772
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,435
No, no, no

773
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:41,520
But unfortunately, you did park
in Lamont's space

774
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:46,774
-He's not nearly as lenient as I am
-On three, fellas

775
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:57,949
-We got this We got this
-you want to put the car back?

776
00:58:58,366 --> 00:59:00,368
This is none of your business

777
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:02,369
Shane is our business

778
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:05,371
-We're the guards
-And we protect our quarterback

779
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:11,376
This is funny to them bozos
you got jokes? you got jokes?

780
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:14,003
That's your ride right there,
ain't it?

781
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:15,880
Yeah

782
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:23,385
That's my windshield--!

783
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:25,513
-Now put the car back
-Son of a bitch!

784
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:27,722
Son of a--

785
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,558
Oh, son of a bitch? I'm a son
of a bitch? Son of a bitch?

786
00:59:33,852 --> 00:59:35,395
Stop, stop, stop!

787
00:59:35,603 --> 00:59:37,397
Come on, goddamn it, help me!

788
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,940
You're gonna pay for this!

789
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:44,402
No, I'm not And stop messing with
my man, that includes his ride

790
00:59:44,568 --> 00:59:45,903
And wax that motherfucker

791
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:48,405
Give it a tune-up too

792
00:59:50,407 --> 00:59:51,782
Ready to go to practice?

793
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:54,410
Yeah, let's do that

794
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,744
-How's that arm?
-Good

795
00:59:57,453 --> 00:59:58,705
What's that smell?

796
00:59:58,754 --> 00:59:59,755
Wild yam

797
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,174
-That's nice
-you like that?

798
01:00:03,759 --> 01:00:07,846
And so, boys and girls,
if anybody does have any firearms...

799
01:00:08,096 --> 01:00:10,766
...you need to turn them in
as soon as possible.

800
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:12,184
No questions asked

801
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:14,937
Understood?

802
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:22,778
All right

803
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,364
Okay, coach, it's all yours

804
01:00:32,788 --> 01:00:36,959
Last Sunday, I saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could

805
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,003
To win the football game

806
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,257
We lost Not because
of effort or desire

807
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:47,803
But because of lack of leadership
and trust One's been resolved

808
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:51,807
But leadership means nothing if
we don't believe in each other

809
01:00:51,807 --> 01:00:55,436
Players spend years together
before they develop trust

810
01:00:55,811 --> 01:00:59,189
I'm asking you to do it in a week,
not reasonable but

811
01:00:59,398 --> 01:01:01,817
These aren't reasonable times

812
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:06,822
I know you all have concerns
about this Sunday

813
01:01:10,284 --> 01:01:11,827
But a real man

814
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:16,832
Admits his fears

815
01:01:19,126 --> 01:01:21,420
I'm asking you
to do that here, tonight

816
01:01:24,006 --> 01:01:25,424
Who wants to start?

817
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:26,842
Let's talk about fears

818
01:01:27,927 --> 01:01:29,345
Fears Fears

819
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,853
I'm scared of spiders, coach

820
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,858
-That's not what I meant
-I'm afraid of spiders too

821
01:01:43,234 --> 01:01:45,903
Goddamn spiders freak me, too, fellas

822
01:01:47,363 --> 01:01:48,864
Well, I didn't mean that--

823
01:01:49,031 --> 01:01:52,076
Ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm?

824
01:01:52,326 --> 01:01:54,203
-Crawling on you?
-Damn!

825
01:01:54,453 --> 01:01:57,873
Thanks, Jumbo you can just
rock me to sleep tonight

826
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:03,879
Okay, that's great, but I'm talking
about what scares us on the field

827
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,841
Like spiders on the field?

828
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:09,885
Can we get beyond the spiders, please?

829
01:02:11,387 --> 01:02:12,221
Bees

830
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,098
Bees?

831
01:02:14,348 --> 01:02:15,891
-Bees?
-Bees

832
01:02:18,185 --> 01:02:21,397
Anybody here afraid of anything
other than insects?

833
01:02:22,148 --> 01:02:22,940
Come on

834
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:25,151
Quicksand

835
01:02:26,444 --> 01:02:29,906
Shit, yeah!
Quicksand's a scary mother, man

836
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:33,409
It sucks you right in and even
if you scream, you get that muck--

837
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,411
I don't think that's it

838
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:38,956
That's not what he had in mind

839
01:02:39,373 --> 01:02:41,918
-What's he talking about, then?
-Ask him

840
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:46,088
What's up, Shane?

841
01:02:49,091 --> 01:02:50,384
You're playing

842
01:02:51,052 --> 01:02:55,348
And you think everything is going
fine But then one thing goes wrong

843
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:56,349
And another

844
01:02:57,934 --> 01:02:59,185
And another

845
01:02:59,435 --> 01:03:03,981
You try to fight back, but the harder
you fight, the deeper you sink

846
01:03:04,941 --> 01:03:06,192
Until you can't move

847
01:03:08,236 --> 01:03:09,570
You can't breathe

848
01:03:11,322 --> 01:03:13,366
Because you're in over your head

849
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:16,953
Like quicksand

850
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,130
That's some deep shit
Some deep shit

851
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:32,218
Anything else?

852
01:03:34,554 --> 01:03:36,556
-Going back to the mini-mart
-The shipping yard

853
01:03:36,973 --> 01:03:38,099
The auto plant

854
01:03:38,975 --> 01:03:39,976
Prison

855
01:03:40,977 --> 01:03:42,186
Yeah, all right

856
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:49,986
The truth is, you guys have been
given something

857
01:03:50,028 --> 01:03:51,988
That every athlete dreams of

858
01:03:53,323 --> 01:03:55,033
A second chance

859
01:03:55,992 --> 01:03:57,243
And you're afraid of blowing it

860
01:03:58,369 --> 01:03:59,370
We all are

861
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:02,499
But now our fear is shared
and we can overcome it together

862
01:04:02,999 --> 01:04:06,503
Let's lose that fear this Sunday
and put it into San Diego!

863
01:04:07,337 --> 01:04:08,505
Come on!

864
01:04:18,098 --> 01:04:21,017
Another vicious hit by
the All-Pro Hank Morris.

865
01:04:21,017 --> 01:04:23,019
That's his third of the game.

866
01:04:23,061 --> 01:04:24,604
It's just me, dickhead

867
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:27,982
I tell you, he is really putting
a hurt on Falco.

868
01:04:28,233 --> 01:04:31,027
I'm not sure how much more
of this abuse he can take

869
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:34,030
Huddle up!

870
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:35,448
Huddle up!

871
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:40,578
Same play, except let Morris by
Nobody touch him

872
