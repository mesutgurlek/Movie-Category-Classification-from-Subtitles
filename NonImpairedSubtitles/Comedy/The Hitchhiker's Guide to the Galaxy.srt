Hello, Humma.

751
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,000
- [priest] Join us. Sit down.
- Good to see you. Thanks. All right.

[Humma] The handkerchief is coming.

Let us pray the Almighty will exhale
a breath of compassion on us all.

so that it may wipe us clean.

[Humma] Zaphod Beeblebrox,
our infamous President.

What brings you to our humble planet?

766
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,100
[Zaphod] Oh, l think you know

No, l don't think l do.

But we both know... you do.

Your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze.

771
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,200
[Zaphod] That's funny.
During the campaign, Humma,

772
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,700
when you were my opponent
running against me,

773
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,800
you said l was stupid.

774
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,900
The election is ancient history,
Zaphod, but...

775
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,200
...if memory serves, you won,

776
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,600
proving that good looks
and charm win

777
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,600
over brilliance
and the ability to govern.

778
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,100
And, incidentally, you are stupid.

779
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,800
[Arthur] Excuse me, Mr Humma, sir.

780
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,100
Uh, l just want to say, there's been
some sort of terrible mix up

781
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,500
'cause, actually, he's not with us.

782

We came to worship you.
He followed us and...

783
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,400
He grew, didn't he. He's not that tall.

784
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,500
You didn't come half-way across the

Why are you here?

Of course not,

You've grown, obviously.

790
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
- [Zaphod] Aggh! Oomph!
- Wait! We don't know why we're here.

791

We were trying to get to Magrathea

- [Humma] A gun.

- A gun?
- A very special gun.

Deep Thought. l'm a-coming.

[Arthur chuckles] So, this is how
it's all going to end, is it?

1206
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,300
Me, alone on a dead planet,
with a manically depressed robot.

[Marvin]
You think you've got problems.

1208
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,500
What if you are
a manically depressed robot?

1209
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,800
[man] Excuse me.

1210
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,800
- [Arthur] Aaaaagghhh!
- [man] Whoa, whoa.

1211
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,500
- Who are you?
- No, uh, my name is not important.

1212
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,100
Uh, you must come with me.

1213
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,500
- Get away.
- [man] Terrible events are afoot.

1214
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,100
Um, you... you must come
or you'll be late.

1215
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,500
- [Arthur] Late? What for?
- What?

1216
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:27,100
No, no. What's...
what's your name, Earthman?

1217
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,400
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- [man] Well...

1218
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,200
late as in
''the late Dentarthurdent.''

1219
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,900
lt's a sort of threat, do you see? No.

1220

- No.
- [man] Your friends are safe.

1221

- You can trust me.
- A man who won't tell me his name?

1222
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:49,200
Okay, my name is, um...

1223

...my name is... is...
is... Slartibartfast.

Let me show you.

[Marvin] l could calculate your chances
of survival, but you won't like it.

[clank]

Did you know we built planets?

1230
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,700
Oh, yes, fascinating trade.

1231
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:48,400
Doing the, um... doing the coastlines
was always my favorite.

1232
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:54,200
We used to have endless fun doing the
little fiddly bits around the fjords.

1233
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:59,300
But then the galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom-built planets

are a... are a bit of
a luxury commodity...

been a terrible mix-up with your planet.

- And men.
- What?

1238
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,800
Best laid plans of mice and men.

1239

- Gun?
- That Humma sent you for.

- Okay.
- That's stupid.

1281

1286
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,400
[Arthur] So it wasn't destroyed?

1287
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:18,800
Actually, it was.
This is a backup. Earth Mark ll.

1288
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,600
So you... you made the Earth?

it with the one guy who really does.

1345
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,600
Hey, whoops.

1346
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,400
Oh, baby doll.

1347
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,800
Give me that thing.

1348
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:45,600
[sighs] lt won't affect me.
l'm already a woman.

1349
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:47,200
[boom]

1350
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,400
[rumble of grating stone]

1351
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,000
lt's okay.
lt's only a couple of little mice!

1352
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:02,600
[huge rumbling]

1353
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,200
[Slartibartfast] Voil!
Himalayas. Good, eh?

1354
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,000
Earthman, you must realize

1355
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:18,700
that the planet you lived on was
commissioned, paid for and run by mice.

1356
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,800
When you say mice, do you mean
the little furry white creatures

1357
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,800
with whiskers, ears, cheese?

1358
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,800
Yeah, but they're protrusions into our
dimension of hyperintelligent beings.

1359
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,500
l don't know this cheese
of which you speak,

1360
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,300
but they were there on Earth
as mice experimenting on you.

1361
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:44,400
l see where you've become confused now.
You see, we were experimenting on them.

1362
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:48,300
Ah, no, well, yeah, no.
That's what they wanted you to think,

1363
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,400
but you were actually
elements in their computer program.

1364
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,500
[Arthur] Actually, this explains a lot.

1365
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,300
All my life,
l've had this strange feeling

1366
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,400
there's something big and sinister
going on in the world.

1367
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:06,200
No, that's normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe gets that.

1368
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,800
[boom]

1369
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:13,100
Perhaps l'm old and tired,
but the chances of finding out

1370
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,800
what's actually going on
are so absurdly remote

1371
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:19,900
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy.

1372
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,500
l'd much rather be happy
than right any day.

1373
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,700
- And are you?
- Uh... no.

1374
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,400
[laughs] That's where
it all falls down, of course.

1375
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,800
Here you are then.

1376
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,000
ls this...?

1377
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,200
lt's, um... lt's all there.

1378
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,600
You know, it all works.

1379
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,700
Welcome home.

1380
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,500
[all cheer]

1381
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,600
- Hey!
- Hey, man!

1382
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,800
- There you are!
- Surprise!

1383
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,800
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

1384
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,400
ls that tea?

1385
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,800
- First, our hosts attacked us.
- Right.

1386
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:55,400
But then they made up for it
by making us...

1387
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,800
[tearfully] ...this amazing meal.

1388
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,000
lt's so... Everything's right.
Everything's delicious.

1389
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,300
Oh, come on, that's lovely.

1390
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,700
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

1391
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:17,500
[chuckles nervously]
The, um, talking... talking mice. Cool.

1392
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:22,800
- Sit, Earthman.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

1393
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,200
- Please, drink.
- Um, uh, excuse me.

1394
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:30,700
- Uh, is there anything else?
- No, we're quite happy, thank you.

1395
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,500
Um, good, l'll be outside, so...

1396
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,800
You were right.

1397
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,700
- [Mouse] Please, drink.
- Yes.

1398
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,200
He was right.

1399
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,100
Now, to business.

1400
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,000
[both] To business!

1401
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,500
[firmly] Eat!

1402
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,400
- Shh.
- Sorry.

1403
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,000
[Mouse] We've spent a lot of time
on your planet

1404
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
looking for this ultimate question.

1405
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,700
Only to have it blow up
in our faces. Literally.

1406
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,300
Which is why you're here.
We've been offered a lucrative contract

1407
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,400
to do several 5-D TV chat shows.

1408
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,000
But here's the point.
We must have product.

1409
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:08,300
We need the ultimate question,
or one that sounds ultimate.

1410
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,500
- Of course.
- We've rebuilt the planet.

1411
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,700
Now all we need
is the missing piece of the puzzle.

1412
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,900
- Which happens to be your brain.
- Right.

1413
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,400
[Mouse] More tea?

1414
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,200
Sorry, did you just say
you need my brain?

1415
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,500
Yes, to complete the program.

1416
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,200
You can't have my brain. l'm using it.

1417
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:33,200
- Hardly.
- Hardly? Cheeky... Cheeky mouse.

1418
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,200
Zaphod! Trillian!

1419
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,600
- [whirring]
- Ford.

1420
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,200
What was in that food?

1421
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:48,000
What was in my tea?

1422
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,700
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

1423
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,000
[grunts and whimpers]

1424
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,200
Just wait a sodding minute.

1425
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,800
You want a question
that goes with the answer 42?

1426
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,600
What about, what's 6x7?

1427
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:04,200
Or, um, uh, how many Vogons
does it take to change a light bulb?

1428
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:08,100
Here's one: how many roads
must a man walk down?

1429
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,500
Hey, that's not bad.

1430
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:18,000
Fine. Fine, take it, 'cause my head
is filled with questions,

1431
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,300
and no answer to any one of them

1432
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:24,000
has ever brought me
one iota of happiness.

1433
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,700
Except for one.

1434
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,700
The one. The only question
l've ever wanted an answer to.

1435
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,400
ls she the one?

1436
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:34,900
The answer bloody well isn't 42,
it's yes.

1437
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,600
Undoubtedly, unequivocally,
unabashedly, yes.

1438
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:43,600
And for one week,

1439
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:48,400
one week in my sad little...
blip of an existence...

1440
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,200
...it made me happy.

1441
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,300
That's a good answer.

1442
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,600
[mouse] We don't want to be happy.
We want to be famous.

1443
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:03,400
- What's this ''ls she the one'' tripe?
- Take his brain!

1444
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,700
No, don't take the brain!
Don't take the brain, mice!

1445
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,700
[grunts]

1446
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,000
[screams]

1447
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,400
- [screams]
- lt wasn't me!

1448
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,400
- [gibbers]
- [Zaphod] l'm famous.

1449
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,900
Shoot him, quickly, shoot him!

1450
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,400
Oh, bollocks!

1451
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,000
Agghh!

1452
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,900
l'm gonna be sick.

1453
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,200
[coughs] Belgium.

1454
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:44,400
[voices, vibrations]

1455
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,800
Follow me.

1456
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,000
[Vogons] Left, right, left, right.

1457
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,600
Attention!

1458
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,000
[Marvin] Thanks a lot
for leaving me behind.

1459
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,400
Though l can't say l blame you.

1460
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:07,200
Mr President,
we're here for your protection.

1461
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,600
Thanks, man. l appreciate it.

1462
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,000
Fire!

1463
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,400
No! No!

1464
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,600
[Marvin] What's all the fuss about?

1465
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:22,500
Vogons are the worst marksmen
in the galaxy. Ooh.

1466
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:27,700
- For God's sake, stop!
- Cease fire.

1467
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,900
Now l've got a headache...
headache... headache...

1468
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,000
Marvin!

1469
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:50,400
[Zaphod] Oh, no.

1470
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:55,900
- [Ford's battle shriek]
- He's got a towel, run away!

1471
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,100
l'm gonna get us outta here.
How do you drive this thing?

1472
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
We need that gun.

1473
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:11,000
Come on. Get this ship started.
Come on. Start!

1474
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:14,200
Come on. Oh, fire, fire!

1475
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:15,600
Fire, fire!

1476
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,800
[Arthur] Oo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

1477
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,500
[Vogon] He's locked it
from the other side.

1478
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,700
We'll have to go the other way.

1479
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,700
Come on, let's go!

1480
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,500
[shouts]

1481
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,500
Stop!

1482
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,800
[Arthur] Oh, no!

1483
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,700
[Zaphod] Stop it! Stop it!
Stop shooting at us!

1484
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,700
[shooting stops]

1485
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:07,400
Oh, l feel so depressed.

1486
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,700
[Vogons groan]

1487
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:13,800
l can't face another day.

1488
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:17,500
What's the point?

1489
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,800
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1490
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,400
Sorry about your spaceship, Arthur.

1491
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,700
[Vogons groan]

1492
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,100
Marvin, you saved our lives.

1493
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,500
l know. Wretched, isn't it?

1494
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,700
[moans]

1495
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:56,000
You got to ask yourself,
what's the point?

1496
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,800
[workman] Take it away.

1497
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:11,700
You could do all of that, but it's not

l... l... l've just been informed
by some of the lads

01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,100
that since we're so near completion,

1500
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,600
we're gonna go ahead and finish Earth.

1501
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,200
Oh.

1502
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:26,300
We, well, we can put it back exactly
as it was when you left, you know.

1503
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,800
Unless there's, um...

1504
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:33,400
...there's, you know,
anything you want to change.

1505
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:40,800
Something you think
your planet could do without.

1506
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,600
Yeah. Me.

1507
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,300
Oh! Um, hello?

1508
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,100
No, as is. Yep, leave it. Yep.

1509
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,600
Let's go somewhere.

1510
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,300
Definitely. Where did you have in mind?

1511
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,600
l know this great restaurant
at the end of the universe.

1512
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,800
l am a little peckish.

1513
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,600
l need to go to Humma's.
He's got something of mine.

1514
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:15,300
- l think. l'm so confused.
- Don't worry, baby. We'll sort it out.

1515
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,000
All right, let's trip the
light fantastic, baby. Just you and me.

Come on.

1517
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:25,100
- You got your towel?
- Yeah. Why? Am l going to need it?

1518
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,700
- Only always.
- Right. Yeah.

1519
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,700
l wouldn't want to go

1559
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:07,700

<i>''I wouldn't want to go anywhere</i>
