1
00:01:56,082 --> 00:02:00,280
The sweet, uncomplicated
satisfaction of the younger woman.

2
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,514
That fleeting age when everything
just falls right into place.

3
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,489
It's magic time, and it can
render any man...

4
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,855
...anywhere, absolutely helpless.

5
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,761
Some say I'm an expert
on the younger woman.

6
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,801
Guess that's because I've been
dating them for over 40 years.

7
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,375
So, baby, you're rich?

8
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,675
Well, my mother is. Sort of.
I mean, not really.

9
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,751
If she lives within a mile
of here, she's rich.

10
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,151
Well, I guess a hit play will
buy you a house in the Hamptons.

11
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,848
- I'd like to meet your mother.
- No, you wouldn't.

12
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,223
She's great. She's totally brilliant,
but she's not your type.

13
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,854
You're overlooking
one of the great things about me.

14
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,898
I don't have a type.

15
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,296
She's over 30.

16
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,370
Oh, what?

17
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,736
Like you don't know you
have a slight reputation for...

18
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,774
- For?
- For...

19
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,878
...never dating anyone over 30.

20
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:04,915
It just so happens, my dear, that
women of a certain age don't date me.

21
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,279
You ever think of it that way? No.

22
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,421
It's always me.

23
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,814
Hey.

24
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,788
I'll call back Monday.

25
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,226
Say you couldn't find me.

26
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,130
Who?

27
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,200
I'll call her later.

28
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,894
No, no, I have the number.

29
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,630
Yeah.

30
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,882
Make a right.
It's the second driveway on the left.

31
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,279
Right.

32
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,682
Wow.

33
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,884
It's the perfect beach house.

34
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,362
So...

35
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:56,594
...what are we gonna do out here,
just the two of us, for two whole days?

36
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,704
Tell me the truth.
Are you at all glad we waited?

37
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,237
Truth?

38
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,635
No.

39
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:06,506
But I'm extremely glad
we're finally gonna...

40
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,313
Wanna go for a swim?

41
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,807
How long will it take you
to change?

42
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,186
- Thirty seconds.
- Really?

43
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,685
That long?

44
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,255
Oh, Har, by the way,
no smoking in the house.

45
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,914
My mom doesn't allow it.

46
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,585
But she allows you to
strip in the front yard?

47
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,594
Bring guys you're
dating here to...?

48
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,293
She doesn't know everything I do
or when I do it or where I do it.

49
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,539
Okay.
The fabulous two-story living room...

50
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,273
...which, I predict, we will spend
absolutely no time in whatsoever.

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,815
- It's a knockout.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,920
I'm very good at giving this tour,
by the way, although...

53
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,717
...l've never actually done
it while taking off my clothes.

54
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,156
Behind me, the requisite
Hamptons deck...

55
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,228
...complete with
pool and ocean view.

56
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,365
Your pants, please.

57
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,757
Ladies first.

58
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,715
When I first started auctioneering,
someone told me...

59
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,254
...if I was nervous, I should just picture
the audience in their underwear.

60
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,983
This gives that a whole new meaning.

61
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,886
You're not nervous now, are you?

62
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,527
- I'm always a little nervous.
- Put on your bathing suit.

63
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,929
I brought us champagne.
I'll put it on ice.

64
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,925
No, I know. I can't do anything...

65
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,926
Oh, God! What is this?
Okay.

66
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,067
Okay, you stay where you are.
We have a knife.

67
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,136
- Do you live here?
- Look, mister.

68
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,796
I am gonna dial 911,
and you are not gonna move.

69
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,602
- Zoe, hand me the phone.
- You don't understand.

70
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,041
- I'm your daughter's friend.
- Don't think so.

71
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,206
My daughter is in the city. You, what,
wander in here, high on ecstasy?

72
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,079
- Honestly, if you'd just...
- No!

73
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,152
Stay there.
I was in the Israeli army.

74
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,618
I can break you in half.

75
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,089
Hello. Yes! Yes, I have
an intruder in my house.

76
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,954
29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack...

77
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,221
I'm dating your daughter, Marin.

78
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:42,300
She invited me here for the weekend.
She's in her room right now, changing.

79
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,436
You're dating my daughter?

80
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,334
Now, who would have thought
that would be worse news?

81
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,178
Yeah, sorry. False alarm.

82
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,611
No, he's not a burglar.

83
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,775
- He's dating my daughter.
- I had no idea you were coming.

84
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,544
You said you had to write.

85
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,848
I do, but I thought
I would do it out here.

86
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,457
I should have told you
I was bringing someone.

87
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,117
I'm sorry. I should've told
you we were coming.

88
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,456
Obviously. Anyway, here we are.

89
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,928
Hello, I'm the mother.

90
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,589
Harry Sanborn. How are you?

91
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,429
Oh, God, sorry.
This is my friend Harry.

92
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,128
- My mom, Erica. My aunt Zoe.
- Sorry about that.

93
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,503
We just totally spur-of-the-moment
decided to get out of the city.

94
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,371
Good, that's good.

95
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,605
Honey, does Harry have a robe?

96
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,271
You know what?

97
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,477
I think I should just take off, let
you gals enjoy your weekend and...

98
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,882
What?

99
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,352
No, no! Oh, I'm sorry. Of course,
don't do that. That's silly.

100
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,222
Zoe and I will leave...

101
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,296
...and you and Harry stay.

102
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,198
Harry.

103
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,028
I'm sorry.
I apologize about the near arrest.

104
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,667
You were very impressive.
Very strong.

105
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,234
Very...

106
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,036
...macho.

107
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,303
Well, I don't think
I was exactly macho.

108
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,347
Trust me, if I ever catch a guy
in his underwear in my refrigerator...

109
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,679
...I hope I'm half the man
you were, Mrs...

110
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,688
- Mrs...
- Right, okay. Whatever.

111
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,984
Alrighty, then,
I'm definitely gonna hit the road.

112
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,720
Ladies, sensational meeting you.

113
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,124
Doll.

114
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,924
- Give me a call.
- Hold on.

115
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,159
Let's not get so dramatic here.
What are we, four teenagers?

116
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,701
We're sophisticated people.

117
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,534
Why don't we all stay. Your mother
has work, I have papers to grade.

118
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,199
Do your thing, whatever that may be...

119
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,675
...and if we wanna hang out together,
we will.

120
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,612
If we don't, we don't. No reason
we should give up this weekend.

121
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,114
Seriously.

122
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,753
- I can handle it.
- I can totally handle it.

123
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,448
I mean, well, I can handle it.

124
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,487
- Bonjour, Madame Barry.
- Bonjour, Annie.

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,633
Impressive.

126
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,668
She took French lessons
after she and my dad split up.

127
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,602
Part of her "keep busy, don't look
back" program.

128
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,765
- Now she's practically fluent.
- Marin!

129
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,044
- Okay.
- Not bad.

130
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,344
Well, yeah. I am fluent.

131
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,984
I'll be right back.

132
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,564
It's an epidemic.

133
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,606
Buy some things.

134
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,438
How about pasta salad?

135
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,240
We had that last night.

136
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,280
- We did? I don't remember.
- Sure.

137
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,680
Why don't we get a spread
and put it on.

138
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,223
Oh, sorry.

139
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,127
Sorry about that.

140
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,633
- My fault.
- No. It's fine, it's fine.

141
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,570
So, Harry, what do you do?

142
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,403
I'm an owner of a record
company, among other things.

143
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,841
- Which record company?
- Drive-By Records.

144
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,780
Drive-By Records?

145
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,051
Is that a joke? I mean, what is that?

146
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,777
It's a hip-hop label.

147
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:26,982
Hip-hop? Oh, rap. Right, right.
Well, that's interesting.

148
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,658
Let me see if I get
where you're headed here.

149
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,957
I'm sorry, but look,
I hate rap. I do. I really do.

150
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,362
It's just crude and violent
for my taste...

151
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,900
...not to mention
just a tad misogynistic.

152
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,267
Hey, some people see rap as poetry.

153
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,307
Yeah, but how many words
can you rhyme with "bitch"?

154
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,035
Next, please.

155
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,836
How we doing?

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,738
Should have left
when she tried to arrest me.

157
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,979
How's the new play?
Are you getting happy with it?

158
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,590
You know the thing about me.

159
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,954
I'm 90 percent hard work,
10 percent talent.

160
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,655
And so far, the talent part
hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

161
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,389
Right. Right.

162
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,057
- What's your play about?
- About?

163
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,970
I'm not exactly sure,
which is a bit of a problem.

164
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,631
But so far, it's about
a divorced woman, a writer.

165
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,267
She's a high-strung, over-amped,
controlling, know-it-all neurotic...

166
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,879
...who's incredibly cute and lovable.

167
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,615
It's a comedy.

168
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,255
So how did you two meet?

169
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,017
At a wine auction at Christie's.

170
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,686
Harry was the big buyer
of the night.

171
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,992
I kept raising my paddle
just to get her to smile at me.

172
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,068
Before I knew it,
I bought the entire collection.

173
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,034
Every known bottle
of Château Margaux.

174
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,936
After that, the least she could do...

175
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,577
...was share a bottle with me.

176
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,042
Ever been married, Harry?

177
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,608
No.

178
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,612
- No, I haven't.
- Mom.

179
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,081
Wow. Now, why do you think that is?

180
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,653
Well, some people just don't
fit the mold, and so far, you know...

181
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,290
Hey, if it ain't broke...

182
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,255
- Exactly.
- Wait a second.

183
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,950
Aren't you a famous bachelor?

184
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,255
Well, I wouldn't say I'm famous.

185
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,298
Yeah, didn't I read an article
about you in New York magazine?

186
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,495
I guess some people find it interesting
I've escaped the noose for so long.

187
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,970
That was the title,
"The Escape Artist."

188
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,336
I read that article.
That was you?

189
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,138
Well, you were once engaged
to someone really big.

190
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,645
- Who was it? Joan Collins? No.
- No.

191
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,181
- Okay. Carly Simon?
- Somebody cool like that.

192
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,342
- Someone like that.
- Not Martha Stewart.

193
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,784
- No! Not Martha Stewart!
- You could ask him.

194
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,721
No, this is more fun.

195
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,291
It's like I'm not here.

196
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,020
Harry was once
engaged to Diane Sawyer.

197
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,131
- What?
- Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.

198
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,766
- I'm impressed.
- Yeah.

199
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,765
Women your age
love that about me.

200
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,938
- You know what I mean.
- Yes, I do.

201
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,704
I mean, it's not a bad thing
to say, "women your age."

202
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,778
Oh, no. I'm sure it was a compliment.

203
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,312
It's just...

204
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,747
...an accurate observation. It's...
- So when was this?

205
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,514
- The engagement?
- Long time ago.

206
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,852
She was this adorable,
lanky girl from Kentucky...

207
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,551
...with the greatest pair of legs
I have ever seen.

208
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,995
Never understood her ending up on a
job where she never showed them.

209
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,930
You can't be serious.

210
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,503
I mean, she's Diane Sawyer.
She goes into caves in Afghanistan...

211
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,539
...with a shmatte on her head.
Who cares about her legs?

212
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,937
You know what?

213
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,669
I hate to eat and run, but...

214
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,814
- No!
- No, wait. No.

215
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,382
Come on. This is really fascinating,
what's going on at this table.

216
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,645
Zoe teaches women's studies
at Columbia.

217
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,585
- Okay. So this is gonna hurt.
- No.

218
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,622
- Let's take you and Erica.
- Zoe...

219
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:51,286
You've been around the block a few
times. What are you, around 60?

220
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,896
Sixty-three!

221
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,589
Fantastic!

222
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,396
Never married, which, as we know, if
you were a woman, would be a curse.

223
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,198
You'd be an old maid, a spinster.

224
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,341
So instead of pitying you,
they write articles about you.

225
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,238
Celebrate your never marrying.

226
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,244
You're elusive and ungetable,
a real catch.

227
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,507
Then, there's my gorgeous sister here.

228
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,344
- No, wait. What...?
- Look, please...

229
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,885
No, this is interesting. Look at her.
She is so accomplished.

230
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:20,389
Most successful female playwright
since who? Lillian Hellman?

231
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,426
She's over 50, divorced.
She sits in night after night...

232
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,087
...because available guys
her age want something...

233
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,234
Forgive me, but they want somebody
that looks like Marin.

234
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,838
The over-50 dating scene is geared
towards men leaving older women out.

235
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,066
And as a result, the women
become more and more productive...

236
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,473
...and therefore, more
and more interesting.

237
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,877
Which, in turn, makes them even less
desirable because as we know, men...

238
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,984
...especially older men,
are threatened and afraid...

239
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,053
...of productive, interesting women.
It is just so clear.

240
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,124
Single older women as a demographic
are as fucked a group as can exist.

241
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,493
Oh, God!

242
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,687
What are you, possessed?
How could you say those things?

243
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,767
It seemed really obvious, the injustice.
Thank God men die younger than us.

244
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,131
- It's the only break we get.
- You know what?

245
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:10,605
Write a dissertation. Don't announce
that I stay in night after night...

246
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,745
By the way, one "night after night"
would have been enough.

247
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,474
Did you ever realize that I stay in
as a part of my job?

248
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,142
And why do you think I married
the director of my plays?

249
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,015
He was the only man I ever saw.

250
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,385
And anyway, I like staying in,
and I like this time in my life.

251
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,016
Why do I have to defend myself?
I was married for 20 years. I'm done.

252
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,460
- What the hell was that?
- Sorry, I thought I was onto something.

253
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,964
Honey, what are you doing
with this guy?

254
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,831
He's old. He's chauvinistic.

255
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:39,993
- He's fun.
- Fun?

256
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,538
I mean, how is he fun?
He's, like, wrong.

257
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,335
- Yeah, wrong can be fun.
- No.

258
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,774
- Not this wrong.
- He's smart and fascinating.

259
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,881
If you talked about something
other than marital status...

260
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,075
...you would find he's smart,
owns 10 different companies.

261
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,086
What does that mean? It means
he can't commit. That's what it means.

262
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,454
- Not that I want him to commit.
- Oh, yeah, that I get.

263
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:06,428
Anyway, he said he thought you two
were very spontaneous and nice.

264
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,829
And then he said he's leaving
as soon as the sun comes up.

265
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,334
What, his car doesn't have
headlights?

266
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,501
Wait a minute.
I have no right to get this nuts.

267
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,074
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,438
He's your friend, he's not mine.

269
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:24,810
- I'm sorry and love you.
- I love you more.

270
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,248
No chance in hell
he said we were nice.

271
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,289
Please. None.

272
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,231
What are they listening to?

273
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,527
I don't care.

274
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,972
Marvin Gaye?

275
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,173
Will you stop that?

276
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,079
That's disgusting, Zoe. Stop it!

277
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,743
There.

278
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,185
She'll never see him after this
weekend. She can't commit either.

279
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,094
He does sound fun.

280
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,465
Admit it. He's got something.
You felt it, right?

281
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,396
Okay, this is nuts.

282
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,033
Mom!

283
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,506
Did she say, "Mom"?

284
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,372
Mom, hurry!

285
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,111
Mom!

286
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,587
I don't know what happened.
We fooled around.

287
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,951
And then he just said he felt
funny, and he just collapsed.

288
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,719
Harry, what is it?

289
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,830
- I'm okay. I'm fine.
- Does your chest hurt?

290
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,161
It's like an elephant's sitting on it.

291
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,529
Call 911,
tell them to send an ambulance.

292
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,500
Marin, now!

293
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,874
- My God!
- What are you doing?

294
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,634
Mouth-to-mouth.

295
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,343
Oh, you fucking guy.

296
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,142
We need an ambulance right away,
please!

297
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,947
29 Daniels Lane,
Sagaponack.

298
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,164
- We got him.
- Apparent cardiac arrest.

299
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,392
Sinus check, 120.

300
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,797
- BP?
- 150l95.

301
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,098
- Forty-one. Right here?
- On three.

302
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,934
- All right.
- Careful.

303
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,440
We've got a line in.

304
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,601
- Switch over to monitors.
- How we doing?

305
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,543
30 minutes of chest pain,
nausea, shortness of breath.

306
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,979
Pulse, 104. Respiration's 18.

307
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,847
Get a CBC, CMP, cardiac
panel and 12-lead EKG.

308
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,147
- Yes, doctor.
- Mr. Sanborn, I'm Dr. Mercer.

309
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,157
- Are you in any pain right now?
- I feel some pressure in my chest.

310
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,318
- It's tight.
- Show me where the pain is.

311
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,327
Right here.

312
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,494
What were you doing
when the pain started?

313
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,332
- I was kissing a beautiful woman.
- Were you having intercourse?

314
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,407
Unfortunately, no.

315
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,805
- Sense of humor intact.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,243
Give him aspirin, metoprolol,
5 milligrams, hang a nitro drip.

317
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,041
- Mr. Sanborn?
- Yeah.

318
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,310
EKG shows a blocked artery
which is not allowing enough...

319
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,922
...oxygen to get to the heart muscle.
- I'm having a heart attack?

320
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,924
We're gonna stop it, but I need
to know what medications you take.

321
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,722
- I take Lipitor.
- Chew this.

322
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,701
- Anything else?
- And a white one for blood pressure.

323
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,436
And what about Viagra?

324
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,566
Mr. Sanborn, did you take
any Viagra today?

325
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,269
- Mr. Sanborn?
- No.

326
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,713
- No Viagra.
- Okay, good, just need to be sure.

327
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,216
Because I put nitroglycerin
into your drip.

328
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:52,050
And if you had taken Viagra,
the combination could be fatal.

329
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,132
- Your dad's gonna be okay.
- He's not my dad.

330
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,795
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your granddad's gonna be okay.

331
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,440
Oh, thank you so much.

332
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,240
We're not related.

333
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,538
- He's a friend.
- Sorry.

334
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,045
I'm Dr. Mercer.

335
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,650
Mr. Sanborn did have
a mild heart attack.

336
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,912
I gave him something
to dissolve the clot, and it worked.

337
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,555
He's very lucky.

338
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,489
Another half-hour, I don't...
I don't know if this would have worked.

339
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,691
This was very intense.

340
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,696
- He's doing great.
- Yeah.

341
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,801
I gave him something
to help him sleep.

342
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,770
It might make him a little loopy at first
but then it should knock him out.

343
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,967
- You're Mrs. Sanborn?
- No! Oh, no. No, I'm just...

344
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,941
No, I'm Erica Barry.

345
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,775
He had dinner at our house.
I met him this afternoon.

346
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,177
You're Erica Barry?

347
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,410
- Yes.
- The playwright?

348
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,417
- Yes.
- What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.

349
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,818
- Really?
- Huge fan.

350
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,619
Thank you.

351
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,892
Wow!

352
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,298
Thanks.

353
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,493
Thank you, doctor.

354
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,931
- Erica. Green tea.
- Oh! That's hot.

355
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. May I?

356
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,269
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

357
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,710
This is very sweet of you.

358
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,215
In med school you learn what keeps
you up without making you nuts.

359
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,146
You know I heard you had a house
in the Hamptons.

360
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,349
I am a big fan. I've seen every play
you've ever written.

361
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,962
Some were written before your time.
There's some Marin's never seen.

362
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,121
No, I'm pretty sure I've seen
them all.

363
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,928
- I saw the last one twice.
- Julian, a walk-in may need stitches.

364
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,467
Okay, thanks.

365
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,968
I'll check on Mr. Sanborn.

366
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,802
If he's asleep, you might want some
shuteye. Come back in the morning.

367
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,377
Great to meet you, Erica. Ladies.

368
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,483
Okay.

369
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,819
Now, that's the perfect guy for you.

370
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,651
He's adorable!

371
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,919
Mother, I've never seen a man
less interested in me.

372
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,086
Or more interested in you.

373
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,061
Me?

374
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,099
- He's 30 years old.
- No, he's older than that.

375
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,760
Who cares how old he is?
I mean, he's not my type.

376
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,135
He's a gorgeous doctor.
He's perfect for you. He's hot for you.

377
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,742
- Which makes him really perfect.
- Okay, stop it.

378
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,435
He likes my work, not me.

379
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,273
I would never...

380
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,348
Shut up.

381
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,919
- Oh, God, is he all right?
- Harry!

382
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,422
Harry, over here.

383
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,764
Honey, I wanna go home.
Can you call Leo...?

384
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,529
Harry! You've got to get back into bed.

385
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,696
Woman, you saved my life.

386
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,202
Get a nurse. Nurse! Nurse!

387
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,243
I thank you from the bottom of my...

388
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,376
Even unconscious, he's a letch!

389
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,178
- Get off!
- You shouldn't be standing.

390
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,822
It's all right. Thank you.

391
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,889
I gotta take a whiz, girls.

392
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,896
We'll take care of that for you.

393
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,262
Okay, I'd like to see that.

394
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,301
Okay, here we go.

395
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,666
I'd love to see that.

396
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,905
Somebody better get it.

397
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,347
Now, what can I do you for?

398
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,507
I'm here to pick up Harry Sanborn.

399
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:43,245
Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
Come on, I'll take you to him.

400
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,322
And you are?

401
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,890
I'm Leo Hoffman,
I'm Harry's personal assistant.

402
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,721
Do a little chef, a little driving,
party planning...

403
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:54,059
...whatever the man needs.
- It sounds like an interesting job.

404
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,497
I'm going on six years
and never a dull moment.

405
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,902
Okay, Harry, looks like we're
gonna have to let you go.

406
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,342
Take it easy, kids.

407
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,673
I just...

408
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,544
...sat up a little too fast.

409
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,378
Doc, tell them.

410
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,617
Am I in good shape?

411
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,654
How were my tests this morning?

412
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,315
He's doing extremely well.

413
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,188
- Can I hug him?
- Absolutely.

414
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,027
Yeah. Okay.

415
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,727
Okay. Okay.

416
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,031
Let's not get goofy.

417
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,038
We got nothing but good news here.

418
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,540
Knock, knock.

419
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,705
- Hi.
- Hey.

420
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,007
- I'll catch you on the way out.
- Thanks.

421
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,019
So...

422
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,389
...l'm some great date, huh?

423
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,857
Yeah, Mr. Excitement.

424
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,693
Tell me something.

425
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,900
We haven't actually had sex yet,
have we?

426
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,436
No.

427
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,973
We haven't.
You're correct on that one.

428
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,971
Something to live for.

429
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,084
Down to the cheek.

430
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,265
Hold on, Tarzan, we're still moving.
Slowly.

431
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,935
Hey, l...

432
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,107
Harry, I'm sorry but I can't
let you travel quite yet.

433
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,206
I ain't going back in there.

434
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,717
I can't put you in a car
and I can't leave you in the parking lot.

435
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,980
I won't sue you,
if that's what you think.

436
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,681
I'll sign whatever you'd like.

437
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,793
Just let me go back to the city.

438
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,225
Here's my best offer.

439
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,628
I won't put you in the hospital
if you stay nearby a few days.

440
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,399
Get a nurse. Let me keep an eye on
you until we get your strength back.

441
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,736
Stay nearby.

442
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,277
Doc, where do you suggest I go?

443
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,650
No!

444
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:33,758
Somebody please explain to me
how I ended up babysitting this guy?

445
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,387
Somebody please explain to me
how I ended up babysitting this guy?

446
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,224
This is the best turkey sandwich
I've had in my life.

447
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,265
- You're not listening to me.
- I am. Don't get all pissy.

448
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,027
I come here for peace and quiet.

449
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,104
Suddenly, I'm a character
in a Kaufman and Hart play.

450
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,104
And the phone doesn't stop.

451
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,642
And it's never for me.

452
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,444
Sorry to interrupt.

453
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,377
No, that's fine, Leo. I'll take it.

454
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,483
- No, it's okay...
- No, no, I'll take it.

455
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,482
I don't mind washing them.
Okay.

456
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,881
How you doing?

457
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,755
The man doesn't know my name,
and I'm doing his dishes.

458
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,361
I said I'll take it back tomorrow, okay?
Great.

459
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,963
I'll take care of it.
Just one second. Hi, Erica?

460
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,396
- Where shall I put this?
- Here. I'll take it.

461
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,230
Harry has a bad headache.
Do you have any Tylenol?

462
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,702
- Tylenol...
- Extra Strength would be fantastic.

463
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,670
Hi, I'm Tania.

464
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,366
- Hi.
- Harry's second assistant.

465
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,910
- Dave Klein, her assistant.
- Nice to meet you.

466
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,605
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

467
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,911
"What should I do with this?"

468
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,555
It's an empty water glass.
What are the choices?

469
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,317
Okay, I'm getting out of your hair.

470
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,553
So you're not ready to show me
any new pages?

471
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,095
- Dave.
- I'm not putting any pressure on you.

472
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,664
- I'm just asking.
- Dad!

473
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,362
I didn't know you were here.

474
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,833
Just on my way out.

475
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,997
I was gonna drive back to the city with
Zoe, but I'd much rather go with you.

476
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,666
Actually, I have someone
to meet before I go.

477
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,505
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

478
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,877
You're leaving? Zoe's leaving?
The entourage is leaving?

479
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,018
I'm gonna be stuck with him, alone?

480
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,710
The hospital's sending over
a nurse in the morning.

481
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,618
In the morning? That's, like,
19 hours from now.

482
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,787
Okay, I can handle this.

483
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,019
I'll just get myself into a Zen place.

484
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,188
Play music. Cook. Write. Focus.

485
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,547
Thank you.

486
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,261
Well, four mai tais at lunch...

487
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,904
...is a bit much for anybody.

488
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,235
Hi.

489
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,907
Can I call you right back, doll, huh?
Thank you.

490
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,138
Hey.

491
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,617
- What's up?
- Okay, here's the thing.

492
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,984
I don't want to play the uptight
nurse to your bad-boy patient.

493
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,251
If you want another heart attack,
go ahead. I have work to do.

494
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,156
I don't have time to make a run...

495
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:28,390
...to the hospital because you're filling
your clogged arteries with smoke.

496
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,965
But more importantly...

497
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,629
...l'd rather not have my freshly
painted house smell like a pool hall.

498
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,635
Have you always been like this,
or do I bring it out in you?

499
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,312
Just, you know.

500
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,450
I don't think I've ever had
this effect on a woman before.

501
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,609
What effect do you think
you have on me?

502
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,448
I don't quite recognize it.

503
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,147
That's how I know
I never had it before.

504
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,416
So you don't sleep?

505
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,721
I only need about four hours a night.

506
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,455
Me too.

507
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,497
I never slept eight hours
in my life.

508
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,464
Me either. I wish I could.

509
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,400
Want me to shut these? The sun
comes in strong in the morning.

510
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,905
- Sure.
- So, Harry...

511
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,633
...who were you talking to?

512
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,301
A friend in L.A.

513
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,074
- It's only 10:00 on the coast.
- That's not past her bedtime?

514
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:22,045
So you don't get
more mellow as the hours pass?

515
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,915
Good night, Harry.

516
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,682
Can I ask you one other thing?

517
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,456
What's with the turtlenecks?

518
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,187
- It's the middle of summer.
- Seriously...

519
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,764
...why do you care what I wear?
- Just curious.

520
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:40,098
I like them. I've always liked them,
and I'm just a turtleneck kind of gal.

521
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,571
You never get hot?

522
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,605
- No.
- Never?

523
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,510
Not lately.

524
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,058
Finally.

525
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,957
Okay, okay.

526
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,784
Holy...!

527
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,786
Oh, God!

528
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

529
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,660
Oh, God, am I sorry.

530
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,470
What are you doing?!

531
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,438
- I was just trying to find the kitchen!
- What? Back here?

532
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,200
I got confused.

533
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,312
And it was dark and...

534
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,914
I didn't really see anything.

535
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,107
Just...

536
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,613
Just your tits.

537
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,985
And a little...

538
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,755
- Goodbye, Mrs. Barry.
- Goodbye?

539
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,766
You're leaving?
Oh, no, that's not good.

540
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,030
- Been fired.
- Fired? No, you just started.

541
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,606
Not fired, darling. Just not needed.

542
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,108
Not needed?
Wait, what are you talking about?

543
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,269
Of course she's needed. We need her.

544
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,847
Oh, no. I'm actually feeling
pretty perky today.

545
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,847
Making quite a comeback.

546
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,977
Sorry for your trouble,
Mrs. Gimble. Take care, dear.

547
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,021
You've been wonderful.

548
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,125
Listen...

549
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,693
...about last night...

550
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,887
Yeah, how about
we never talk about that?

551
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,028
I was at the drugstore.
Your prescriptions were ready.

552
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,692
They said to take two with food,
this one without.

553
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,167
You were in silhouette.

554
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,364
Yeah, I think that's talking about it.

555
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,738
- I didn't really see all that much.
- Yep, there you go.

556
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,572
I won't mention it again, but...

557
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,509
- Going to work, Harry.
- Hey.

558
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,275
You saw my ass.
You don't see me acting nuts...

559
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:10,478
...and wearing glasses
and hats and weird outfits!

560
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,089
Yes or no?

561
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,657
What's the deal?

562
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,493
- Can I go?
- You still getting dizzy?

563
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,154
- Not as much.
- Out of breath?

564
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,495
- Only sometimes.
- Good.

565
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,263
- How's Erica treating you?
- Who?

566
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,371
Erica.

567
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,902
Oh, her.

568
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,807
She is a major piece of work.

569
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,711
Doc, the woman wears turtlenecks
in the middle of the summer.

570
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:44,844
She's beyond uptight.
Almost makes her fun to be around.

571
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,618
Uptight? That's funny,
I haven't noticed that.

572
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,023
Try living with her.

573
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,824
I actually saw her naked last night.

574
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,491
- That doesn't sound so uptight.
- It was an accident.

575
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:02,036
She thought I was asleep,
I thought her room was the kitchen.

576
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,309
You know what Freud said,
"There are no accidents."

577
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,235
Trust me.

578
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,904
This was an accident.

579
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:15,678
Although, why would she walk around
naked when she knows I'm nearby?

580
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,617
Why would you think
her bedroom was a kitchen?

581
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,588
It was dark.
It was 2:00 in the morning.

582
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,525
That could explain why she was
walking around naked. Deep breath.

583
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:29,826
I've never seen a woman that age
naked before.

584
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:35,200
- You're kidding.
- Hey, we're not all doctors, baby.

585
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:41,068
I think she's very beautiful.
And she's a fantastic writer, you know.

586
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,440
No, I don't know.

587
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,042
She's pretty major.

588
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,677
- So you date her daughter?
- Okay.

589
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:54,655
Now, she's a great chick.
Must take after her father.

590
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,227
Which reminds me. Doc...

591
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,524
What about Mr. Midnight, here?

592
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,702
When can I be up and running
in that department?

593
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,307
I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay put
for another couple of weeks.

594
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:15,879
- But it won't kill me when I do it, right?
- No, it's exercise. It'll be good for you.

595
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,038
After a heart attack,
rule of thumb is:

596
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:23,119
If you can climb a flight of stairs,
you can have sex.

597
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:42,974
So you're saying he can't travel at all?
Not even by plane?

598
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,138
So you're saying he can't travel at all?
Not even by plane?

599
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,536
- Train?
- I don't think so.

600
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,281
Been tough, huh?

601
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,908
He fired his nurse after an hour,
and now says he doesn't need one.

602
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:59,318
- He's a bit of a workout.
- How are you holding up?

603
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,219
- Me?
- You.

604
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,984
Well, I'm...

605
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,184
I'm fine. Fine.

606
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,491
One more "fine"
and I won't believe you.

607
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,560
Wait, where's my...?

608
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,066
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

609
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,005
Hello?

610
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:26,182
Hi. I know, I'm sorry.
I haven't been able to get back.

611
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,481
Part of the play takes place in Paris...

612
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:36,150
...so I keep listening to French music,
hoping to get inspired.

613
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,287
Well, I'm trying.

614
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,393
It's not exactly flowing out
of me yet, but...

615
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,700
Pick you up around 7?

616
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,937
So, what about the patient?

617
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,312
Like he said, he doesn't need a nurse.

618
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,302
I'm walking around the house!

619
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,303
Oh, no.

620
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:36,150
- Hi.
- Listen...

621
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,221
...l've decided to get over
the "you saw me naked" thing.

622
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,984
- So let's not deal with it anymore.
- Good...

623
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,788
...because I have been hiding
from you all day.

624
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,189
Do you want to come in?

625
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,800
I don't want to break your rhythm
or anything.

626
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,567
That would be wishful thinking.

627
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,963
Nice painting.

628
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,637
So I'm gonna venture out there
and go for a short walk.

629
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,472
- You up to that?
- My doctor recommended it.

630
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:08,279
I gotta build up to climbing stairs
and stuff like that.

631
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,386
You wouldn't want to join me?

632
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:15,624
- That means you don't want me to?
- No. I was asking if you wanted to.

633
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:21,322
I would, but I don't like to break
once I start writing, so I shouldn't.

634
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,592
Not that a little fresh air would hurt.

635
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:28,296
It's just a walk, Erica,
not a marriage proposal.

636
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:33,234
- You know my name.
- Erica Jane Barry.

637
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,073
I looked you up on the Internet.

638
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:43,513
Do you know that there are over
8000 websites that mention you?

639
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,213
- That's not possible.
- Yeah, it's true.

640
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:50,416
I know everything about you now,
and not because of last night.

641
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,188
Yeah, no, no. I understood.
