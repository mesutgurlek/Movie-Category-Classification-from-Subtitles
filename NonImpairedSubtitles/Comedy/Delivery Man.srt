1
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,480
<i>In many ways,
they'll miss the good old days</i>

2
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,411
<i>Someday, someday</i>

3
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,520
<i>Yeah, it hurts to say
But I want you to stay</i>

4
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,565
<i>Sometimes, sometimes</i>

5
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,685
<i>Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth</i>

6
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,681
<i>I will do my best</i>

7
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,520
<i>You say you wanna stay by my side</i>

8
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,049
<i>Darlin', your head's not right</i>

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,685
<i>See, alone we stand
Together we fall apart</i>

10
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,084
<i>Yeah, I think I'll be all right</i>

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,486
- Hey, David.
- Hey, Joey.

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,369
Your brother's looking for you.

13
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,486
- Hey.
- Hey, David.

14
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,881
Where the hell were you?

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,128
- Did you take the truck home again?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,045
Pop asked you not to use the meat truck
for personal purposes.

17
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,245
- Hi, Mom.
- But you did it anyway?

18
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,327
Uh-huh.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,528
- Do you have the jerseys for tonight?
- Yes.

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,167
No, no, no, seriously.
Do you have the jerseys for tonight?

21
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,962
- Yes. Yes, sweetheart, yes.
- Aleksy, hang up.

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,721
Yeah, sweetheart.

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,205
I should never have gotten
this woman pregnant.

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,089
Do not procreate, David.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,721
Reproduction is a very bad idea.
Do not reproduce, ever.

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,405
Hey, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,241
To pay back some money that I owe,

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,328
I've built a little hydroponic greenhouse
in my apartment.

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,241
You're... You're growing pot?

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,440
And you're the only person
I know with a green thumb.

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,080
- And you want me to grow pot?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,930
Right. Absolutely.

33
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,687
That is the one thing missing for me
right now to achieve total happiness.

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,251
Getting into a drug ring.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,721
Because the pressure of my wife
calling me every three minutes

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,367
because she's about to give birth
to my first child isn't intense enough.

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,481
How much do you owe?

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,883
- Eighty.
- "Eighty"?

39
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,803
- Eighty thousand.
- Eighty thousand?

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,522
When you say it with that face,
it does make it seem like a lot.

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,611
How do you get yourself
into these situations, David?

42
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,971
$80,000?

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,930
What happened?
How do you owe someone $80,000?

44
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,242
I borrowed money to invest in Newtech.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,409
- That is a pyramid scheme.
- It is not a pyramid scheme.

46
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,006
- The guy was arrested!
- Those charges were unrelated!

47
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,287
- He was arrested!
- David.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,929
You know, David, I love you like a son.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,606
I am your son.

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,286
Which is why I love you like a son.

51
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,603
But if you don't have our new jerseys
for tonight's game...

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,761
I have the jerseys.

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,327
You gotta have the jerseys.
It's the team picture.

54
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,481
I have the jerseys.

55
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,849
He won't have the jerseys.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,161
Come on, come on.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,324
<i>WOMAN'. Your loan has been denied.</i>

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,409
But if I don't get the $80,000,

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,370
there's people that are
gonna come and drown me.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,243
Can you please put that down
on your little form,

61
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
that there's people
that are gonna come drown me?

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,322
<i>You do not have
the necessary collateral.</i>

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,321
That is why we're not
gonna give you any money.

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,528
Basically, then, you're just
a big goddamn pawn shop.

65
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,726
No, we're not a pawn shop.

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,890
You're a pawn shop with fancy furniture.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,930
And for all these reasons,
I have to turn down your application.

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,650
I'm very sorry.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,606
All right. I understand.

70
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,050
This is a hold-up.

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,801
Excuse me?

72
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,609
I said, "All right. I understand."

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,690
This is a hold-up, asshole.

74
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,968
- Excuse me, you just said something.
- No.

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,725
- Just then, you said something.
- No.

76
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm here. I'm David Wozniak.
I'm here to pick up my jerseys.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,447
- I've been waiting for you.
- I know! I know!

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,011
I'm so sorry,
but my team photo is tonight.

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,161
The whole team has to
have their jerseys,

80
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,241
it's for the whole year.

81
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,606
- All right already!
- Thank you so much.

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,841
I really do appreciate it.

83
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,401
Yes!

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,849
- A bag?
- No.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,206
Rolling papers?

86
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,760
I grow tomatoes.

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,283
Hey! It's a delivery truck!
I'm making a delivery.

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,487
You're kidding me, right?

89
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,520
Yes. I swear I have the jerseys,
on our mother's...

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,402
Yes! On our mother's grave.

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,690
The jerseys are with me
in the truck as we speak.

92
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,249
Hey! Come on, stop! Hey! Hey!

93
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,167
You got my jerseys!

94
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,963
- I know it's late.
- Yes, it is.

95
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,927
But you brought me
such beautiful flowers.

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,407
I did.

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,730
And Mr. Bernstein takes
such great care of them.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,525
Where have you been, David?

99
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,887
Emma, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,964
I was trying to pay back
some money that I owe.

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,642
I understand,
but why can't you call or text?

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,802
And why can't I come
to your apartment anymore?

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,640
I never said
you couldn't come to my place.

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,886
- Are you hiding something?
- Nothing.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,491
You're sure you're not hiding
anything in your apartment.

106
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,206
Nope.

107
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,890
I'm pregnant.

108
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,006
That's great.

109
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,006
Yeah.

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,643
- Emma...
- No.

111
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,645
You know what? I can...

112
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,731
I can do this on my own.

113
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,684
What do you mean, "on your own"?

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,490
I want a child, okay?

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,327
But I don't want a father

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,209
who just disappears
because he gets too busy.

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,486
You're unreliable.

118
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,722
I mean, you've got...
You've got money problems.

119
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,483
You basically don't have a life.
This is not a life.

120
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,847
- I have a life.
- You don't have a life.

121
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,247
People who have a life do not ring
pregnant women's doorbells

122
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,486
at 3:00 in the morning.

123
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,005
I didn't know you were pregnant.

124
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,043
David, you would know.

125
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,409
If you just called me
every once in a while.

126
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,411
<i>I guess...</i>

127
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,002
I guess at first, for a second there,
I was in shock.

128
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,288
I mean, you know, it was a shock.

129
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,807
But then, you know, the...

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,406
That feeling of fear went away,
and I got this feeling

131
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,328
that this could be the most beautiful
thing that ever happened to me.

132
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,687
Stevie, no. Hey, Stevie, no!

133
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,127
Hey, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

134
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,286
Back to bed. Not in the sandbox.

135
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,044
Hey, where are you going?
No, don't go in the sandbox.

136
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,441
Not in the sandbox!

137
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,520
You gotta talk Emma
into getting an abortion.

138
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,766
- What?
- You have to.

139
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,729
How could you say such a thing?

140
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,201
How can you say stuff like that
in front of your children?

141
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,402
My children know that
they're too old to be aborted.

142
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,166
I'm realizing that I might want a kid.

143
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,403
You are a free man.
You do not want kids.

144
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,130
Kids are a black hole.

145
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,649
They will suck up all of your energy,
your money, your time, your hair.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,888
Remember when I had great hair?

147
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,130
I can't get it up anymore.

148
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,089
How can you talk like this
in front of your children?

149
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
I can say anything I want
in front of my children

150
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,960
because they don't listen to me.

151
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,441
My children do not pick up on
the frequencies of my voice.

152
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,165
And I'm telling you,

153
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,084
I have a problem
achieving a full erection now.

154
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,684
It's not normal for a man of my age
to no longer have a nice, big erection.

155
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,283
Hey, what are you doing?
Listen to me, go back to bed.

156
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,521
Not in the sandbox.

157
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,211
Don't get in the sand.
Don't go in the sand!

158
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,201
- As your friend...
- Daddy?

159
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,561
No. No, no, no. Hey.

160
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,290
- Dad.
- Back to bed, honey.

161
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,407
Daddy.

162
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,687
I'm trying to have a conversation.
Please stop that.

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,569
- Daddy!
- Okay, stop that now.

164
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,927
I'm telling you, I think
I might want a kid.

165
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,200
As your friend and as your lawyer,
David, may I be brutally frank with you?

166
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,241
Sure.

167
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,723
You don't have the skills
to bring up a child.

168
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,689
I need order in my life.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,408
And this is order?

170
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,362
I think this is beautiful.

171
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,522
Daddy!

172
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,401
David Wozniak.

173
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,605
Uh, the back door was
already broken into.

174
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,445
My name is Mark Williams.
I'm an attorney.

175
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,843
I've been trying to contact you
for several days now, Mr. Wozniak.

176
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,130
I do not have a great deal of time.

177
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,362
I shall be brief.

178
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,608
Between 1991 and 1994,

179
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,401
you donated sperm
under the pseudonym "Starbuck"

180
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,166
at the privately-owned
Graboski-Levitt Clinic,

181
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,242
which I represent.

182
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,881
No.

183
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,368
That was not a question,
it was a statement.

184
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,086
We have all the documents
necessary to prove it.

185
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,841
Over the course of 33 months,
you were a very, very frequent donor.

186
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,811
You donated 693 times

187
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,683
in exchange for which
you received the sum of $24,255.

188
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,051
Your sperm is of a very high quality.

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,047
Oh, thank you.

190
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,170
I'm sure your sperm is also high-end.

191
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,841
Uh...

192
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,289
Certain complications arose,
which meant that for a period,

193
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,522
Mr. Graboski-Levitt gave your sperm

194
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,169
to all the women in his clientele.

195
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,722
You have sired 533 children

196
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,451
and 142 of them
wish to know your identity.

197
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,607
What?

198
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,126
You are the biological father
of 533 children.

199
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,528
At the time of each of
your multiple donations,

200
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,161
you signed a confidentiality agreement.

201
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,684
Legally, the Graboski-Levitt Clinic
is obligated to protect your identity.

202
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,849
But a subset of your children

203
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,367
is contesting the legality
of those documents.

204
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,205
They wish to know who Starbuck is.

205
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,601
You say that for each
of the 693 sperm donations

206
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,242
you signed a confidentiality agreement
under the pseudonym of "Starbuck"?

207
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,447
Every time. Always.

208
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,761
I always signed the
confidentially agreement, always.

209
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,370
And you signed those documents

210
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,841
before or after executing
the manual labor?

211
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,041
Before.

212
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,248
And you always wrestled
the dragon alone?

213
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,361
Yes.

214
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,681
Frankly, I'm disappointed
you never told me about any of this.

215
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,041
Usually you call up your friends
after you get laid,

216
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,650
not after you wrestle the dragon alone.

217
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,365
But if you absolutely insist,

218
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,320
I promise you I will phone you
every single time I fly solo.

219
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,768
That's an interesting offer.
Unfortunately, way too time-consuming.

220
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,606
Listen, they claim that your right
to privacy should take a back seat

221
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,968
to their basic human right
to know who their biological father is.

222
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,203
It's very complex. Very, very complex.

223
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,726
It's...

224
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,887
It's really complex.

225
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,169
Do you know that this is
the dream of every lawyer

226
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,482
to argue a case this significant?

227
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,122
A case that will leave its mark?
That will stand as a precedent?

228
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,408
My mother always said that
I would never amount to anything.

229
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,881
- I'll show that old bitch.
- What do we do now?

230
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,842
As your lawyer, I suggest you
cease masturbating in fertility clinics.

231
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,805
- Do I have to get a real lawyer?
- You can't afford a real lawyer.

232
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,611
I'm gonna call the Bar Association today,
reactivate my license.

233
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,761
You don't have a license?

234
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,048
I lost it because of a small formality.

235
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,001
Something about a missing dated form
and a bribe. It's nothing.

236
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,801
Oh! Yes, in hopes of persuading
Starbuck to meet with them,

237
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,322
142 of the children in your lawsuit
want you to know who they are.

238
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,645
This envelope contains the profiles
of 142 of your children.

239
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,329
Do not open it!

240
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,121
Brett.

241
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,361
Hey, Starbuck.

242
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,170
Don't call me that.
Can Susan take the kids?

243
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,328
When she's not investing
all her energy in her new career,

244
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,483
she prefers to wisely use her time
sleeping with men I don't like.

245
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,721
Do you have a babysitter?

246
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,120
Why, you need someone
to watch over that envelope?

247
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
I know I shouldn't have,
but I've opened it.

248
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,766
Worst idea ever.

249
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,002
I picked out one of the profiles.
I just picked one.

250
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,481
One. Do you know
whose profile I picked?

251
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,085
Andrew Johansson.

252
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,524
We got to go.

253
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,841
What do you got?

254
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,684
- $225
- $200.

255
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,847
There he is.

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,601
Let's go, baby. Take it. Take it.

257
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,970
Come on, 13! Let's go, 13!
Come on, Johansson.

258
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,965
13 is wide open! Let's go!

259
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,286
Yeah!

260
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,926
<i>Andrew Johansson
with the three.</i>

261
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,121
Play defense, play defense,
play defense!

262
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,130
Play defense, play defense! Yes!
Do you see him? Do you see him?

263
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,884
He stopped it, he blocked it.
He got right in the lane.

264
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,962
Did you see him get in the lane?
Did you see 13 get in the lane?

265
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,121
We got 13, guys.

266
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,289
Why don't they put him in?
Why don't they put him in?

267
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,925
The game's almost over.

268
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,690
Why are they not... They put him in!

269
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,771
Andrew Johansson.

270
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,440
Thirteen seconds.

271
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,931
Okay, set up.
He's open, he's open, he's open.

272
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,645
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

273
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,290
Pass it to 13! Pass it to 13!

274
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,200
Why won't they give it to 13?
Give it to him!

275
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,483
He's open! Catch it. Got
it, got it, got it!

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,241
Andrew! Andrew! Andrew!

277
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,687
Andrew! Andrew!

278
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,850
<i>Those were my genes.</i>

279
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,765
My genes were on a professional
basketball court tonight!

280
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,049
In a way, you could say that
that was an extension of myself

281
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,288
that hit that game-winning shot!

282
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,569
I mean, do your kids play
professional basketball?

283
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,563
No, not to my knowledge.
But I will inquire.

284
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,920
They don't tell me everything.

285
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,007
So, I've been thinking
that we could plead insanity.

286
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,169
- What?
- I don't know.

287
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,123
Maybe you would
not be held responsible

288
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,806
for actions taken
while mentally unstable.

289
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,171
We could bank
on your mental problems.

290
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,165
I don't have mental problems.

291
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,248
I don't have mental problems!

292
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,051
When we're in court,
I want you to say it exactly that way.

293
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,487
One, two, three, Wozniak!

294
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,410
Let's go.

295
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,882
Come on! One, two. One, two. One two.

296
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,963
Big time, big time, big time!

297
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,531
Let's play some basketball.

298
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,966
Come in. Back up, back up!

299
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,520
Hurry up! Come up, up, up!

300
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,120
- Are you allowed to hit the arm?
- No.

301
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,726
Okay. Pick and roll!

302
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,644
Let's go! Back, back, back! D, D, D!

303
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,484
Great steal! Here we go, hit me!

304
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,961
I'm going in for the jam. Okay, not a jam.

305
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,042
What the hell position is he playing?

306
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,320
A little help? Thank you.

307
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,209
All right.
Why don't we meet up back here at two?

308
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,407
Emma!

309
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,846
Uh...

310
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,491
Give me a second?

311
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,160
I have officially decided to have a life.

312
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,006
I'm at work.

313
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,529
I'm going to convince you
that I deserve to be this kid's father.

314
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,324
I'm sorry, excuse me.

315
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,648
Four days in a row,
I have not had any sleep.

316
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,609
But I've never been so happy in my life.

317
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,491
I never thought that
I would love anyone that much.

318
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,486
The kid poops four times a day
and I think I'm losing my mind.

319
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,086
I think I'm going crazy, because I swear

320
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,122
his diapers make me so proud.

321
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,322
I'm totally convinced that my child

322
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,482
takes way better dumps
than any other kid.

323
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,130
Your brother wants parental leave

324
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,011
so he can spend more time
admiring his son's diapers.

325
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,327
It's the law, okay?
I'm entitled to parental leave.

326
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,643
I had three kids, and two hours
after each of them was born,

327
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,962
I was here, serving customers.

328
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,323
You absolutely have to have kids, David.

329
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,401
What?

330
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,286
My girlfriend's pregnant.

331
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,201
You got a girlfriend?

332
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,481
Yeah.

333
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,769
David, you're gonna love it.
You are gonna love it.

334
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,203
Your kid is never gonna poop
as good as my kid,

335
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,050
but you are gonna love it.

336
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,804
- Can you believe that?
- No.

337
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,686
I promise,
I will only be gone an hour.

338
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,243
No, I won't. Look, I've called everyone.

339
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,048
How many times have I covered for you?

340
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,766
Oh, my God, man.

341
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,246
I'm begging you, man.

342
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,170
I really, really need
you to do this for me.

343
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,411
I can't even talk to you.

344
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,761
Yeah?

345
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,685
Can I help you?

346
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,167
I'll have a espresso to go, please.

347
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,360
I said "to 903.

348
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,605
Is there a lid?

349
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,486
Do you have a lid?

350
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,451
Usually, you get a lid
when you order a coffee to go.

351
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,451
$3.25.

352
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,200
You could be a bit more polite.

353
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,567
Polite?

354
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,006
I'm a customer.

355
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,685
You're a barista.

356
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,287
Would it be possible
to act in a polite manner?

357
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,561
What the hell are you talking about?

358
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,167
I'm talking about a little "please"
and "thank you."

359
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,806
- A little thank you.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

360
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,566
Is that not considered cool
by your generation anymore?

361
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,206
Who the hell are you, man?

362
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,522
I'm just saying if you
smiled a little more,

363
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,523
maybe there would be
more people in here.

364
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,840
If you want to be a waiter...

365
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,729
Well, there's the thing.
I don't want to be a waiter.

366
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,081
I'm an actor.

367
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,843
I am an actor missing the opportunity
of a lifetime right now.

368
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,685
And you, because you give me
three bucks and a quarter,

369
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,245
you want me to smile?

370
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,400
You want me to smile when I am
totally pissing away my life?

371
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,962
It doesn't have to be a big smile.

372
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,205
Okay.

373
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,884
Have a nice day.

374
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,569
Good afternoon.

375
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,564
I'll take care of the coffee shop.

376
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,841
Yes or no?

377
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,682
Customers come in sometimes.

378
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,204
It isn't always empty.
I can't leave you with the shop.

379
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,850
But it's the role of a lifetime.

380
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,685
Yeah, and how do I know
you won't just walk off with the cash?

381
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,528
You can leave with my truck full of meat.

382
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,931
And why would you do this?

383
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,290
Satisfaction of knowing
that you helped someone

384
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,124
make something of themself.

385
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,480
Bring it back without a scratch.

386
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,803
Okay. People might come in.

387
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,169
I can figure out
how to make a cup of coffee.

388
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,250
All right. Okay.

389
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,006
Thanks.

390
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,929
<i>It is total chaos
in the meat market today, David.</i>

391
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,560
And you decide to disappear?

392
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,370
In the whole family business,

393
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,602
<i>you know you've got
the easiest job, right?</i>

394
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,886
<i>And in spite of having the simplest job,
you manage to do the job badly!</i>

395
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,600
It's like every day you find a new way

396
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,887
to push back the frontiers
of incompetence!

397
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,568
<i>There are only two components
to your chosen occupation.</i>

398
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,882
<i>Get meat, deliver meat.</i>

399
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,087
That's not what I ordered.

400
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,487
It's free.

401
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,130
Take it, it's free.

402
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,085
<i>You're no longer a "deliverer."
You're more of a "keeper."</i>

403
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,851
Why is our truck still full of meat? Why?

404
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,288
Why have you only taken
our meat out for a drive?

405
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,604
- Yeah?
- I'll Have...

406
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,127
Tell me who you are
before I call the cops.

407
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,921
I'm the waiter.

408
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,526
I'm the owner.

409
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,331
I do the hiring here.

410
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,927
Josh got called in
for the audition of a lifetime.

411
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,367
Fine. He can look for another job, then.

412
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,881
Sir, it was the audition of a lifetime.

413
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,690
That's not the problem.

414
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,841
What's the problem?

415
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,606
He's not a good actor.
He has never been cast.

416
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,681
Never.

417
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,842
He's a good kid, but he's wasting his life.

418
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,366
He's fired.

419
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,330
Look, this whole thing was my idea.

420
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,246
So, I guess it's your fault
if he can't pay his rent.

421
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,406
I lost my job?

422
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,644
You lost your job.

423
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,881
I got the part.

424
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,041
You got the part?

425
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,089
Yeah, they loved me.

426
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,047
You got the part?

427
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,089
As of today, I'm an actor.

428
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,490
- Congratulations, man!
- Thanks.

429
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,642
Thanks, man. Thanks.

430
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,606
Wow!

431
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,364
I knew it!
I knew you were gonna bail on me.

432
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,447
How the hell am I
supposed to pay the rent?

433
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,888
Okay, wait. No, no, wait! Wait!

434
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,801
The cash is on the table.
I'm four dollars short.

435
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,689
Peter, you owe me money.

436
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,046
No, you owe me money!

437
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,851
Okay, so then,
what are you gonna do about it?

438
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,931
You told me June.

439
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,686
Tell me,
what am I supposed to do now, huh?

440
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,810
Tell me!
What am I supposed to do now?

441
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,962
Miss, don't worry about the money.

442
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,442
You, uh, won your pizza.

443
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,168
Yeah, you won the contest.

444
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,607
You won our, uh...

445
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,762
You won our "Eat and Win" contest.

446
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,084
I don't know what you want,
but this is not a good time.

447
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,244
I'm not doing too well right now,
so can you leave my apartment?

448
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,521
Yes.

449
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,842
Yes, absolutely.

450
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,001
I'm about to call the police!

451
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,010
No. No need for that at all.

452
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,243
It's only that I can see that
you're not doing very well,

453
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,086
and we have a policy

454
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,961
that's very, very, very strict

455
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,602
in the condition in which
we can leave our customers.

456
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,050
Here at...

457
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,441
At Rocco's Pizzeria,
we believe in a more humane pizza.

458
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,485
So, is everything okay?

459
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,721
Miss?

460
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,571
Shit!

461
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,725
Okay, okay, you're okay, you're okay.
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

462
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,289
Miss. Miss!

463
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,129
- Kristen?
- Miss!

464
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,841
Let go of me!

465
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,128
Kristen! Kristen!

466
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,925
Excuse me, and who are you?

467
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,763
Are you ashamed to say
you're my father?

468
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,126
No.

469
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,450
May I have a word with you?

470
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,841
Yes.

471
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,003
The good news is that for the moment,

472
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,642
we just happen to have a spot
open in our rehab program.

473
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,201
The bad news is that your daughter

474
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,965
seems totally uninterested
in the program.

475
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,449
Since she is still a minor,
it's your decision.

476
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,008
- I'm not...
- It's a very good program.

477
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,367
We've gotten great results.

478
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,606
I'll talk to her.

479
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,847
Hi.

480
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,125
How are you?

481
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,089
Please sign the release.

482
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,886
Look, I don't know who you are, but...

483
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,531
I'm begging you, sign the papers.

484
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,969
- They have a great program here.
- I can stop on my own.

485
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,086
I mean, I just had the scare of my life!

486
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,965
- Please sign the papers.
- I think the program is...

487
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,771
No, if I do the program
then I'm gonna be surrounded

488
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,451
24 hours a day by addicts.

489
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,331
And I guarantee, I will relapse.

490
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,890
People don't stop using
in these programs.

491
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,481
They stop when they wanna stop.

492
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,730
- They will help you.
- They'll lock me up.

493
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,044
And I'll lose my job. I just...

494
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,725
I just got this great job

495
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,730
and I have nothing in my life
besides this job.

496
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,768
- I'll talk to the...
- Thank you.

497
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,807
I'm going to sign the release.

498
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,966
Worst decision that you'll ever make.

499
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,161
She says she'll be happy.

500
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,402
Right now she doesn't need to be happy.

501
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,768
She needs to stop using.

502
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,851
And she will.

503
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,970
Do you love your daughter?

504
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,841
I do.

505
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,884
Tell her. Go tell her that you love her.

506
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,005
And tell her that you will
not sign that release.

507
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,091
Where do you work?

508
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,365
Bloomingdale's.

509
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,282
- You're okay for tonight?
- Yes.

510
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,609
- And you got my number.
- Yeah.

511
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,650
- Great. You start work tomorrow at...
- 8:00.

512
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,802
- Okay. And you'll be there at 8:00?
- 8:00.

513
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,484
Okay.

514
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,731
Well...

515
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,486
In my life, I have a tendency

516
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,965
to make very, very, very bad decisions.

517
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,886
Tell me that I haven't just
made another wrong decision.

518
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
You haven't.

519
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,807
Thanks.

520
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,728
Oh, man.

521
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,121
Yes.

522
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,286
Yes!

523
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,121
Thank you, thank you. Yes!

524
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,201
Whoo!

525
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,441
<i>Wonderful</i>

526
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,321
<i>Glorious</i>

527
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,648
<i>The sum of all your experiences</i>

528
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,203
<i>A living breathing result of the fight</i>

529
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,801
<i>And every night
you spent shrouded in darkness</i>

530
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,164
<i>Has led you to this moment in the light
It's all right</i>

531
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,201
<i>Wonderful</i>

532
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,161
<i>Glorious</i>

533
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,282
I've never even tried that.

534
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,283
When you do it,
it's different than regular Pilates?

535
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,681
That is why notable
notorious Americans,

536
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,850
such as Roger Morris,
George Washington,

537
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,281
Eliza Jumel and Aaron Burr...

538
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,166
I'm a writer, too. I like to write.

539
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,601
- Oh, that's awesome.
- Yeah, yeah.

540
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,681
- You hold me still.
- Taxi!

541
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,326
All right.

542
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,485
Yeah.

543
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,010
Grab my hand.

544
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,970
- Just watch me dance.
- Okay.

545
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,845
Here, just take it.

546
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,520
Wow! Okay, thanks!

547
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,651
How about hitting this guy up?

548
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,569
Yeah! Do you feel that?

549
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,047
Have all called the
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

550
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,603
- Nice!
- Thank you.

551
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,525
- Exciting.
- Thank you.

552
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,605
It's all right.

553
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,525
No, no. Okay.

554
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,000
Okay, okay!

555
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,041
<i>My love is beautiful
It's here for the taking</i>

556
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,444
<i>It's strong and pure
and utterly earth-shaking</i>

557
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,410
<i>My love has brought me here
to show you it's true</i>

558
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,842
<i>A wretch like me
You'll make it through</i>

559
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,446
Hey, come on, buddy,

560
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,440
what are you doing?
You never see a girl before?

561
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,727
Wow.

562
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,406
Honestly, really? Just keep walking.

563
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,801
That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, Shorty!

564
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,121
Hello, Ice Queen!

565
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,049
Hey, Ice Queen,
I need a hand over here.

566
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,765
Hey, I need a hand right here!

567
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,721
On!

568
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,245
Did you say "Ice Queen"?

569
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,201
- Did you actually say "Ice Queen"?
- Yeah.

570
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,004
Don't say that!

571
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,810
Don't say stuff like that!

572
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,480
All right.

573
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,244
All called the Roger
Morris-Jumel Mansion "home."

574
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,408
Oh! Yeah! Yeah!
Was that unbelievable? Unbelievable!

575
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,646
Don't forget the money, guys.

576
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,084
<i>And everything became clear.</i>

577
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,648
I had kind of an epiphany.

578
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,691
I cannot be the father of 533 children.

579
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,966
It's not possible.

580
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,762
It is impossible to be
the father of 533 children.

581
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,207
It is impossible to be
the father of four children.

582
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,603
Right! Exactly. It's impossible.

583
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,448
But I can be their guardian angel.

584
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,204
Their guardian angel?

585
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,011
They need me.
They need a guardian angel.

586
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,606
They need someone to look out for them.

587
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,691
And I fathered them,
so it's my responsibility.

588
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,447
So, you're telling me that
your purpose on Earth is to look out for,

589
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,565
like a superhero, 533 children.

590
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,051
I didn't say "superhero."

591
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,281
Out of curiosity,

592
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,040
when you're looking out
for these children,

593
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,491
will you be wearing any kind of cape?

594
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,767
I didn't say "superhero."
I said "guardian angel."

595
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,963
So, no cape, but you will have wings
and play the harp.

596
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,730
I'm starting to feel more
and more comfortable

597
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,881
with this insanity plea.

598
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,006
I do not have mental problems.

599
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,005
Say it exactly like that to the judge.

600
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,800
Thanks.

601
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,687
Hey, there.

602
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,291
So, today is the first ultrasound.

603
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,328
David, look, I need... I need a friend.

604
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,082
- I'm a friend.
- I want that to be clear.

605
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,401
It's clear.

606
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,931
Okay, well, let's get going.

607
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,240
I drank a gallon of water

608
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,522
and I'm not allowed to pee
before the ultrasound.

609
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,761
- So, is that the leg there?
- That is.

610
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,410
Which one?
Which one's the leg?

611
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,851
The white spot that you see.

612
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,361
- And is that the head up high?
- That is the head up high.

613
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,602
- Okay.
- And we're gonna see the arm.

614
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,567
- That's amazing.
- Isn't it?

615
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,046
So, now all the organs are okay?

616
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,804
Yep. Perfect.

617
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,123
I just passed by the baby's head.
And there's the belly.

618
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,369
My God, do you see the belly?

619
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,483
And there's the whole baby.

620
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,051
That's incredible.

621
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,210
David, I'm not sure.

622
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,206
Not sure of what?

623
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,607
Look at them. They're monsters.

624
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,690
I mean, look at that one. Look at him.

625
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,651
Emma.

626
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,643
This is the most absolute beautiful thing
that can happen to anyone.

627
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,009
Who are you? The Dalai Lama?

628
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,840
What do you mean,
"the most beautiful thing"?

629
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,846
And look at that one.
He's eating his own booger.

630
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,650
It's a great source of protein.

631
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,241
Listen.

632
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,441
You are going to be a good mother.

633
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,249
So, here's what.

634
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,126
Since I absolutely
do not trust you at all...

635
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,647
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna declare you the father.

636
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,961
- Yes!
- No, David, wait.

637
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,242
I'm gonna declare you the father
on probation.

638
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,570
- "Father on probation"?
- Yeah. You get no slack.

639
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,604
For how long?

640
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,444
Forever.

641
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,486
Will our child have to call me
"Daddy On Probation"?

642
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,647
No.

643
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,967
Will I have to wear a uniform

644
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,203
that will separate me
from the regular daddies?

645
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,522
- No.
- Then, I accept.

646
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,011
We're having a kid. We're having a kid!

647
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,286
Yes.

648
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,961
Your name?

649
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,642
- Earl Monroe.
- And you are?

650
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,526
A friend.

651
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,491
He's over there.

652
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,160
Great.

653
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,727
Thank you.

654
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,764
You're not going to visit with him?

655
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,771
No. I...

656
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,683
I just wanted to stop by
and see him, and...

657
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,370
- Well, now I have, so...
- He would really enjoy it.

658
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,202
Yeah, but...

659
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,603
Don't worry, just say
whatever comes to mind.

660
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,964
Hey, Ryan.

661
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,280
One, two, three.

662
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,607
Earl Monroe.

663
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,926
You did good.

664
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,807
I said nothing the whole time.

665
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,364
I couldn't get a word out.

666
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,602
You were there. You did really good.

667
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,321
Okay.

668
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,606
Great.

669
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,849
<i>In Athabasca, we set a fire</i>

670
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,964
<i>To the world we left far behind</i>

671
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,806
<i>All the faces, we put</i> away

672
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,204
<i>Lost lives float into space</i>

673
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,131
<i>I got a message, I got a sign</i>

674
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,809
<i>Through the wires swinging in time</i>

675
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,889
<i>It's so simple, it's like the sun</i>

676
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,044
<i>Shines down on everyone</i>

677
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,165
<i>Black bird, from the blue</i>

678
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,325
<i>I give my love to get used</i>

679
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,770
<i>Our hopes come true</i>

680
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,161
Sabrina!

681
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,730
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

682
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,325
- You are late.
- I know, I'm sorry.

683
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,725
Thank you very much.

684
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,290
Excuse me.

685
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,520
Sorry.

686
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,531
Excuse me.

687
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,767
Look, if we really want
to find out who Starbuck is,

688
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,922
we need these guys to help us
put together the strategy

689
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,889
to make sure that this thing
doesn't turn into a circus.

690
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,884
- We don't have the money.
- We can do it on our own.

691
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,804
The objective wouldn't be
to always have them there.

692
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,487
I think if we just take the time
to check out what they've proposed...

693
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,369
I simply wanted
to express the fact

694
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,562
that I feel we were better off
without them.

695
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,044
Yes, gentleman in the blue.

696
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,406
Do you have a comment?

697
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,803
I just want to say that...

698
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,164
I don't know all of you here.

699
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,006
But...

700
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,362
But you're all focused, a lot,

701
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,885
on finding Starbuck.

702
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,567
But, whatever happens,

703
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,806
you're all brothers and sisters.

704
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,761
You've all found one another.

705
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,569
- Hey!
- Hey!

706
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,085
- Hi.
- Hi.

707
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,130
What are you doing here?

708
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,721
I'm... Yeah... You know, I'm...

709
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,687
I'm the father.

710
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,481
I'm the adoptive father.
I'm Ryan's adoptive father.

711
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,524
- Ryan?
- He's not here tonight.

712
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,967
He's at a home for the disabled.

713
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,288
He's disabled,
and he just couldn't make it.

714
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,409
- Hey!
- Hey.

715
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,162
Kristen. This is...

716
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,240
- Taylor.
- Yeah. Taylor saved my life.

717
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,324
He saved my life at the pool.
He's a lifeguard.

718
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,689
And I'm the adoptive father of Ryan,

719
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,889
and he couldn't be here,
because he's handicapped.

720
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,246
You're the father of one of the children?

721
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,367
- Adoptive.
- Oh, wow.

722
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,727
- How's it going?
- Hey, hey, hey, Josh!

723
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,880
Yeah.

724
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,051
- Josh, this is Taylor, and this is Kristen.
- How's it going?

725
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,130
Josh worked at a coffee shop,
and he is now an actor.

726
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,765
Josh, this is Taylor.

727
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,167
Taylor is a lifeguard.
He saved my life a few months ago.

728
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,891
And this is Kristen. Orders pizza.
She is also an ex-drug addict.

729
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,042
And I'm the adoptive father

730
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,362
of a young disabled man
who couldn't be here.

731
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,521
And his name is Ryan.

732
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,364
Hey, you're the guy from the park.

733
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,851
- Hey.
- How are you?

734
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,081
Great.

735
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,929
Josh, Kristen and Taylor.

736
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,081
- Hey.
- How are you?

737
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,281
What's up? Adam.

738
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,009
Kristen has got a great job,
and she's still...

739
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,800
Yep, I'm still working at Bloomingdale's.

740
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,484
So the job, which is great.
Everyone's doing great.

741
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,610
And I'm the adoptive father
of a disabled...

742
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,011
Young disabled man.

743
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,925
Ryan, who was obviously...

744
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,527
Unfortunately, was in conflict
with some of the disabled days

745
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,728
of doing the activities and
stuff that we're involved in.

746
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,281
So, I got the stuff for him.
I gotta run out of here.

747
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,568
But everyone looks good.

748
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,766
- Good to see you.
- Great. Great to see you.

749
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,840
Taxi!

750
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,885
As of tonight, you are officially part of
a mass action lawsuit against yourself.

751
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,361
What the hell are you doing here?

752
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,004
A bit of reconnaissance work.
What the hell are you doing here?

753
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,605
I was following one of my kids...

754
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,411
But why are you doing this?
Who does things like that?

755
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,050
I don't know, I was curious.

756
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,281
- Stop!
- Stop what?

757
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,249
Stop everything for the rest of your life.

758
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,368
Every time you have an idea,
I want you to come to me,

759
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,966
and as your friend,
I will shoot your idea down.

760
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,521
You're not a normal person, David.

761
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,165
I am a normal person.

762
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,163
David, we've known each other
for 20 years.

763
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,163
I can tell you for a fact,
you are not normal.

764
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,401
I'm very normal.

765
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,607
Really?

766
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,284
- What about Mariouka?
- I don't see the point...

767
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,486
Five years ago,

768
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,364
you married a Russian woman
that you had never met.

769
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,806
She needed to get into the country,

770
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,201
and she promised to clean
my apartment for a year.

771
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,931
And she disappeared after three days
with her real husband.

772
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,687
David, how much money
did you lose importing Cuban cigars?

773
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,171
That guy looked very honest.

774
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,129
He was in his bathing suit!

775
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,524
Since when does anybody do business
with a man in his bathing suit?

776
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,167
Listen, for the first time in my life,
I think I'm doing the right thing.

777
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,641
You're not doing the right thing.

778
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,363
Stop seeing your kids!

779
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,723
Where's our money?

780
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,048
I'll get it! I said I'll get it.

781
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,246
<i>It's now $100,000.</i>

782
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,764
So, I really need you
to lend me some cash.

783
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,250
Tony. It's David. Yeah...

784
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,166
Hello?

785
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,365
Phil! Buddy, how are you?

786
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,805
Rob!

787
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,206
Nelson!

788
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,767
All right, don't worry, man. I understand.

789
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,250
No, no. I'll catch you soon.

790
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,970
Hello, David Wozniak.

791
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,325
All the profiles.

792
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,722
And I saw on your overdue bills
that your name is David Wozniak.

793
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,928
I was sitting behind you at the hotel.

794
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,365
My name is Viggo.

795
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,889
I'm your biological son.

796
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,006
Are you gonna expose me?

797
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,802
I don't know.

798
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,490
I don't even really know
why I ever wanted to meet you.

799
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,010
Who are you?

800
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,410
What do you do for a living?

801
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,931
I work at a meat store.

802
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,366
I'm a vegetarian.

803
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,808
So, you murder animals.

804
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,362
No. I deliver the meat.

805
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,960
I don't murder it.

806
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,204
I chauffeur it around.

807
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,169
Leo Tolstoy says that,

808
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,448
"if a man earnestly seeks
a righteous life,

809
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,410
"his first act of abstinence
is from animal food."

810
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,801
I did not know that.

811
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,160
Sir Thomas More said,

812
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,766
"The Utopians feel that
slaughtering our fellow creatures

813
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,048
"gradually destroys
the sense of compassion

814
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,443
"which is the finest sentiment
of which our human nature is capable."

815
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,520
That's interesting.

816
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,206
Can we keep this our secret?

817
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,809
Can I stay here a few days?

818
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,724
I need to get to know you.

819
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,810
It has only been two weeks,
and he has become unbearable.

820
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,769
Again this morning,
he called me three times.

821
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,651
That's three times this morning.
He's taking up all of my time.

822
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,882
Do whatever he wants.
We can't let him expose you.

823
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,565
Long conversations.

824
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,282
Long, like police interrogations.
He feels the need to bond.

825
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,249
Do whatever he wants,
or he will expose you.

826
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,327
He wants to point out books
that are so dense and so esoteric

827
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,370
that it's impossible
to make heads or tails of it.

828
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,330
And then he'll twist it
and ask if I agree with it,

829
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,211
and then, he'll use it to prove
that somehow I'm full of shit.

830
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,681
I'm not having conversations
with him, Brett.

831
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,087
I'm in a chess game that
I don't realize that I'm in.

832
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,005
And it's exhausting. It's draining.

833
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,081
No.

834
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,360
- Answer it.
- No!

835
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,922
You have to answer it.
Anything he wants.

836
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,051
<i>Hey, I got you</i> a <i>kale salad.</i>

837
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,241
You got me a what?

838
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,601
Kale salad.

839
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,285
I'm kidding.

840
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,761
I got you a triple monster burger.

841
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,445
Yes, please.

842
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,329
Hey, should you be painting like this?

843
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,405
Because I can do this.

844
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,722
I can do the painting. I'm happy to do it.

845
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,125
Thank you for being here.

846
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,125
I'm glad I'm here.

847
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,322
- But I'm excited to do the painting.
- Yeah?

848
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,880
From now on, let me do the painting.

849
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,126
- All right.
- Okay.

850
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,964
I got you some French fries.

851
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,441
- You got French fries, too?
- Yes.

852
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,170
And there might be
something else in there.

853
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,486
Really?

854
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,250
A little treat?

855
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,801
You got me two burgers!

856
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,768
So, I'm trying to cancel
tomorrow night with Emma

857
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,685
and I think I can get off a bit early,
so we can do whatever.

858
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,491
Whatever you want.
Tomorrow night will be Viggo's choice.

859
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,005
All right, I'm off.

860
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,329
Good game, David.

861
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,405
Everything okay?

862
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,487
Yeah.

863
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,647
You want to play?

864
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,681
Yeah!

865
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,167
All right.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.

866
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,963
We gotta hurry. Careful, careful, careful.

867
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,690
Do you have any sweatpants,
or anything?

868
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,171
No.

869
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,527
You don't want to wear that stuff.
It's not a nightclub, Viggo.

870
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,760
Do you have any shorts for me?

871
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,520
I don't think my shorts are gonna fit you.

872
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,440
Like this.

873
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,126
What?

874
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,966
Up there.

875
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,050
Dribble, dribble, dribble.

876
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,570
Oh, my...

877
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,645
You just gotta dribble. You gotta dribble.

878
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,045
So, you just... You just dribble.

879
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,680
Dribble, dribble! You gotta dribble!
You gotta...

880
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,082
Why doesn't he dribble?

881
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,730
David, you absolutely have
to be there next Saturday.

882
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,689
Everybody's gonna be there.

883
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,766
Actually, I have plans
next Saturday with Emma.

884
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,241
But you were the one who came up
with this whole concept

885
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,681
of brothers and sisters
finding one another.

886
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,002
Yeah, I understand, but I
already have plans with Emma.

887
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,729
Anyway, I spend a heck
of a lot of time with you.

888
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,681
You know, I also have a real family.

889
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,561
Family.

890
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,410
You said "real family."

891
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,127
- No.
- You... You...

892
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,441
Just because
you decided to turn the page

893
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,047
on that period of your life
doesn't mean we don't exist.

894
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,644
We exist. We exist for real.
We're also your real family.

895
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,531
Viggo.

896
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,006
Viggo!

897
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,880
All I'm saying is,
I hope that you're happy.

898
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,930
I hope you realize that I had
to lie to Emma to be here.

899
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,208
That I lied to the woman
carrying my child.

900
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,725
Your "real" child.

901
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,281
Viggo, we have talked
about the incident a lot.

902
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,569
I don't think we need to continue
to dwell on our little misunderstanding.

903
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,769
I am here. Do you see that I'm here?

904
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,446
Do you see that I am here?

905
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,801
- With your fake kids.
- Fake?

906
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,760
Fake? Viggo, what the hell
are you talking about?

907
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,922
I mean, if we're not real, what are we?

908
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,162
- Nietzsche said...
- Screw Nietzsch-ka!

909
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,606
Screw Kindergarten!

910
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,364
"Kierkegaard."

911
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,801
I think it's this way.

912
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,928
Screw Nietzsche! Screw Kierkegaard!

913
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,084
And screw... The...

914
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,931
You can't even come up with one more.
That's it, you're done at two.

915
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,370
Look, screw all of those dudes.
None of those guys had 533 real kids.

916
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,087
Did you bring me here to expose me?

917
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,321
No.

918
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,642
I want to keep you all to myself.

919
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,410
<i>I know it's coming
I can feel it in my bones</i>

920
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,811
All right!

921
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,241
<i>This is information you already know</i>

922
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,688
<i>Even if it's only temporarily</i>

923
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,406
<i>Give the illusion tonight
You belong to me</i>

924
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,767
<i>Oh, the things</i>

925
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,841
<i>I will believe</i>

926
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,049
<i>Ignore the hundred lovers</i>

927
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,203
<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

928
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,841
<i>The words come easily</i>

929
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,804
<i>And they sound so lovely</i>

930
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,245
You all right?

931
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,090
<i>I guess it's just as easy if you lie to me</i>

932
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,209
- Put these next to the grill, here.
- Next to the grill.

933
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,447
Special recipe.

934
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,727
It's a secret family recipe,
but you'll like this.

935
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,241
Wow!

936
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,801
Do you see what happens
when the tofu hits the grill?

937
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,841
Nothing.

938
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,567
Exactly what happens when
the tofu hits our taste buds.

939
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,087
<i>I am alone
I am in love with an idea</i>

940
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,761
<i>Sophisticated neurological appeals</i>

941
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,407
<i>I want to negotiate some kind of a deal</i>

942
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,121
<i>I want to tear it open
Show you that it's real</i>

943
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,931
<i>Oh, the things</i>

944
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,089
<i>I will believe</i>

<i>You got hidden up your sleeve</i>

947
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,568
Okay. Get in nice and tight.

948
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,771
All right, we got one more. Get in close.

949
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,360
- All right.
- Can I get in?

950
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,441
All right.

951
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,086
Okay, everybody, just scooch in.
Get as close as you can.

952
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,769
Okay, on the left.
Can you move in just a little?

953
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,771
All right. Say, "Cheese."

954
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,570
Cheese!

955
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,643
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

956
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,164
<i>Got me down to the very marrow</i>

957
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,090
<i>Don't you know I need your help</i>

958
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,522
<i>You're a friend of mine</i>

959
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,567
<i>And I'm real, real gone</i>

960
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,486
Hey. This is Ryan.

961
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,966
- Hey, Ryan.
- What's up, Ryan?

962
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,411
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hi.

963
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,769
<i>That was the best, right?</i>

964
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,289
I had a great time.

965
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,530
So, uh... I guess this is it.

966
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,129
Have a great day.

967
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,765
Ryan?

968
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,811
Could I just have a... Just... Thanks.

969
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,931
'III

970
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,366
I just wanted to...
I wanted to tell you...

971
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,410
I'm your father.

972
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,326
Okay.

973
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,366
So...

974
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,282
You'll keep seeing more of me.

975
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,850
That was a fun weekend. Okay.

976
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,488
You seem way too relaxed.

977
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,448
This is a great moment for me.

978
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,648
It's a new stage in our relationship.

979
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,881
No.

980
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,611
- No?
- No.

981
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,169
It's really important that you know
there is no truth in anything

982
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,800
they are going to say about me. None.

983
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,291
You must understand,
they love to humiliate me.

984
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,965
They're monsters. Really.

985
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,771
- They are monsters.
- Okay.

986
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,642
I want to propose a toast to Emma.

987
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,883
Because I think it's important
that you know that this...

988
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,203
- Rite of passage.
- Rite of passage.

989
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,562
Well, it's not just about
humiliating David.

990
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,245
Although, it is one of the objectives.

991
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,331
And if we have exposed David's past
to the harsh light of day...

992
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,084
Well, I think it's important,

993
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,884
because you gotta know
what you're getting into.

994
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,644
And now that you know all this...

995
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,370
I have some more pictures.

996
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,931
Not Sniper.

997
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,246
Sniper?

998
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,323
It was his rock band.
They wore a lot of makeup.

999
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,922
It was the '80s. Everybody wore makeup.

1000
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,002
I didn't wear makeup in the '80s.

1001
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,925
But look, now that all this is known...

1002
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,605
I think it's also very important
for you to know

1003
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,088
that the Wozniaks have had
some wonderful times

1004
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,011
- and some hard times.
- No.

1005
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,681
Dad?

1006
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,846
When my wife and I were newlyweds,

1007
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,322
we always dreamed of
having a honeymoon in Italy.

1008
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,848
But we didn't have much money.

1009
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,409
Then we had children.

1010
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,962
We told ourselves, someday,
when we're old.

1011
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,130
But time passed.

1012
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,763
You have to make
the most of the present.

1013
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,485
Do you all make the most of the present?

1014
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,561
Yes.

1015
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,369
Yes, Dad.
We make the most of the present.

1016
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,886
When my wife fell ill,

1017
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,408
David came over one day
with plane tickets to Venice.

1018
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,089
He had seen to everything.

1019
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,687
The hotel near Doge's Palace,
the gondolas.

1020
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,922
Then later, our three sons
flew over and joined us.

1021
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:57,084
We had a big family dinner
near St. Mark's Square.

1022
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,604
David paid for everything.

1023
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,450
David...

1024
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,884
He does things like that.

1025
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,121
If you are able to live
with his countless faults,

1026
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,443
you will also live through
some marvelous times.

1027
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,161
Let us pray.

1028
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,925
- No.
- Come on. Dad, please.

1029
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,570
- Let's drink.
- Yes.

1030
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,809
Your father is adorable.

1031
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,650
Yeah.

1032
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,164
I can't believe you brought
your whole family to Venice.

1033
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,130
How did you pay for that?

1034
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,200
I had money.

1035
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,646
When you were 20?

1036
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,371
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1037
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,449
What kind of job did you have
that would pay for a trip to Venice?

1038
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,771
It was a manual-labor type job.

1039
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,202
That was an awesome meal.

1040
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,851
Almost.

1041
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,125
All right, let's bring it.
Open the flood gates, here.

1042
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,523
Have fun.
Okay, have a good day at school, guys.

1043
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,681
Have a good time.

1044
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,923
It's okay to like recess. How are you?
Look at these angels.

1045
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,845
My man, how you feeling?
Have fun, buddy.

1046
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,808
Coffee? Toast? Eggs?

1047
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,681
- No.
- How was your weekend?

1048
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,244
- Relaxing.
- Good.

1049
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,640
Very relaxed.

1050
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,925
Dinner with the family.

1051
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,046
And I read.

1052
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,760
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1053
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,202
That you lie to your girlfriend,
that's par for the course.

1054
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,766
Untruthfulness is the basis of a good,
strong relationship.

1055
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,086
But I'm not your girlfriend, David.

1056
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,720
So, before you tell me
that you spent the weekend

1057
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,489
with Frodo and Gandalf
and Bilbo Baggins,

1058
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,688
why don't you go ahead
and take a look at this?

1059
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,441
Well, as you can attest,

1060
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,649
the reporter won't be winning any prizes
for his journalistic skills.

1061
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,691
But apparently,
his story was picked up by CNN

1062
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,563
and Fox, and even the BBC.

1063
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,763
Which means,
when you go to bed tonight,

1064
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,601
four or five billion people will be asking,
"Who the fuck is Starbuck?"

1065
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,926
Now tell me, is this good news for us?

1066
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,367
Does this augur well for our trial?

1067
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,603
Is this the type of situation
over which we can regain control?

1068
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,321
The answer is yes.

1069
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,806
Now, we go on the offensive.

1070
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,406
A countersuit.
We, too, are going to sue the clinic.

1071
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,601
What for?

1072
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,762
Substantial punitive damages.

1073
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,083
It's the clinic's duty not to do anything
to jeopardize your anonymity.

1074
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,410
By overusing your donations,
they have given rise to a substantial,

1075
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,046
well-funded challenge to your anonymity

1076
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,727
which has now generated
extensive media coverage.

1077
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,369
I mean, you should hear the stuff
that people are saying about Starbuck.

1078
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,600
What are they saying about Starbuck?

1079
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,280
Terrible things. But it's good.

1080
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,283
It's fine, because our countersuit...

1081
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,283
David, your debt problems will go away.

1082
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,728
We're going after big, big money.

1083
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,965
<i>It is all over Twitter,
it is all over the net.</i>

1084
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,726
<i>No way is this guy
coming out of the closet.</i>

1085
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,881
<i>No way!</i>

1086
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,883
<i>At work,
every meeting you go into,</i>

1087
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,086
<i>no matter what you say,</i>

1088
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,490
<i>everyone will always be thinking,
"Hey, it's El Masturbator."</i>

1089
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,807
<i>Five hundred
and thirty-three kids!</i>

1090
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,650
<i>He's donated 693 times!</i>

1091
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,249
<i>Boy, this guy was making money
hand over fist. I can't believe it.</i>

1092
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,002
<i>Anyway, listen.
He went by the code name "Starbuck."</i>

1093
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,161
<i>"Starbuck"?</i>

1094
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,927
<i>I think "Chock full o'Nuts"
would have been more like it.</i>

1095
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,760
<i>"Chock full o'Nuts"
would have been better.</i>

1096
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,924
You should read some of these tweets.

1097
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,331
<i>The last kid was an accident.</i>

1098
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,721
<i>I guess he was watching
a rerun of Baywatch,</i>

1099
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,330
<i>and it just happened.</i>

1100
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,681
<i>I had no idea this could
actually be a job.</i>

1101
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,363
<i>I mean, I knew it could be a hobby.</i>

1102
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,804
What do you think about
all this "Starbuck" business?

1103
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,371
Oh, it's horrible.

1104
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,407
What's horrible?

1105
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,164
It's horrible.
You don't think it's absolutely horrible?

1106
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,049
- I don't know.
- What was he thinking?

1107
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,886
Well, he obviously wasn't thinking
that they would use his sperm so much.

1108
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,042
And he obviously wasn't thinking

1109
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,885
that they would choose
his profile so often.

1110
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,201
May I help you?

1111
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,967
Yeah, do you have a stroller
for 533 children?

1112
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,731
- No.
- No. No.

1113
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,881
He doesn't.

1114
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,044
Because it's not normal
to have 533 children.

1115
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,690
It's not normal.

1116
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,688
Viggo, where the hell are you going?

1117
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,569
- I don't know.
- It goes in the back.

1118
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,404
- In the back.
- Okay.

1119
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,050
Hey, David.

1120
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,722
Your brothers are in the office.
They want to see you.

1121
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,688
They wanted 100 grand! 100 grand?

1122
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,010
I mean, Pop didn't have it.
So they tried to drown him!

1123
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,241
What were you thinking?

1124
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,761
Tell me, David, what were you thinking?

1125
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,970
Get the cash, David. Get the cash!

1126
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,205
Unbelievable!

1127
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,641
- Dad, listen.
- Go away, David.

1128
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,450
Go away.

1129
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,251
Let's...

1130
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,530
Let's do the countersuit.

1131
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,486
Excellent. Excellent.

1132
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,962
- Come on in.
- All right.

1133
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,369
<i>BRETT'. What would happen
if we no longer</i>

1134
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,408
<i>respected these types of agreements?</i>

1135
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,328
Nothing less than an unlimited quantity
of chaos.

1136
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,570
Custody battles.

1137
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,969
Possible intrusions upon happy families.

1138
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,442
And this, on either party's side.

1139
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:48,083
<i>Mothers showing up
on donors' doorsteps.</i>

1140
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,809
<i>And donors suddenly
wanting visitation rights,</i>

1141
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,723
<i>wanting to partake
in important decisions</i>

1142
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,802
<i>about religion, about schooling.</i>

1143
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,284
None of the parties were coerced
into signing this agreement.

1144
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,601
And nowhere have I seen
an expiration date.

1145
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,246
What'd you guys think?

1146
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,771
Why don't I understand
when you are talking?

1147
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,329
Well, you see...

1148
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,481
This is a complex situation.

1149
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,722
I would vote for the other guy.

1150
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,286
Well... No. The other guy is wrong.

1151
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,563
Grandma's right.
I think you're gonna lose again.

1152
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,130
Did she say that?

1153
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,527
Okay. Well, all right. Thanks, kids.

1154
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,400
You can all go to bed.

1155
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,568
Is that going to be
your argument in court?

1156
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:55,281
That won't work in court.
You can't send the real judge to bed.

1157
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,966
Yes, I can.
Daddy can send anyone to bed.

1158
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,849
And right now, you're all going to bed.

1159
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,801
Now, go.

1160
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,408
These are children who are lost.
They are lost in the wilderness.

1161
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,444
And they want to know
who their father is.

1162
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,329
I mean, is that too much to ask?

1163
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,801
And what would...

1164
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,567
What would happen if we no longer
accepted these types of agreements?

1165
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:06,729
Nothing more than
an unlimited quantity of chaos.

1166
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,801
Um...

1167
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,126
The mic...

1168
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,570
Oh, that's better. Is that okay?

1169
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,371
Here we are, outside of
the New York courtroom...

1170
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,006
I feel like this is an easy case to win.

1171
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,611
<i>What I'm saying is,</i>

1172
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,004
<i>which fundamental right should
take more importance here?</i>

1173
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,767
<i>I've been</i> a <i>musician
pretty much my whole life.</i>

1174
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,321
And when I write music,
I write it because...

1175
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,404
I think, when I say this,
I speak for everyone.

1176
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,686
I know, how for me...

1177
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,081
I wasn't actually able to
grow up with a dad.

1178
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,887
I would like to meet the guy,
the man, who created me.

1179
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,050
And there's a lot of transitions
in my life that I've come across.

1180
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,522
It's central to who I am.
It's really all I've thought about.

1181
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,730
I just want to feel
like I have a part of myself.

1182
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,731
The last ultrasound
that is on Friday at 2:00,

1183
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,450
do you think that you can make it there?

1184
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,482
There is no contract, okay?
They've broken the contract!

1185
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,806
They break with the contract!

1186
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,966
The man signed an anonymity
agreement for 693 donations!

1187
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,770
He has a right to punitive damages,

1188
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,320
because you should hear
what people are saying about him now.

1189
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,885
- You have got to be prepared!
- I am prepared!

1190
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,327
Well, then why don't you do it?

1191
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,170
You're my friend, I'm sorry.

1192
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,520
- I'm just so pissed off.
- Yeah.

1193
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,001
So we hope that it has been made clear

1194
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,880
that the intentional blocking
of this vital information

1195
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,925
has had, and will continue to have
a negative psychological impact

1196
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,562
on each and every single one
of Starbuck's children.

1197
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,921
In finishing,

1198
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,287
while the donor may have bargained
for confidentiality with the clinic,

1199
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,242
and the parents may have
accepted that confidentiality

1200
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,887
as a condition to receiving
the sperm donation...

1201
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,842
The children didn't agree to anything.

1202
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:10,849
Yet, they are the ones,
they are the ones most directly affected.

1203
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,846
This makes no sense.

1204
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,887
Thank you.

1205
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,962
These are some great kids.

1206
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,244
Without the anonymity clause,

1207
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,609
none of them would be here.

1208
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,761
And not to have these beautiful kids,

1209
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,009
that would be a great loss.

1210
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,845
We need the anonymity clause.

1211
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,644
The court will now take
the matter under advisement.

1212
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,291
How long could it take?

1213
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,446
I don't know, David. I do not know!

1214
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,766
What don't you know?

1215
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,605
I know absolutely nothing!
My mother was right.

1216
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,882
I'm useless and I'm out of my league.

1217
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,162
You should have got
a real lawyer, David.

1218
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,051
<i>All rise!</i>

1219
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,161
You may be seated.

1220
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,083
In the adjudicated action,

1221
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,641
the parties will receive
a detailed document,

1222
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:35,243
in which you will read
that Starbuck is entirely,

1223
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:39,964
and without reservation,
entitled to remain

1224
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,086
anonymous.

1225
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,561
He will also be entitled to $200,000
in punitive damages

1226
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,525
from the Graboski-Levitt Clinic.

1227
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,725
You are adjourned.

1228
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,963
Starbuck, therefore, will be entitled
to remain completely anonymous.

1229
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,811
He also will receive
$200,000 in damages.

1230
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,446
Yes! Yes!

1231
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,647
Brett,
what's your reaction to the verdict?

1232
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,286
Obviously, I feel great compassion
for the children.

1233
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,488
But I am very, very happy-

1234
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:19,050
I am very proud to have vindicated
my client and his rights.

1235
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,967
<i>And I want to say thank you
to my own children and to my mother.</i>

1236
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,204
<i>Mom, I won.</i>

1237
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,131
<i>I won.</i>

1238
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:33,442
<i>And I just want to say, David, we did it!</i>

1239
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,401
No!

1240
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,721
<i>We did it, David!</i>

1241
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,724
- No.
- Who's David?

1242
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,885
<i>He's my lover</i>

1243
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,805
<i>who has always been there for me.</i>

1244
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,930
<i>And, David, my darling...</i>

1245
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,641
<i>I love you, David. I love you, David.</i>

1246
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,485
Obviously,
a very emotional trial for everyone here.

1247
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,847
Did you expect this verdict?

1248
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,211
We're disappointed.

1249
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,689
Our case was dismissed,
and we've now exhausted

1250
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,449
every possible legal recourse.

1251
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,684
But we haven't lost everything.

1252
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,171
While we were told today there's no law
requiring Starbuck to identify himself,

1253
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,802
there's more to this
than just legal obligation.

1254
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,522
There's us, and there's him.

1255
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,608
And beyond any law,
there are human beings.

1256
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,771
So, ultimately,
the final decision is Starbuck's.

1257
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,925
He's under no legal obligation
to identify himself.

1258
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,806
<i>But now that he's seen all of us,</i>

1259
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,970
<i>he may well decide to do so.</i>

1260
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,850
<i>That decision is his.</i>

1261
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,922
<i>There has been a lot of
unfavorable comments about Starbuck</i>

1262
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,889
<i>in all of this media coverage.</i>

1263
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,808
<i>We would really just like
our father to know</i>

1264
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,848
<i>that in our eyes,</i>

1265
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,965
<i>he's not a criminal or a freak.</i>

1266
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,250
<i>To us, he's someone</i>

1267
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:07,050
<i>who gave life and happiness
where it was badly needed.</i>

1268
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,489
Congratulations, darling.

1269
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,405
I had it.

1270
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:41,442
I had pitched the perfect game
and I had to screw the whole thing up.

1271
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,647
My mother saw the whole thing on TV.

1272
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:52,007
Well, she must have been surprised
to find out that you had a male lover.

1273
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,210
No. She said she always suspected it.

1274
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,728
She told me we make a lovely couple.

1275
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,161
And your kids?

1276
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,482
- They think it's cool.
- Mmm.

1277
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,645
I'm just wondering...

1278
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,567
And really just theoretically, but...

1279
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,769
If I decided to identify myself,

1280
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,042
would I lose all the money
from the countersuit?

1281
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,524
Yeah, I think you would.

1282
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,685
Emma always says that, uh...

1283
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,124
That I don't have a life.

1284
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:48,330
So, um, I officially set out

1285
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,128
to try and do the right thing.

1286
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,162
It's harder than I thought.

1287
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,921
Pop.

1288
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,210
Pop, I'm Starbuck.

1289
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,370
<i>You are El Masturbator?</i>

1290
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,801
Yeah.

1291
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,891
Now, for once in my life,
I'd like to make the right decision.

1292
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,365
Once.

1293
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,603
For once in my life, I would
like to be a normal person.

1294
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,730
How would a normal person
handle a situation like this?

1295
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,491
A normal person would
not be in this situation.

1296
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:03,408
Let's just say that a normal person
had a slight lapse of judgment

1297
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,121
and donated sperm 693 times.

1298
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,289
What would they do?
What would my brothers do?

1299
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,761
Your brothers are not mentally equipped

1300
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,645
to deal with a situation like this.

1301
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,603
When you get right down to it,

1302
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,730
you're probably one of the
few people on this earth

1303
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,445
able to deal with such a situation.

1304
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,771
Why not just tell them?

1305
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,563
As you know,
I have some money problems.

1306
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,609
Yeah, your debts.

1307
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:40,409
You know I grew up
in terrible, terrible poverty.

1308
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,561
Yes, I know, Pop.

1309
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,401
I know.

1310
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:48,282
When I left Warsaw to go to the States,
my father gave me $10.

1311
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,408
That was everything he had.

1312
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,650
I couldn't turn down his help,

1313
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:58,806
so I promised him I'd pay him back
1,000 times over, once I got rich.

1314
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,963
My father died

1315
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,811
when your mother and I
still didn't have a cent.

1316
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,521
'III

1317
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,285
I always wondered
what was harder for him.

1318
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,488
Not being able
to give his children enough,

1319
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,644
or not being with them
when they hit hard times.

1320
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,440
My great good fortune in life
is to see you boys every day.

1321
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,130
That, for me, is success.

1322
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,248
So, like my father, I want to help you.

1323
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,525
Here is $10.

1324
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,651
It brought me good luck.

1325
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,322
With $10, I built my empire.

1326
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,007
So, take the $10.

1327
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,170
And also take...

1328
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,010
It's your share of the meat store.

1329
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:54,364
It's your inheritance, in small bills,
to pay off your debts.

1330
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,409
I'm scared I'll disappoint them.

1331
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,684
Why would they be disappointed?

1332
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,403
I'm a meat truck driver.

1333
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,488
I'm an incompetent meat truck driver.

1334
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,086
True, you are incompetent.

1335
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,483
It takes you four times longer
to deliver meat than anyone else.

1336
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:20,207
But wherever you go, people love you.

1337
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,169
They're going to love you.

1338
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,284
Everyone loves you.

1339
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,044
Thanks, Pop.

1340
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,768
We'll be right with you, sir.

1341
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,967
Emma!

1342
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,967
Emma!

1343
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,165
Mr. Wozniak?

1344
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,844
You gave us a little scare, there.

1345
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,961
Yeah.

1346
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,170
Hi.

1347
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,487
Mr. Wozniak?

1348
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,767
Yeah.

1349
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,326
Your family is here to see you.

1350
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,000
Is he healthy?

1351
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,526
Yes.

1352
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,003
Does that mean he can work tomorrow?

1353
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:23,687
This is weird.

1354
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,971
Hey-

1355
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,445
I lied to you.

1356
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,089
I am your biological father.

1357
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,482
And you have a little brother.

1358
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,210
He was in a bit of a hurry. But...

1359
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:59,563
He's doing very, very, very well.

1360
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,001
Can we see him?

1361
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,084
I'll find out.

1362
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,047
Hey-

1363
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,851
He's so small.

1364
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,806
Emma.

1365
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,920
Will you marry me?

1366
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,371
Wouldn't you want to wait and see
if I get my figure back?

1367
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:53,370
If you stay flabby,
I promise I'll get flabby as well.

1368
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,408
I wonder if that's
the first time the word "flabby"

1369
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,562
has been used in a marriage proposal.

1370
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,880
Emma...

1371
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,241
I'm Starbuck.

1372
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,649
Why are you always scamming?

1373
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:37,802
God, how could you think
that a marriage proposal

1374
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:43,285
would excuse the fact that
you're the father of 533 children?

1375
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,727
David! God!

1376
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,120
How...

1377
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,683
This is no longer your child.

1378
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,046
I want to be very clear on two points.

1379
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,531
The first point.

1380
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,762
I said I was gonna change
as quickly as possible,

1381
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,961
and I am doing that.

1382
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,130
I've had a chance to do a lot of thinking.
A lot!

1383
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,443
And I've come to the conclusion
that it's not anyone but me

1384
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,000
who can decide if I am the father or not.

1385
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,403
Not a judge, not my family, not Dr. Phil,

1386
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,568
and in the end, not you.

1387
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:21,681
In other words, nobody but the father
can decide if he is the father or not.

1388
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,731
And I, David Wozniak,
am the father of this child.

1389
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:31,367
The other reality that can't be changed
is the fact that I am Starbuck.

1390
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,841
Now, this, obviously,
can be somewhat frightening

1391
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,084
since it's something totally new,
and no one on this planet

1392
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,811
has ever experienced it before. It's...

1393
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,003
It is like the first steps
on the moon.

1394
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,921
But despite a few drawbacks,

1395
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,367
I think that we can
actually take away from this

1396
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,165
a tremendous amount of joy.

1397
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:59,283
Not to mention,
vast amounts of free babysitting.

1398
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,522
I don't know how this is gonna work out.

1399
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,047
Right now, me coming out
and revealing who I am,

1400
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,764
I'm risking everything.

1401
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:12,484
I'm risking all for the well-being
of my 533 kids.

1402
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:15,286
And I would think
that you seeing me risk all

1403
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,602
should convince you
that whatever happens,

1404
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:23,044
that no matter what turmoil this kid
right here gets into, I will be there.

1405
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,850
Now, you asked me to have a life.

1406
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,527
Well, here it is. This is my life.

1407
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,967
It may be a bit strange.

1408
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,282
And a bit oversized.

1409
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,608
But it's my life.

1410
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,369
The second point.

1411
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,010
That was a very long first point.

1412
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:52,370
The first point was long.
The second point...

1413
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,889
The marriage proposal was not a scam.

1414
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,768
The second point was much shorter.

1415
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,921
I need you in my life.

1416
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,843
Promise me,
one day you'll take me to Venice.

1417
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,210
Okay.

1418
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,521
<i>The world is yours</i>

1419
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,801
<i>Hold it close</i>

1420
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,889
<i>With open arms</i>

1421
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,005
<i>Little feet</i>

1422
