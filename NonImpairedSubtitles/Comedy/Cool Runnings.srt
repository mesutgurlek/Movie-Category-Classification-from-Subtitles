1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Ah, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

2
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,200
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
If I give the love
you know you won't forget

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,000
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,600
Come on to me, baby

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,700
And take my blues away

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,300
What I need to see now

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,600
Is brighter days

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,700
I want to take away
my dark skies

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Take away my tears

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,300
Take away my sufferin'

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,800
People feel for
all these years

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,900
Ah, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,500
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,700
If I give the love
you know you won't forget

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,600
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Let this love light shine

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,700
Let it in your soul

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,500
Steady on forever

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,000
It's time to take control

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,200
- On your mark, get set, run!
- We don't need no darkness

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,600
We don't need no fear

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,000
We don't need no sadness

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,500
All we need is care

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,200
Don't get upset
if you ain't got nobody

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,500
Don't get upset
if you have no fun

27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,000
- Don't get angry
- Don't get upset

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
- When you wake up in the mornin'
- Hey, Derice, where you runnin', man?

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,100
- 'Cause it's a new day
- West.
- Mornin'. How are you?

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,000
Life's just begun

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Ooh, yeah
Give thanks and praises

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,400
- Hey there.
- Derice!

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,700
- Yeah, man!
- Love is coming your way

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,600
Don't get upset
if you ain't got nobody

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Don't get upset
if you have no fun

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,200
- Don't get angry
- Don't get upset

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,900
When you wake up
in the mornin'

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,200
'Cause it's a new day
Life's just begun

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Ooh, yeah
Give thanks and praises

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,100
- Morning.
- Faster, Bannock, faster!

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Come on, child, you have
an Olympics to get to.

42
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,800
Handsome as a lion, that one.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,300
I could watch that backside
all day.

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,300
Come on!

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,200
- Go! Come on!
- Ah, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,100
Girl, if I give the love
you know you won't forget

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Take away my sadness

48
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,900
Take away my tears

49
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, Sanka.

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,300
This steering wheel
is finished.

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,200
All right, team, let's get ready
for the pre-race cheer. Ready?

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,700
- Yes, sir!
- Ready?
- Yes, sir!

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,400
All right,
one, two, three, toot!

54
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,600
Who's the captain
of our crew?

55
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,000
Who's a friend to me and you?

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,400
Kind of nice, good-looking too.
Sanka! Sanka! Yea, Sanka!

57
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,600
Get back to work!

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,900
Who's the big hot bag of air who
doesn't have to comb his hair...

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,300
who doesn't bathe
and doesn't care?

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,100
- Sanka! Sanka! Sanka!
- Yea, Sanka! Hey!

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,200
What's happenin', star?
Where you been, man?

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,100
You almost missed my all-time world
record: seventh derby in a row.

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,300
Easy, Rasta. I'm not going to forget
my best friend on this day of days.

64
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Derice, my grandfather says
you're definitely going to
make it to the Olympics.

65
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,600
He says you're even faster
than your father.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,200
-Yeah, man, do it for Jamaica!
-Hey, you know what my grandfather says?

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,500
- What?
- Get back to work!

68
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,000
- Booie, booie!
- What are you talkin' about?

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Good luck, man. I'll see you
at the finish line, all right?

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,500
- Hi, Momma Coffie.
- Hi, Derice.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,500
- Derice, is Sanka ready?
- Who knows?

72
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,000
Ready. That boy's never ready.

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,900
He's a lazy, crazy, sorry,
no-good bag of bones.

74
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,400
So what you laughing at?

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,600
All pushcarts
to the start position!

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,300
- Ready, little man?
- Ready, big man.

77
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,500
Kiss the lucky egg.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,700
Let's go!

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,600
- On your marks...
- Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme!

80
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,300
Get on up!
It's pushcart time!

81
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,600
and go !

82
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,700
Here we go, Winston!
The Rockett has been launched!

83
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,200
Hey, fruitcake!
Where'd you get that cart?

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,100
Clear out!
Come on, move out! Look out!

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,500
Sanka Coffie,
pushcart champion!

86
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,600
- Pushcart champion!
- Get away! Get away!

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
Hey, grandma, out of my way!

88
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,300
Hey, Sunday driver, make room
for the Rasta Rockett! Make room!

89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,700
- Sanka, four more carts left!
- Pee Wee, move! Move out!

90
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,800
I love Jamaica,
and Jamaica loves me!

91
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,900
Champion! Champion!
You can't mess with the best!

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,400
- Move over! Move over!
- Get away! Get off me!

93
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,200
- Go, Sanka!
- Get him! Get him!

94
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,500
One more cart left!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

95
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Yes! We win!

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
Jump, Winston, jump!

97
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Sanka!

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Move it, man!
Move, move, move!

99
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Sanka, you dead?

100
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, man.

101
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,600
And where do you think
you're going?

102
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,900
You caught me.

103
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,400
- You have papers to grade.
- I'm just getting in one last run.

104
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,100
I can't believe the tryouts
are finally here.

105
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,400
- You nervous?
- I'm not nervous.

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm ready. I've been ready
for this day my whole life.

107
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't care how fast they run,
I'm going to run faster.

108
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,500
I don't care how much
they want it, I want it more.

109
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,700
I'm going to the Olympics, baby.

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,400
I feel it.
I'm going to win the gold.

111
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,300
Derice, are you nervous?

112
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,400
I'm terrified.

113
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,500
It's my turn, Joy!
It's my turn!

114
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the final event...

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,500
of today's Olympic tryouts.

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,300
We have now come to the
main event of our games...

117
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,200
the running
of the 100-metre finals.

118
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
We've had a most
successful afternoon...

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
and I'd like to congratulate
all the athletes...

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,800
who have participated
in today's events.

121
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,500
- You sure no one can beat him?
- Oh, sure, I'm sure.

122
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm just a little concerned
about that big baldy.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let me first congratulate our athletes
on a splendid performance...

124
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,600
and let me remind them that
only the top four finishers...

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,400
will earn the right to represent
Jamaica in the forthcoming
summer games in Seoul, Korea.

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,700
Wait. Y-You're Derice Bannock,
right?

127
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,000
- That's me.
- Oh. I hope I make the team.

128
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,600
-It would be a real honour to
run with you. Good luck to you.
-Good luck to you.

129
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,100
Derice Bannock.
Hey, good luck to you too.

130
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,100
Runners, take your marks.

131
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Get set!

132
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,200
Mr Coolidge, please,
you have to run the race over!

133
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm sorry, Derice.
Nothing can be done.

134
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,900
But I was born to compete
in the Olympics!

135
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,700
Then you're going to have to work
on your boxing or your cycling.

136
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,500
Those are the only other two sports
in which Jamaica competes.

137
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,500
I am not a boxer,
I am a runner.

138
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,000
And it wasn't fair.

139
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,400
It rarely is, my boy.
It rarely is.

140
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,400
Well, Papa, what do I do now?

141
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,800
Look, Derice, let it go, eh?
Let it go.

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,700
You'll have another chance
in four years.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Yeah.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
Mr Coolidge...

145
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,500
who is the other man in
the picture with my father?

146
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,100
Irving Blitzer. He's an
American who lives here.

147
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,800
- Unless, of course, he's
been arrested or shot.
- Excuse me?

148
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, he's a bookie now.

149
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,400
Takes his bets in a small
pool hall just past Sandy Bay.

150
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,700
- Isn't that a gold medal
around his neck?
- Oh, yeah.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
That lunatic was an Olympic
bobsledder who tried to get
your father to switch sports.

152
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,000
He had some theory about using
track sprinters to push the bobsleds.

153
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Some ridiculous
thing like that.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Can you imagine
a Jamaican bobsledder?

155
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,900
And you're sure this man,
he lives on the island?

156
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
- Oh, yes.
- Mr Coolidge, thanks a lot.

157
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,400
- Good, Derice.
- Oh, could I borrow this picture?

158
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,600
- Bring it back!
- Yes, sir. Thanks a lot, Mr Coolidge.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,200
- Oh, just one more thing.
- Mmm?

160
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,700
What's a bobsled?

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,500
That's a bobsled.

162
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,400
Oh. So a bobsled is
a pushcart with no wheels.

163
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,600
-That's what it looks like here.
-Let me see that.

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,300
All right. "The key elements
for a successful sled team...

165
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,800
are a steady driver
and three strong runners
to push off down the ice."

166
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,200
Ice? lce?

167
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Well...

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,800
it's kind of a
winter sport, you know.

169
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,900
- You mean winter, as in ice?
- Maybe.

170
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,600
You mean winter, as in igloos
and Eskimos and penguins and ice?

171
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,400
- Possibly.
- See you.

172
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,400
Where you going?

173
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm going to take a hot bath.
I'm getting cold just thinking
about all this ice.

174
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,100
- No, man! You're going to be
part of my bobsled team!
- What do you need me for?

175
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,700
Who is the best pushcart driver
in all o' Jamaica?

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
- You're looking at him?
- Then you're going to do it?

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No!

178
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Hey, man, you could be famous.

179
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,800
You could have your picture
on a Wheaties box.

180
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,800
But you said "no," and that's
all right, because I don't need you.

181
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
Everybody is going to want
to be on my bobsled team!

182
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Look, star, let me tell you
a little something, all right?

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,300
When you need something from me, you
don't have to hand me a bunch of lines.

184
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,800
All you have to do is
look at me in the eye and say,
"Sanka, you are my best friend.

185
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,200
We been through a whole heap together
and I really, really need you."

186
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Sanka, you're right.
And you are my best friend.

187
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,900
- And we've been through
a whole lot together.
- Heap. Heap.

188
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,900
Sorry, man.
Whole heap together.

189
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,400
- "And I really, really need you."
- And I really, really need you.

190
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
- Forget it.
- But you just said if I said that--

191
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,500
All right.
All right, all right. All right, man.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So, let's talk about
this bill-sled team.

193
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
- No, bobsled team.
- Whoever.

194
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Now, about the Wheaties box--
I'm going to be on it by myself, right?

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,100
No, man, you're going to
be on it with me.

196
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,600
And down the stretch they come!
Tumbleweed is holding on...

197
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,000
- as Captain Video makes it
all the way on the outside.
- Yes, Tumbleweed, yes!

198
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,500
- Come on! That's it!
- Brewster is dropping back
as Tumbleweed holds the rail.

199
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
- Good Tumbleweed! Good Tumbleweed!
- And here comes Captain Video
on the outside!

200
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,300
- Tumbleweed is slowing!
- No, Tumbleweed! No! Bad
Tumbleweed! What are you doing?

201
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,000
- Tumbleweed can't hold it and he
gets pinned against the rail.
- What? Don't do--

202
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
- It's anyone's race
as they approach the rail!
- Don't do that! Let him out!

203
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,500
- Captain Video makes his move!
Tumbleweed is running gamely...
- No! I need this one!

204
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
- but Captain Video seems
just a little bit too strong!
- Please! Come on!

205
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,100
- Here they come!
- No!

206
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,200
Yes! Tumbleweed can't hold it,
as Captain Video takes charge.

207
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,600
And it's Brewster finishing in second,
Susan's Pride finishes third...

208
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,900
and Tumbleweed
is nowhere in sight!

209
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,200
But, my, oh, my,
the odds-on favourite...

210
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,900
- showed his true colours
with that late-stretch run.
- That's all right. Uh-huh.

211
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,200
Tumbleweed held on momentarily,
but realistically...

212
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
only a fool would put
their money on Tumbleweed.

213
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,500
That horse had no chance of--

214
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,000
That guy won two gold medals?

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,500
I think so.

216
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,600
That's Tumbleweed gone.

217
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,500
Okay, next race.

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,200
Excuse me. Are you
Mr lrving Blitzer?

219
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,700
Well, that depends
on who's asking.

220
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,300
My name is Derice Bannock.
This is my teammate Sanka Coffie.

221
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,700
Greetings, sled god.

222
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,300
We were just wondering if you'd
be interested in coaching the
first Jamaican bobsled team.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
Derice, remember the radio?
Radio?

224
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,500
Stick. Shooting with the stick.
Let's go!

225
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
Let's go, Derice!

226
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
Come on, Coach.

227
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Just help me get started!

228
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
- Greetings, sled god.
- Sorry to bother you...

229
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,400
- Get out! Get out!
- but you're the only one
that can help us!

230
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
- Go away.
- Okay.

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,100
Nice to meet you!

232
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
- Maybe today is a bad day.
- Yeah.

233
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,500
I'll come back tomorrow, and
the next day, and the next day,

234
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,500
- No. No!
- and the next day.

235
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,000
- Look, whatever you're name is--
- Derice.

236
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,500
All right, Derice, let me lay
out some difficulties for you.

237
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,000
Snow-- you don't have any.

238
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
It's 900 degrees out there.

239
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Time-- you don't have any.

240
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
The Olympics
are in three months.

241
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,800
And me-- you don't have me.

242
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,300
As far as I'm concerned, the sport
of bobsledding no longer exists.

243
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,900
I don't want to do it,
I don't want to coach it...

244
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,100
and most of all--
and I mean most of all--

245
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I don't want to be within
2,000 miles of anyone who does.

246
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,100
- Now, did you follow all that?
- Then how come you still have
that poster on the wall?

247
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,700
Is that what's bothering you?

248
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,600
There. Is that better?

249
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,600
Are you happy?

250
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,600
Like I said,
my name is Derice Bannock.

251
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm Ben Bannock's son.

252
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,700
I haven't seen this picture
in twenty years.

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,900
Huh! Would you look at me then.

254
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,300
- Ooh. Would you look at me now?
- Please, Mr Blitzer.

255
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,100
Just give me a chance.

256
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
If I don't have what it takes,
we forget the whole thing.

257
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,300
- Believe me, kid, you do not
have what it takes.
- But you thought my father did.

258
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Your father was one of
the toughest competitors I ever saw.

259
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,100
He ran the 100 metres
in ten-flat.

260
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Well, I run it in 9.9.

261
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,600
Come on. Coach me.

262
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,900
Sorry. You're a couple
decades late.

263
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,300
Oh, I see. Well, it might be
easy for you...

264
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,300
to walk away from me,
Mr Blitzer...

265
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,300
but you can't walk away
from this:

266
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,200
20 years ago you came down here
to see if you could make...

267
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
a Jamaican sprinter
into a bobsledder...

268
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,000
and you never got that chance.

269
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Look at me, Mr Blitzer.

270
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm your chance.

271
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,400
Take it.

272
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,900
All right, everyone quiet down.

273
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,000
Nice group here.

274
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,600
Now, for two of you lucky people,
our trip to the Olympics...

275
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,700
starts right now.

276
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,000
And I want to introduce you...

277
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
to Mr lrving Blitzer...

278
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,800
who's going to be
our expert bobsled coach.

279
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,900
Sanka, hit it, man.

280
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
You're on the air, sled god!

281
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,800
- Gentlemen, a bobsled
is a simple thing.
- Yeah! So's a toilet!

282
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,200
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

283
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,200
Basically, what you're looking to do
is get your sorry rear ends...

284
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,900
from the top of an icy chute
to the bottom.

285
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,400
You're ziggin',
you're zaggin'.

286
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,600
It's the biggest, coldest roller
coaster you've ever been on.

287
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
I-lce.

288
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,800
Oh, yeah.

289
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,200
Oh, yeah.

290
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,300
I almost forgot, uh--

291
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,200
One minor drawback to this
delightful winter sport...

292
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,200
is the high-speed crash.

293
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
That hurt. Aah.

294
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,900
Always remember, your bones
will not break in a bobsled.

295
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,200
No, no. They shatter.

296
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,100
So...

297
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,100
who wants in?

298
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Look, Baldy's here.

299
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,700
- Glad you could make it, man!
- Don't touch me!

300
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,100
No problem. So what's your name?

301
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Yul Brenner.

302
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,800
Well, it's good to have you
as a teammate, Brenner.

303
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
Let's get one thing straight,
Bannock.

304
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,000
We may be on the same team...

305
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,400
but I am no one's teammate.

306
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,000
- Long as you come here to bobsled.
- Hey, listen, man...

307
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
the only reason why
I come here...

308
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,900
is to get off of this
stinkin' island.

309
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
If I have to take one
of those bobsleds to do it...

310
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
then all right.

311
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,100
- No problem.
- Uh, yes.

312
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Yes, I have a problem. There's
no such thing as a three-man sled.

313
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
- You're one Jamaican short.
- Hey.

314
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,800
The meeting start yet?

315
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,900
- Uh-oh.
- You!

316
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,600
- I'll kill you.
College boy, I'll kill you!
- Wait! Hold on !

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,800
- Hey, hey! Lighten up!
Whoa! Whoa! Down, boy!
- Wait a second!

318
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,300
- He didn't mean anything!
He didn't mean it!
- You're dead! You're dead!

319
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,300
Kill him,
and we don't have a team.

320
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,300
- I'm not riding
in the same sled as that.
- He tripped me too, you know.

321
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,100
But in case you haven't noticed,
there's no one else here.

322
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,100
You're crowding me, slinky head.

323
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,200
Slinky head.
That's a good one.

324
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,700
- What are you laughing about?
- Nothing.

325
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,100
If it wasn't for you, rich boy,
I'd be in the Olympics right now.

326
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,200
I don't know what
you all are arguing about...

327
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,400
- 'cause Derice was going to
beat both your butts anyway.
- What are you talking about?

328
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,500
How 'bout I beat your butt
right now?

329
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,800
How 'bout I draw a line down the middle
of your head so it looks like a butt?

330
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Forget it, man. I'm gone.

331
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,000
Fine. Stay here on the island.
We're going to Canada.

332
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,200
All right.

333
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
I'll do it.

334
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,200
But you'd better tell
this mama's boy...

335
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,600
to stay the hell
away from me.

336
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,200
You understand?

337
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,200
No problem.

338
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,500
Hey, lrv...

339
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,100
say hello to the first
Jamaican bobsled team.

340
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Oh, goody.

341
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,000
Gentlemen, this is a bobsled.

342
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Sort of.

343
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,600
- All right, here's what
we're going to do. Yul--
- Don't touch me.

344
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,700
Of course. Sorry. You're going
to be the second middle man.

345
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,400
You're strong, you're fast, and
you're going to love that seat.

346
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,000
Junior, you're the first
middle man.

347
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,100
You're quick, you're sharp.
Hop in.

348
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,300
-Sanka--
-I know-- I'm the driver, right?

349
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,400
- No, you're the brake man.
- No-- No, I'm the driver.

350
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,300
No, you're not.
You're the brake man.

351
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,700
- I'm the driver.
- You're not! You're the brake man.

352
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,800
See, you don't understand!
I am Sanka Coffie!

353
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
I'm the best pushcart driver
in all of Jamaica!

354
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,000
I must drive! Do you dig
where I'm coming from?

355
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,100
- Yeah, I dig where you're coming from.
- Good.

356
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Now dig where I'm coming from.
I'm coming from two gold medals.

357
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,900
I'm coming from nine world records
in both the two and four-man events.

358
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,700
I'm coming from ten years of
intense competition with the
best athletes in the world.

359
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,200
That's a hell of a place
to be coming from.

360
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,900
You see, Sanka, the driver
has to work harder than anyone.

361
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,000
He's the first to show up
and the last to leave.

362
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,700
When his teammates are all out
drinking beer, he's up in his
room studying pictures of turns.

363
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,500
You see, a driver must remain focused
one hundred percent at all times.

364
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,500
Not only is he responsible for knowing
every inch of every course he races...

365
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,100
he's also responsible for the lives
of the other three people in his sled.

366
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Now, do you want
that responsibility?

367
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,000
I say we make Derice
the driver.

368
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
So do l, Sanka, so do l.

369
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,200
Oh, the back is nice.

370
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,900
All right, Father, listen here.

371
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,600
You see, I've made up my mind.
I'm going to be a bobsledder.

372
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,100
That's right. A bobsledder.

373
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Oh, really?

374
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

375
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,800
Fine. Cut off my allowance.

376
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,200
Because you see, Father...

377
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,500
a man has got to do
what a man has got to do.

378
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,300
Just who I wanted to see.

379
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,700
- M-M-Me?
- You know where I just came from?

380
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,400
- W-Where?
- I got you a job...

381
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,600
with Webster, Webster and Cohen,
the biggest brokerage house in Miami!

382
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,500
- Oh, right. Webster, Webster and Cohen.
- Yes! That's right.

383
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,400
And you start end of the month.

384
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,900
- Yes, but I thought that I would--
- Look...

385
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,800
we went along with this
track nonsense long enough.

386
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,000
And we agreed that it's time to
get on with your real future. Right?

387
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,400
- I know--
- Right?

388
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,000
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

389
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm going to tell your mother.

390
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,300
I guess we sure told him.

391
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Winning a bobsled race
is about one thing: the push start.

392
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
Now, I know you dainty little
track stars think you're fast.

393
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,100
Well, heh, let's see
how fast you are...

394
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,400
when you push
a 600-pound sled.

395
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,300
Now, a respectable start time
is 5.7 seconds.

396
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,400
If you speed demons can't
whip off an even six-flat...

397
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,700
you have a better chance of
becoming a barbershop quartet.

398
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,700
Derice, come on! Hey!

399
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,200
Junior, get in! Never mind!

400
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,000
We'll have to move it back.
Let's go!

401
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,800
- Here on this mountain top Whoa-oh
- Slow down! What are you
doing to me? Slow down!

402
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,500
- I got some wild, wild life
- 14.3. No good.

403
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,700
- I've got some bills
to pay, whoa-oh
- 13.5. 11.7.

404
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,500
This is what it's all about!
This is where you win or lose the race!

405
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,200
Right here in the pushcart! This
is where you're gonna practise!

406
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,700
Right here! Right here in the
Volkswagen, you're gonna practise!

407
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,300
No, Junior, quit falling down!
Come on, hustle!

408
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,800
Catch up to them!
There you go!

409
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Junior! No! Do it again!

410
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,500
Whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop, Derice!
Stop! Wait! Wait for me!

411
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,600
Wait! I'm in! Stop!
Slow down!

412
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,100
- Great. Very good. Try it again.
- Wild, wild life

413
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,900
If I've said it once,
I've said it 46 times.

414
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,500
Cold weather endurance is vital
to building a successful sled team.

415
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,200
- Cold enough?
- Wild, wild life

416
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,900
- You got to live your life
You got to live your life
- One, two, three!

417
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,600
Wild, wild life

418
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,200
- Wild, wild life
- Go! Go! Go!

419
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
- Here on this mountain top Whoa-oh
- Whoa! Slow down!

420
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,500
- Sanka, hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes, man!
- I can't! It's stuck!

421
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Hold on!

422
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,300
About some wild, wild life

423
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,300
Sanka, you dead?

424
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,100
Yeah, man.

425
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,200
What have you done to the
police unit? I shall arrest you!

426
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,700
- Who owns this thing?
- We do, sir.

427
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,700
- And who are you?
- The Jamaican bobsled team, sir.

428
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,100
Don't give me that business.
I wasn't born yesterday.

429
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,200
5.9! 5.9!
You did it! You did it!

430
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,600
5.9! We did it!
We did it! 5.9!

431
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,200
Get out of the way. Get out
of the way. 5.9, guys. What?

432
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,300
- Who are you?
- I'm their coach! You guys okay?

433
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- How's the sled?

434
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,300
- Yeah, man, we're fine.
- Sled's okay?

435
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,300
Well, it's in the wrong place!
Get it back to the top of the hill!

436
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,300
Let's move it right now, you slackers!
Move it! Let's hustle! Come on!

437
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,200
Let's move it!
Come on, you guys! Move it!

438
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,900
I'm not asking for
a winter sports programme.

439
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,600
All I need is a lousy 20 grand so I can
get us to the Olympics. That's all.

440
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,600
How in God's name are you
going to get to the Olympics?

441
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,200
These boys have never even
seen a sled race before!

442
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,200
Mr Coolidge, I have been looking at
sledders since I was twelve years old.

443
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,200
If I say these kids can make it
to the Olympics, they can make
it to the Olympics.

444
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,700
Okay. Well, I'll tell you
what we'll do.

445
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,700
Practise down here with
the boys a bit more, and when
you're a little further along...

446
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,500
- I'll come along and see you--
- No! No! No!

447
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,400
Now, just a minute,
Mr Blitzer.

448
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,100
This country enjoys
a fine athletic tradition...

449
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,500
and if you think I'm going to give you
the little money we have...

450
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,100
so that you can parade us around in
front of the world like a freak show...

451
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,100
you've got another thing coming.

452
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,200
It's bad enough how you
embarrassed your own country.

453
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,700
I'm certainly not going to
allow you to embarrass ours.

454
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
No go, kid.

455
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,100
That's okay, Coach.
We'll get the money.

456
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,700
- Do the words "give up"
mean anything to you?
- Not a thing.

457
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Some people say you know
they can't believe

458
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,600
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

459
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
'Nuff people say you know
they can't believe

460
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,200
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

461
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,600
Hi. I'm here to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

462
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We're looking for a sponsor
for the first Jamaican bobsled team.

463
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,900
Oh!

464
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,100
We have the one Derice
and the one Junior

465
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,300
I'll pay you a dollar
to shut up!

466
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,900
We got nine dollars and fifty-two cents
from Yul Brenner, thank you.

467
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
We got a hundred and eighty-four
dollars from Derice and me.

468
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,600
Sanka, how did your singing
on the street go?

469
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
How did it go?

470
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,900
It went like this:

471
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
'Nuff people say you know
they can't believe

472
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
- Sanka, we know.
- Jamaica, we have a bobsled team

473
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,900
- Sanka.
- We have the one Derice--

474
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,800
How much?

475
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,300
- I made a dollar and sixteen cents.
- Oh, that's great.

476
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,000
We're only short about
nineteen thousand bucks.

477
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,600
- Sorry I'm late, everybody.
- No, really, that is terrific.

478
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Don't pack a suitcase, Junior.
We're not going.

479
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,900
Mmm, that's too bad.

480
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,900
- Whoa!
- Oh! Where'd you get it, man?

481
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,900
- I sold my car.
- Yes, man.

482
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,000
- I am going.
- No, we're not.

483
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,100
Look here, Junior, I appreciate
what you're trying to do here...

484
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,000
but we can't accept this money;
it just wouldn't be proper.

485
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,200
Uh, Derice, if I hadn't
tripped you fellas...

486
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,500
we'd already have been going
to the Olympics; I want you to have it.

487
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,900
You mean you want us
to have it, right?

488
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Right. Us.

489
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,000
Thanks a lot, Junior.
Thanks a whole heap, man.

490
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,000
Remember, this doesn't mean
that I like you, you understand?

491
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,300
Be sure to thank your father for
us, 'cause Lord knows, he didn't
have to let you sell that car.

492
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,300
Well, uh, he doesn't know
I sold the car.

493
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,600
Um, he doesn't know
I'm on the team.

494
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,200
He thinks I'm off to Miami...

495
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,300
and I loaned the car
to a friend...

496
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,400
to work for Webster, Webster
and Cohen, someplace like that.

497
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,500
Some people say you know
them can't believe

498
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,600
Jamaica
We have a bobsled team

499
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,000
- Yes!
- We have the one Derice
- And the one Junior

500
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,100
Yu-- Sanka

501
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,100
The fastest of the fastest
of Jamaican sprinters

502
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,200
Go to Olympics
Fight for Jamaica

503
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:29,100
Welcome to Calgary, Alberta, Canada,
home of the 1988 Winter Olympic Games.

504
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,300
- This is it.
- We hope you all enjoy your stay.

505
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Sanka, man, what you smokin'?

506
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,300
I'm not smokin'.
I'm breathin'.

507
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,900
- All right, fellas,
this is us. Let's go!
- Move! Let's go! Move!

508
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,400
- Aah! Me first!
- What's the matter? You guys cold?

509
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,200
It's not so much the heat; it's
the humidity that'll kill you.

510
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,100
Excuse me, do you know where
you can register for bobsled?

511
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,000
Do you know where you
register for bobsled?

512
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,800
- See you.
- I'll see you around.

513
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,200
- Okay, Mike, good to see you again.
- Ja?

514
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,400
- Take care. All the best.
- Ja? Okay, ja.

515
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,200
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'd like to
register for the tryouts.

516
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,100
- What country?
- Uh, Jamaica.

517
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,000
What country?

518
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,600
Jamaica.

519
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,200
Well, what do you know?
A Jamaican bobsled team.

520
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,300
Okay, here it is.

521
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,400
Uh, it says here your qualifying run
will be held on the evening of the 10th.

522
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,500
Your judges will be Shindler,
Gremmer and Kroychzech.

523
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,500
- I know Kroychzech. He's a good guy.
- Yeah.

524
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,900
In order to qualify, you must
complete the course safely in 1
minute, 2 seconds-flat or under.

525
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,000
- Used to be a minute, five.
- Yeah.

526
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Times change.

527
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,600
- Irv, is that you?
- Roger, how you doing?

528
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,100
Hello, Kurt.
Been a long time.

529
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,300
Obviously not long enough.

530
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,300
- Hello, Larry.
- Jesus Christ, lrv.

531
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
What the hell did you
do to yourself?

532
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,300
- Don't worry about them, lrv.
- Roger, you got to do me a favour.

533
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,800
- What?
- Please. You know that
revolving restaurant thing?

534
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,800
- Yeah.
- Meet me there in half an hour.
- Half an hour?

535
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,200
- Yeah. Please!
- Roger, come on!

536
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,200
I'll try.

537
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,300
- Thanks, Roger.
- Yeah, well-- What's up, lrv?

538
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,400
- How about a drink?
- No, I'm fine.

539
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,000
- What's so important
that it couldn't wait?
- Want something to eat?

540
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,900
- No, I'm fine!
- A salad or something?
- Irv!

541
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,000
- I need a sled.
- You came all the way
to Calgary without a sled?

542
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,500
I got 4,800 dollars.
I just need something competitive.

543
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,700
- For five grand?
- I know you got something
lying around, Roger.

544
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,800
- But, lrv--
- Anything.

545
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,400
- You know I can't do that.
- Now, wait a minute, Roger.

546
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Remember when you were desperate
to make that last slot on the
'68 Grenoble team...

547
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,800
and you pleaded with me
to talk to Kurt?

548
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,300
Did I say, "Sorry, Roger,
I can't do it"?

549
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,300
Come on, don't make me beg.

550
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,300
Roger, it's me.

551
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,600
All right, maybe I can get you
one of our practise sleds.

552
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,600
You're a saint, you know that?
A saint! You haven't changed
a bit! You're still a saint!

553
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look, don't get
all mushy on me. Just tell me one thing.

554
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,700
Is this whole thing a big joke,
or do you really expect these
Jamaicans to qualify?

555
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,900
Not only are they going to
qualify, they're going to
turn some heads doing it.

556
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,200
Listen, three of these guys
can run the hundred in under ten-flat.

557
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't care who you are,
that's lightning.

558
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,100
Yeah, but can lightning
run on ice?

559
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,000
No problem, man.

560
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,100
God!

561
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,700
Irv, these special shoes
aren't very effective.

562
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,200
Grip with your toes!

563
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,000
All right, you sugar-coated
track stars!

564
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,700
Move out and let the ice rasta
show you how it's done.

565
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,500
- Yeah. Like that, yeah. Good.
- Hey, fellas!

566
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,400
- Look at my progress.
- Stop touching me!

567
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,400
All right, fellas, that's it!
Let's get off the ice before practise.

568
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,600
- What practise?
- That practise.

569
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,100
That's right.

570
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,700
Good team this year.

571
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,400
Ein, zwei, drei!

572
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,900
Oh, man, you should see this
on the hill.

573
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,600
- It's like a miracle.
- What's "Schweiz"?

574
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,400
- No, man! Swiss!
- This is the real thing, man.

575
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,700
Gentlemen...

576
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,900
I'd like to introduce you to
the newest member of our team.

577
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,200
Um, you won't believe what I
had to go through to get us
a sled in such good shape.

578
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,400
Uh--

579
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,300
If we're going to make it
into the Olympics...

580
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,600
this is the boat that's
going to take us there.

581
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,300
Well, I'm-- I'm told
she's actually quite fast.

582
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,000
I, uh, know she's not
much to look at...

583
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,500
- but, uh--
- Shh! She's beautiful!

584
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,900
All coaches must sign teams in
before approaching bob run.

585
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,200
Here we go.

586
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,400
Let's go! Let's go!

587
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,200
- Hold on a minute.
- All right, come on.

588
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,300
Here we go.
