1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,480
Previously on Eureka.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,314
Loose smart dust could
potentially disrupt

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:07,140
every band on the
electromagnetic spectrum.

4
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:10,733
Phones, computers...
Neural impulses in our brains.

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,364
Where's the control unit?

6
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:15,540
We have a G.D. employee
in custody

7
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:17,075
under suspicion
of espionage.

8
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,778
Justice will be taking over
that investigation immediately.

9
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:24,416
You have one message
in your inbox.

10
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,785
Holly was printing
a body blank

11
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:27,952
in the
neural networking lab.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,989
- Why?
- I don't know.

13
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:33,158
Carter.

14
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:34,926
Sorry, Jo.
Can't help you right now.

15
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,629
Got some things
to take care of.

16
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:39,664
- Those are Z-waves.
- But then Holly's pattern

17
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,166
wasn't the only one
stuck in there.

18
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:43,468
Or maybe something else
is trying to get out.

19
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:45,470
Something else from the
matrix? That ain't good.

20
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:47,572
Zane Donovan,
you're under arrest

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,607
for obstruction of justice
and destroying evidence.

22
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,510
Fargo, I think I found your
missing smart dust controller.

23
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:03,988
Hi.

24
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,257
We got a...

25
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,531
Now, we're even.

26
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,606
Jack,
where have you been?

27
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,341
I... I've been trying
to reach you for hours.

28
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,310
Well, sorry.
I guess the smart dust

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,145
is still... yeah, messing
with the cell reception.

30
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,614
But we found the control unit,
which is good.

31
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:31,049
Fargo says he'll
have it fixed soon.

32
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,717
No, not that.
Zane and I found something.

33
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,319
We don't even know
what we found

34
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,687
and then Shaw
arrested him.

35
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:41,593
Yeah, we heard.

36
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,628
And then you decided
to have coffee?

37
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,530
Don't you fret,
Dr. Blake.

38
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:48,433
Ms. Lupo is handling
the situation as we speak.

39
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,934
Well, handling it how?

40
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:53,605
In her usual way, with
intimidation and brute force.

41
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:55,039
Jack,
this isn't funny.

42
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,975
Shaw thinks that Zane
destroyed classified files.

43
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,711
And something else
disturbing is going on.

44
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,846
Jo, Henry, Holly.

45
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:05,150
People are not
acting like themselves.

46
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:06,518
I'm sure it's
just the smart dust.

47
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,886
The electromagnetic chaff

48
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,087
could be affecting
people's brain functions.

49
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,488
No, I don't think
that that's it...

50
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:13,658
But the E.M. levels
are on the decline.

51
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:16,995
See, we have a plan.

52
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:20,365
Dr. Tuchman, one Peruvian
macchiato to go. Enjoy.

53
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,967
Thanks, Vince.

54
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,445
Well, I think we should
probably get back to work.

55
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,814
Catch up with you later,
babe. Promise.

56
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:38,116
Bye.

57
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:39,951
Where are you going?

58
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:42,253
Protect and serve.

59
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:54,132
You have a visitor.

60
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,469
Could we,
have a moment?

61
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:02,273
Make it fast,
you don't have much time.

62
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:09,280
Grace, good to see you.

63
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:11,216
So, Henry, have you, uh,
thought about what I said?

64
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,985
Of course.
Could you remind me?

65
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:15,353
Don't play.

66
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:18,189
You are not responsible
for me being locked up,

67
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,858
which is why I'm
not giving you a choice.

68
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:23,161
If you say that you helped me
leak classified information,

69
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,231
I'll deny it. They have
no evidence to hold you.

70
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,666
They have no evidence
to hold you.

71
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,535
Shaw's just
making an example.

72
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:33,404
Henry, I know what I did and
I can accept the consequences.

73
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:37,742
I can't.
I won't.

74
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,078
And that's why
I'm getting you out of here.

75
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,181
Henry, what are you...

76
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:47,218
Grace, trust me.
This is the only way.

77
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:49,821
You're my wife.

78
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:03,701
And I will never
let you go.

79
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:23,121
Morning.
Dr. Tuchman, right?

80
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:27,659
Yes. I...
I do something wrong, sheriff?

81
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,228
Well, the smart asphalt
sensor said you were weaving.

82
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:32,130
Well, I don't think so.

83
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,631
It's probably
just a glitch.

84
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,035
Say, weren't you
on the <i>Astraeus</i> crew?

85
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:40,338
Yeah, unfortunately
as it turned out.

86
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,639
Yeah.

87
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,675
You're going
to have to come with us.

88
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,376
To where?

89
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:48,046
Back where you belong.

90
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,514
I don't understand.

91
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,251
You will.

92
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,822
Get out of the car,
please.

93
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,858
This way.

94
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:06,164
This way,
right here.

95
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,633
Right this way.

96
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:26,784
I've got you.

97
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:29,420
You're just making this
harder on yourself, Donovan.

98
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:33,224
I know you destroyed the files
implicating Dr. Monroe.

99
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,694
What files
do you speak of?

100
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,296
You're trying
my patience, kid.

101
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:40,264
And you're
wasting my time, pops.

102
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:41,666
You've got nothing
tying me to this

103
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,068
or you would have
arrested me by now.

104
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,436
He's right.

105
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:47,338
He's guilty
and we both know it.

106
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:49,607
Probably, but you don't
have enough to charge him.

107
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:52,510
You want me to release
your boyfriend?

108
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,245
Shocking.

109
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,514
He won't go anywhere
we can't find him.

110
00:05:56,582 --> 00:06:02,086
Major Shaw, sir.

111
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,789
"Probably"?
Whose side are you on, Jo?

112
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:10,161
Do you want to be
in his custody or mine?

113
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,663
Grace Monroe just
escaped from detention.

114
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:14,599
What, wh...
How?

115
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,435
I don't know, but it looks
like someone else helped her.

116
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,372
While I was in here.
Apology accepted.

117
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,076
You can cut him loose,
but he's your responsibility.

118
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:28,312
Gather your team,
I want Monroe found.

119
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Yes, sir.

120
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:38,322
Promise me
you won't wander off.

121
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:46,497
There is something
very, very wrong.

122
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,633
People are doing things
that don't make any sense,

123
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,101
like they've
been brainwashed.

124
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,936
Yeah, well, with smart dust
jamming up the works,

125
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,071
they could be.

126
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,673
But Jack said you found
the control unit

127
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:56,908
and you were
fixing it.

128
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,209
That's the first
I've heard of it

129
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:00,044
and I haven't
seen Carter in hours.

130
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,345
See?
Brainwashed.

131
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:03,314
What, him or me?

132
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,684
Jury's still out.

133
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:09,487
Where's the
bio-printer?

134
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,255
Henry said that he
had it moved to maintenance.

135
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,958
I never
authorized that.

136
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,693
I'm guessing
that you didn't give Holly

137
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,495
permission to start
printing body blanks, either.

138
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,327
What?

139
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:21,384
Do you know how many millions
of dollars those things cost?

140
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:24,569
Man, girlfriends are expensive.
What was she thinking?

141
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,537
I don't think
she was.

142
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,473
Zane found other
Z-wave signatures

143
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,175
in the mainframe where
Holly was being stored.

144
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,811
What if that's why she started
bio-printing more bodies?

145
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,547
But why would she create
new bodies for them?

146
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,916
Maybe because
the program told her to.

147
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:41,185
There was a deliberate
energy pulse in the lab.

148
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,221
What if it was a command
that her neural processor

149
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,789
was responding to?

150
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:48,559
So you really think
others are controlling Holly?

151
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:52,363
Zane and I saw something.
Hands, like someone

152
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,866
was trying to get out.

153
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,201
What if they did?

154
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,341
Power supply
is holding steady.

155
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,077
Smart dust control unit
is working perfectly.

156
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:09,247
Virtual Eureka
is back online.

157
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,882
This time,
they won't get out.

158
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm going to miss
this one.

159
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:19,624
We can always
make you a new one.

160
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:21,993
And when we get
the rest of them,

161
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,595
I think I'm going
to like it out here.

162
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:35,895
Well, it looks like
these DNA profiles

163
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:38,732
were bio-printed
onto the bodies.

164
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,800
My God.
It's Jo...

165
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,837
And Henry and at least
a dozen others.

166
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,372
If they took
the bio-printer,

167
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,140
they could have
copied anyone by now.

168
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,942
Fargo, people aren't
being brainwashed.

169
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,445
They're being replaced.

170
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:54,280
What are you guys looking at?

171
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:57,984
What?
I was released, okay?

172
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:03,723
I didn't bust out
like someone else I know.

173
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,092
It's Jack.

174
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,464
He's one of them.

175
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:13,633
Who's "them"?

176
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:24,511
Dr. Yoo, just the woman
I'm looking for.

177
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:26,079
What can I do
for you, sheriff?

178
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,547
Well, I need you
to come with me.

179
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:29,516
Police business.
I need your expertise.

180
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,619
- Okay.
- Yeah.

181
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:36,356
Love the jacket,
by the way.

182
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:41,995
You're telling me
Carter, Henry, and Jo

183
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:43,596
are all evil clones
made by Holly?

184
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,398
Well, technically
VR-programmed intelligences

185
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,367
in bio-printed bodies,
but yeah, evil clones.

186
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:48,868
I knew Jo was off,
but not that off.

187
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,370
I can't believe
this is happening.

188
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:52,172
Tell me about it.
My resurrected girlfriend

189
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,773
is the
<i>Manchurian Candidate</i>.

190
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,208
Well, we have to find them.
We need outside help.

191
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:56,676
Well, half the time
we can't call out,

192
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:58,111
reception is so spotty.

193
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,613
I have an idea.

194
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:02,415
I have access to a
priority-5 gets hard-line

195
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:05,418
that goes directly
to NORAD HQ.

196
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:10,857
It's dead.

197
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,158
They've cut us off.
We're on our own now.

198
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:14,928
What about Shaw?

199
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,329
They don't have
his DNA on file,

200
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:17,697
so they
can't copy him.

201
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:19,866
Plus, he has rocket launchers.
I'm on it.

202
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,534
I have to
find my kids.

203
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,136
All right, I'm going
to get us some weapons.

204
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,437
Nonlethal.
If we can't tell the good guys

205
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:25,572
from the bad,
we can't just kill them.

206
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,873
Well, we better hope
the evil clones

207
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:28,708
play by
the same rules then.

208
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:31,044
Director, I know people
have infiltrated G.D.

209
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:32,412
That's why I'm here.

210
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,814
I'm not talking spies.
More, doubles.

211
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,082
Double agents?

212
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,317
No,
haven't you noticed?

213
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:41,788
People have been acting
not themselves lately.

214
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:43,523
One person
comes to mind.

215
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:45,191
Well, not me. I mean...
Jo, hey.

216
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:46,793
Am I interrupting?

217
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:50,263
No, we're just...
Military man talk.

218
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:53,433
Really, you served?
Which division?

219
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:57,237
Long division.

220
00:10:57,304 --> 00:11:00,006
The director seems very
distressed about...

221
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:02,275
Grace's escape.
It's terrible, really.

222
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,210
Do you have
any new leads?

223
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:06,079
Actually, uh, yes.
Comm's still patchy,

224
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,547
but we have a
security scan hit.

225
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,749
Grace Monroe's credit card
was used an hour ago

226
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,651
at a a service station
in grants pass.

227
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,253
Now, let's get
a team moving.

228
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,255
Wait, wait, wait.
That's weird, isn't it?

229
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:16,856
I mean, Grace wouldn't
be so careless.

230
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:18,525
She's on the run,
people panic.

231
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:21,561
Sir. Every second
we waste, her trail gets colder.

232
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:27,233
Agreed. Keep us
on high-alert until I return.

233
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,902
Fargo, I was wondering
if we could review

234
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,437
the latest security
lockdown procedures.

235
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:33,940
They're in my office.

236
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:37,177
No, it's okay. I mean,
the regularly scheduled

237
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,412
security briefing
will be fine.

238
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:48,888
You expect me
to believe that people

239
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:50,089
are being
body-snatched?

240
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:51,491
I know how it sounds.

241
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,860
It sounds like you're
stupid or stoned or both.

242
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:56,062
My vote's for both.

243
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,127
Just think for a minute.

244
00:11:58,128 --> 00:12:01,788
Has anyone you know
been acting strangely?

245
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,203
Not themselves?

246
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,771
Tuchman didn't show up
for work today,

247
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:09,776
but he's always had
a lazy work ethic.

248
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:12,245
Lazy work ethic,

249
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,824
Okay, how is this
even possible?

250
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:26,759
My God.
Zane, stay back.

251
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,461
That is not me.

252
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,665
What? You're not me.
I'm me.

253
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:38,238
What the hell,
Zane?

254
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:39,806
Come on, man.
I'm me.

255
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:42,175
Prove it.

256
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,843
Okay, uh, during
estrange training, uh,

257
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:45,144
you came into Cafe Diem

258
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,512
and I tried to give you
one of my lima coins.

259
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,880
And then you didn't
want to take it,

260
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,249
so we thought that
it would be funny if

261
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:50,984
we covered them in tabasco
and gave them to Fargo.

262
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:52,552
Zane, come on.
Just shoot this idiot.

263
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,189
You know he's not me.

264
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:59,726
I trust you.

265
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,694
If you say so.

266
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:03,997
Zane, don't!

267
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:22,382
How did you know
that it wasn't me?

268
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:25,818
The real you
wouldn't trust me.

269
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:31,658
You dematerialized me.

270
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,893
Yeah, what happened
to non-lethal weapons?

271
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,362
Well, that one's
a work in progress.

272
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,267
Yeah, you don't say.

273
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:45,038
Betrayed by my own DNA.
Gross.

274
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:46,239
So what else
can we use

275
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:48,875
that won't splatter
innocent people?

276
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:52,111
Well, I guess we could
develop something

277
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,315
that would specifically
target them.

278
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:59,719
But if they're like Holly,
they're basically human.

279
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,587
Yeah, their bodies.

280
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:05,024
But not the Z-waves underpinning
their consciousness.

281
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:08,061
What if we make
a sort of E.M.P.

282
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:11,064
That'll fry only
that brainwave frequency.

283
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,965
That would knock
them all out.

284
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:16,402
If it worked.

285
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,274
Trust me,
it's not my first rodeo.

286
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,876
I taste like chicken.

287
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:46,766
Doug.

288
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,268
- Holly.
- I'm so glad to see you.

289
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:51,471
Okay,
why exactly?

290
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,740
Something really weird
is happening.

291
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:59,479
It's like... it's like
I'm not myself anymore.

292
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:01,547
I mean, not at this
exact moment.

293
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:03,983
Right now, I am me.

294
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:08,254
I just don't know
for how long.

295
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:11,257
They're making
me do things.

296
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:14,494
Who?

297
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:18,631
The NPCs,
from matrix Eureka.

298
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,800
It's like they made me
walk in my sleep, but instead

299
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:24,470
of raiding the fridge,
I'm spitting out bodies.

300
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,806
Like the queen alien
on Lv-426.

301
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:30,143
Okay, well that would
explain why Allison and I

302
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,311
found DNA patterns in
your bio-printer files.

303
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:37,350
- They made me do it, Doug.
- It's okay.

304
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:40,820
I know you wouldn't go
all pod-person on purpose.

305
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:44,223
But why would they print
replicants of us?

306
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,725
What do they want?

307
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:48,361
They're everywhere.

308
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:54,066
Come on, I know a place
where we can talk safely.

309
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:56,669
S.A.R.A.H., where's...
Kevin.

310
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:58,070
I need you to pack
an overnight bag,

311
00:15:58,138 --> 00:15:59,138
we're going
on vacation.

312
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:00,173
Sweet, where to?

313
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,541
To your Nanna's.

314
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:03,476
Okay,
that's not vacation.

315
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:05,411
All right, that's me staying
upwind of grandpa all day.

316
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,213
I mean, he needs to lay off
the chili, I'm sorry.

317
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:10,750
Honey, just pack, quickly.
Please. Now.

318
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,718
Dr. Blake, your
blood pressure is elevated.

319
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:13,686
Is everything
all right?

320
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:14,954
S.A.R.A.H., I'm fine.

321
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:16,856
Honey, I will explain
to you on the way,

322
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:18,791
we need to pick up
Jenna from the day care.

323
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,359
No need.

324
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:23,296
I've got her
right here.

325
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,436
Hi, mommy.

326
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,205
Babe.

327
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:34,373
Where you
running off to?

328
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:48,178
Kevin,
bring Jenna upstairs.

329
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,947
Now.

330
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:51,115
Mom, why are
you tripping?

331
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:53,217
Yeah.

332
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:56,120
Jack isn't himself.

333
00:16:56,187 --> 00:17:00,424
He's sick. I need to
bring him to G.D.

334
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,526
Actually,
I've never felt better.

335
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:04,695
Dr. Blake, a
full-body CT scan shows

336
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,097
that sheriff Carter
is perfectly healthy.

337
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:10,367
And looking forward
to some quality time together.

338
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,870
Not with them.

339
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:16,607
We could go somewhere.
Alone.

340
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:19,610
Subtle, mom.
Dang, get a room.

341
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:21,578
It's not what
she means.

342
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,947
But I got a room.

343
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:25,549
Here.
S.A.R.A.H.,

344
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:27,985
why don't you make
a snack for the kids?

345
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:30,821
Happy to.
But there's just one thing.

346
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:37,327
S.A.R.A.H., what...
What are you doing?

347
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:40,063
Kevin, it's fine.
This isn't Jack.

348
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:41,231
What?

349
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,599
It's a long story.

350
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,067
S.A.R.A.H.,
how did you know?

351
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:46,804
My CT scan also
included a DNA analysis.

352
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:48,839
Although it matched
sheriff Carter perfectly,

353
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:51,809
his cells are
only one day old.

354
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:53,343
You mean he's a clone?

355
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:56,213
Sweet.
Can we keep him please?

356
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:57,781
This is Jack's evil twin,
not a puppy.

357
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,886
Zane? Can you hear me?

358
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:04,688
Tell me that you
found something.

359
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,657
How about a Z-wave bomb
that'll fit in your pocket,

360
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:09,259
but should knock out
all the NPCs on one go?

361
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:12,663
Okay, wait a minute.
"Should" knock them out?

362
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,065
Yeah, we just need
an NPC test subject

363
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:18,502
that we can calibrate
the Z-wave frequency.

364
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,738
We, uh, kind of
microwaved our last one.

365
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:23,240
Okay, well, I think
I can help you with that.

366
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:24,708
But we need to find
a safe place

367
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,343
where they won't
be looking for us.

368
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:29,313
I'll meet you
at the cabin.

369
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,281
Kevin, honey, I need you
to help me move him

370
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,483
and then I need you to lock
the door and keep Jenna inside.

371
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:35,219
Don't let anyone in
until I get back.

372
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,954
Don't worry,
I'll keep them safe.

373
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:39,656
Mom,
you're scaring me.

374
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:41,792
Honey, everything
is going to be okay.

375
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,594
All right, I just need
you to trust me.

376
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:45,863
Come on,
let's move him.

377
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:56,039
It was so terrifying.

378
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,976
It was like that dream
where you're trying to scream,

379
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,310
but all you
can speak is orcish

380
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:03,080
and you know what
you're doing is wrong,

381
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,782
but there's no way
to stop yourself.

382
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,218
Yeah, I don't think
I've ever had that dream.

383
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:12,256
Me neither, but that's
exactly what it was like.

384
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:14,825
So
where are we going?

385
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:19,763
Just
a little bit further.

386
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:25,602
Brain-jacking really,
really sucks.

387
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,238
You're my hero.

388
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:38,115
Are you looking
for this?

389
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:40,417
I really wanted
to trust you.

390
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:45,923
You can't win,
Doug.

391
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,558
I'm so sorry,
Holly.

392
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,036
Well, that was
uncalled for.

393
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,904
Where's Jack?

394
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:02,172
Let's call it
"napping."

395
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,708
So he's alive?

396
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:09,579
Of course he's a valuable
intellectual resource.

397
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,048
You all are,
we don't want to hurt you.

398
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:12,816
Yeah, I wasn't born
yesterday, unlike you.

399
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:15,485
Clever.

400
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:17,387
It's for
the greater good, Allie.

401
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,790
Just think about it.
When you're back inside,

402
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:22,626
you'll be able to create
all sorts of amazing things

403
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:24,962
without potentially
destroying the world.

404
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,968
Back in wh...
Beverly's matrix program.

405
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:32,436
You're still acting on
your last directive

406
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,471
to keep us inside.

407
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,673
Call me stubborn.

408
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,308
So you want to put
the entire <i>Astraeus</i> crew

409
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:39,776
back in matrix Eureka?

410
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,712
Well, we're protecting
you from yourselves.

411
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,880
So that you can work
in safety and peace.

412
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,582
And the more brainpower,
the better.

413
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,686
My work is here. My family
is here. Jack is here.

414
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:51,188
Yes, I am.

415
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,156
And when I'm done,

416
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:56,893
no one
will even miss you.

417
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:08,505
A flux compression
generator bomb, nice.

418
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah, when it's time,
we flip that switch

419
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:12,776
and <i>sayonara,</i>
doppelgangers.

420
00:21:12,844 --> 00:21:15,212
You know, Donovan,
I have always maintained

421
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,747
that under
proper supervision

422
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:18,582
you are not
completely incompetent.

423
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:20,617
Well, damn, Parrish.
That's probably the nicest

424
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:23,387
thing that you've
ever said to...

425
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:27,557
Probably anyone,
actually.

426
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,759
All right,
let's meet Allison

427
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:30,260
and take down
these meat puppets.

428
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,528
Okay

429
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:33,697
may I have
your attention...

430
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:37,801
By order of director Fargo,
G.D. is now under lockdown.

431
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:40,370
No entering or exiting
without authorization.

432
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:41,538
Have a nice day.

433
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:43,173
Yeah.

434
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:44,341
Are we there yet?

435
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:48,545
Shut up.

436
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:53,350
Would you
look at that.

437
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:54,518
Damn it.

438
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:57,020
There's nowhere
to run, Allie.

439
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:40,063
You're only making it
worse for yourself.

440
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:42,032
Well, she's got spunk.

441
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll give her that.

442
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,573
<i>GD is now on lockdown,
status Bravo.</i>

443
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,509
Crap.

444
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:54,544
Why would Fargo
lock us down?

445
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:56,613
I'm betting he didn't.

446
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:59,082
You think
Larry's been replaced?

447
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,650
Well, maybe
all of them have.

448
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:06,690
Either way,
we're trapped.

449
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:09,726
The NPCs think that
I've been replaced, right?

450
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:12,996
So as NPC Parrish,
I put you in handcuffs,

451
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:14,264
and I walk you
right out the front door

452
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:15,632
as my prisoner.

453
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,135
I don't know, man.

454
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:20,570
Come on, Zane.

455
00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:22,239
Dude, it will be just like
in <i>Star Wars</i> when

456
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:25,242
Han Solo put Chewie in handcuffs
to fool the imperial guards.

457
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:28,478
In this scenario,
you're Han Solo?

458
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:29,646
Yeah.

459
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,648
Trust me, Zane.

460
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:35,085
I was born to do this.

461
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:37,954
I can't believe
it didn't work.

462
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:40,957
Seriously, dude,
you're an asshat.

463
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:43,160
Come on, Han, time to
encase you in carbonite.

464
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:44,728
He's only kidding,
actually we're going

465
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:47,531
to insert a bio-absorbable
stent made of polylatic acid

466
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:48,832
into your bloodstream
and then hook you up

467
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,001
to a giant hive-mind.

468
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:55,205
Forever.

469
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:58,175
That is so not better.

470
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:30,006
I am really
done with her.

471
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:32,544
We'll find her.

472
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:39,583
Hear that,
Allison?

473
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,287
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

474
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,890
Where do you think
you're going?

475
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,425
To find my husband.

476
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:27,495
Baby, I'm hurt.

477
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:28,863
He's right here.

478
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:30,632
You got her, boss?

479
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:32,804
The hell he is.

480
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:38,072
Stop.

481
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,677
Carter, hurry!
She's on the road.

482
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:44,646
Stop.

483
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:46,981
Allison,
what are you...

484
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,717
Go, go, go.
Go!

485
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,992
Now what?

486
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,529
Now we do this
the hard way.

487
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:03,798
What happened to her?

488
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,700
You were right, the NPCs
have been controlling her,

489
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,435
making her bio-print
bodies to download into.

490
00:26:07,503 --> 00:26:09,003
That's because they're
putting people

491
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:11,205
back inside the matrix program.
And they're not just stopping

492
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:14,042
at the crew... they're trying
to replace us all.

493
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:17,979
Not without a fight.

494
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:20,715
I'm telling you, Vincent.
People are being taken.

495
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:23,084
By whom?

496
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:24,218
By the sheriff
and deputy Andy.

497
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:26,220
And Jo and her guards.

498
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:30,725
We need
to warn everyone.

499
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:32,994
My God.
They're here.

500
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:38,032
Okay.

501
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,802
Everyone
in the freezer.

502
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:00,855
Jo.
Andy.

503
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:04,292
Vincent.
Where is everybody?

504
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,161
In the freezer.

505
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,944
Carter put in
satellite TV.

506
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:24,245
How very old school.

507
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:25,646
Fargo, focus.
Something is wrong.

508
00:27:25,714 --> 00:27:27,215
Zane and Parrish should
have been here by now.

509
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:31,185
Unless they
were taken.

510
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:33,087
We need the bomb
to nullify the NPCs'

511
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:34,422
Z-wave signature.

512
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,057
We're going to have
to do this ourselves.

513
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,358
Yeah, but we have
to connect it to the

514
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:39,260
smart dust control unit
to amplify the pulse.

515
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,763
I bet the clone army
is using it

516
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,964
to power the new
matrix computer.

517
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:44,298
Yeah, except we don't
have the Z-bomb.

518
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:48,002
That does pose
an issue.

519
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,972
Wait a minute, Zane said
the Z-bomb fit into his pocket.

520
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,740
So if he and Parrish
were taken, maybe

521
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:54,008
he could still
have it.

522
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,276
So we just
need to find out

523
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:56,477
where they're being held
and activate it.

524
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:57,712
Except we have no clue
where that is.

525
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,249
Someone does.

526
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:03,518
We just need
to follow her.

527
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:10,858
Nice work, Mata Hari.

528
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:13,261
And Allison is where,
exactly?

529
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:15,296
Well played.

530
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:17,265
We need to widen
and regroup.

531
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:22,804
The program isn't complete
without the final two.

532
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:24,939
Mata Hari was probably
innocent, you know.

533
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,275
A better spy analogy
would have been Emily Geiger

534
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:29,010
from the
American revolution.

535
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:30,945
Or Belle Boyd during
the Civil War.

536
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:33,714
Or Violette Szabo
from World War II.

537
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,016
She was awesome.

538
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:38,319
Do you have
an off switch?

539
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,638
Okay, you find Zane,
see if he has the Z-bomb.

540
00:28:57,706 --> 00:28:59,173
I'll sync my PDA to
the smart dust control unit

541
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:00,775
and amplify the pulse.

542
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:02,243
Okay, well be careful.
Don't get caught,

543
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:03,611
we may be
the only ones left.

544
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,880
That's reassuring.

545
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:24,165
I'll go this way.

546
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:42,517
The crew.

547
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,307
My God.

548
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:14,048
Jack.

549
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:17,885
Honey, you got to wake up.
You got to wake up.

550
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,668
Come on.

551
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:35,970
Any time now.

552
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:38,839
Silent mode,
silent mode.

553
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:40,641
Frak me.

554
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:47,582
You,
you're with me.

555
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:50,151
They're outside.
All hands on deck.

556
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:59,660
I'll be back.

557
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:17,478
Hi, Doug.

558
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:19,280
Okay.

559
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:20,982
You slippery
little fish.

560
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,818
Let's go, Fargo.

561
00:31:23,885 --> 00:31:25,252
Get back.

562
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,188
Easy, easy, easy.

563
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:28,589
We don't want
to hurt you.

564
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,924
Speak for yourself,
he made me run.

565
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:31,092
You know
what they say, Doug.

566
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:33,294
Resistance is futile.

567
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,701
That's what you think.

568
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:41,836
He's controlling
the smart dust.

569
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:43,437
Well, that's annoying.

570
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:46,273
I can't see anything.

571
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,808
I knew night vision
mode would come in handy.

572
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,310
He won't get far.

573
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:50,745
- Can anyone see him?
- Think he's gone this way.

574
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:51,812
Why is Doug
even bothering?

575
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,982
Do not let him
get away.

576
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,018
Good question.

577
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:15,236
Zane, thank God.

578
00:32:15,303 --> 00:32:16,504
Please be the bomb.

579
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,240
Thank you.

580
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:21,175
Mommy?

581
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:23,577
What are you doing?

582
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:35,923
Please don't hurt me,
mommy.

583
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,325
- Please.
- Jenna.

584
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:45,887
Jenna?
No, you're not real.

585
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:47,422
You're not real.

586
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,375
Yes, I am.
And I'm scared.

587
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:54,246
I don't understand
what's happening.

588
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:56,385
Will you stay with me?

589
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:02,890
Mommy's tricky,
isn't she?

590
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:08,426
Good job,
sweetheart.

591
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:09,961
Now you go play,
okay?

592
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:14,132
No.
I want to watch.

593
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,969
Always the curious one,
yeah?

594
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,871
No, no.

595
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,324
That's quite enough,
Dr. Fargo.

596
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,558
How did you...

597
00:33:40,626 --> 00:33:42,193
I have
infra-red vision, too.

598
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,795
Man.

599
00:33:43,863 --> 00:33:48,199
So I suppose we can't
talk this out,

600
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:52,103
man to replicant.

601
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:56,474
We're done talking.

602
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:59,411
Relax, mommy.

603
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:01,746
Time to go to sleep.

604
00:34:01,814 --> 00:34:04,716
Please, I can't
leave my kids.

605
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:05,784
Jo and I will
take care of them.

606
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:07,919
Over my dead body.

607
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:09,587
We don't
want that.

608
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:12,657
Bye, mommy.

609
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:16,761
Relax,
I'll be right here.

610
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,897
So will I.

611
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:22,000
- Daddy.
- Jack.

612
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:28,239
Did he hurt you?

613
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:29,941
No, I'm fine.

614
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:34,112
I am so happy to see you,
the real you.

615
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:39,884
Go. Go.

616
00:34:48,894 --> 00:34:50,795
It came
from in here.

617
00:35:07,913 --> 00:35:11,485
Daddy.
They're gone.

618
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:17,557
Daddy's very angry.

619
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,059
Please tell me
that thing can help us.

620
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:22,560
It can.

621
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:23,962
Do I sense a, "but,"
or an, "if"?

622
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,764
If we can amplify it.
Fargo was trying to link it to

623
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:27,198
the smart dust controller,
but I think they got him.

624
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:30,435
They
we can't go back.

625
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,637
Not without
broadcasting the location.

626
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:34,472
Wait a minute.

627
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,740
Broadcasting,
that could work.

628
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,042
Well, I don't think
that will help us.

629
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:38,610
No, no,
but the cabin.

630
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,779
We could use the satellite dish
to amplify the Z-wave signal.

631
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:46,618
We just have to get
the NPCs to follow us.

632
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:48,953
I don't think that's going
to be a problem, run.

633
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,426
Don't let them
get away.

634
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:57,762
Can't have gone too far.
Come on, let's go.

635
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:08,073
Try the back door.

636
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,391
Jack.

637
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,200
Okay, where's
the satellite dish?

638
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:38,736
- It's in the loft.
- Okay.

639
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:42,040
Game over.

640
00:36:45,878 --> 00:36:48,213
I just hate myself
sometimes.

641
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,101
You okay?

642
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:08,536
I got to
kick my ass.

643
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:22,853
I know
all your moves.

644
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:27,721
This one's new.

645
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,536
They're coming.

646
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:44,104
Jack!

647
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:46,944
Come on, let's go.

648
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,449
Come on, Jack.
Get up.

649
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:58,152
My God.

650
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:18,471
Allie.

651
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:24,445
Up there!

652
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,647
Lights...

653
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:28,182
Out.

654
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:30,184
Okay, I got it.

655
00:38:37,892 --> 00:38:39,228
Holly.

656
00:38:46,568 --> 00:38:47,735
You okay?

657
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:49,003
Yeah,
are you all right?

658
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,638
Well, there's only
one of me, so yeah.

659
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:53,043
Well, one of you
is all I need.

660
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:58,879
I love you
so much.

661
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:10,824
I'm not sure if I'm
comfortable with this.

662
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,559
The NPCs have human
brainwave patterns

663
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:15,663
that were downloaded into
bio-printed bodies.

664
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,532
There are ethical considerations
to how we deal with them.

665
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,234
I think you're just
keeping a spare around

666
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:21,402
in case I don't
work out.

667
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:23,172
No comment.

668
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,278
Well,
what else we got?

669
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:32,680
Shaw still camped out
in Fargo's office?

670
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:36,717
Yes, but I don't think
that Fargo has noticed.

671
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:38,152
He hasn't left
Holly's side since we

672
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:39,453
set off the Z-wave bomb.

673
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:41,522
It's been, like,
two weeks.

674
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:44,525
- And she's still comatose.
- Yeah.

675
00:39:46,027 --> 00:39:49,398
911.
Holly.

676
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:53,701
Is the neural lattice
collapsing?

677
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,969
No, synaptic firing rate
is rising, and still stable.

678
00:39:56,037 --> 00:39:57,838
Wait, is...
Is that good?

679
00:39:57,906 --> 00:40:00,240
Come on, Holly.
You can do this.

680
00:40:00,308 --> 00:40:02,910
Looks like she's
trying to wake up.

681
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:05,879
Holly?

682
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:15,556
That's my girl.

683
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,428
Okay, now just
need to...

684
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:28,035
Hi.
Welcome back.

685
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:29,937
You must be
director Fargo.

686
00:40:30,004 --> 00:40:32,106
I'm Dr. Holly Marten.

687
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:33,307
I'm here to see your
F.T.L. drive.

688
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:34,575
Senator Wen sent me.

689
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,276
You look just like
your dossier photo.

690
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:38,178
Most people don't.

691
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:41,548
I think it's the glasses.
They're very distinctive.

692
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:42,750
Why doesn't
she remember him?

693
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:44,184
Knocking out
the Z-waves

694
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:45,619
must have compromised
her solid-state drive.

695
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:47,521
Yeah, her brain stores
memories like a computer,

696
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:48,789
once that data's lost...

697
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:50,057
It's gone forever.

698
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,426
Wait.
What happened?

699
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:55,064
Was I in an accident?

700
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:59,700
Something like that.

701
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,344
Here you go, and sorry about
that whole freezer thing.

702
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:12,183
That's okay.

703
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:17,851
So San Francisco
could be nice.

704
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:19,753
Or Seattle.

705
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:21,989
It rains
too much there.

706
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:24,525
Unlike here.

707
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:26,727
Jack, do you really
want to leave Eureka?

708
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:29,530
Well, I think at a certain
point, we need to ask

709
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:32,733
ourselves if the universe is
trying to tell us something.

710
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:36,336
D.O.D. is asking themselves
that same question.

711
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:38,839
Major Shaw, didn't
see you eavesdropping there.

712
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:42,409
I'm looking for
director Fargo.

713
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:43,944
Is there a problem?

714
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:45,612
Isn't there always?

715
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,349
What were you saying
about the D.O.D.?

716
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:51,051
I should talk
to the director.

717
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,122
Major,
what is going on?

718
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,192
Believe me,
the department appreciates

719
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:00,661
the remarkable work that's
been done here in Eureka.

720
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:04,331
Been done?

721
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:07,768
Given the latest incident
and breach in national security,

722
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:12,639
the department's terminating
its funding of Global Dynamics.

723
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:14,641
For how long?

724
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:17,811
Permanently.

725
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:20,950
We're shutting
Eureka down.

726
00:42:26,317 --> 00:42:32,317
